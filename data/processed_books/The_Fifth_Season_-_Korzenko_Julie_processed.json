      "content": "Chapter One Emma O’Malley stared out her office window. Sunlight reflected from the river, striking her eyes and making her squint.“The new owner of River Run will be arriving sometime today,” Margaret’s estate lawyer stated in a blunt and matter-of-fact tone, not realizing he was ripping her world apart.The sharp, clipped words hopped an unstoppable merry-go-round in Emma’s mind. She inhaled and exhaled rapid breaths, battling against the suffocating clutches of a full-blown panic attack. “I don’t understand. It can’t be true. It’s not fair.” She cringed inwardly at her whiny teenager-like voice.“There’s not much to understand,” the man said. “Stone Connor is Margaret’s grandson. Please have the resort prepared for a tour and provide him with appropriate accommodations.”Emma avoided eye contact and continued to focus on the scenery beyond the glass pane. Summer kissed the rambling fields with a vibrant green that became blurred and distorted with shock. “You can’t be serious? I know you’re Margaret’s attorney, but you were also her friend. She’d never leave this place to someone she barely knew.”Her world crumbled last week, but she’d survived. Emma’s throat caught, and she pushed down the rock of grief.She’d not only lost a woman she loved dearly, but also fifteen years of happiness, success, and security shattered by the power of the Almighty.Sorrow was still very much an overwhelming camper within Emma’s heart. But now, that pain was being forced aside by an even deeper and well known invader…fear.Losing River Run was something she’d never considered.“Emma, Margaret has provided quite well for you. You have a healthy trust fund, but River Run has passed to her grandson. I’m sorry. I know how much you love the place. He’s mentioned the fact that he’ll be selling the resort. Maybe you can inquire as to a position with the new owners.”“I don’t want her money.” I want River Run, I need River Run.Tilting her head, she listened to her surroundings. Tick tock. Tick tock. The usual comfort the antique grandfather clock afforded suddenly resembled the last thirty-second countdown of her life. Doomsday dead ahead, it clipped.“I’ve an appointment, Emma. As I said, Stone Connor will be arriving today. Now, if you’ll please excuse me. I’ll check back with you after he’s settled.”Emma nodded and rose, shaking the meaty hand of the attorney. “Thanks, Matthew, for coming out here personally and explaining. I’m sorry for my rudeness.”The elderly man smiled and wrapped her in a gruff bear hug. “Life has a funny way of challenging us. I realize this is a huge adjustment for you, but I know deep down that Margaret was only looking out for your best interests. These were not decisions she made lightly.”Emma nodded, swallowed and swore under her breath when a tear escaped the corner of her eye. “I know. I’ll be fine.”As Margaret’s attorney exited the resort, Emma tightened her mouth and inhaled a few sharp breaths. Stone Connor hadn’t even bothered to attend his grandmother’s funeral. His claim to River Run was a travesty. He had no right. With a glance at her desk, she traced the large flourished letters of Margaret’s Last Will and Testament with her fingertip.Fear.Anger.Resentment.Her mind waded through the maze of emotions, trying to find a way out. Every turn of thought increased her frustration until the need to scream scratched her throat.She rose and stalked out of the office and into the main section of the resort. The ten thousand square foot estate nestled in a remote corner of Jackson, Wyoming held five suites. Featuring seven bedrooms, numerous fireplaces, extensive decks, three lounges, pool table, and exercise room, River Run was a favorite retreat for the wealthy. Emma was losing more than her job…she was losing her home.Crossing the main living room, she walked down the stairs to the lower level and entered the first suite to her left. She ran her hands slowly across the down bedding that covered an antique, four-poster bed and smoothed non-existent wrinkles.Emma sighed as her fingers glided against the crisp, white cotton. It felt heavenly soft and called to her with an irresistible invitation to Neverland.Verifying that the dresser and nightstands shone brightly, she nodded in approval when the late morning sun reflected its beams of light upon the gleaming surface. A slight lemon-scent remained from the furniture polish, tickling her nose and springing forth a memory of Margaret performing her daily white-glove inspections.If only she could bring the peaceful surrounding within, it might make the future manageable.A soft chime signaled the approach of a vehicle. Emma installed the underground security wire several years ago after a group of over-zealous reporters tracked one of their celebrity guests to the lodge. The signal was the first alert, the second alert was at the gated front entrance, where you either needed a code to enter or call the office for admittance.Due to the fact that there were no guests this week, she’d released the staff to privately grieve for Margaret and spend personal time with their own families.She hurried up the stairs, jogging down a narrow hall and into the office. Swearing with the voracity of an Irish sheepherder, Emma sat down and stared at the image in the security camera. The slight trembling of her hands an annoyance.It must be him, she thought. Stone Connor currently stood at the end of the long gravel drive. Threatening and dangerously close to the only place she’d ever called home.He was leaning against the front of his Jeep Wrangler, gazing around the massive property. Even though the picture was grainy, she didn’t deny that the man had the presence of someone who knew what he wanted and intended to achieve his goals, at all cost. With a start, she realized he wasn’t admiring the property but taking stock.As if he felt her presence, Stone turned his head and glared into the surveillance camera.Emma gasped then released a shaky laugh. It was impossible for him to know she was watching.Wasn’t it?He was scruffy. And she leaned forward to see what lay beneath the beard and mustache. The picture was too fuzzy, and it was impossible to obtain any idea of his motivation.Her eyes widened when he snarled, shook his head in disgust, and walked around the vehicle. Jumping behind the wheel, he gunned the engine and sped through the gates. Margaret’s attorney must have given him the code, she realized. Resentment sparked and fired.He was coming.Emma began to shake. “Stupid woman. He’s not the enemy.” She inhaled and exhaled several times, attempting to smooth her anxious nerves.Wiping her sweaty palms on the front of her jeans, she walked out of the office, through the kitchen, and opened the large mahogany front door. This was her territory. He might be the owner, but he didn’t belong here.She did.River Run would be hers. *** Stone was irritated.Why hadn’t he been informed of his grandmother’s death? Granted, he’d cut ties a lifetime ago, but someone could have notified him. A small pang of regret and sadness clenched his heart, and Stone quickly doused it. No good to start caring at this late date, but he’d like to have been at the funeral. The old woman hadn’t ever pushed him or pried into his soul like everyone else. She’d been okay in his book…until now.He didn’t understand Margaret Connor’s motivation for leaving him River Run. He didn’t want it.Stone prided himself on being a man with no connections.No strings.No roots.Those only caused pain when Death came to visit. And Death was always there, waiting until the perfect moment to rip into your soul. He knew. He’d seen it.Hundreds of lifeless eyes wavered before his face and behind each set were thousands more filled with an aching anguish no living person should witness.Not for him.Even before he’d entered the Army’s Ranger program, Stone realized the detachment he coveted so dearly was steadfastly established. War merely reaffirmed it.Yet, here was something that threatened to invade his territory. A possession.“Never,” he said softly. He’d sell this place, donate the money somewhere and be on his way.No strings.No roots.No emotion.Pulling the Jeep to the front of the lodge, Stone mentally noted the missing roof shingles and peeling paint. He didn’t care. River Run could rot.The woman framed within the mammoth front doors was another thing all together. She was tiny, but the invisible mini-Teton lodged firmly on her shoulder was an entirely different matter. Dark amber hair swept back from a pixie face in waves of soft curls while green fire crackled from beneath thick lashes. At least, green was the color he imagined. Clad in jeans and a white polo shirt sporting the resort’s logo, she silently challenged him to move forward.Stone hissed between his teeth. This was a complication.Margaret’s attorney had warned him…this woman and River Run were one in the same.Hell, she could have the damn place. In fact, he’d gladly sign it over and be done with it all. Except that wasn’t the provision of the Will. Four seasons. He had to spend four insufferable seasons here.If he didn’t, then possession reverted to his father. And that wouldn’t do.He’d never allow that.And that meant River Run was his for the next twelve months.So, here he was, in an uncontrollable situation. Again. *** “Mr. Connor?” Emma couldn’t believe the man stood there staring at her as if she radiated some sort of black plague. How rude.“Yes, ma’am,” he answered in a gruff, raspy voice. Stepping away from the Jeep he sauntered slowly in her direction. Hands shoved within the pockets of his faded denims, head cocked slightly to the side, eyes roving everywhere and nowhere all at once. What was he searching for?She tried not fidgeting, but her hands twisted together of their own accord. He was taller in person than on the video camera. Thick strands of jet-black hair hung well past his collar adding an element of disheveled danger. “Welcome to River Run.”After an interminable amount of time, Stone Connor reached the front porch. Emma looked up into his face then quickly cast her eyes downward. The emptiness behind his steel blue eyes scared the stuffing out of her. She’d seen that look before. It was the gaze of a trained hunter...a trained murderer.“Thanks,” he said and pushed rudely past her into the resort. Whistling softly, he inspected the kitchen and main living area. “This is some place.”“Yes, yes it is. If you like, I’ll show you around.” Emma moved toward him and pointed to the other end of a small sitting area. “Behind those double doors is the master suite. I’ve done some juggling and rearranged the rooms so that you can occupy that area yourself.” She started to walk past him, but his hand whipped out and grabbed her arm. Emma stilled.“What do you mean juggling?”Emma narrowed her eyes and glared down at the fingers gripping her skin. His voice might sound like something from the crypt, but she’d be dammed if she’d allow him to physically intimidate her.“The rooms are fully booked until the end of the season,” she said, prying his hand off her arm and knocking it away.“Fully booked?” he responded, not paying any heed to the triumphant gleam in Emma’s eyes. “I’m not living with a bunch of people underfoot. Cancel them.”She frowned, closed her eyes, and begged for patience. He’d been granted a gift that Emma would give her left arm for, not her right…because she needed that to run the resort but definitely her left. She swore silently. He was nothing more than a selfish, arrogant, pretentious jerk. Counting back from five, Emma concentrated on calming the anger that threatened to spew forth giving Old Faithful a run for its money.She’d worked long and hard to make River Run attain the status of a five-star resort, and he wanted her to cancel the reservations?“Mr. Connor let me explain...” she paused as he turned angry eyes on her.“No, Miss...What the hell is your name anyway?”“O’Malley, sir. Emma O’Malley. As I was saying before you rudely interrupted, our guests pay a minimum of fifteen thousand dollars per week to vacation here. I doubt you’d want to give the ranch a bad name by canceling these reservations.” Every muscle in her body wanted to fling itself at Stone Connor, knock him back out the front door, and pray he never returned.“Fifteen thousand dollars?” Stone stood there, his mouth hanging open.He looked like the Bass she’d caught several years ago. It was mounted and hung in the living room, a reminder of more carefree days.“Who would pay that to stay here?”“A lot of people, sir. We’re booked solid until the holidays.” Emma wished she could take him to the taxidermy and mount him out front with a plaque that said Rude and Uncaring Grandson.“What? That’s nearly six months away?”“I’m certain you’ll manage. Have you hired a new manager?” Emma swallowed past the lump in her throat. It hurt to imagine someone else performing her duties, duties that she had created and perfected.“A what? What on earth are you going on about?”His eyes were a flat screen of nothing as he stared at her, demanding an explanation. Emma sighed deeply. Slapping the pointy end of her Irish temper back in place, she spoke slowly and deliberately. “A new manager. I’ll be leaving shortly, Mr. Connor, per your wishes.”“I don’t make wishes, Ms. O’Malley. And I certainly don’t recall asking you to leave.”“Are you selling this place or not?” she demanded, her fear making her sound slightly hysterical.“Of course I’m selling.”Emma’s heart battered against her chest. The mere thought of having to begin filling in applications for rent and work ignited a panic that made her feel as if she’d waded into wet concrete. But none of it showed. Her eyes remained calm, her hands clasped firmly against their insistent quaking. “Then I’m leaving.”“You don’t have to leave for another twelve months,” he stated lightly as if it meant no more to him than asking for a piece of paper.Had she heard right? Emma shook her head and glared at the man before her. “What’re you talking about Mr. Connor?”“The provision of the Will is that I remain here for four seasons or else it reverts to someone else.”Furrowing her brow, Emma attempted to process all angles. It seemed to her that his solution stood right before him; but when she went to open her mouth to say so, his hand shot up to silence her.“No more questions,” he grumbled, his voice rough and edgy. “But you can stay, at least until you figure a way to dump these guests.”She bristled at his caustic comment regarding River Run’s patrons. “Mr. Connor may I point out a fact to you?”He sighed and stood silent, raising his brows for her to continue.She shook her head and inhaled in an attempt to not physically smack the arrogance off his face. “If you choose to close River Run, then it won’t be a very profitable business to sell next summer, will it?”Emma’s saw his mind working. His eyes never showed one iota of emotion, but his jaw tensed and he frowned.“I need to think on that.”She offered a half-smile, praying she’d won her first battle. If she could convince him to stay, make the resort work, and show him exactly how valuable an employee she was, maybe he’d reconsider selling.Her identity would be safe.She would be safe.“Don’t look at me like that,” Stone commanded.“Like what?” Emma replied, shocked at his anger.“Like I’m gonna save ya,” he said. “I’m a long time gone from that business.”Emma shook her head and stepped back, slightly discombobulated at his insight. She looked at Stone Connor closely for the first time since he’d arrived. For all she’d been through in her twenty-eight years, Emma had become a very good judge of character. Maybe it was due to her father’s coaching in her early childhood on working the room with visiting political members, but she had an innate ability to read people and instinctively understand what made them tick and how to approach them. It’d been an invaluable asset in managing River Run. She swore when she realized her pre-occupation had blocked this sense.Stone snarled once more and strode past her to the back deck. She recognized the defensive I don’t give a damn armor. It didn’t bother her; two could play that game. She traipsed behind him.“That’s a tributary from the Snake River,” she said, trying to connect on some level, attempting to allow her sixth sense its freedom and provide her with insight.He remained silent. Aloof. Emma studied his face. High cheekbones dropped to a firm, intense mouth. No laugh lines there, she mused. At least she figured there weren’t any -- his entire face was cloaked in hair.She avoided direct contact with his eyes. Their empty, soulless depths bothered her. He topped her by a good foot. Every muscle rippled, tensed to battle some invisible enemy. The fact that Margaret had rarely spoken about Stone suddenly dawned on her.“Over to the left,” she rambled. “Is an old graveyard that belonged to the family who first settled here in the early eighteen hundreds.”She stepped back as he turned to her, piercing her with steely eyes.“Why do I need to know this?”She shrugged, her unease flooding back. “I thought you might be interested,” she said kicking herself internally for her mousy voice.“You thought wrong. Where’d you say my room was?”Squaring her shoulders, Emma met his gaze. “There’s no need to be rude.”“There’s no need to be friendly.”“I wasn’t being friendly, I was being polite. There’s a huge difference. Friendly would mean I care.” Let him fire her. She ignored the stream of fear gurgling beneath her pitiful display of courage. He was a hideous man with no manners, and she’d not tolerate him. A deep rumbling emanated from his chest followed by a derisive snort.Was he laughing at her?She stood as tall as possible, her back as straight as the Lodgepole Pines scattered across the yard. A grin spread across Stone’s face, sending an unfamiliar parade of sizzling sparks along her nerve endings.His eyes lit, and she thought a spark of something flashed within their steel depths, but it was gone as quick as it came.“I think we’ll get along just fine Ms. O’Malley. Just make sure you stay polite,” he said.“Polite won’t be a problem, Mr. Connor. Please follow me. I’ll show you to your room.” Curiosity snuck out from behind her emotional fence and tickled her mind. Stone Connor was an enigma, and it bothered her.They entered the house, and she led him toward the western corner.“Tell me, Ms. O’Malley, how long have you been employed here.”She tensed at his question but quickly realized it was normal under the circumstances. “Fifteen years, Mr. Connor. I’ve lived here for fifteen years.”“You were only a child?” he said, his voice laced with astonishment. “Why would Grandmother hire a child?”“I was more than capable,” she responded icily. She needn’t elaborate on her past. He was prying.“Capable of what? Doing your homework?”“My past really is of no concern to you, Mr. Connor. I’m more than qualified to perform my duties.”Stopping in front of a large wooden door, Emma twisted the glass knob and opened it. She walked into the center of the sitting room for the master suite, verifying everything was in order. With a nod, Emma turned to head out and slammed smack into a concrete wall.Eye level with his chest, she inhaled sharply as his scent invaded her senses.Stone grabbed her upper arms, his fingers tightened painfully, and she winced.Gazing up, her eyes met an entirely different wall. A wall of blue fire that burned right into the center of her soul.“What game are you playing?”“I don’t understand?” Emma said, trying to clear the cobweb of physical awareness that spread across her brain.“You and my grandmother? What game is this? You’ve lived here for fifteen years, and she willed the place to me? If this is some hair-brained scheme to reintroduce me into society, then you can stop the charade right now. I’ll have nothing to do with it.”Emma’s heart was doing a great rendition of a paddleball game. She hated this feeling. “Let go of me, you’re hurting my arms.”“Not until you tell me the truth.”“The truth?” She cringed as her voice rose several octaves. “I don’t understand this madness any more than you do. I created this place. I brought the clientele here. I wanted nothing in return but a little security. Nothing but a home to stay in.” Her voice rose in crescendo until she practically screamed the last few words at him.He released her in obvious shock. She swallowed quickly controlling anymore words from spewing forth and continuing this regrettable outburst. “I’m entitled to my rages as well, you know. You haven’t cornered the market yet,” she said, fighting to regain her internal balance.He flashed that grin again. Emma ignored the gone-over-the-hill-too-fast-left-my-tummy-behind jig feeling it evoked.She needed air. “I’ll be preparing dinner for eight o’clock, until then help yourself to whatever you want in the kitchen.”Emma spun and exited the suite before she did something stupid like slug him. These were uncommon urges for her and extremely unsettling. She raced through the resort into the comforting environment of her private apartment.Emma paced from cubby-sized room to cubby-sized room, absently rearranging knick-knacks given as parting gifts from appreciative guests.Space.She needed space. Stripping out of her jeans and into a pair of grungy khaki gardening shorts, Emma knotted her hair on top of her head and headed outside.Retrieving a rusty blue wheelbarrow from the barn, she piled her pruning shears and gloves inside.The scent of hay and the warm summer sun smoothed her tangled emotions. Emma wove between the white hens that were scattered across the barnyard and headed out past the horse pasture.“Tomorrow would be a good day to gather eggs,” she said to herself, realizing she’d forgotten this morning.She couldn’t prevent the giggle that emerged as the back of her legs were nudged by little furry heads. Rhett and Scarlet, the resort’s pair of Pygmy Goats, danced behind her. They followed her happily, frolicking in the grass and chasing butterflies. Passing a grove of quaking aspens, Emma arrived at her destination.A patch of wildflowers grew in abundance, shimmering beneath the sunlight in an ocean of blues, purples and yellows. Emma carefully selected the flowers she wished to display, clipped them, and placed them gently in the wheelbarrow. She then knelt and pulled at the stubborn weeds sprouting from between the carefully laid brick border. She smiled at the silly antics of the goats. They were everywhere. In her garden, down the field, back to the garden, and up to the house.It was times like this that all her troubles faded away. Life was good and wonderful. The velvet petals on her Black Eyed Susans were a miracle of nature, fragile yet sturdy enough to battle the stiff western breeze that blew through the valley.Emma inhaled the sweet afternoon scent. Suddenly, things weren’t all that bad. She’d tolerate Stone Connor, and maybe…somehow, talk him into keeping River Run. Her heart swelled to near bursting at the thought of not having to leave the ranch.A loud curse and panicked squeal spurred Emma out of her daydreams and into a dead run. She raced up the hill, the goats grunting happily as they nipped at her heels. Hurdling the white picket fence outside the master bedroom, she darted through the open French doors and discovered what she’d feared.Stone, crouched in a fighter’s stance, waved a malicious looking knife at the one thing she valued more than River Run.",

      "content": "Chapter Two Small, beady eyes flared with rage. Stone shuffled sideways, careful not to make any aggressive movements.“Easy, boy…nice pig.”It moved closer and snarled, displaying an amazing amount of jagged, yellow teeth. Stone made a quick survey of the room. He didn’t want to inflict too much damage, but if the pig charged he’d be forced to go for the jugular. Blood would be everywhere.“Put that knife away, Mr. Connor,” Emma O’Malley demanded, pushing in front of the rabid, walking roast and glaring fiercely at him. He didn’t know what to do first. Kill the pig or kill the pain-in-the-butt-know-it-all resort manager.“Get back, Ms. O’Malley. I know what I’m doing.” He crouched lower as Porkchop snarled louder.“She’s not dangerous. Put your weapon away.”“I don’t think so, ma’am. That hunk’o’ham’s about to make me the laughing stock of Jackson Hole.”“You’re right about that. It doesn’t take much of a man to kill a defenseless old pig.”His eyes widened when the woman actually knelt down and wrapped her arms around the ugly round critter. This was certainly no Wilbur. Its hide was covered with gray, bristly hair and a layer of green slime decorated its snout. By her actions, it was clear Emma O’Malley loved this disgusting creature.Snapping his knife shut, he listened as she spoke in a honey tone of soothing words that spread a disquieting flicker of sensation down his spine.“I was referring to the fact that I’d make the front page news as being the first human to ever die from a rabid pig,” he said, straightening up and backing further away from the odd couple sitting in the middle of his bedroom.The woman turned watery green eyes in his direction, causing a lump to form at the back of his throat. She looked sad, as if someone had yanked the world right out from beneath her milk and honey perfection.“Pocahontas isn’t rabid. In fact, she thinks you’re the intruder here. The only thing she did wrong was assume that this was my room.”“And is it?” Stone concentrated on maintaining a straight face and not responding to the pig’s name. Who in their right mind would name an ugly, old pig Pocahontas?“Is what?”“Is this your room?” He frowned as she continued to croon softly and stroke the pig’s side.“Not anymore,” she sighed. “It seems River Run is under new management.”“Oh for cryin’ out loud, I already told you that your stay here has been expanded to a year. How long will it take you to find a new place and a new job?”“Forever,” she said. Without so much as a see-ya-later, Emma O’Malley stood up, shuffled the filet of flesh out the door and exited the suite. He swore the three-hundred-pound pork chop smirked at him before disappearing around the corner.Stone stood within the silent confines of the master suite. Running his fingers through his mop of hair, he suddenly realized the enormity of what’d been handed him.He didn’t want to be responsible. The bullet that tore through his upper torso more than a year ago left a bigger emotional scar than the visible puckered skin around his shoulder.Inability to make decisions.No longer a leader.Scared of Death.But not scared to die. Oh no, he wasn’t scared to die. In fact, he’d tried to stay with his men...die with them. But that damn baby was pushed into his arms, and he’d made a dash for safety, leaving behind the cries of pain and the only family he’d acknowledge. Dead. All of them. Killed in a massacre the world would never know about.They’d asked him to retire...said it was for the best. Said he should have a life filled with happiness and not war. What did they know?Stone walked into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. He flipped the silver knob to the shower and waited for steam to fill the room. Glancing around, his mind fantasized imagining Emma O’Malley languishing in the marble jacuzzi or standing beneath the wide spray of water from the showerhead. He could almost see her sheer, silken nightgown, white as a lily with no other adornments but the glow of her flawless skin. Shaking his head, he realized he did see her nightgown. It was hanging on a hook on the back of the door.He guessed that confirmed her answer. She must occupy these rooms when the place was empty.Stepping beneath the stream of hot water, Stone concentrated on what he faced.Disregarding the faint stirrings of a physical attraction, he figured he didn’t particularly care for the prickly Miss O’Malley. But if she was willing to run the day-to-day operation of the resort, then he supposed he’d better get used to her.What other choice did he have? Allow his father to inherit? He wouldn’t give that man one thing that belonged to him, not even if it meant living with a million different people over the next twelve months.Stepping out of the shower, he grabbed a towel and spent a quick second in appreciation of the thick Egyptian cloth.He’d never been one for luxury, but he had to admit it had its perks.Staring in the mirror, he toyed with the idea of shaving. He wouldn’t do that, fighting a quick pang of fear at having to face his clean-shaven image. That man was a killer. He didn’t want to see that person again.Stone pulled on his jeans and an army-issued t-shirt and walked out the French doors. He looked around, ignoring the breathtaking vista that lay before him. There’d been a time when the mountainous range of the Grand Tetons embraced him in their beauty, grabbing his breath, and making him thankful to be alive.But time passed. He was no longer thankful to be alive and didn’t want to acknowledge the wonders that surrounded him.A radio blared from above, and he climbed the wooden stairs that led to the back deck. Sliding silently between the open double doors, Stone stole a few moments to absorb the woman before him.Emma O’Malley, chief cook and bottle washer, moved gracefully around the kitchen. Her back was to Stone. He admired her quick, precise motions. The way her faded jeans hugged her entirely too enticing derriere as she pulled vegetables from the refrigerator, rinsing, then chopping. He frowned when she wiped the back of her hand across her face.Why was she crying?He hated tears. Backing away, Stone stumbled over a needlepoint-covered footstool and knocked a stack of books off the coffee table. He closed his eyes at the outburst sure to follow.“Are you spying on me?” Emma demanded.“I wasn’t spying,” he grunted, picking up the books and replacing them on the table.“Yes, you were,” she said.“Why are you crying?” He stood up and looked straight at her tear-stained face. Green eyes flashed back through wet lashes and a blush that would make a strawberry patch proud spread across her face.“I’m not crying.”“And I’m not spying.” He threw her what he prayed was a dangerous glare and retreated back through the French doors. Enough of that. Tears and sadness were nothing he could help with. Glancing up at the roof, he frowned. It needed a bunch more shingles and the entire estate could use a fresh coat of paint. If he wanted a quick sale, he’d have to spruce it up.“I was not crying,” a loud voice called behind him. Sighing, he turned and faced the angry woman.“I guess I was wrong then, but it seems to me that tearstains and wet lashes are definitely tell-tale signs of crying.”“This is what’s making my face all funny,” she said, waving a large yellow onion at him. She brought it closer and shoved it beneath his nose. “I don’t waste time on emotional release, it’s too draining.”“I see,” he said, pushing the offending vegetable away. “I apologize for jumping to conclusions.” His eyes widened as a fresh batch of tears pooled in a sudden emerald ocean. She pursed her lower lip and turned away. “Hey, I’m sorry, okay?” he said.“Shut up,” she retorted, a slight waver to her voice. “I’m not crying.”“I can see that,” he said, although he was certain that this time she was definitely crying, especially when the tears spilled over her bottom lashes and snaked lazily down her cheek.“Good, I’m glad you understand my position,” she hiccupped. Waving the knife in his face, she began to say something but stopped when the blade fell off and clattered to the deck. She bent down spewing words that burned even his well-seasoned ears.He was trying very hard not to laugh. It would be mean to laugh, but her language tickled something he’d thought dead a long time ago. “You’d better take your onion back to the kitchen before it has you sobbing.”“Thank you, I’ll do just that.” Emma O’Malley turned to walk back into the kitchen. She glanced one last time over her shoulder, and Stone knew he’d better run…which is exactly what he did. Spinning on his heels, he dashed back down the deck, around the end of the house, and into the safety of the master suite.As soon as the glass doors were shut, he burst out laughing. He laughed so hard, his side hurt. How would his therapist define this behavior? Insanity, he figured.“I have no clue what you’re laughing at,” she said, stopping his heart and scaring him silly.“Where’d you come from?” he gasped.She pointed to the main entrance to his room and swept past him to the bathroom door. “I believe I left something here.”“Yes, you did,” he grinned and started to laugh again. He didn’t understand why this woman’s discomfort made him want to sit down and haul her onto his lap. He wiped his watering eyes and sat down on the bed.“Are you crying?” she asked, an innocent tone to her voice that sent warning signals zinging around his brain.“No, are you spying?” he said.She smiled slightly, a spark of amusement dancing in her eyes. “This was my room.”“You can have it back.”“I don’t want it. I want River Run.”“I can’t do that, I’m sorry.”“I understand.” Emma turned and reached behind the bathroom door. Snagging her nightgown, she wrapped it into a small ball. “I’m sorry I bothered you.”“I’m positive you don’t understand, Ms. O’Malley.” Stone heard the sharp tones to his voice and winced as the fragile string of friendly banter snapped. Just as well, he thought. The fear of this woman suddenly escalated from zero to ten. She was dangerous.She made him feel. *** Emma stalked behind her desk and sank into the worn leather chair that had seen River Run from its days of barely being able to pay the mortgage to its current status. Her fist still clutched the soft fabric of her nightgown.She’d been furious to find him attacking Pocahontas. The Pot Bellied pig was her last link to love and affection. Nate Connor handed her over when Emma first arrived, and she’d latched onto the squirmy, tiny piglet with all the adoration her young heart held. She’d accepted the responsibility and worked hard to make the pig happy. The pet was her lifeline back to reality and away from the horror that often invaded her sleep.Stone was nothing like his father. He’d never offer a kind hand to a kid in need.But he was right about one thing, she didn’t understand. Margaret promised to provide for her, keep her secret, and keep her safe. She’d promised.Her throat caught, and she stifled the sob that threatened to break forth. Closing her eyes, Emma rested her head on the back of the chair. How could she be angry with a ghost? A woman she loved, no less. It wasn’t right. Of course, Margaret would’ve wanted to leave River Run to one of her descendants. It’d been in the Connor family for more than a hundred years.But why hadn’t she left it to Nate?“Just deal with it, O’Malley.” Standing up, Emma headed into the small munchkin-size room she used when the resort was full. She tossed the nightgown on the bed and went to her closet. Standing on her tiptoes, her fingers searched the recesses of the upper shelves finally latching onto the cool surface of a metal strongbox.She pulled it down and caressed the surface lovingly. It’d been too long since she’d sifted through the contents and a little bubble of anticipation rattled in her stomach.Flipping open the lid, Emma settled on the edge of her bed. She carefully pulled out a stack of photographs. Her mother’s bright smile prompted her to smile in return, but it quickly faded into a frown as memories crashed forth shattering the peace.Ireland, a country she barely remembered. The pungent aroma of spiced sausages and yeasty mugs of ale invaded her mind but the surroundings were only shadows. Echoes of laughter and happy carousing skimmed across her ears, but she didn’t know why they were there. She couldn’t remember.“Hey,” a deep voice crashed into the silence of her room, causing her to jump off the bed and spill the contents of the strongbox across the floor.“What’s the matter with you?” she said. “You scared the hell out of me.”“Sorry,” he answered, kneeling down to gather up the loose papers scattered on the carpet.“I’ll get those,” she cried, suddenly panic ridden at the thought of discovery. What a fool she’d been keeping these incriminating items in her possession.“Who’s this?” he asked, handing her a picture. She glanced down at the faces smiling brightly into the camera lens.“My parents.”“Where are they?”“Dead,” she answered, unable to prevent the flicker of glassy eyes and rivers of blood that replaced the couple in the color photo.Her father, Hugh Gallagher, battled all his life against the Provisional IRA. He’d viewed them as nothing more than glorified terrorists. Working furiously to aid in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, his life came to an abrupt halt when her mother was brutally murdered in their home...a violent act that shouldn’t have a place in the memory of a thirteen-year old.“I’m sorry, Emma.” His gentle voice shocked her, and she frowned at him.“Nothing to be sorry about. It was a long time ago,” she said, stuffing the documents back into the safety of her strongbox. This alarm at discovery restated how insecure she’d become. “What can I do for you?”“Not a thing,” he answered, pausing to read an article. “What’s this?”She peered over his shoulder and tried to not let apprehension reach out and betray her. “What does it look like?”“A newspaper article.”“You win first prize, Mr. Connor. I’m happy to see you can read.” She reached over and grabbed the yellowed sheet of paper.“Why do you have an article on the Good Friday Agreement?”“I’m a proper Irish Catholic and keep up on my politics,” she said.“I buy that, but that still doesn’t answer my questions.”“Too bad,” she hissed, relieved that he’d obviously missed the printed names of party members and their families. It wouldn’t take a brain surgeon to connect Emilie Gallagher with Emma O’Malley. “Now, if you don’t need anything then what’re you doing here?”He stared at her.She swallowed the lump in her throat, refusing to acknowledge her fear and insecurity.“I came to apologize, but…” he shrugged, standing up with the grace of a panther, “it seems I’ve only intruded further.”“Apologize for what?” she asked, trying to direct the conversation away from the contents of her box.“For laughing at you. It was rude.” Stone backed out of her room and leaned against the jamb. “I didn’t mean anything by it, and I’m sorry I didn’t respect your privacy. We need to learn to live together, and I was wrong. Again, I’m sorry.” As silently as he’d arrived, Stone Connor disappeared.“How does he do that?”Reaching up and removing the clip from her hair, Emma exhaled a frustrated breath. She snapped the lid closed on the strongbox. One day, she wanted to see these pictures and think of only the happy days. That time wasn’t yet, and if she retained possession of these documents, it might never arrive.But the thought of burning the only link to her heritage created a cavern of sadness large enough to swallow her whole. Absently scratching her head, she ran her fingers through her hair, untangling the snagged clumps.With a quick glance out the window, she realized the sun no longer burned bright but had faded to a late afternoon pale yellow. Time to shower and change then prepare to face Stone. Emma craved peace, but her current predicament guaranteed the opposite. *** Emma lit the last candle and stood back to survey the dinner table. She’d decided on an outdoor meal. The brilliant red of the dying sun burned fiercely in the background casting a soft glow across the backyard. The grill sizzled with seasoned steaks, scalloped potatoes, and thick, marinated asparagus. Her mouth watered at the tantalizing aroma of garlic and onions.She heard Stone clear his voice before walking onto the deck. Turning, a polite smile in place, Emma welcomed him to dinner. “I thought that you might like a sampling of River Run hospitality. Most guests prefer to eat here, and I think it would help for you to experience a bit of the atmosphere we provide.” She noted he’d cleaned up still appeared to be a disheveled wreck, with long hair and scraggly beard. His jeans were clean but well-worn with the knees shredded enough to reveal skin. The dark, long-sleeved shirt bore the name of a football team she vaguely recognized. However, it was the edge of muscle beneath the fabric that bothered her in a way she didn’t want to acknowledge.“Whatever,” he grunted and slid into one of the wooden deck chairs surrounding the small table.Emma shook her head and ignored his bad manners. Consoling herself with the fact that in a few days the place would be bustling with activity, she served the platter of savory meat. Stone dug into his food with the relish of a starved man. He finished his steak, had several helpings of the sliced potatoes and onions and polished off most of the asparagus. Peering at her plate, his eyes sparked when he saw how much meat still remained.“Here,” she sighed in exasperation. “Take it.” Pushing the plate toward him, she couldn’t help but laugh in amazement when he scooped up the meat, giving her a cheeky grin, and scarfing it down in several quick bites.“Thanks,” he mumbled, still chewing. “I can’t tell you the last time I’ve eaten this well.”“You certainly don’t appear to be starving.”“I said eaten this well, not eaten. I consume food for energy, but this…” he pointed his knife around the table. “This is heaven.”“Thanks, I think,” she said.Resting his knife on the edge of the plate, he tossed his napkin on the table and settled back in the chair. Emma started to blush as his eyes raked her from top to bottom, scrutinizing every part of her body. He reached for the red wine and poured himself a liberal helping.“We need to set the game rules in place,” he said after savoring the dry, heady Cabernet.She gulped down a swallow herself and attempted to look at him with as much brazen audacity as he did her. “Game rules?”“Yes. We’ve an entire year to spend beneath this roof and it won’t due for us to be at constant odds and tip-toeing around one another. I don’t feel like being an invader in a hostile camp.”Emma nodded. “I hadn’t meant to make you feel that way. I suppose I’m the one that owes you an apology.” As much as she hated to admit it, he made sense.Stone shook his head and held his hand up to ward off her sputtering. “No more apologies, and no more invasions of privacy. I won’t ask personal questions, and you’ll provide me with the same respect. I shouldn’t have pried earlier. We’re employer and employee and that’s how things need to remain. I expect you to run this resort with the same efficiency and strive for success that you offered my grandmother. In return, I’ll do what I can to ensure that the new owners maintain your services. In the meantime, I’ll begin work on sprucing up the exterior and doing whatever you deem necessary to continue our five-star rating. Is that agreeable?”“Yes,” she whispered, more than a little shocked that he wasn’t being more difficult.“Do you want your rooms back?”“Oh no, I only use them when we’re on downtime like this week. I’m fine where I am, but thank you.”“Okay.” Stretching his legs he rose from the table. “Good night.”“Good night,” she said, successfully hiding the sadness she felt because he was leaving.He paused before entering the house. “By the way,” he said, turning to face her. “Keep your watch-pig away from me.”“Pocahontas?”“Yeah, Porkahontas.”She glared at him and started to rise. Of all the insulting, conceited, ignorant things this man could do, stooping to the level of calling her pig names appeared downright childish in her book.“Pocahontas will remain in the barn.”“What’s the matter?”“What?” She knew she sounded curt, but her anger wouldn’t stay in the background.“You’re frowning. What’s the matter?”“Nothing,” she said. “My brain’s just rushing through everything that needs to get done before the weekend. I’ll see you tomorrow.”He grinned and winked. Emma’s eyes widened when she realized he’d been teasing her. All sorts of foreign reactions sprung forth from within, including little flashes of heat that burned from the pit of her stomach down to the tips of her toes. Damn those muscles.She glowered at the man before her and ignored the throat-tightening response to his wicked smile.“You’re still frowning.”“Don’t make fun of Pocahontas,” she said.Tilting his head back, he laughed loudly.“I’ll make a note of it.” Stone turned and walked into the house. “Let’s meet in the morning to review what needs to be done. I’ll help you prepare for the weekend.”Suddenly the space without Stone Connor seemed too quiet and too empty. “Sure, no problem,” she said absently, watching as he retreated through the living room and back toward the master suite. Picking up the half-full bottle of wine, she filled her glass. With a sigh, she settled in to enjoy the cool evening air. Alone. *** Stone reached his room. His heart beat like a manic drummer, and he crossed the hardwood floors in five angry strides. Flinging open the French doors, he inhaled the crisp air. He’d done it. Made his speech and escaped.The atmosphere, the dinner, the attraction that bristled beneath the well-protected layer of emotional detachment he and Emma devised, accumulated into an extremely volatile grenade. How many times had he resisted the urge to lean forward and touch her? He’d lost count.Emma O’Malley was a contradiction with a capital “C.” She intrigued him, and she frightened him. Stone recognized the precarious situation, and he promised himself to tread lightly and remain distant.He’d ignore her allure. Ignore her mystery. He’d pay no attention to whatever it was that made her squirm with apprehension. Wandering outside, the cool night air caressed his skin.Deep in thought, Stone hadn’t been paying attention to his actions and suddenly discovered he stood beneath the deck. There she was. Like a moth to light, he’d been drawn to her essence.Emma leaned against the wood railing, face turned up to the brilliant stars that scattered the sky like a swarm of fireflies. Her hair hung loosely down her back. His fingers itched to run the silken strands across his palms, to feel it tickle his bare chest.It would never happen.Retreating back into the shadows, Stone headed silently to his room.His brain reviewed what needed to be done. Fix up the resort, scrutinize the books, prepare to sell, ignore the gorgeous redhead that fired his blood.Stone’s eye caught the shadow of a man walking along the fence post. Every sense went into overdrive, and he melted into the night, to observe…to protect.The man stopped about a hundred yards from the back deck and let loose a low, eerily familiar whistle. Emma waved and leaned across the wooden boards to blow kisses at the stranger. It didn’t take long for bitter awareness to spark…the man’s height, his stance, his overconfident superiority oozed across the space.For the first time in twenty years, Stone stood less than a state away from his father.",

      "content": "Chapter Three Emma sat up in bed. What was that noise? She thought she’d heard a thump, but couldn’t be certain. She sat and focused on her surroundings then slid from the warmth of her bed and tip-toed to the door. Another loud crash reverberated against the walls of the resort. Her heart slammed against her chest. She grabbed her umbrella as a weapon, flung open the doors and ran into the main kitchen.Nothing.She heard the roosters, General Coleman and Colonel Mustard, announcing daybreak. A quick glance outside confirmed the early morning hour. Emma started to turn her head away from the window when she saw debris smack onto the wooden deck.What on earth?Footsteps shuffled above. There was someone trying to break in through the roof. Rushing down the hall, she knocked quietly on Stone’s door.“Stone.” Emma kept her voice low, attempting not to alert the intruder. When he didn’t answer, she cracked it open. “Stone?”Damn. Where was he?Emma considered her options. She could call the police, but at thirty miles away they’d take forever. She could grab Margaret’s .22 and deal with the intruder herself. Yes, Emma decided. That’s exactly what she’d do. It was time to take a stand and stop being the fraidy-cat her life had molded her into.With light footsteps, she retreated to her corner of the resort. Emma pulled on a pair of jeans and old denim shirt, mentally pep-talking her way through the upcoming scene.Get the gun.Go to the attic.Climb on the roof.Shoot the bastard.Piece of cake.Why wouldn’t her hands stop trembling? She went to the locked safe in the garage and swapped her umbrella for the Ruger. Silently ascending the staircase, Emma passed the upper suites and opened a small, narrow door at the end of the corridor. The squeaky hinge made her wince. Did the intruder hear? And where was Stone?Her step was light, but the age of the rickety staircase leading to the attic signaled her presence. The gun rested in the crook of her arm, a comfort against the dangerous element outside.Bending beneath the low beams and creeping forward, Emma stifled a sneeze silently promising to clean the place out before the next influx of guests. Another crash echoed from outside. For an intruder, this guy wasn’t very sharp.Cursing her pride, Emma realized how difficult she’d made the past few days for Stone. He didn’t feel responsible for River Run because she’d not allow it. It was hers. But it wasn’t. It was Stone’s, and if she’d acknowledged that then he’d be the one protecting the resort and not her.He’d been withdrawn but amiable to any request she made. They’d worked out a schedule. Rolling her eyes, she realized it all revolved around food. Morning coffee equaled discussions on daily duties, sandwiches at lunch meant a review of finances, and dinner always entailed a battle over impending guests and Stone’s involvement. What involvement? She’d refused every appeal he’d made. Emma inhaled deeply. Her mind was rambling.She reached the tiny gable window. Deep breaths. Aim and shoot. Offense not defense. That was the solution.With shaking fingers, Emma slowly slid open the window. She crawled out the narrow space, gun at the ready. The soft trickle of a small pebble washing down the roof caused her baby hairs to stand at attention. Someone was here…but where?A large hand snaked out, snatching the gun and making her lose her foothold. Down she skidded, across the dewy shingles, her momentum gathering speed no matter how hard she tried to slow down.Her arms flailed backward, hands clawing at the air. She connected with a strong arm then a grip of iron seized her, yanking her painfully up, away from the impending death-for-certain sled ride over the roof. Inhaling shakily, Emma raised her eyes and connected with a fury of blue-steel.“What in blazes are you doing up here?” Stone bellowed.“Be quiet,” she whispered.Glaring, he dragged her up the wooden shingles. She scrambled for a foot hold, slipped, and fell into his arms. Eyeing her warily, Stone sat and pulled her down in front of him, tugging her tightly between his legs and against his chest. His heart pounded against her ear, and Emma realized that the calm, cool indifferent persona was a farce.“What’s wrong,” he said, his voice low and barely audible against the blood that throbbed in her head.“There’s someone trying to break in.”“From the roof?”“Yes, didn’t you hear the noise? Someone’s trying to break in.” She looked around and realized they were the only two people up there. Damn, they’d escaped.Emma frowned when she heard Stone’s chest rumble with laughter. Tilting her head away from him, she saw the flicker of amusement riding shotgun to the dark, silent anger.“What’s so funny?”“That was me,” he said.She frowned and shook her head. “Who was you?”“That noise. I thought I’d start early. I’ve been ripping shingles off the roof for the past hour.”“Ripping the…?”“I’m sorry I scared you,” he said. “What on earth were you doing playing Annie Oakley anyhow? And why one earth would anyone want to break into here?”She glared at him. The pride at having taken the attack stance suddenly withered into embarrassment. “You almost made me fall off the roof,” she argued.“Huh, sorry ‘bout that, but you scared the crap out of me. I guess I overreacted.”“Why?”“I thought you were someone else,” he admitted, brushing fractured pieces of clapboard shingles from her clothes.“Who?”“No one important.” The tone of his voice blocking any additional questions.She turned away and stared at the horizon. Emma breathed deeply and surveyed her bird’s eye view curious as to who he thought she’d been. “It’s beautiful.” The sun poured through the Grand Tetons like rivers of gold, highlighting the valley with bright rays that penetrated and melted the misty blankets hanging above the pastures.An eagle screeched, its cry pulling her in.“Hey,” Stone interrupted. “Where are you?”She pointed to the magnificent Bald Eagle circling a narrow stream at the base of River Run’s pastureland. “Up there.”“Huh,” he grunted, scooting back and slowly rising to his feet. He helped her up, and they carefully picked their way across the slick shingles to the attic window. “The next time you go all brave and crazy, call me first.”Emma pulled her hand from his grip. She ignored her tingling skin and damned the awareness that skittered along her spine. “I tried, but you were obviously occupied elsewhere.”“I think, Ms. O’Malley, that there are probably several items we need to discuss.” Stone motioned for her to go past him, into the attic.“Such as?” Emma said, crawling through the window and waiting for him to follow.“Why’d you think there was danger up here?”She stepped quickly to the stairs and headed down. Emma wasn’t confiding her problems to him. She’d spent the last week being interrogated over every aspect of River Run, and his razor sharp mind wouldn’t take anything she admitted at face value. He’d delve into her past with the tenacity of a terrier, destroying all her carefully laid masks. “An overactive imagination?”In all honesty, he’d probably fire her and then where’d she go?Stone Connor didn’t appear to be the type of man that wanted trouble around. And she was definitely trouble.For now, her identity and past would remain a secret.“I don’t buy that,” he said, when they’d reached the kitchen.She whirled around and pierced him with what she prayed was a don’t-mess-with-me stare. “I’m certain that a man as strong and virile as you has never awoken to a nightmare of life threatening proportions and thought the shadows were out to get him. I’m sorry if my petty, female fears seem inconsequential to you, but they exist.”He walked backward, hands held palm forward in defense. “I didn’t mean to get your Irish up.” Stone turned and exited the kitchen, then paused in the living room. “For what it’s worth,” he called. “I do.”“Do what?” she replied, not bothering to hide her annoyance.“Have nightmares of life threatening proportions.”And before she responded, he was gone. *** Once more, Stone found himself gazing out his French doors, blocking the beauty of the view and concentrating on his internal struggle. Damn that woman. Wasn’t she just a walking, talking vampire of emotional upheavals?He’d not slept well the past few nights. The week was quickly coming to an end, and the thought of his father this close to him continued to ignite fireworks of anger and resentment. Why was Nate here? More importantly, what did Emma O’Malley have to do with him?The sound of footsteps creeping up from within the house flashed all types of childhood memories across his mind. He’d not reacted well. His heart still pounded when he thought how close Emma came to falling off the roof.“Damn careless,” he swore and hammered another nail of self-doubt into his coffin.Stone couldn’t help but sense there was more to Emma O’Malley’s story than a simple girl who happened to apply for a job with his grandmother. His mind was trained to analyze situations from every possible angle, scrutinize the enemy, then infiltrate and overwhelm. He was lost here.He didn’t understand the enemy. But, he wanted the enemy. Stone walked into the bathroom and stared at his reflection. What was she doing to him?The feel of her pressed against him on the roof and that one moment where her face lost all traces of worry as she watched the eagle soar caused an aching deep within his soul.Once Emma O’Malley realized what Stone Connor stood for, she’d run. And when she did, she’d take all temptation with her. She’d take away his sudden desire to breathe.She wasn’t for him, anyway. And it had nothing to do with her idealistic, pet-loving, schizophrenic attitude. He refused to care for anyone that associated with his father. Isn’t that why he’d left in the first place?Trill laughter filtered through the closed door of the master suite. He heard voices in the kitchen and wondered who’d arrived. Checking the calendar Emma provided him with, he noted they still had an entire day before guests began invading.Curious, Stone left the safety of his room and ventured back into the kitchen. River Run’s rooms were bursting with activity. People were hugging, crying, laughing, and talking all at once. An elderly gentleman consoled a young, Latino woman to the left. In the center of the room, a group of twenty-something, giggling girls spoke rapidly to one another using their hands when words failed.They were everywhere.He strode over to Emma who stood in the center of this human tornado and grabbed her arm. With a grin, she patted his hand like he was a child and yelled above the din.“Guys, I’d like to introduce the new owner of River Run, Stone Connor.”There was an immediate decent into silence. Twenty pairs of eyes stared at him, some accusing, some shocked.“Mr. Connor, may I introduce the River Run staff.” Emma grabbed his wrist, pulling him toward the crowd of people that had begun to form an uneven line. Her touch burned.When was the last time he’d allowed anyone to lead?He swallowed the longing to pull her closer, to use her as a shield against the inquisitive stares, but instead battled to remain focused and examine the odd assortment of characters wearing identical River Run t-shirts.Emma ticked off name after name along with each person’s occupation, Maid, Landscape Artist, Culinary Assistant, Activities Coordinator, they all quickly became a blur. Stone mentally filed it away. He was wary of the glances that seemed to want his approval or required direction. Leadership wasn’t his responsibility.Finally, Stone shook hands with his last employee. Tilly someone or other, the chef. She was a short, buxom brunette, and if she wasn’t giving him an open invitation into her pants then he was stupider than Porkahontas.“So, like I said,” she cooed. “If you want a private sampling of the menu next week, I’ll be happy to prepare it and bring it to your suite this evening.”“Tilly,” Emma said. Stone gazed down at his resort manager, the sharp tone in her voice amused him. “I’m certain that won’t be necessary.”“How do you know, Em? Maybe Mr. Connor would like a little taste of my mouth-watering wares.” Stone bit his lip. It wouldn’t do to laugh in this woman’s face. He was concerned, however, that she’d treated Emma with a hint of contempt.“Ms. Williams, right?”“Yes, sir,” the chef replied, scuttling forward and stroking his shirt sleeve.“I appreciate your offer of a private dinner.” He didn’t miss the spark of triumph she tossed at Emma. Frowning, he rubbed his hand over weary eyes. Normally, he’d gladly accept the catch-of-the-day, but right now he wanted to land his fist smack in the middle of little-miss-hot-potatoes forehead. “Ms. O’Malley and I have business to discuss. We’ll both dine on the back deck this evening, if it suits her schedule.”Emma gaped at him. He furrowed his brow and glanced at the mounted bass behind her head. Glancing down at her open mouth, he resisted the urge to lift her chin. “Ms. O’Malley, does that suit you?”“Yes sir,” she whispered.He turned and walked out of the room, pausing outside the living room he looked over his shoulder and waved his hand. “Carry on, everyone. I’ll be back before you leave for a daily report.”Closing the door to his suite, he relished the silence. He’d done it. An hour of masquerading as a human being, and no one had seen beyond his façade.Collapsing on the bed, he grabbed his head and dug his palms into the pain that sliced his temples. Thirty dead eyes floated before him. He’d made the wrong choice, they accused.He needed to forget, that’s what his therapist said. Until he pushed these faces down, into the fathoms of his soul, he’d be unable to continue.Stone’s lip twisted up into a savage smile.He’d won this first battle. He hadn’t failed beneath the ever watchful gaze of Emma O’Malley. *** Emma helped Tilly stash the groceries she’d brought. The woman chattered non-stop about their handsome new boss, absolutely ignorant that he’d not been interested in her feminine wiles.“It’ll take a while for him to warm up to me, but you’ll see.” She wagged a finger at Emma. “He’ll come around and then maybe I’ll be your boss one day.” Tilly giggled, grating on Emma’s nerves.“Put the receipt for these items in the office, Tilly. I’m going to work in the barn.” Emma saw the disgusted eye roll the woman tossed at her but avoided the biting retaliation forming on her lips. The barn was an important aspect of River Run. The children adored playing with the animals, not to mention the abundance of fresh eggs her hens provide.Pocahontas, rooting in the barnyard, greeted her with happy little grunts, and she bent over to scratch behind the pig’s ears. She was old, and Emma feared she’d not make another winter, which might be the best. What would happen to her if Emma left?“We’ll not think about that, Pokey, will we?” she said.“Think about what?” Stone asked.“How do you do that?”“What?”“Sneak up on people. It’s very disconcerting.” Emma straightened, brushing green slime off her sleeve where Pocahontas had snuffled against her arm.“That’s gross,” he said pointing at her hand.“She’s a pig. It’s no different than wiping goop out of your dog’s eye.”Stone closed his eyes, shook his head then opened them to gaze at her in amazement. “Are you some type of bunny hugger?”“No,” she frowned. “We don’t have rabbits. Well, we did, but the coyotes got ‘em. It wasn’t a pretty sight.”He snorted and waved his hand at her.“What?” she asked.“I wasn’t referring to cuddling rabbits. A bunny hugger is an animal activist. I’m a bit surprised you didn’t know that?”Emma bristled. Granted, she didn’t follow the news much, it scared her. But she’d always thought of herself as relatively well informed and in tune with things. This was idiotic. “That’s not really a term I hear on a daily basis. Sorry if I disappointed you.”He sighed. “Look, let’s please try and get along. We need to show a united front before the employees.”“I think we’re getting along just fine. Want to help set up for tomorrow?”“What’s tomorrow?”“The arrival of the twin terrors.”“What?”“The Bakers have two twin boys. This’ll be their third visit in two years.”“And?”“The boys are mean to animals.”“Then why let them out here?” Stone leaned against the side of the barn and stared at her.“Because they’re our guests.”“I don’t understand. Just tell them they’re not allowed near the animals.”“That’s diplomatic.” She didn’t try to hide her sarcasm and attempted to walk past him, but he stopped her. She was close enough to smell the spicy scent of his cologne. Tilting her head up, she gazed into his face.Time stopped.His eyes were warm, dark blue and curious. They bore into her soul, searching for something. Emma’s heart caught. And she panicked. Who was this man?“Don’t go,” he said, his voice barely audible.“I’ve things to do.”He nodded, his eyes suddenly clouding over and retreating back to their normal steel. “What do you want me to do?”She swallowed and stepped back, putting distance between them. Emma didn’t understand these emotions, and honestly, she figured she’d never understand them. Better to ignore everything.“Pocahontas’s pen needs to be reinforced with another four by six and the lock switched to the inside, out of reach of little hands.”“Porkie’s got a pen?”She glared and pointed to the end of the barn. “Pokey’s room is just down that way. She’ll show you the way.” Sure enough, Pocahontas trotted down the aisle and opened her door for Stone. He shook his head and followed.Emma mucked stalls, rewired gaps in the chicken coop and made sure all gates had double locks. She attempted to ignore the presence of Stone, but his muttered expletives made her smile. “Quite a creative vocabulary you have there.”“What?” He called from the back of the pig pen.“Your language,” she yelled back. “It’s very colorful.”He glanced over the gate in her direction. “The military offered special courses.” Another stream of curses followed this, and he dove back into the pen. Curious, Emma walked down the aisle and peered over the door.“Oh,” she sighed when she saw what he’d been doing. Instead of one four by six, Stone had re-paneled the entire pen, making sure all holes were filled. He’d cut in a small piggy door with a flap to allow Pocahontas easy access to her home, but it could also be locked down to prevent any unwanted little boys from investigating.Apparently, Pokey was showing her gratitude by stealing Stone’s tools. At present, the pig firmly grasped his hammer between her teeth.“Come on, Porkahontas, give it over.”“Stop calling her names. Pigs are sensitive.”He tossed her one of his get-real looks and turned to face the pig. “Okay, beautiful. Let’s have that hammer.”Pocahontas snuffled then dropped the tool. She stomped past Stone and exited the pen via her new door.“I think she likes you,” Emma said.“Whatever,” he shrugged.“Tell me about the military. What branch were you in?”“Who said I’d been in the military?” he growled, his face suddenly flushed with anger.Emma back-pedaled in her mind. Rut-ro, this was a sensitive subject. “You did, but I’m sorry. We’d promised not to question each other.”He pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head sadly. “No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. Hey, let’s just stop saying we’re sorry, okay?”She smiled, biting back the instinctive apology that almost slipped out. “You got it. I’m done here so I thought I’d check on the progress inside.” Turning away from the most complicated man she’d ever met, Emma headed back to the house.“I’ll see you at dinner,” he called after her.She waved her agreement but didn’t dare glance back. *** Emma stepped from the shower and toweled off quickly. She was late. It’d taken longer than expected to perform her walk-through after housecleaning finished. She’d verified that the rooms were prepared, wine rack stocked, refrigerator full, special items purchased and itinerary finalized.The Bakers were set. For now, at least.What should she wear? Wait a minute, it didn’t matter what she wore. This was only a business dinner.“He’s not my type.” She insisted to the mirror. He was…well, he was just too hairy. Emma imagined trying to find his lips beneath his beard and mustache. At least that thought stopped her fingers from trembling.“Ready?” A deep voice called from her doorway, almost making her drop the towel that was wrapped around her body.It’d never crossed her mind to shut her bedroom door. No one ever ventured into her private section of River Run. “Would you stop that?”“What?”“Sneaking up on me. I can’t stand it. You’re gonna have to start wearing cowbells.”He grinned. “I guess this means you’re not ready.”“No, I’m not ready. Does it look like I’m ready?” She winced at her choice of words.Stone’s eyes darkened, and his mouth parted slightly. He licked his lips and inhaled sharply. An electric bolt shot straight up her spine as she realized the only thing between his burning gaze and her naked body was a tiny, white towel.“I’ll wait for you outside,” he said.“Good idea,” she whispered then slammed the door in his face. A throaty laugh filtered down the hall, and she winced again, hating the way her body responded. Emma opened the closet and rooted for something appropriate.Thirty minutes later, she arrived on the back deck adorned in a crisp white shirt and black pants. She’d moisturized until her skin glowed. Her face wore only the slightest trace of makeup, enough to hide a few freckles and thicken her lashes.Emma nodded to Tilly and glanced around for Stone.“He left,” Tilly said. Emma raised her brows at the obvious bitter edge to the woman’s words.“Really?” A stab of disappointment lodging in Emma’s chest. “Where’d he go?”“I dunno. One minute he was here the next he was gone. Still want to eat?”“Of course,” she answered. Tilly shook her head in disgust and returned to the kitchen. Emma knew she needed to deal with the chef’s attitude, but there always seemed to be something more pressing to resolve. She’d admired Stone’s deft handling of the difficult situation earlier and wondered how he’d learned such diplomacy?The table was lavishly adorned with the best silverware and finest china. A bottle of wine cooled in an ice bucket, and Emma walked over to pour herself a glass.As she placed her hand around the neck of the bottle an arm reached around from behind, taking the bottle from her grasp. Woodsy aftershave signaled the arrival of Stone. He took hold of the wine glass with his other hand, pinning her between his body and the table. Emma was trapped.The warmth of his chest pressed against her back igniting every nerve with sparks of energy until her entire system hummed in anticipation.She spun around within the circle of his arms and gasped in surprise, her anger fading beneath shock.The only familiar feature on the face before her was a set of icy blue eyes warming to a deep azure.",

      "content": "Chapter Four “You shaved.” An uncomfortable pang constricted Emma’s heart. He’d done it. With one swipe of the blade, Stone Connor had flicked off the scab of solitude and opened her soul to a longing she’d never dared contemplate.“Yeah, don’t make a big deal of it. I’m not real happy right now.”“But you look great,” she said, trying desperately to control the frenzied rhythm of her pulse. He’d been roughly attractive before; but now, without all the facial hair masking his chiseled features, Stone Connor was downright gorgeous. The vulnerability hidden smartly behind cynical eyes undid her, luring her into an alien place.Emma studied his face, tracing a finger down the right side of his cheekbone to a strong, square jaw. He tensed and pulled her hand away.She shouldn’t have touched him, but her impulses refused to be disregarded. “Sorry.”“I figured I’d better look the part of an expensive resort owner and not a mountain man.”“I see,” Emma said, a little disappointed. Ridiculous, she silently chided herself. It’s not like he’d do something like this for me. Curbing her bubbling emotions, she remembered the way he’d gazed at her wrapped in the towel. Attraction, in the physical sense, didn’t equal the heartrending sensation rapidly seizing her soul.“Want some wine?” He stepped back, a cold draft snaked its way up her arm, replacing the warm tingle of his skin.“Yes, please. I’ll just slip inside and inform Tilly we’re ready to eat.”“Why not wait a few minutes,” he said, startling her. “I’d like to talk to you.”Emma nodded and took a seat at the table. He smiled, displaying a sexy dimple that snagged her attention.“What? Am I bleeding?”“No. I just hadn’t expected that.” She pointed to his cheek.“What?”“That dimple.”He frowned, the sudden warmth in his eyes fading. “I’d forgotten,” he said.Emma looked at her hands, twisting a napkin between her fingers. Forgotten? How did a person forget their own face?“What do you want to talk about?”“Your salary.”She reached up and gripped the stem of her wine glass. Talk about forgetting. “I don’t have one,” she said.“That’s what the accounting reports indicate, and I’d like to change that.” Stone sat back, sipping his wine. His eyes locked onto hers. She ignored the desire that began twirling in her chest instead focusing on this latest obstacle.“I don’t want a salary.”“I’m not leaving you River Run which means I need to pay you a salary.”“Is that what you think? That I don’t have a salary because I expected Margaret to hand River Run to me on a silver platter?”“What else am I to think?”“You sonofa....” Emma couldn’t finish. Her anger swept the beauty of the evening away. She’d thought maybe he’d changed, warmed up, fit in…made a decision to commit. Isn’t that why he’d shaved?Obviously not.Stone Connor cared only about himself. She could only guess at his motivation, and it certainly wasn’t toward her best interest. He probably wanted to alleviate his guilt, pay her a ridiculous sum in order to convince his warped sense of righteousness that he’d recompensed her appropriately for a lifetime of blood.What did she expect?No, Emma realized, her problems were her own. She hadn’t explained her history because he’d fire her. How could she anticipate his understanding? She needed a plan. An escape route.She needed to quit overreacting.“Hey, don’t go getting all twisted hither and nither. It was an easy assumption.” He leaned forward placing his hand on hers. Emma resisted turning her palm over and grabbing his hand like it was the last rung on a ten-story fire escape. She wouldn’t trust this man.“Stop tearing that napkin to shreds. I’m not being confrontational, but I’d like to right any wrongs from the past.”“Your grandmother provided quite handsomely for me, and I’m no charity case.” Emma refused to fall for his counterfeit charm again. She knew the heart of the beast, and it was solid granite. This salary war wasn’t about paying her--it was about control.“Still, you deserve a salary.”“No.”“Why?”“I prefer to leave things as they are.”“Which is?”“River Run pays my expenses with a bonus at the end of each year. The bonus is based on a percentage of the previous year’s profits, and the sum is then invested in Clover Enterprises.”Stone raised one brow. “Clover is you?”“Yes,” she said, ignoring the skeptical expression.“Funny, I thought it was someone else.”“It’s mine.”Emma said a silent prayer. He’d certainly deduced that Nate Connor’s name signed and authorized all transactions for Clover Enterprises. If he delved any deeper, it could very well explode years of planning.The man sitting across from her would be shocked to discover she had no license, no bank account, no social security number. As far as the computer banks and the government were concerned, she didn’t exist.It needed to remain that way.Stone relaxed, obviously content with her explanation. At least he wasn’t pushing anymore.Emma raised her glass and sipped the wine. It was her favorite. An Italian Chardonnay the color of honey with a smooth, buttery taste. She detested the woodsy overtone of the more popular Chardonnay’s, and her discovery of this wine sprouted a dangerous obsession. She exercised restraint and limited herself to one bottle a week.“This is great wine,” Stone said.“Be careful, it’s addictive.”“Really?”“Uh huh,” she murmured, lost for a moment as the liquid gold slipped down her throat, burning slightly. This was how Stone made her feel, she realized with a start. Careful girl. That kind of thinking would only lead to heartbreak.“Next item on my agenda…” Stone leaned forward and focused all his attention on her face, causing a river of panic to surface. What did he know? “Is a stipulation that if not followed will result in immediate dismissal.”Her throat tightened, and she swallowed back the sudden panic.“My father isn’t to step one foot on this property.”“But...”“No,” he warned. “This is not up for discussion.”Emma sat back, her chest constricting in pain. She didn’t know who this affected the most…him, her, his father? All three of them, she figured.Could she manage a year without Nate? More importantly, could Nate manage a year without her? Leaving River Run and moving in with Nate wasn’t an option. She’d considered it briefly the first night Stone arrived, but the thought of bringing trouble to a man who’d survived a grueling life seemed unfair.She’d protect Nate. He’d sheltered her from loneliness and pain at great personal cost. The man didn’t need any more problems, and the arrival of his son already caused him agony.“I understand your feelings...” she began, but the dangerous shadow that crossed Stone’s face interrupted her.“How could you? I don’t know what lies he’s told you, but I can certainly assure you that you don’t understand. Look at your surroundings, look at where you were raised.”She stood and tossed her napkin on the table. Bending down, her nose practically touching his, she could feel his breath on her face. “Look at where I was raised?” She battled to control her anger and despair. “You know nothing. You could’ve had this...all of this and then some, but instead you ran. But don’t you worry, Mr. Connor, I’ll respect your wishes. However, I won’t be able to stay the year, that’s asking too much.”Emma turned around and collided with Tilly. “It looks like Mr. Connor will be dining alone tonight,” she said.“What do you mean you won’t be able to stay the year?” Stone called to her back. She stopped, turned and faced him.“Your father needs me,” she said. Her anger at his self-centered demand barely remained in check. “He won’t survive.”“But…”She raised her hand, denying any retort. “I’ll be leaving as soon as I find an apartment.” Her heart stuttered. How was she going to find a place to rent? Money wasn’t the problem, it was the application. Her name would be made public. Damn, Stone Connor. Damn him.“Stop,” Stone yelled, rising to his feet and crossing the space in three long strides. He grabbed her arm and stared into her eyes. His steely gaze laced with a hint of desperation confirmed to Emma that his capability to manage River Run was nil. “I don’t want you to leave.”What a snake pit of contradiction. His actions defied his words at every corner of their conversation. He didn’t want her to leave, but he demanded unreasonable restrictions. Unfortunately, her position remained equally as perilous. They needed one another, whether they liked it or not.“I need to see your father.”“Why? What’s he to you?”“Do you really want to know?” Emma pushed his hand off her arm, stepping forward and jabbing a finger to his chest. “You don’t care. You won’t forgive.”“Damn right, I won’t forgive. That man’s nothing but pig slop to me.”“It’s a shame, you know? The two of you have so many wonderful qualities in common it’d be a real show stopper to see who’d out spit the other.”Stone glared at her. “I’m nothing like that man.”“You’d be surprised.” Emma turned once more, heading into the house.“Does he have to come here?” Stone called.She paused and thought a moment. Attempting to lay her emotions aside and think clearly, Emma contemplated her best interests. She faced Stone.“No, I’ll go to him.”“See?” He grinned lopsidedly. “We can do this. You don’t have to run away every time I’m being difficult.”Emma didn’t find any of this humorous. Actually, her stomach felt as if it’d sunk to the bottom of Jenny Lake. She’d go to Nate. She’d stay with Stone. Why then, did it all feel wrong?“I’m no longer hungry.”“What a shame,” Tilly interrupted, scooting in from the kitchen. “Maybe he’ll appreciate a little company of the more friendly kind.” Emma watched in astonishment as the chef gracefully slid into the chair beside Stone. “It’s a shame for all the food to go to waste,” she practically cooed.Turning to see Stone’s reaction, her gut twisted painfully at his obvious interest in Tilly.“Fine, Tilly. It appears Mr. Connor might be up for a little friendly conversation.”Turning, she walked as gracefully as possible across the deck and into the house. She could feel his black gaze burning her back. Damn, but if she wasn’t jealous… *** “So, Mr. Connor, what’ll it be? Appetizers? Or do you want to skip right to dessert?”Stone eyed Tilly. He couldn’t believe Emma walked away leaving him here with this over-bearing, top-heavy, slithering slut. It appeared Ms. O’Malley didn’t care whether or not he accepted Tilly’s unspoken invitation.That bothered him.He slapped away the all too familiar feeling of abandonment. Emotion wasn’t good. Swearing silently, he realized Emma O’Malley was no better than his father. The second something he said or did contradicted her goals, she ran. He hoped the exit door didn’t sting too badly when it hit her on the back.“Just make me a plate, Tilly. I’ll take it to my room.” He rose and grabbed the wine. No use wasting a good chardonnay. “Alone,” he continued as Tilly waggled her brows.“Your loss, boss.” She left the deck and went into the kitchen returning a few minutes later with a steaming plate of food. “Enjoy.”Stone took the plate and headed to his suite. Needing Emma’s cooperation to continue the successful atmosphere of River Run was one thing, but wanting her with every thread of his existence forced him into a territory more dangerous to him than his last mission.Why must she be so difficult?Why did he care? *** Emma sat on the edge of her bed, a faded picture held lightly between her fingers. Tears edged her lashes and dropped silently onto her cheek, weaving a warm path to her chin. She sniffed, grabbed a tissue off her nightstand, and continued staring at the photograph.Nate Connor’s blue eyes stared at her. They were identical to Stone’s and caused an uncomfortable hitch in her heart. These men belonged together. Time hadn’t healed their wounds it only rubbed the salt of anger deeper into the raw flesh. She closed her eyes and images flashed in her mind.A tiny piglet wiggling from strong arms, dashing across the barn yard and straight into Emma’s grasp. How’d Nate known? Was it be possible for a man who’d abandoned his only child to understand that her aching, thirteen year-old soul, needed something to hang on to…something to remind her to live? If that were the truth, then Nate Connor paid more than once for past indiscretions.Emma stood up, swiped the tissue across her face, and exited the bedroom. Her wine was on that back deck, and she’d muck stalls before allowing Tilly to consume that bottleThe deck was empty.Dishes were gone, glasses cleared away and the ice bucket vacant of her coveted fruit.Wow, she thought. They’d moved fast.Ignoring the envious rage building, Emma returned to her rooms.She needed to leave.She wanted to stay.Shaking her head in frustration, she let loose a strangled scream. Could life become more complicated?A soft knock on her bedroom window startled Emma. She peered out the curtains and frowned when Nate’s face smiled back. Damn. She opened the window, and he climbed through.Her heart hammered in fear. If Stone pulled one of his silent approaches, she’d be done for.“Nate, you have to leave.”“Why?” He yanked her into a fierce hug. “I miss you baby girl.”She pushed back, patting his cheek and smiling. “I miss you, too. But Stone’s threatened me with dismissal if he catches you on the property.”“I see,” he said. A familiar cloud descended across his eyes, and she couldn’t hold in her derisive snort. “What?”“You and Stone have a lot in common.”“I should hope not. I’d hate to think he’d fallen down the same hell-hole I did.”“Maybe not the same, but he’s somewhere blacker than a bear’s butt.” Emma walked to her door and made sure she couldn’t hear the approach of footsteps.“Who taught you to speak like that?”“You did,” she smiled then sobered. “I’ll come to you.”He stared at her long and hard then shook his head. “Don’t you dare. It’s too risky.”“No it’s not.”“Emma, there’s been talk in town.”She frowned and wondered at the sudden change in conversation. “What kind of talk?”“An Irish political member, possibly Seamus, is searching for property to purchase in this area. His goons have been blabbing all about his wealth and celebrity status. They’re stinking up the saloons.”His last words froze her in place. “What’re you doing in the saloons?” Why hadn’t she been told? Time for new spies, Emma quickly decided.“It’s not what you think, sweetie. I’m collecting their old bottles and making lamps.”“Lamps? Since when?”“Remember I made the one for the Christmas party last year? Billy Perkins loved it and stuck it in his store. Apparently, a lot of other people loved it too. I’m doing quite well. But this is all beside the point.”Emma’s mind spun. Nate committing to something? Doing something with his life? She’d become used to her job of making sure he felt connected, making sure he didn’t slip down the alcoholic landslide that’d left him broken and alone. “I’m sorry, Nate. I didn’t know.”“It’s okay, baby girl. I wanted it to be a surprise. I’ve started building my cabin on that lot Margaret left me. I feel good.”“I love you,” she said, her eyes tearing up. She’d been a fool to think he couldn’t survive without her.“Back to the men in town…”“It could be anyone,” she said. Her fingers twined together, and she dug her nails into her skin.“It sounds like him.”“Do you think he knows I’m here?”Nate ran his hand over his face and shrugged. “I’m not sure, but it’s too close. If he gained access to privileged files, he’d know about me. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to put two and two together. He’s done it before.”“But why now? Why fifteen years later?”Nate scratched the back of his head. “Elections, I gather. Let me do some more digging and see if something’s triggered this renewed search, if that’s what it is. Then again, baby girl, it could all be innocent.”If Seamus Adams were here, her life flipped from complicated to impossible. The man that scraped a bloody knife across her mother’s throat and watched coldheartedly as life slowly seeped from eyes that used to bathe Emma in love, was closing in. “I don’t think so. I’ve felt exposed and wary ever since Margaret passed away. I’m thinking now’s a good time to trust my spidey sense.”“No, you’re hurting. We’re all hurting. But I want you to promise me something.” He squeezed her shoulder.“Anything, Nate. What can I do for you?”“No. It’s what you can do for yourself.”“What?”“I want you to ask my son for help.” His words slammed into her like an icy snowball.“No.”“He’ll help you,” he said. “I can’t anymore.”“No. He’s not the boy you remember, Nate. He’s no hero just a broken man mad at his father and the world.”Nate frowned and shook his head. “I think you’re wrong, at least partially. I’m sure he’s mad at me. I did some unforgivable things. But he’s not broken, not my son…not a Connor.”“Whatever,” she sighed. “But I’m not asking for his help.”“I’ll not leave until you promise.”“I can’t make that promise. You’d better go. Old soft shoe himself could come barging in here at any moment and send us both out on our skinny butts.”Instead of going to the window, Nate walked to her door. He opened it and proceeded to walk out.“Where’re you going?”“To tell my son you need help.”Emma’s heart stopped. No. If Nate knew how much Stone hated him, it’d send him back to the bottle for sure. If Stone knew Nate was here, it’d send her right out into the cold and smack in the face of Seamus Adams.“I promise,” she said softly.“I didn’t hear that?”“I promise.”Nate grinned, stepped back into the room and kissed her cheek. He then slipped silently out the window. Emma swore silently. With the threat of Seamus Adams, she needed to insure her job was safe. As much as she hated the idea, an apology was in order, but she’d hold off on her promise. Nate hadn’t specified when she needed to confess. *** Emma stood outside Stone’s door. She hated groveling but revenge wasn’t a worthy ally.One cheek biting apology needed delivering.Knocking gently on the door, she waited. Was Tilly still inside performing all sorts of contortions on his body? Jealousy wasn’t an attribute she usually labeled herself with, and she didn’t like it one bit.Knocking once more, her breath hitched when she heard a soft moan.A muffled scream followed. Emma turned to leave, hating the bitter emotions swirling in the pit of her stomach. Another yell stopped her. That wasn’t erotic, it was panicked. The following howl, propelled her forward, through the door at a dead run. Something was wrong.Stone was in bed, alone, tossing back and forth fighting an invisible demon. Emma rushed to his side. She grabbed for his arm.“Stone, wake up.”He struck out. His fist connected with her cheek, knocking her off the side of the bed. Scrambling back to her feet, Emma climbed on the mattress and straddled his chest. She couldn’t match his strength. Struggling against his powerful muscles, she called his name.“Dammit, Stone, wake up.”All motion stopped. She exhaled in relief when his eyes opened. Her heart caught as her gaze fell into sapphire pools of raw pain.“You were having a nightmare.” Heat soaked through the sheet, through the fabric of her pants, and straight into her core.The anguish written across his face sliced through her soul. Wherever he’d just been must have been three levels lower than hell.He reached up, caressing her cheek. His touch sparked flames that simmered and burst into a raging inferno. She closed her eyes. Pulling her down slowly, he touched his lips hers. Jolts of desire slammed into her chest, causing her breath to catch. Stone deepened the kiss, running his tongue across her mouth and then tugging her closer and plundering within.He needed. She gave.It was a kiss meant to heal but instead Emma felt as if her world disintegrated into nothing more than the ashes left behind by summer firestorms. He consumed her, touched and taking with his tongue more than she’d bargained for.Blood pounded through her brains. Emma knew if she didn’t break the kiss, she’d be lost forever. *** Stone was dying. Every nerve fired blasts of desire and need, burning through his reserve. The feel of Emma’s lips against his triggered emotions he knew weren’t ready to see the light of day.Taking one last sip of pure ecstasy, he held her face gently between his hands. Running his tongue lightly over the sweet edge of paradise, he inhaled the light scent of jasmine that swirled and touched his senses then committed it all to memory.He couldn’t have this.Stone closed his eyes, pushed Emma back and pulled away.“Sorry ‘bout that,” he said. He brought forth the memory of the life fading from his men--it helped crash down the gates against the enticing allure of Ms. Emma O’Malley.“You were having a nightmare.” The sudden confusion in her voice twisted his gut into knots.“I thought you were someone else.”“Oh, I see.” It didn’t matter that she hid her face and scrambled off the bed faster than a coyote leaping for its kill, Stone saw the pain. He also saw a huge dark smudge beneath her left eye.“What the hell?” Reaching across the bed, he grabbed her arm and pulled her closer so that the dim light of the bathroom highlighted her face. She turned away. “What happened to your face?”“Nothing.”“Don’t lie to me. It looks like you’ve been hit.” Lifting her head slowly, Stone inhaled at the anger blazing from her emerald eyes…eyes that belonged in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow and not shadowed by fear and disgust.“I was.”“Who?” He ran his finger across the swelling flesh, and she pulled back as if his touch revolted her.“You. You hit me.” Emma jumped off the bed and dashed from the room.Stone collapsed back onto his pillows. His head pounded and felt too heavy to hold up. Scrunching his eyes closed, he tried to breathe past the pain in his chest. Another person he’d hurt. Another innocent life his poisoned fingers had touched. He could remember her smile, remember her laugh at his clumsy attempt to help her pig, remember the wonder on her face as she watched an eagle fly. But he couldn’t remember his fist connecting with her soft skin. What fuck-up.Laying quietly, he ignored the tear that slipped from the corner of his eye.",

      "content": "Chapter Five Stone entered the kitchen, inhaling the sweet scent of coffee. He sauntered over to the array of silver dispensers, snatched a mug off the counter and filled it with the piping hot brew. Emma pulled a tray from the oven. Steam rose from the top of what appeared to be blueberry muffins. With a frown, he studied the edge of her cheekbone. Over the past days, the mark he’d left on her face went from an innocent light red to an ugly patch of muted yellows and greens. His stomach rolled at the reminder of his weakness.“I’m heading into town this morning. Do you need anything?” He cleared his voice of the rough edge and offered what he hoped was a warm smile. “I’m happy to go wherever.”Emma glanced up from her scrutiny of the muffins. “I’m good. Just testing a new recipe – let me know if you taste the hint of cinnamon in these.” She removed a muffin from the tray, placed it on a small plate and handed it to Stone.Stone glanced at the plate, then put it on the counter and grabbed the muffin. He bit into the center and closed his eyes in sheer pleasure. “This is good.” He polished the rest off in two bites and grinned at Emma. “Don’t know a thing about the cinnamon but that was a little slice of heaven.”Emma rolled her eyes and smiled. The only thing marring the beauty in the frame of his gaze was that horrible bruise. Stone’s smile slipped, and he nodded at her. “Call my cell if you think of anything you’ll need. I shouldn’t be gone more than a few hours.” He hated the warmth that drained from her face the second his tone turned gruff, but he didn’t know how to handle what she offered. Distance was better, for now. *** Stone pulled his Jeep onto the gravel drive of River’s Edge Ranch. He sighed as waves of his childhood crashed across the green fields and licked through cattle fences. The warmth of childhood memories blanketed his unease and anxiety and by the time he reached the main house, the thought of seeing his cousin filled him with an edge of happy. Stone shook his head, exited the Jeep and strode onto the wide front porch. He knocked on the door, turning and surveying the ranch while he waited for an answer.“Stone?” A deep voice boomed as the front door opened. “I couldn’t believe it when Alexa said you were stopping by. It’s great to see you, man.”Stone turned and faced his cousin. They were about the same height, but where Stone was dark, Ethan was light. Except the eyes. Ethan’s were somewhere between honey and mud, and Stone had the Connor blues. “Ethan, long time no see.”Ethan pulled him into a gruff bear hug. “Hate the story I’ve been hearin’.”“I know, man.” Stone slapped him on the shoulder. “It’s been a rough year.”“Care to share,” Ethan grinned and sauntered onto the front porch. They headed down the stairs in tandem step and did what they’d always done as children, walked to the barn.Stone shook his head. “Not particularly. But I would like your help.”“Emma’s story?”They reached the horse stalls, and Ethan tossed him a shovel. Stone grabbed it and flung open the gate to the first bay, his movements honed over years of growing up around River’s Edge. “Yeah, how’d you guess?”“Margaret. She was worried about her decision and asked that when the time was right I help you understand.”Stone huffed out a frustrated breath. “Understand? Hell, she’s pretty much confined me to jail.”“Help me finish the stalls, we’ll grab some brewskies and kick back in the rocking chairs. I’ll spill my guts.” Ethan pounded his fist against the wooden railings. “Deal?”“Deal.” Stone tucked into his chores and allowed the physical workout to heat his muscles and sooth the anger lying beneath his skin. It felt good. To be here, with a person he trusted with his life, and not hear the hollow laugh of Death.“I guess we’re done,” Ethan called from other end of the barn.Stone glanced up, rested the shovel and pitch fork he’d been using to muck the stalls and add fresh hay against the wall and surveyed the length of building. “I’d say it looks that way. Beer?”“You betcha,” Ethan laughed.They headed back to the porch. Stone fell into one of the aged rockers and kicked his boots off. Ethan returned from the house a few minutes later with a bucket laden with ice and half a dozen bottles of a brand Stone recognized as one of the local microbreweries. “This stuff any good?”“Yeah. Who’d figured T. J. would actually be good at anything?”Stone laughed. “Well, his Pa did like making moonshine.”“True that,” Ethan said and grinned. “What can I tell you that you haven’t already figured out about Emma?”“She clearly has issues and an unhealthy obsession with River Run.” Stone popped the cap off his bottle, took a healthy swig and grinned at Ethan. “Good.”“Are you telling me that covert ops Ranger extraordinaire Stone Connor hasn’t accessed confidential databases to unearth the identity and background of Emma O’Malley?” Ethan appeared honestly perplexed.“Why would I have done that?”Ethan barked out a hearty laugh. “Boy, she’s blinded you with those wicked green eyes and Irish red hair.”Stone frowned not finding any of this funny. “I realize 2 and 2 are not adding up to 4 – but why would I ever think to do a background check on her. Is she a criminal?” That thought didn’t sit well, deepening the edge of his frown.Ethan handed Stone another beer. “No. She’s not. She’s actually not a real person.”“I’m listening.” Stone stated, his tone flat in contrast to Ethan’s slightly amused lilt.“Don’t get pissed off until I explain. Apparently your…um, Nate owed Emma’s father a personal debt and agreed to smuggle her out of Ireland and keep her safe here in Jackson. She’s using a false name and has no formal identity in the States. Margaret donated quite a healthy sum to the local schools to keep that fact quiet. So, in a nutshell, she’s kind of in our very own homegrown Connor family witness protection program.” Ethan glanced at Stone and nodded. “It’s the truth.”“You don’t say,” Stone drawled. His mind worried through Ethan’s words and came up with an amount of questions that gave him a headache. “Who is she?”“Emilie Gallagher, daughter of an ex-Irish political leader named Hugh Gallagher. Her mother was murdered in front of her fifteen years ago. Her father disappeared, presumed dead. The man Emma claims murdered her mother is none other than Seamus Adams.”At that, Ethan had Stone’s undivided attention. “The dude running for Prime Minister?”“One and only.”Stone picked at the label on his beer. “I saw him on the news last night. He’s here in town.”“Looking for property, they say.” Ethan tilted his head and shrugged.“You think he knows about Emma?”“I think if I’m vying for the most powerful seat in my homeland, I’d be damned certain there was nothing between me and that election.”“This is a lot to absorb. I need to do some research on our Mr. Adams.”Ethan nodded. “And Emma?”Stone shrugged. “I’ll talk to her. Now, here’s the million dollar question. What the fuck was Margaret thinking leaving me River Run?” He snagged the last beer in the bucket and inhaled a gulp.“I don’t think your grandmother expected you to want River Run. What she expected was for you to protect Emma.” Ethan sighed and squeezed Stone’s shoulder. “I also believe she prayed you and your daddy would find a way back one another.”“That’ll never happen.” Stone recognized Ethan’s silence for what it was. Disagreement. He appreciated his cousin’s refrain from verbalizing what Stone didn’t want to hear.Ethan finally let out a shallow laugh. “And, deep down, I think she was playing matchmaker.”“What? Me and Emma? We’re like oil and water, man. That’s also never gonna happen.”“Really?” Ethan said, his mouth twitched with laughter.Stone glared at his cousin. “Really.”“Have you looked at her? I mean really looked at her?”Stone slid his boots on, stood, tossed his empty bottle in the bucket. “I’m not going there. Ever.”“Okay. Seth will be thrilled to hear that. He’s got a bit of a crush on little Emma.”Stone jogged to his truck and waved back at his cousin. “Fine, she’s all his.”“If you say so,” Ethan laughed as he walked into the house.Igniting the engine, Stone continued to frown. What was it that Ethan said that’d turned the afternoon grey? Emma. Danger. He was on that. No worries. Something else niggled, something about Seth, but it was as elusive as a mole in sunlight.",

      "title": "Chapter 13",
      "content": "Chapter Six I thought you were someone else, Stone’s voice taunted. After all these weeks, you’d think she’d find a way to fix this scratch in her memory. Stone’s verbalization about his tryst with Tilly grated her mind like nails on a chalkboard.Emma made her way down the winding, gravel drive. Fall snapped its fingers last week and painted the horizon with vibrant orange and red. Two months, she mused. She’d survived two months within the same household as Stone Connor.She wondered whether Stone’s four seasons meant the entire season or if he’d be free of the ranch by springtime. If so, they’d waltzed right into Season Two, and she figured she’d almost crossed the halfway point.Over the past weeks, River Run symbolized a trophy neither Stone nor herself were willing to relinquish. They’d drawn lines, schemed and then arrived at the same conclusion. Working together appeared to be the only solution. Stone stepped into his authoritative duties, protecting his legacy with the iron hand of a military general. Emma catered to the guests, reinforced River Run’s five-star rating, and prayed nightly her boss didn’t turn his razor sharp intuitiveness in her direction.Inhaling the brisk autumn air, she stretched her arms to the late morning sun. Last night, the temperature dropped into the low forties, and the first fire of the season crackled and burned in River Run’s hearth. She could smell the burnt oak each time a soft breeze blew from behind. The sun promised to warm the day, holding at bay the icy wind that blew from the top of the Grand Tetons. It’d be another few weeks before first snowfall.Emma finally reached the main gate. Where was Nate?The crunch of gravel to her back made her sigh with a bit of dread. She turned and waved as Stone Connor pulled his Jeep to the gate. “Hop in,” he barked.“I’m meeting someone.”Emma watched a myriad of emotions cross Stone’s eyes, but he bit back any reference to his father. “Can you call and reschedule. We need to talk.”Panic bubbled in her gut. “Can it wait?”Stone sighed and rolled his eyes. “I haven’t pried into your business with him once over the past few weeks. I’m politely requesting that you reschedule today because we have important things to talk about.” Stone paused. He snagged his ball cap off his head and ran his fingers through the mop of black hair matted to his forehead. “I know who you are, Emilie.”Emma froze. Air drained from her lungs and she slipped to the ground, hugging her knees to her chest. “Who else?” Her voice sounded tinny as she fought against the ring of fear. “Who else have you told?”“What?” Stone jumped out of the Jeep. “No one. I wouldn’t tell anyone and endanger you.”Emma shook her head. “I don’t understand.”“I don’t care who the hell you are, Emma O’Malley – Emilie Gallagher. Doesn’t make a difference. What I do care about is the fact that my grandmother expected me to keep you safe. I can do that…if you let me.” He helped her back to her feet. “If you trust me.”Emma gazed into his eyes. There were no clouds. No dishonesty. “Why?”He shrugged. “Because it’s how I’m made.” He offered her a genuine smile. “They don’t let just anyone into the Rangers, you know.”She grinned and tilted her head. “I know.”Nate Connor’s battered truck pulled up to the gate. Emma waved at him to stay in the vehicle and then offered her full attention back to Stone. “Can this wait just an hour? I promise I’ll be back by two.”The ease exited Stone’s stance, and she hated the fact she’d caused that. “Fine. We’ll talk at two.”Before rational thinking took hold, Emma stood on her tiptoes and kissed Stone’s cheek. He stepped back, but she rested the palm of her hand where her lips had been. “Thank you, Stone.”She backed away, but the flare of emotion flickering in the depths of Stone’s eyes hadn’t gone unnoticed. Emma quickly unlocked and slipped through the side pedestrian gate. Waving at Nate, she jogged to the vehicle, opened the passenger side, and hopped in.“Mornin’, baby girl.” Nate grinned and winked. He put the truck in gear and drove away. “You okay?” He nodded toward the Jeep that headed back up the drive to River Run.“Fine.”They’d managed this weekly rendezvous, and to Emma’s delight it seemed enough for Nate.A few weeks of hyperventilating each time Nate’s truck pulled onto the main road had dimmed to a tiny pinprick of fear. Fifteen years Emma stayed hidden behind the walls of River Run, rarely venturing into town. Now, spending one day a week riding beside Nate, the world waved a carrot under her nose.They’d hiked and explored the wilderness of the national parks that made their corner of the world famous. Nate’s constant state of nervousness dimmed the golden trips to a dull silver, but Emma ignored his concerns, insisting they continue these weekly visits.Leaning over, she planted a kiss on Nate’s cheek. “Where’re we heading today?”“I thought, if you didn’t have to be back for a few hours, you might like to see the cabin.”“Really?” Emma smiled brightly. “Is it done? You’ve been so secretive.”The older man grinned like a kid with his first baseball bat. “It’s done.”She clapped in delight. “I can’t wait.”“How’s my son?” Nate asked.Emma’s heart sank. They danced this fox trot every time he picked her up. She couldn’t dissuade his innumerable questions nor quench his insatiable need to connect with his own flesh and blood. But, damn, if squaring off his son’s hatred and protecting Nate wasn’t becoming an angry cyclone.“He’s fine.”“And River Run, will he keep River Run?”“No Nate, he’s not going to keep the resort. Stone wants nothing more than to fix it up and sell. He’ll never stay.”Nate smiled sadly at her. “You don’t know what a Connor’s capable of. That place’ll crawl beneath his skin soon. You just wait and see.”“Okay, I’ll wait and see.” Emma knew arguing was futile. She glanced out the window. Osprey and bald eagles dotted the trees that grew from the steep ravines of the Snake River. The rapids were flowing, wild and turbulent, kicking up frothy white water with the vengeance of an angry ocean.“Did you review the latest Clover report?” Nate said.She pinched the bridge of her nose and nodded. “It doesn’t look good.”“Has Stone bothered to dig any deeper into the company?”“No,” she said. “I think I shocked him when I insisted Clover belonged to me, but we’ll see come the end of December when the investment check is due. He knows my history, Nate.”“Not surprised. I heard he’d been out to River’s Edge a week or so back. He ‘en Ethan were thicker ‘en thieves growin’ up. Figured Ethan would fill him in. We’re almost there,” Nate exclaimed, his attention diverted from Stone and onto what lay before them.The truck swung off the main road and headed down a dry, dirt path. It bounced and lurched over pot holes and rocks. Holding the dash for safety, Emma couldn’t help but smile at the boyish anticipation lighting Nate’s face. There’d be plenty of time to discuss Clover and Stone another time. The fact he didn’t seem worried about Stone’s knowledge was a comfort. She’d no desire to ruin this day.After what felt like an interminable roller coaster ride, the truck stopped before a small log cabin. Emma sighed. It was perfect. The home was situated next to one of the tributaries of the Snake River, and its wrap-around deck invited you to explore its width and visit awhile. The bubbles and gurgles of a quick flowing stream echoed through thickly pined woods.“It’s beautiful.” She walked across the wooden planks and admired the serenity of Nate’s paradise.“Thanks, Emmie. Want to see inside?”She grinned at the use of her childhood nickname and followed him into the cabin. The sparsely furnished rooms spoke loudly of Nate’s inability to lavish any luxury upon himself. After his wife’s death, Margaret explained to Emma that her son simply stopped believing in his worth. Instead, he poured whiskey down his throat and left his child to face life alone.Stone Connor muddled through years of feeling his father’s wrath and self-deprecation…then escaped. He’d joined the army and never looked back.Emma guessed the last bit. Being raised within the Connor household meant diverting conversation away from Nate’s son, away from past pain, and away from any topic too difficult to face. She’d become an expert at dodging tense dialogue, sparing feelings and healing wounds with soft words.Clover Enterprises lay somewhere between tense and healing. At times, many things were best left unsaid.“Let’s have a quick cup of coffee, Nate, and then you need to take me back to River Run. We’ve a group of guests arriving this afternoon.”“That’s fine, baby girl. Just sit right there and let me serve you for a change.”Nate’s okay, she mused. He’s doing just fine.She wished her own life felt as harmonious. *** “Where’ve you been?” Stone demanded, pacing the front porch intent on either polishing the wood with his shoes or digging a hole with his heels. She was late. The trip to Nate’s cabin consumed more time than expected.“Sorry.” Emma scooted past him and entered River Run.“Okay. I’m sorry I snapped. I need to talk to you about my plan. Guests are due in less than an hour.” He followed her into the kitchen not allowing any room for escape.“What’s the matter, Stone? Afraid you can’t handle a simple welcome-to-River-Run speech?”“No.” He handed her a pad of paper. “There’s been a change of plans.”She took the paper and frowned at his chicken scratch. “I can’t read this.”“It says they’ve added a guest, an important person and would like to make certain he receives appropriate accommodations.”“And?”“It’s Seamus Adams.”Emma froze. “What?”Stone held his hands up. “Don’t panic. Actually, I think this is a good opportunity to determine whether he’s a threat or simply here doing what he says he’s been doing. I didn’t discourage the request.”“There’s no way, Stone. It’s too dangerous.” Emma paced in a tight circle. “I’ll go. I’ll stay with Nate or out at River Edge. You can’t ask me to be in the same room with that man.”“It’s what I’m asking.”She exhaled a shaky sigh. “For a second there I thought we were on the same team.”Emma clearly noticed that Stone bit back a grin. “We are.” He gripped her shoulders gently, rubbing his thumb against the edge of her arm. “Trust me. I’ll protect you. This is a step toward your freedom. There’s just one other slight problem.”Her emotions were ricocheting in all directions and culminated in a shallow laugh. “What other problem could possibly trump this?”“The only available suite is mine.”Emma shrugged and headed into her small cluster of rooms to find some peace and perhaps a Teton sized chunk of bravery. “So? Move.”“Where to?”“You’re the boss, you figure it out.” Her indifference didn’t seem to be sitting well with Stone. When she turned to shut her door, she noted his face was flushed a deep crimson. Her eyes widened as she caught sight of his tightly clenched fist.“I believe then, that I’ll be joining you in your quarters.” He smirked and left her there, open-mouthed and in shock.He couldn’t stay with her. Could he?Emma slammed the door and took stock of her little world. Small office to the left, even smaller bedroom to the right, and tiny bathroom in the middle. Surely, he must be joking.She crossed the miniscule hall and entered her bedroom. Her full sized bed jammed tightly into the corner couldn’t accommodate Stone’s height not that she’d ever entertained any ideas about allowing him access.“I’m here.” Stone spoke softly over her shoulder, and Emma refused the urge to turn around and smack him. She’d tried assimilating his stealth into her daily routine, but he still managed to scare the lucky charms out of her.“You can’t stay, Stone.” She turned and blocked his entry into her bedroom. His shaggy mop had been groomed into a relatively tame cut, but there were still strands that insisted on falling over his brow.“Why not?”“This is my space.” She stared into his steel blue gaze refusing to back down. Stone dropped his duffel bag, eyed her bed thoughtfully and shrugged.“No choice, Emma. I’ll be staying here.” The gate bell rang in her office, and his attention quickly switched focus. He walked over to the security monitor and punched a code into the computer. “The closer we are, the safer you’ll be,” he called over his back. “Our guests have arrived. You’ll need to inform the add-on that his room isn’t quite ready. I’ve already snagged Lola, and she’s cleaning as we speak.”Emma stuck her tongue out and moved gracefully past him and out of the intimate arena. A frustrated sigh escaped, but she focused her attention on the task of welcoming this next slew of vacationers.“Wait for me,” Stone called quickly catching up and matching his pace to hers.She cast her eyes up at his face. Sudden anger suffused her entire body. “This is an evil plan.”His brows shot up in surprise. “Not of my making. But often forces align to show us a window of opportunity.”“I’m glad you find it easy to play with other people’s lives.”Stone flinched. “I don’t play.”“I’m sorry,” She shook her head, mad at herself. The nature of his nightmares testified to a dark story. She hadn’t meant to awaken the memory. Instead, Emma straightened her shoulders, attempted to harvest some courage from the man standing by her side and opened the front door.“Have you locked Porkahontas up? This crew’s never visited before, and I’d hate to face a lawsuit brought on by an overprotective pig.”Emma rolled her eyes at him. She hated his teasing of Pocahontas but knew he was lightening a tense moment. He grinned, a wicked light to his eyes. “Don’t laugh,” she said, opening the front door. “She’s gonna slime you but good one of these days if you keep insulting her.”“Yeah?” He quirked a brow and nudged her shoulder with his. “She loves me, and you know it.”Emma glared. She much preferred the brooding, injured son persona to this roguish rebel. Whenever he pulled a personality back flip, it made it difficult to hide her feelings. “The Leary’s have overbooked their itinerary even though I pointed out they’d never fit in both Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park in one day.”“Hmm, you’ll straighten it out.”“I always do.” The two of them emerged on the front porch at the same time the long, black limousine pulled up. She marveled at how easily they slipped into their roles. *** Stone smiled brightly at the invisible people behind the dark tinted glass of the limo. He knew he’d placed both Emma and himself in a precarious position by invading her rooms, but the presence of Seamus Adams demanded drastic action. Even though he’d professed Emma’s safety, Stone wasn’t convinced. His gut screamed Adams knew her identity. This was either a brilliant plan or one he’d regret for eternity.Four doors opened, spilling eight passengers onto the drive. They climbed over one another intent on absorbing the first view of River Run, talking and pointing and laughing in delight. Stone glanced at Emma. She smiled brilliantly at him, her eyes dancing and face glowing with pride, the twinge of fear only apparent to the most discernible eye. Stone saw it clearly along with a few other aspects that caused him pause.He knew she loved River Run, but his heart caught when he realized how much. Stone turned quickly away, not wanting to ponder his insight or deal with his reaction.A tall man, in well-pressed kahki pants and Rugby shirt exited last. He turned and faced the front door.Stone felt Emma tense. He grabbed her hand and pulled her down the steps, beside him. She backed up, he tugged forward and tossed her a warning glance. Panic and fear raged war against her professionalism and it sliced through his chest, almost decapitating his resolve.Engage the enemy.Offense is better than defense.Nothing he could say would help Emma. She must face the man gazing at them curiously. She must greet her mother’s killer.“I can’t go down there,” she said. Her voice strained to a bare whisper.“You can do this.” He demanded, hating every inch of his plan.She stared at him. Her body trembled from head to toe, but he remained impassive. Emma squared her shoulders, tilted her chin up, and turned to greet their guests. A surge of pride rushed through Stone. This was one tough lady.Reaching Seamus Adams and his entourage, Emma extended her hand and greeted everyone with the professionalism of a polished hostess.Seamus Adams clasped her hand firmly. The touch of the man who’d swam in her nightmares for the past fifteen years threatened to send her to her knees. She swallowed hard, blocking the image of the last time she’d seen his fingers.Bloody. Deadly.Stone walked up and stood behind her, his hand resting protectively upon her lower back. She glanced back, startled by the intimate contact, but he didn’t release her.“Welcome to River Run, Mr. and Mrs. Adams. I’m pleased you were able to join the Leary party. It might be a few moments before your accommodations are prepared, so please won’t you accept a light lunch in the kitchen?”“Aaah, Mr. Connor, I presume. I appreciate your quick acknowledgement to our request for a room. I’m house hunting in the area and when John and Linda invited me and the missus to join them, it was an opportunity I didn’t dare pass.”Stone didn’t miss the covert glances Seamus kept directing at Emma. He focused inward, ignoring the chaotic swell of emotion, and centered himself in a void of nothingness. Because from emptiness came the ability to see the enemy, know the enemy, become the enemy.Stone leaned forward and grasped the outstretched hand of the man currently headlining his soon-to-be-dead list. *** Emma hustled in the babbling crowd of tourists. She remained distantly professional to everyone, answering questions, and directing them to their rooms. The Adams’ stayed with Stone while their suite was being prepared.She felt raw, exposed and vulnerable.The moment Adams’ pale blue eyes met her face, she’d known the future. The man’s thick Irish brogue sparked memories. He’d not spoken to her as if he knew. But no words were necessary…his presence made his point.Her identity was no longer a secret.Inhaling and straightening her shoulders, she walked into the kitchen. The familiar scent of fresh brewed coffee and home baked bread steadied her. Convincing herself the Adams’ were nothing more than another couple looking for an exciting vacation, she plastered a smile on her face. “What can I get for you folks?”Stone glanced over and nodded.“Emma, would you mind checking on the itinerary for tomorrow and confirming the times are all correct?”She opened her mouth to inform Mr. Resort-know-it-all that she’d completed that task three days ago but quickly realized this would be a perfect opportunity to escape and avoid any further contact with Seamus Adams. Stone’s plan.“Of course, Mr. Connor. I’ll do it right away.” She suppressed the urge to curtsy and make a face at Stone and quickly exited the kitchen.By the time she reached the office, her hands were shaking uncontrollably. She dropped into the worn leather chair and inhaled sharply. Stone arrived before she’d been provided an opportunity to collect herself.“You okay?”“Yes,” she nodded. “No,” she recanted.Stone kneeled in front of her chair and rubbed her arms. She sighed and tried to allow the comfort he offered to seep in. He stared into her eyes. “You did great.”Emma bit back a whimper as Stone stood and sat on the edge of the desk. His touch helped, but she wasn’t about to ask him to hold her.“I did some further cross checking and you’d be amazed at the horrible antics Seamus Adams has been participating in. It simply stuns me this man’s succeeded in politics. Then again, I’m also a sucker for good guys winning. It appears Seamus’ perfected the role of the devil-in-disguise.”“I’m not surprised. Do you have a plan?”He shook his head. “It’s in the works. But, I’ll tell you one thing, no one takes what’s mine. Too many lives have been lost that way.”Stone turned and left the office. His words were confusing, his actions mystifying.She didn’t know what to think, but despite all the fear and insecurities twining themselves around her heart, it skipped a little beat, leaping up toward a sunbeam of hope.No one takes what’s mine. *** Stone shut the door that separated the main part of River Run with Emma’s private quarters. The grandfather clock peeled twelve times, stroking in the witching hour. He’d finished his nightly security check, verifying all guests were accounted for and no strangers lurked within the gates of River Run.Peering into the bedroom, he confirmed Emma slept.She lay sprawled upon the top of her covers, still dressed in jeans and River Run shirt. A notepad lay open next to her outstretched arm. Somewhere in the back of his mind he wondered what she’d been doing, but the silky river of red hair caught his breath and held him captive.If ever a fairy were to grace reality, she’d be Emma’s twin. Long lashes rested against her cheek, making Stone’s fingers itch. He longed to hold her, feel her heart beat wildly against his. But no matter what his inflamed senses demanded, he couldn’t relinquish control.He’d not shirk his responsibilities, though. If it took his last gasp of air, he’d see Seamus Adams dead.Stone stepped back from the bedroom and entered the office. Walking around the desk, he sat in the worn leather chair. Emma’s jasmine perfume wafted from the shadows. He closed his eyes and brought forth the memory of that night in his room. The tender kiss and burning desire quickly faded beneath his more memorable vile display of bitterness.Stone picked up the phone and dialed a number he’d sworn never to use again.",

      "title": "Chapter 14",
      "content": "Chapter Seven Guns? Her mind couldn’t comprehend what she saw.Emma stared at the array of weapons neatly arranged within the center of her bedroom, the dark gray and black metal a stark contrast against her cream flokati rug and cucumber walls.“What’re you doing?”“Preparing,” Stone said. He sat crossed legged next to the weapons. The ammunition lay on her bed as he cleaned and dissected the gun in his hand, his movements deft and precise. The clicking and snapping echoed ominously within the tight space.“For what? An invasion of prairie dogs?”Stone laid his current weapon aside and looked at her. He shook his head slowly, picked up a small handgun and held it out for her to take. “No. An invasion of leprechauns.”“You can’t be serious? Seamus Adams isn’t going to risk his political career and kill me smack in the middle of my own home.” She ignored the proffered weapon and walked to her bed. Pushing the boxes of bullets out of her way, she sat and studied the man before her. “I’m not even certain he knows who I am.”“He knows.” His focused expression punctuated the threat. “I’ve done some checking into Mr. Adams, and he doesn’t ever do anything without an ulterior motive. In case he chooses the stupid path, I want to be prepared.”“Stone,” she said, trying to absorb everything. “This is crazy. He’s been here for almost a week and hasn’t made any move against me. If anything, the Adams seem more concerned with sightseeing and house hunting than the goings on of River Run.”“You hate him here.” Turning back to the weapons, he checked the next chamber.“It doesn’t mean I want to stoop to his level and kill him. What good would that do?”Stone glanced up and tossed her an incredulous look. “Set you free.”Emma didn’t know what to say. His eyes deepened in color, and she glimpsed an emotion he desperately tried to hide. She dropped to her knees and knelt beside him. Lifting her hand, Emma touched his shoulder. “Not this way. I don’t want to be set free this way.”He stilled beneath her caress but didn’t push away. “Don’t you want revenge?”“No.”She stared into the depths of his eyes, a warmth replacing his normally impenetrable wall. He reached up and pushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his fingers grazing her skin. Holding her breath, Emma resisted the urge to lean closer. He’d never touched her like this before, with tenderness washing away the steel.Last night surrounded by his presence, suffocated by his masculinity made walking on hot coals a preferable option. She hadn’t crawled beneath her covers in four nights afraid the intimacy would be too much to resist. Stone never said a word. They’d rested side by side, fully clothed, never touching.She was exhausted both physically and emotionally. Breaking contact, Emma sat down and crossed her legs. Stone appeared relieved.“Revenge,” Emma said, “is not the answer.”“Then what do you suggest?”“I suggest we get our acts together and serve dinner. Tilly’s almost done in the kitchen and the hour’s getting late.”“How can you forget what that man’s done to your family?” Stone demanded, rising to his feet. He reached down and yanked her up. She glared into his face.“How dare you? I haven’t forgotten. But I’ve accepted those memories, placed them where they need to be. Otherwise, the only thing I’d ever remember would be the blood running down my mother’s throat. I’d never be able to think of her without thinking of death. And that’s not acceptable. She gave me a love of life I’m forever grateful for. Her smile and selflessness are things I need to remember, have to remember. Otherwise, what good was it all? I loved my mother and my father.” Emma felt tears prick her eyes and swallowed past the lump in her throat. “But I won’t live in their death.”“Why? It’s not so bad.” Stone responded, his voice flat and unemotional.“You don’t get it, do you? I watch you fight to forget. I feel you toss and turn and attempt to block out whatever nightmares your mind has conjured. But it’s useless. Until you accept your memories, both good and bad, despair will win every time. You can’t make your past go away. So deal with it.”Stone didn’t move. “All this psychobabble isn’t going to change me, so you might as well stay away.”Emma widened her eyes in shock then stepped forward smacking her hand against his chest. “Don’t you dare run. I’m sick and tired of your unemotional, vacant stares. Your refusal to step into the world and participate.”“Participate? You’re a fine one to toss in accusations about participating. In case you haven’t noticed, Ms. O’Malley, there’s an entire life beyond the gates of River Run.”Her breath caught, and she tried not to let his words affect her. “You know why I stay close to home.”“Yeah, I know. Hiding is a great excuse for not living.”“Screw you! My life is this resort, and I live it with a greater passion than most people.” Emma stepped back, putting distance between herself and Stone. The truth of what he said stung.“Passion?” Stone responded, averting his face and rubbing a hand across his eyes. He was tired. She didn’t care.“What’s that supposed to mean?”He glanced back and pierced her with a steely gaze. “Emma, your main concern is to take care of everyone else. Being so focused on righting other people’s wrongs, how could you possibly know desire?”Her heart pounded. She couldn’t believe his attack and how very wrong his judgments were. Granted, Emma’s natural caretaking habits might appear to drown out her own dreams, but they didn’t. Did they? “ You’re a fine one to talk. We’ve been trapped here for months and this is the first time you’ve ever touched me.”“Isn’t that what you want? This indifferent relationship that remains professional at all times. Or would it be better if I yelled at you and told you how you twist my stomach into knots every time you look at me? No,” Stone shook his head. “I don’t think so. You wear your crown of indifference too well.”“I…” Emma didn’t know how to respond. How’d they get so far off topic? “Killing Seamus Adams is wrong. I’m not a killer.”“But I am.”“No.” She said softly. “You’re not a killer.”He smiled bitterly and headed for the door. “Oh, but you’re wrong, Ms. O’Malley, that’s exactly who I am.” Stone stopped before leaving and turned to look at her. “Can you care for a man buried in blood?”“No…” Before she could finish her sentence, he’d left. “But I think I can love you,” she whispered to the empty room. *** Damn, that woman drove him crazy. He swore again as he speared another mountain of dung. It hadn’t taken him long to discover the advantages of mucking stalls and cleaning the barn. No wonder Emma spent half her day out here. The animals never talked back. They listened in rapt attention and every once in a while bestowed you with unconditional love and affection.“Porkey, your mistress has gone too far this time. She needs to mind her own business.”The pig grunted and continued rooting around the stall.“Can you believe I almost spilled my guts? Told her how I feel? What’s the matter with me?” His stomach churned. She’d seen right through him, right into his core, and he hadn’t liked it one bit.Another stack of manure tossed into the wheelbarrow. At this rate, he’d be done with barn duties half an hour ahead of schedule. Stopping, Stone braced himself against the pitchfork. He looked at the pig. She’d halted her nosing about and actually sat gazing at him in interest.“What?”Porky snorted, green slime covering her snout.“That’s just plain disgusting.” Stone stepped forward and wiped his sleeve against the offending gunk. “You’re much prettier without that stuff.”He swore she smiled. Shaking his head, he tossed the pitch fork on top of the wheelbarrow and exited the stall. All there was left to do was add more hay, fill the grain buckets and bring the horses in for the night. Not enough chores to avoid Emma for the rest of the evening.He didn’t want to face her. For the first time in over two years, Stone felt an inner pulse, felt a desire to breathe. She’d woken him from his self-imposed exodus. But for what purpose? Even if there could be a slight chance of her caring, he couldn’t look beyond her affection for his father.It’d never work.No. He’d stick to his game plan. Eliminate Seamus Adams, sell River Run, and get the hell outta Dodge.Away from his father, away from Emma, away from the lure of life.Dumping the contents of the wheelbarrow out back in the compost pile, Stone tried hard not to chuckle at the antics of Rhett and Scarlett. The pygmy goats were the silliest excuse for an animal he’d ever seen. Entertaining, but silly. He leaned against the paddock fence and whistled for the three retired Cutter horses Emma adopted.This place resembled a zoo rather than a resort. He led the first horse into the barn and froze as a shadow stretched from the opposite end.“Interesting choice of duties, Mr. Connor.” Stone immediately recognized the gravely voice.“Mr. Adams, can I help you?” He pushed the horse between himself and the Irishman, swearing silently at his lack of weapons.Opening the stall door, Stone released the Cutter. He turned and faced Seamus Adams. The man stood about five inches shorter than Stone and carried the paunch of a well-fed, pub-hopping father of three. Physically, he wasn’t a threat.“You don’t like me much, do you?”“I’m afraid I don’t really know you, Mr. Adams. However, if you feel we’ve been less than hospitable, I’ll speak with the staff.”Seamus waved his hand and shook his head. “I thought I might take the opportunity to explain that although I’m a politician, I’m an honest man.”“Your political views are no concern of mine.” Stone eyed Pocahontas. She crept from the back of the barn, her teeth barred, and a low growl rumbling in her massive chest. “However, it appears my pig’s got a different opinion. If you’ll excuse me while I put her away for the night.” He shuffled the round body down the barn and into her pen, placating her with soft words. Emma would skin him alive if anything happened to her best friend.“Dangerous animal,” Adams said, stepping back out of the barn.“No. But she’ll bite if you threaten her.” Stone followed the man outside and they walked together back to the house.“I’m not here to threaten,” Seamus said.“Well that’s a relief,” Stone said, not bothering to hide his sarcasm. “Because I tend to bite as well.”“I’ll keep that in mind.”The two men entered River Run. Stone nodded to Seamus, then proceeded into Emma’s rooms. The aroma of baked onions steeped in sherry indicated dinner was almost ready and hosting duties required.He stepped into the bedroom. The urge to kick himself slammed into his gut, and he swore savagely. He’d left the guns laying everywhere. How could one woman rattle him enough to forget his responsibilities?He noted that Emma had pushed the weapons aside and covered everything with a blanket. He swore again, grabbing his clothes from the inch of closet space he’d been allowed.The bathroom light glowed beneath the door, and he leaned against the hall wall, waiting for Emma to finish. Thoughts of steamy air caressing her skin and streams of hot water flowing into places he longed to touch didn’t help in calming his temper.She opened the door. His chest constricted, and he flinched at a longing impossible to deny. *** Emma stepped into the hall, eyeing Stone warily. He looked furious.“I didn’t use all the hot water,” she said.“Thank you.” He wasn’t moving. She pulled the towel tighter around her body and scolded herself for not bringing a robe. A warm tingling spread slowly across her skin, and Emma knew it wasn’t an after effect of the scalding shower. Anger over the mess of guns and his disputatious attitude spurred her into leaving her room half-dressed.“You’re welcome.” Scooting past him, Emma dove for the safety of her bedroom.“Emma?”She stopped, turning to face the keeper of her heart.“Yes?”“I didn’t mean what I said.” He fumbled with the wad of clothes clutched in his arms. “I don’t want you to stay away.”Swallowing the lump in her throat, she nodded. Wincing, Emma wondered if he could hear her heart pounding. “I’m not indifferent.”He didn’t say a word, but his eyes deepened and a slight smile touched his lips. After what felt like an eternity but probably only encompassed a few seconds, Stone stepped into the bathroom. Bathed in the yellow glow of the small fluorescent bulb, he cast one more soul searing gaze in her direction. “I’m not running.”The bathroom door shut, and she heard water spill from the showerhead and closed her eyes against the erotic images torturing her mind.What would it be like to have a man like Stone love you?A round of roaring expletives hit her ears.“Stone? Is everything okay?”“No, dammit,” he yelled. “The water’s ice cold.”She tried not to laugh, but failed. With shaking shoulders, Emma entered her bedroom and proceeded to transform herself from an emotional avalanche into an animated hostess. *** Stone emerged into the main part of the house refreshed from the chilly shower and unusually lighthearted. He felt like smiling which only made him scowl.Candles lit the resort in a soft, yellow glow. The fireplace sparked, crackled and sizzled in bright colors, thanks to a bag of colored pine cones he’d grabbed from the hardware store this morning. Emma stared at the bright blue and green fireworks, mesmerized by their magic.He paused in the doorway. The blaze from the fireplace highlighted her hair, creating a halo of burnt amber. She’d dressed for the occasion. An off-the-shoulder, cream sweater topped a tawny suede skirt that accentuated the curve of her hips. His mouth watered. If he closed his eyes, maybe the room full of people would disappear and allow him a moment to savor her, taste her, claim her.Stone knew he didn’t deserve her. Love and laughter weren’t his future. Maybe tonight he could pretend? Masquerade as a whole man, a worthy man. Swearing softly, he realized a mask didn’t exist thick enough to cover his black soul.“Stone?” Her voice stretched across the distance of the large living room, caressing his ear and shooting straight to the depths of his yearning.He forced himself forward. Standing close enough to inhale her jasmine perfume but not touching. “What’s up?”“Nothing. You seem kind of far way. Is everything okay?”He couldn’t look away from the depths of her emerald eyes. Little jewels in a satin case.She smiled tentatively, a flash of hope, desire maybe, deepening the richness of her sparkling green gems. He wasn’t sure, but in self-preservation, Stone efficiently doused the twinkle.“I’m going to talk with Seamus Adams. I’ll check in with you later.” Ignoring the hurt expression that crossed her face, he headed over to the billiards table. Become the enemy. Stone clapped Seamus on the back and accepted the offered pool stick. “Let’s play,” he said. *** Emma sipped her wine. She refused to look at the other end of the long dining table. Stone and Seamus Adams remained in deep conversation, their voices carrying the length of the room. She smiled politely at Linda Leary.Tilly finished clearing the last of the dinner dishes and began presenting dessert. The tiramisu didn’t tempt her taste buds like it normally did but instead caused her dinner to churn bitterly.“So tomorrow is hiking Jenny Lake, right?” Linda said.“Yes. I think you’ll love it. Make sure you stop in town tomorrow night and collect your picture from today’s rafting trip. It’s definitely worth framing.” The polite words burned her mouth. What she wanted to do was stand in the middle of the table and scream at Stone. How dare he?She froze suddenly. Tilting her head, she confirmed her fear. Seamus Adams had just mentioned Clover Enterprises.“Emma?” the Irishman called.“Yes, sir?”“I was just asking Stone here if he’d ever heard of a local company called Clover Enterprises.”She glanced at Stone. His face remained impassive, but she could see the blood behind his steel blue eyes. “No sir, can’t say that I’m familiar with that business, but that’s not unusual. I tend to stick pretty close to home.”“I see. It appears they’re investing quite a bit of funds in my opponent’s political campaign. I was hoping to meet with them and offer a more viable solution to their investment.”“Seamus,” Stone interrupted. “I’m certain I can inquire around and see if we can’t find someone to talk to.”Emma wanted to faint. This little scenario crossed beyond her wildest nightmares. Seamus Adams knew about Clover? How could he? She disguised her concern and focused back on Linda. “Tomorrow is the staff’s day off so I’ve arranged for you to dine downtown. Every Sunday the local pizza restaurant has an eat all you can buffet involving every possible concoction imaginable.”“That sounds delightful. The kids’ll love it, I’m sure.”Emma smiled and excused herself from the table. She couldn’t wear this mask any longer. It was cracked to the point of disintegration.Walking rapidly from the dining room, she closed the doors behind her. Blocking out the rest of the guests, blocking out Stone.She grabbed the phone and quickly dialed Nate’s number. Her hands trembled violently, and she had to redial several times before getting it right. Listening to the ring, Emma tapped her foot and bit her nails. No one answered.“I think you have a lot of explaining to do.”Emma whirled around and threw the cordless phone at him. “Stop that. Right now, you stop that.” She approached him, waving her finger under his nose. “If you ever again so much as say hi and make me jump, I swear on all the four leaf clovers in the pasture that you’ll be a soprano before you finish your next word.”Stone narrowed his eyes and stepped into the room. “Yeah? That’ll be pretty hard to do when the next time I say hi will be at your funeral.”“Go back to your guests.”“Our guests have all gone to bed. Apparently without a hostess around to direct conversation, it’s rather boring.” He grabbed her finger before she could wave it one more time. The warmth of his touch seeped beneath her skin, sending little flames of fire all along her nerves.“Why?” he said softly. “Why expose yourself this way?”“I didn’t.” Emma swallowed and bit back tears. “I don’t know how he found out about Clover. It shouldn’t be written anywhere in any records.”Stone stared into her eyes. “Are you planning on assassinating Seamus Adams? Is that why you don’t want my interference?”“No.” Emma gasped and tried to pull away. Instead, he wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her closer.“You’re not going anywhere until you explain what’s going on.”She closed her eyes and counted back from ten. Her emotions skittered to the left then to the right, making it dammed impossible to think straight. “Nothing. There’s nothing illegal with Clover. I initiate a donation once a year to aid in the downfall of Adams’ political organization. But it goes through a thousand different companies before ever hitting the soil of Ireland.”Stone stared at her, his brows furrowed. “I don’t know whether to admire you or shake you silly. How stupid can you be?”She bit her tongue. If only he knew the whole of it.“I’m not stupid.”“Did it ever occur to you that this is exactly how he knew your whereabouts?”Emma shook her head slowly.He appeared entirely too caught up in his thoughts to realize how closely they stood. Her hand still caught in his grasp, his other hand pushing her firmly against his chest. Her heart quit beating as his fingers slid slowly down, over her rear. She was wrong. He knew.Stone released her hand and wrapped his other arm around her, pulling her even tighter against him. They molded together, not an inch of space between their bodies. She stared up into his face, into dark pools of desire.“I don’t want this,” he said.“I know.” And she did. She understood his hesitancy, his need to remain distant. He would be gone soon.Their lips touched and everything blurred beneath the longing and desire. Emma let go. She poured every ounce of herself into him, showing him what he’d never accept in words. His breath hitched, and he delved deeper. Pulling her in, twirling her around in an erotic dance.Her head spun…every nerve flaming and wanting only one thing. Stone.His hands raked her hair. She yanked at his shirt, pulling it off his shoulder. He chuckled when his buttons popped, but he never broke the kiss…the earth shattering, smoldering, hotter than Hades kiss.Somewhere she heard an insistent ring.“What’s that?”“The phone, damn…hold on.” Stone bent and picked up the cordless she’d tossed at him earlier. She smiled at his flushed face and erratic breathing, thinking it the most wonderful display of emotion she’d ever seen. He grinned wickedly. Emma rolled her eyes and held her hand to her heart, trying to calm her own mad pounding.Stone glanced at the caller id screen then handed the phone over. The look in his eyes spoke louder than any word.“Hello?” Her heart sank as Nate’s voice rattled down the line. “Yes,” she answered, “I did try to call earlier.”Emma bit her lip, fighting back the sorrow as Stone walked out, quietly shutting the door.",

      "content": "Chapter Eight Emma woke slowly. Soft rays of sun trickled through half-open blinds, creating golden bridges that blurred into a dust-particle blizzard. Without turning her head, she knew Stone was gone. In fact, she couldn’t be certain he’d even spent one moment next to her last night. Pushing away her unreasonable anger at Nate Connor, Emma sat up.The scent of rich Columbian coffee wafted beneath her door, spurring her to hop out of bed and don her typical outfit of jeans and River Run polo shirt. She exited the tiny bedroom and entered the kitchen.All four tables were filled with excited guests. White water rafting always prompted this nervous thrill from families who’d never experienced the heart-stopping, roller-coaster adventure.“Emma?” Seamus Adams interrupted her thoughts. She poured herself a cup of coffee, locked her emotions away, and turned toward her mother’s killer. Only a few more days, and he’d be gone.“Yes sir?” She smiled sweetly.“Why don’t you join us today? Linda mentioned how you love hiking.”“Oh, I don’t think…” Suddenly the room burst into an uproar, everyone talking at once. They all begged her to come along. The faces of the teenage boys alight with joy. I bet they just want to stare at my ass, she thought as the man-children cajoled and sunk to their knees, prostrating themselves before her. Keeping their octopus hands off her the past week made diving into the icy waters of Jenny Lake an enjoyable experience.“Please, Emma.” Linda ‘Leary stepped forward and squeezed her arm. “I can attest that Seamus’s wife, and I would certainly feel more confident with you on board.”“Really, I appreciate everyone’s encouragement, but I have a full day’s schedule to complete.”“I’ll fill in,” Tilly piped up from behind the counter. Emma glared then quickly covered her expression. A sudden thought tickled her mind. What if she could trick Seamus into revealing a soft spot in his campaign or better yet, what if she could verify once and for all that he truly had no knowledge of her identity?If either prospect succeeded, she’d be a more confident person. “Okay,” she inhaled deeply. “I’d love to join you.” *** The South Junction of Jenny Lake lay a few miles into Grand Teton National Park. Tilly maneuvered the resort van with a skill that sparked a bit of jealousy for Emma. No license. No driving outside River Run. Blocking out the incessant chit-chat between Linda and Seamus’s wife, Emma concentrated on what she wished to accomplish today.“This is very exciting.” Linda Leary jabbered as they exited the bus and lined up in front of their tour guide. “Do you do this a lot?”“At least several times a year,” Emma admitted, although she failed to add that this was the first time she’d joined a tour group. Normally she and Nate hiked the trails, enjoying the scenery and absorbing the serenity of their surroundings.She assisted the group in tightening their hiking books and securing water bottles.“Can I have everyone’s attention, please?” The Leary’s and Mrs. Adams gathered round. Emma noted Seamus still wandered toward the visitor’s center. “The trail that will take us from here to the West Shore boat dock is not overly difficult as far as trails go around these parts. There are steep areas but for the most part the path is clear.” Emma paused to make certain her audience understood. “Once we reach West Shore, we can break into two groups if not everyone wants to hike to Inspiration Falls. There is a shuttle boat that will bring those who are tired back here to the visitor’s center to wait on the rest of the party. Any questions?”Linda raised her hand. “I see all these bear signs. Is this bad territory?”Emma smiled as she noted the woman move closer to her sons. “If you use common sense, we will be fine. Talking in regular tones will warn any unsuspecting bear of our presence and hopefully they will move out of our way before we even know they exist.”Adams rejoined the group and handed his wife a water bottle. “I’ve got an extra,” he offered it to Emma.“Thanks,” she nodded, placing in the pouch hanging off her belt. “Let’s march.”Traipsing across the winding path that edged the lake, Emma couldn’t help but smile as the Leary boys pounded their chests in a Tarzanian testosterone display. They flanked her side, each vying for a snippet of attention.The water was glorious as it glittered with the reflection of the morning sun. Emma allowed her group’s excited chatter to smooth the tense muscles burning her shoulders. She kept the pace moving and slowed it slightly as the incline deepened upward toward the west end of the lake. “Let’s take a quick break and have a drink. Remember, hydration is a major factor in fighting the negative impact of this elevation.”She downed half her bottle of water, wiped the perspiration from her face and motioned for everyone to continue. A group of hiker’s passed them, whispering among themselves about spying a black bear. Emma twisted around and pulled a pair of small binoculars from her pocket. Sure enough, about a quarter mile behind them was a smudge on a hillside. If this was only her and Nate, they’d spend a few moments studying the bear and continue on their way. However, this was a group of rawhides that were her responsibility. “Alright, gang, let’s speed up this snail’s pace.” There was a sharp bend about a half mile up which would put them at a safe distance from the bear. “Come on, boys. Let’s race.”Emma grinned as the Leary teens bolted forward, vying for the medal of first place. Linda Leary glanced at Emma who pointed behind her. “Bear.”“Oh dear, okay. Let’s get a move on.”Emma suppressed her laugh as the women moved forward at a very quick clip. She began to follow. Her head spun and she reached out to brace herself against the nearest tree. Emma blinked a few times to clear her eyes. Jenny Lake misted to a dim pin prick then waved back into view.“Something wrong, Emma?”Emma shook her head and waved Adams forward. “No. I’m fine.”She stumbled and tripped to the right, clutching another limb to prevent a headlong dive into the lake below.Adams loomed before her. She followed his gaze as the group rounded a corner and disappeared from sight. They were alone. Emma knew she was in trouble. Something was terribly wrong but her mind fogged and nothing made sense.“Give my regards to your mother.” Adams whispered against her ear.Shaking her head, Emma pushed against his shoulders. “What?”Emma felt her body being lifted, but her muscles wouldn’t react. In a hideous moment of slow-motion, Adams tossed her from the edge of the precipice. She fell downward, her shoulder smacking painfully into the edge of the cliff. Emma attempted to snag a limb from one of the low hanging trees, but she slid downward at an alarming pace. The world spun and her fingers slid off the rocky cliff. She closed her eyes, reached out but clasped nothing but air.Cold water sliced over her skin. Icy fingers of death snatched precious air from her lungs.Water poured into her mouth. Choking and gasping she took a shallow breath, fighting against the pull of death. Her mind muddled and strength faded. Emma slowly slid beneath the surface, nothing more than a rag doll being lulled to sleep by the embrace of a tranquil lake.Her arm hit something warm and solid. Suddenly, another body slipped under her, wrapping her in strength and pulling her to the surface.She gasped for air, inhaling the sweet scent of life. Allowing the other person all control, Emma concentrated on breathing and filling her starved lungs.Lifted from the water, she turned to thank her rescuer. *** Stone’s heart beat a direct path out of his chest. He bent over, gasping for air and fighting the pain racking his soul. Water poured from his head. He swiped his eyes and stared at the drowned rat lying before him.Emma reached out. He held her hand and bent down so his forehead touched hers. She winced as he moved her arm, checking for any breaks. “I think I’m drugged,” her voice sounded slurred and sluggish.“Don’t ever do something as stupid as that again.” His voice was harsh and ragged from fear. When he’d learned she’d joined Seamus’s group on this expedition, a thousand horrific images plagued his imagination.“I’m sorry. I didn’t think.” Tears welled in her eyes, and he tried to smile. The fear of losing her blocked out all opposing rationale.“Obviously.”“What’re you doing here?” The reflection of the lake clouded her eyes. Stone shook his head and swore viciously. The shock of cold water appeared to have cleared the cobwebs in her brain.“I followed you and shadowed the group.”“Seamus threw me off the cliff,” she admitted.His anger blackened. “I saw.”“Thank you.” She grabbed his head and pulled him down, touching her lips to his. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you.”His nostrils flared and Stone battled to draw air into starving lungs. “Let’s go, we need to warm up.”They stood. Emma caught a glimpse of a blonder version of Stone. “Ethan, watcha doin’ here?” She accepted the blanket handed over by Stone’s cousin.“Figured I was a good back up for your boy, here. I’ve sent one of my men to inform your group about,” his voice dropped an octave lower from anger. “This little accident. They’ve been instructed to take the shuttle boat back to the visitor’s center.”“Where’s Adams?” Emma asked.“Ran like a little toad after his wife.” Stone cursed.Ethan nodded. “I can arrest him.”“No,” Stone shook his head. “We need something more permanent than that.”Emma began shivering. “I’m cold.”“I know baby, I know.” He pulled her tightly against his chest, rubbing her limbs in an attempt to rejuvenate circulation. The closeness of her body scorched away the bone-deep chill of the river.Fear at the thought of losing Emma still coursed violently through his system like the angry Snake. Shocked at his own reaction, he blocked the panic threatening to set in.Orchestrating the return of the resort guests and piling Emma into his Jeep momentarily blocked Stone from dwelling on what snagged at his heart. He worked the vehicle through the winding roads of Grand Teton National Park, mulling over how to exact revenge.Glancing at Emma, he frowned as shivers wracked her body.“Get out of your clothes,” he commanded.“What?” Her teeth chattered so loudly, he had to bite back on the adrenaline laughter threatening to break through.“I’ve some sweats in the backseat. Strip and put them on.”She stared at him as if he’d just grown pointy ears and a little green suit.“I don’t think…think…think so,” she chattered.He clenched his teeth. Stubborn and stupid. Pulling the Jeep off the winding road, he killed the ignition, reached behind her and grabbed his clothes. Jumping out and jogging to her side of the vehicle, he opened her door, picked her up and walked down the slightly sloped shoulder.“What’re you doing?”“I’m providing you with privacy.” He dumped her, not all that carefully, behind a thick cluster of pines. “Now change.”“Oh…oh…oh…kay.”Sighing deeply, Stone looked to the sky for deliverance from the entire soul searing experience. His chest still pounded from fear, his hormones were raging at the mere thought of her naked behind the trees, and his mind demanded he run, fast.“I’m dressed,” she said softly.He turned…and lost his heart.Emma stood ramrod straight, eyes bright with a kiss of tear tipping her lashes. Her hair, a tangle of auburn nests, cascaded wildly past her shoulders. Shivers continued to rack her petite form now swallowed by his navy blue military sweats, but not as often. All of that aside, Stone realized it had nothing to do with the vulnerability etched from head to toe that reached for him but everything to do with the small spark of fire that burned like a homing beacon in her eyes.He wanted that fire.He wanted her. *** Emma gathered the dinner dishes and walked into the kitchen.“Can I do that?” Stone asked.“No, you can’t. I’d appreciate it if you’d stop hovering over me.”“You scared me today.”She paused and gazed at him. His demeanor seemed changed, and it threw her off guard. “I scared myself. Let’s just enjoy an hour of quiet time before the Leary’s and Adams’ return, okay?”He nodded and walked into the living room. She quickly stacked the dishwasher, wiped the counters, and poured them each a glass of red wine. Following Stone’s path, she ended up in front of the warm, blazing hearth. He stood before the mantel, studying a collection of photographs. Emma handed his glass to him and dropped into the overstuffed leather couch.“This feels great,” she said, stretching her feet to the fire.He smiled that wicked little half-grin that made her feel like the tip of a feather caressed her stomach. “We need to talk.”“If you’re going to lecture me again on my poor judgment, I want to plead momentary insanity and be done with it.”“As much as I feel you need a lecture, I’ll refrain for at least a day.” Stone leaned against the mantel, sipping his wine and eyeing her carefully. “I’m going to help you find a permanent solution to this.”Emma tilted her head, ready to listen. “Gee, why does that sound more like a threat than a promise?”Stone chuckled and moved to sit next to her. He didn’t crowd, didn’t allow any physical contact, but the intimacy existed, muddling her mind and igniting her hormones.“Seamus Adams is a threat. He needs to be dealt with before something dangerous happens to either you or River Run.”“River Run…” Emma paused, unable to speak past the lump in her throat. “I understand,” she finally uttered.“I’ve decided to make an official request to the President to investigate his political dealings.”“You can do that?” Astonishment evidently laced her words, because Stone’s reaction bordered on barely-contained indulgence.“Yes. And I think it’ll be a safer road to travel than eliminating him.”Emma snorted her wine. It burned the inside of her nose, causing her eyes to water. “I can’t believe you just said that.”Stone frowned and cocked his head. “Said what?”“Eliminate him,” she repeated, using a deep threatening tone, “as if that were no more trouble than squashing a roach.”Stone tilted his head back, releasing what could only be described as a full-throttle laugh. It tickled her spine and warmed her spirit. “Well,” he said, still chuckling. “To be honest, he really isn’t much more than a roach.” He touched her cheek. Emma stilled, relishing the brief intimate contact. “Remember, killing is as easy to me as mucking stalls.”She saw the flicker of hesitancy and reached forward to mimic his caress. “I don’t believe that.”Stone’s jaw clenched then relaxed.”I have one favor to ask.” His voice suddenly dropped to a low whisper, and his desire ran lightly beneath the surface of his eyes.“Yes?”“You need to cease all Clover activities in Ireland.”Emma’s heart froze. She couldn’t do that. It would mean…no, wait a minute…after that last report, it really wouldn’t mean anything. The search for her father needed to come to an end.Nate’s belief that Hugh Gallagher still lived beneath the menacing hand of Seamus Adams needed to be dissolved. He’d done all he could to help her father, and it was time Emma ended this fruitless search.She trusted Stone.And as much as she hated the idea, she didn’t want to hurt his chances of selling River Run. “All right,” she said softly, burying the deep sorrow that welled in her chest. Nate’s reaction wouldn’t be pleasant, but the time had arrived to face reality.Stone smiled, leaning forward and planting a light kiss on her forehead. “Thank you.”Emma nodded, slightly stupefied by his behavior. “How exactly do you plan on bringing Seamus Adams down?”“I don’t think politically we’ll succeed, but I do believe I can box him into a corner where you’ll no longer be the focus of his concern. I’ll make sure there are more pressing matters within his campaign than a young Irish lass hiding in Wyoming.”“I see.” But Emma didn’t really. Stone obviously disregarded the depth of the politician’s hatred. It wasn’t something that could easily be distracted, but if he had a plan, then she’d trust in him. After all, River Run would be the next target. It was logical to assume that. He’d do what was right for his investment. “Why do you think Adams would try such a stupid maneuver today?”Stone frowned and shook his head. “I’ve no clue. Can you remember saying something that might’ve triggered this reaction?”Emma replayed the few times she’d actually spoken with Seamus Adams and couldn’t remember anything out of the ordinary. “What about Clover?”“What about Clover?” Stone repeated her words, pressing for more than she wanted to share.“Maybe he knows my connection and wanted to punish me.” She offered, touching his hand lightly. Stone glanced down, smiled and twined his fingers through hers.“I have no doubt he knows your connection, but why would it prompt him to attempt murder and ruin his chances of election?”Emma stared into his face. She couldn’t tell him the truth, not now. Not when he seemed finally to be connecting with her. Never, in her wildest dreams, did it occur to her that her actions abroad could inadvertently affect River Run. If Stone knew the potential risk she’d created for his investment, he’d surely back away.“I don’t know.” Shrugging, she bent forward and placed her wine on the table. “I’m tired. I think I’d like to sneak to bed before our guests return.”“I’ll bank the fire and be right there.” He stood, helped her to her feet and gently pushed her in the direction of her rooms. “Emma?”“Hmmm?”“Get under the covers tonight.”Her breath hitched, and she suddenly panicked. “I don’t think it’s a good idea. We’re…”Stone crossed the space separating them and knuckled her chin. “I’m not asking, I’m commanding. I expect my orders to be followed. But don’t worry, I’ll not cross into enemy territory.”“I’m not the enemy.”He touched his lips lightly to hers then backed away, leaving her wanting more. “Yes, Ms. O’Malley, you certainly are.” He winked removing the sting from his words, but it still hurt. She didn’t want to be the enemy. Smiling slightly, Emma turned and walked to her rooms.Away from the heat of the fire and burning desire ignited by Stone, the cool air caused her to shiver. It reminded her of the lake, and she hurried to bury her frozen body beneath the warmth of her down comforter. She changed into sweats, armoring herself against Stone then slipped into bed.Emma drifted to sleep, barely conscious when his weight shifted the mattress. He gathered her into his arms. She accepted his warmth, his protection and smiled dreamily when he whispered good night. *** “I get the shower first, Stone.” Emma called racing ahead of him through the main part of River Run. Rounding the kitchen counter, her socks slid on the hardwood floor sending her flying backward.“Easy girl,” he said, catching her before she hit her head on the ground. They collapsed on the floor laughing. It took her a moment to realize he hadn’t pulled away and continued cradling her against his chest, his arm wrapped protectively around her waist. They hadn’t been this close since the night of the river accident. He’d left her before morning and remained distant ever since.“It’s nice to hear that.”“What?” He inhaled, pulling her tighter. Her skin burned to be touched, she fought the desire to turn around and wrap her arms around his neck. Grabbing the counter for support, Stone hauled them both to their feet.“Your laughter,” she said.“Don’t get used to it. I just needed something to break the tension of having to tip-toe around Seamus Adams. I’m glad they’re gone.”“Me too.” Emma reluctantly stepped from his arms and took off again for the bathroom. She laughed when he grabbed her shirt and yanked her back, against his chest. Battling for a foot hold on the slick floor, she tried to inch forward.“You showered first yesterday, wench.”“Don’t stoop to name-calling, jerk. It’s my bathroom, and I should get the shower first every night. Besides you’ll have yours back as soon as housekeeping is finished.”“I’m not waiting for another two hours. I want a shower now, and I want it hot.” He wouldn’t release her so they penguin waddled into her private rooms. Emma reached for the bathroom doorknob but his hand closed over hers. Twisting around, it suddenly dawned on her how very close they were.He didn’t step back but instead pushed closer. Every inch of him pressed against her. “I’m dirty,” she said.“Really?”Emma eyed him thoughtfully. He’d been different after the accident, more approachable. His hostility toward Seamus Adams escalated each day the vacationers remained. This morning, the Irish politician ran to the limo, tail tucked securely between his legs.“Get your mind out of the gutter, Stone, and let me have my shower in peace.”“You know,” he spoke softly, lowering his head so their lips were nearly touching. “We have the house all to ourselves.”“No we don’t,” she replied. Her lungs burned with the need for air.“Well, except for housecleaning, we do.” He ran his tongue along the edge of her lips. She couldn’t help the little whimper that escaped, causing him to grin wickedly.“House cleaning is very nosy.” Emma leaned into Stone, seeking him with her mouth. He inhaled and dove into her with the want of a hungry man, consuming, overpowering. Her knees buckled, and she clutched his neck climbing closer.Head spinning, body humming, Emma remembered what’d happened last time they were this close. She pushed away and looked into his glazed expression. Passion, lust, and something else she didn’t recognize shone back.“We can’t do this,” she said.“Why not?”The phone rang, breaking the awkward silence with its shrill echo. She broke free and answered. A deep female voice asked for Stone Connor, and her stomach dropped. This was why she needed to protect herself. Handing him the phone, she shrugged.“Because there’s always something new…or someone.”Stone listened to the voice on the other end of the receiver, then glanced up at her. The pain and hurt that crossed his eyes before he turned away crushed her heart. She wished she knew everything about him, could trust all of him.",

      "content": "Chapter Nine Stone lifted the last pumpkin from the Jeep. He glanced up, noting the thick white clouds shrouding the sun and cooling the temperatures. The upper tips of the Tetons were hidden. A storm brewed, and he’d no doubt snow would fall before night settled. Surveying the collection of odd sized orange shapes, he wondered if Emma would help carve. Halloween loomed less than a week away, and the current guests of River Run had a parcel of little tots.With a deep sigh, he sat on the porch steps and reviewed everything they’d gone through the past two weeks. He didn’t understand her adversity toward his therapist. If Emma hadn’t crawled beneath his skin, he wouldn’t have needed to call the damn woman in the first place.He’d hated that.That first call he’d placed after so many months of rejecting therapy. The night he sat in the tiny office, Emma sleeping less than ten strides away, her scent twirling all around making him crazed, he’d picked up the phone and dialed a number he’d sworn never to use again.Psychobabble wouldn’t help him, he knew. But it was the fear that his emotions might possibly damage Emma that forced his hand. He’d never considered her reaction, that she’d hate his weakness.“Mr. Connor?” Stone turned and smiled at Sally Haven. Her heart shaped face, too serious eyes, and outward demeanor of an old lady, snuck beneath the dangerous trip wire around his heart. This five year-old needed to be a child. But, her parents didn’t quite see that.“What’s up Sally?”“Um, I was wondering if I might be of some assistance in, um, carving the pumpkins.”“Sure thing, kiddo. Which one do you want?”“I can choose my own?”“Of course. Just don’t make the face too hard for me to carve.”“Oh,” she said softly. “I wouldn’t know how to make a face.”Stone narrowed his eyes and absorbed the way she shuffled from foot to foot, her hands twisting in time to her words.“Have you ever helped carve a pumpkin?”“Well, no. But I’d like to try.”“What about trick-or-treating?”Little Sally hung her head and shook it slowly. “My parents don’t believe in candy.”“Well then, little girl,” Stone stood and swung her up onto his shoulders, smiling at her shrieks of mock terror. “You’re on vacation which means you’re about to have the best darned Halloween ever.”He performed a mad gallop around the driveway, through the barn and back to the porch. Settling her back on her feet, Stone nodded to the house. “Go put on some old clothes and let your Mom know you’ll be out here with me. We’ll carve these babies then light them up on Halloween.”“Okay, Mr. Connor. I’ll be back.” Sally dashed into the resort, calling for her mother.Stone turned back to the drive, walking thoughtfully around the Jeep. He’d seen Emma down by the gate arguing with Nate. Torn between ignoring his father and protecting the woman he loved, he didn’t know whether or not to interrupt them. Emma didn’t see the truth, didn’t know the animal that lurked beneath his father’s calm demeanor.Making a decision, he walked slowly across the pasture. He’d be out of sight, but within a quick jog should she need his help. *** “I can’t believe you’ve shut down Clover.” Nate’s face flushed crimson as he continued to scream the same thing over and over at her.Once more, she attempted to reason with him. “It’s for the best. Why continue throwing good money after bad? The last report indicated no chance of survival.”“You don’t know that.” His voice rang loudly, laced with an anger she’d never witnessed before.“He’s my father, dammit.”“And you’ve just sentenced him to death.”Emma inhaled sharply. “How could you say that? The minute you brought that little speck of evidence to my attention, I’ve moved Heaven and Earth to discover the truth.”“Why’re you suddenly giving up? I don’t understand this.”“I’m not giving up. I’m being realistic. My father’s dead and nothing I can do will bring him back.”“He’s not dead, and if the roles were reversed he’d go to his grave searching for you.” Nate stepped forward and pointed a shaking finger in her face. “No matter how much money it took.”Emma blanched. Was he right? By doing as Stone asked and ending Clover’s overseas investigations, was she killing her father all over again. Nate pressed closer.“You can’t shut down Clover.”“I have to.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, and she stepped back, away from the angry accusation pouring from Nate’s eyes. It’s the right choice, she told herself silently. Stone’s flesh and blood. My father’s a ghost.The evidence Nate brought her five years ago never panned out. Every tie leading back to that cryptic message went nowhere. The last report received from Clover indicated they’d discovered Hugh Gallagher’s grave, and it apparently contained his remains.She shouldn’t be struggling with this decision.It’s time to move on.“It’s your conscience you’ll be dealing with, Emma. You’ll be the one responsible for burying your father down the line. How do you think that will feel? Knowing he’d been rotting in jail for years while you played mistress to my son?”Emma bit her lip, struggling against the tears. His words knifed her heart, spurting forth guilt and anger all mixed together in a whirlpool of hurt. “That comment was uncalled for,” she said in a soft voice. “Don’t come here anymore until you’ve calmed down. You’ve no right to speak to me that way.”“I owe him my life, Emma.”“He’s gone, Nate. Accept it.” She softened her voice reached for the man who’d raised her. “You don’t owe him anymore. You’ve taken care of me and helped me be the person I am today.”Nate backed away, his gaze burning fiercely. “All I’ve done is hide you and look at the damage that’s created.”His words stinging, she turned and headed up the drive, her heart ripped and bleeding. *** Stone stepped from the shadows and held an arm out to prevent his father from following Emma.“Stone…” Nate said quietly, turning his attention from Emma’s retreating form.“It’s time to leave.”“You don’t understand…”Stone shook his head. “If that isn’t a line I know well. I’m not a little boy anymore, and I damn well do understand. Get off my property.”“You can’t let her do this.”“Do what?”“Shut down Clover.”“What’s Clover to you?” Stone knew about Nate’s interest. It’d bothered him that Emma’s relationship with his father extended beyond River Run, beyond the fact that he’d been a surrogate father. An emotional tie of a phone call every now and then to check on one another seemed far less invasive to Stone than the fact they were in business together. He knew she’d never force Nate out of her life the same way he knew he’d never allow him in to his.“It’s my chance for redemption.”Stone laughed bitterly.“Fine,” Nate said. “I don’t expect you to understand. Do this for Emma then. It’s everything to her. Damn it, Stone, don’t you see? Emma’s doing what she always does. She puts everyone else’s lives and loves before her own.”“I’m not following you and, honestly, I don’t think I care. Now, leave.”“She loves you.”Stone glared at his father. “It’s no concern of yours.”“It is when she’s sacrificing her life…her needs.”“Maybe,” Stone spoke slowly, opening the gate and shoving his father through. “You’d better explain what you mean by that.”“By protecting you and River Run, she’s committing her father to death.”Stone frowned. “Nice try at attempting to invoke more self-doubt, Nate. Her father’s already dead.”“No. He’s not. Ask Emma. She’ll explain all about Clover’s investigations. Then tell her you don’t care and let her find her father. Let her put her own needs above yours.”“I’ve heard enough lies from you old man. You’re more delusional than I thought. Get off my land.”Stone slammed the gate shut, locking it tightly. He didn’t glance at his father again, but jogged up the drive. Afternoon loomed ahead and pumpkins called. A few hours of innocent chatting with little kids and mindless carving of a holiday tradition sounded damn fine to him. He squashed the uncomfortable doubt that tugged at him.Certainly Emma wouldn’t put the best interests of River Run over her father? Would she? *** After calming her inner turmoil and washing away the remnants of tears, Emma headed to the picnic table out back. She paused and watched in amazement.Stone sat between little Sally Haven and her older brother, Matthew. The two children chattered away, digging their small hands into the depths of the opened pumpkins. Piles of seeds and mush scattered the table, the children, and Stone.She inhaled sharply as he turned his head to laugh at something Sally said. He appeared happy. Emma wanted him to act like that with her, unreserved, carefree…alive. The mixed signals drove her nuts. One second, he flirted and tossed her burning gazes full of want and desire…the next, his eyes iced over, pushing her away and declaring his distance.It’s time, she thought. Time for honesty.Emma smiled as she headed for the picnic table. She’d seen the results of Stone’s handiwork for the afternoon. The youngest children were finished with their pumpkins and now lay napping within their parent’s room. River Run’s guests lounged before crackling fires, shooting pool and thoroughly enjoying the respite granted them by the impromptu pumpkin carving project.Stooping for a quick pat and quiet word with Pocahontas, she shivered as a chill breeze swooped across the pasture. Stone rose from the table, making room for her to sit between the last remaining children.“Here,” he said, stripping off his jean jacket and wrapping it around her shoulders. “Who dressed you this morning?”The children giggled, and she rolled her eyes in an exaggerated display of disdain. “Certainly not you.”Stone’s eyes darkened and the brief flare of passion sent her breath racing after the brisk breeze. “I’m contemplating changing that.”“My Mommy dresses my Daddy every morning,” Sally piped in. “She says he’s blinded by color.”Emma laughed and settled comfortably between the children. “Sally, what kind of face are you making?”“I want a happy face,” the little girl said.“She’s such a baby,” Matthew interrupted. “I told Mr. Connor I want a scary pumpkin. One with fangs and horns.”“Horns? My, aren’t we creative. I think I’m going to help Sally and carve her a happy face.”The light banter and distraction created by the children aided in calming the tingles of awareness coursing the length of her body. Stone sat across from her, their knees touching beneath the narrow wooden table, each movement a friction sparking flashes of desire. They worked in silence, answering the children but not one another.She couldn’t look up. Every glance into his wanting eyes pushed her closer to blurting out her demands. And that definitely wouldn’t be proper in front of the Haven kids. Emma stopped all movement. Stone’s foot tickled her shin then moved slowly upward. Her eyes flew up to meet his bemused expression and a treacherous grin tugged at his mouth.“Hi,” he said softly.“What?” She couldn’t think. His touch ignited all sorts of inappropriate responses from her body.“Hi.”“Hi yourself.” Emma frowned and bent her head to hide the crimson flush she knew crept at an alarming rate from her neck to the roots of her hair.“I figured I’d better remind you that I’m over here.”Damn him. His foot continued massaging her leg. “Trust me, I know you’re there.”“I don’t think so.”Emma added the final touch to Sally’s pumpkin and turned the carving around for the little girl’s approval. Sally squealed in delight“Can I go show my Mommy?”“Sure,” Emma answered. “But be careful not to drop it.” Helping Sally lift the fat ball, she made sure the little girl could carry it easily. Matthew traipsed behind his sister, proudly displaying his own creation.Suddenly they were alone. No children to buffer the uncomfortable silence.Stone reached over and grabbed her hands pulling her across the narrow table so her face was barely an inch from his.“I’m tired of dancing.”“Excuse me?”“You heard me. I’m done shuffling awkwardly around this house, snuggling close then hopping backward every time the phone rings. I want you beside me as a partner and in my bed as a lover.” He released her hand and cupped her cheek. “Don’t turn away. I know you feel the same. I see it in your eyes.”Emma inhaled and plunged forward certain her accusations were about to put an end to this ridiculous discussion.“What about your girlfriend?”“My what?” He honestly appeared shocked. He must think her an idiot.“You know, deep, sexy voice on the other end of the phone. Are you willing to give her up? Because I don’t share well.”“Me neither, but I’m willing to try.”“What’s that supposed to mean?”“I have to accept your attachment to my father, and you’ll have to accept my need for a therapist every now and then. Trust me, I don’t give a bat’s flip about myself, but I need to make sure I don’t hurt you or anyone else for that matter. It’s a weakness, I know.” Stone released her and stood up from the table. He glanced at the sky then shot his steel blue gaze down straight into her soul. “But I don’t care. I’m going to fight for us. I’m going to make you understand that we’ve something special here.Emma wasn’t certain how to respond. “Your therapist?”Stone paused his nervous movements and stared at her. “I can’t promise I won’t hurt you. I’m not good at caring. But I can guarantee you there’s no one else in my bed...or in my heart. You’re it. I’ve crossed the finish line. I’m done running.”Picking up a handful of seeds that dripped with stringy pulp, she turned and ignored the don’t-you-dare look that crossed Stone’s eyes. Emma stood, cast one last glance at a face she loved dearly, and smeared the soggy mess from his forehead to his chin. He choked, sputtered and grabbed her waist. “Oh no, you don’t,” Emma said, muffling her giggles and snatching another handful of gunk. This time she dropped it down his shirt and watched his face turn deep red as her palm smashed and crushed the wet slop against his skin. “I have weeks of misery to hand you. I can’t believe how stupid I’ve been. I should have just asked.”“Yep, you shoulda.” Stone stood abruptly, swooped her up in his arms and held her tightly against his sodden chest. He grinned, her stomach fluttered with a million feather swipes of hope and desire. Bits of pumpkin clumped in his hair, and he reeked like day old garbage.“You stink.”His chest rumbled, and she couldn’t prevent her answering laughter. “I’m sorry,” he finally said, placing a sticky kiss on her cheek and nuzzling her neck. She didn’t care. It felt wonderful and delicious.“You need a shower.”Stone paused, the smile slipping from his face. He held her gaze, his eyes burning with emotion. “Not without you.” His words challenged, taunting her to turn her back…retreat into indifference. Replay all their past dances.“Then I’m glad you’re staying in your suite.” She watched the cloud of doubt snake across his eyes, and smiled a sly grin. “My bathroom is way too small for us.”His arms relaxed, and she slid slowly to the ground feeling every inch of his tight body. Stone wrapped his hands within her hair, pulling her face roughly to his. A harsh whisper caressed her ears. “You try my patience.” His lips locked on her mouth, and the world disappeared, tumbling into a vacuum of white clouds and hot breath.When he released her, Emma grabbed his arm to steady herself. Her knees trembled. But she didn’t care. This man knocked her world upside down and that’s all that mattered. “Time for that shower?” she said, walking backward and raising her eyebrows.“You betcha.” He lunged for her, and she ran laughing across the yard, making a bee-line for his suite. With a quick mental tally, Emma knew that Sunday meant pizza night for the resort guests. Her responsibilities were done for the day. *** Emma slipped through the French doors and stopped. Inhaling the pure masculine scent of Stone’s suite, she realized with a start it belonged to him. She’d always held out for the time when she’d be able to reclaim these rooms. Now, all she wanted involved the man standing behind her.“What?” he said. His voice hitched, as if he were afraid she’d change her mind.“I…” Emma turned then frowned. The look on his face silenced the rest of her words. “What’s the matter?”His eyes glistened brightly in the late afternoon light and a muscle twitched above his left cheek. “You’re so beautiful.” Stone’s voice remained soft, but his intentions were clear.“Wow, you had me scared for moment.” She swore if she weren’t attempting to control her legs, her knees would knock together.“Scared?” He walked past her and flipped on the bathroom light. “Yes, I think you should be scared.” Stopping beyond the door, he turned and held his hand out to her. “There’s no turning back now O’Malley…you’re mine.” Everything inside her melted then curled into a tight ball of desire. Her mind couldn’t keep up with her heart. Emotions hot and fast poured through her nerves, sparking and flaring a passionate storm that blanketed all doubts, all reserve.Her lips curved, and she tilted her head. Slipping the jean jacket off her shoulders, Emma allowed it to fall to her feet. With quick precise moves, she removed her shoes and socks then allowed her fingers to lazily unbutton the flannel shirt she wore. Stone’s hand dropped to his side, and he gazed intently into her face.Discarding the shirt, Emma slipped out of her jeans. Stone’s nostrils flared and he leaned against the doorjamb, crossing his arms. The heat lighting his eyes spurred her pulse into rapid fire.She rested her right hand between her breasts and slowly released her bra clasp. He inhaled sharply as satin lace glided to the floor. Emma walked forward, stepping into his arms with the grace of an eagle returning home. His hands grazed her skin, hot, insistent, possessive. Her arms snaked up, twining around his neck. “I’m not scared anymore.”“I am.” Stone dropped his head and laced a trail of fiery kisses from her neck to her shoulder. His hands burned paths of liquid fire as he raked his fingers across her back. He lightly traced the fading bruises that scattered her left shoulder, placing a circle of tender kisses over the yellowed patches.The piercing sound of a ringing phone stilled them both.“If you dare answer that,” he threatened. “I’ll toss you back in the lake.”She shook her head, standing on tiptoes and whispered in his ear. “Promise you won’t regret this.”“Woman, that’s a promise easy to keep.” Yanking her through the door, he slammed it shut, closing out the incessant trill.Emma laughed as he tossed his shirt on the floor, leaving him bare-chested and clad only in jeans. Her eyes followed the cluster of tight curls that surrounded his nipples then drew together in a thin line, dipping down beyond his waistband. She reached out and snapped open his top button.Her hand shook, and she swore if she inhaled her chest would explode. She’d never wanted a man like the one that stood before her. Steel blue eyes burned bright and hot, expecting…demanding. He cocked his head and winked.Stone padded to the shower and turned it on. He glanced at her sheepishly. “You’re gonna have to wait one more second before I perform the duties you so eloquently demanded. I’m a bit sticky.”She slipped out of her panties and stepped beneath the steaming water. “I’ll scrub.”“Emma, you’re killin’ me.” He discarded his jeans and this time she inhaled sharply.“I think I’m scared again.”He leaned forward, snaking his hand behind her head and bringing his lips down onto hers for a tender kiss. “Too late, sugar.” He said softly, running his tongue gently against her teeth. “You and I are about to take a long walk down discovery lane.” *** She smelled like jasmine and honey. He couldn’t catch his breath, it hitched and tightened in his chest. Stone figured his heart might break through his skin at any second. Its rapid pounding mirrored the desire slamming around his gut in waves of exquisite pain, wreaking havoc with his attempts at maintaining an even keel.All his fantasies didn’t come close to the beauty of Emma standing beneath streaming water. His finger followed a trickle of water as it snaked from her shoulder, between her breasts and past her belly button. She gasped as he touched and searched, feeling her heat, amazed at her response to him.She rubbed her hands lightly across his chest, soaping off the last remnants of pumpkin mash. Each touch sent bolts of desire pounding into his gut. Trying to slow his need, he chuckled at the memory of her anger and its consequences. If all his stupidity met with such pleasurable punishment, then he figured he must be in heaven.“Why are you laughing?”He nibbled her ear. She gasped, her nostrils flaring. “You covered me with pumpkin mash,” he said, his tone rough with want. Stone fought against dragging her up and burying himself mindlessly in her. This experience needed to be special. He touched her lips gently and slipped into the passion without fear or doubt, only love. *** They lay nestled beneath the warmth of his covers. Emma’s head rested upon his shoulder and the peace her closeness afforded twisted Stone’s heart. He didn’t know what to do with this love.“Hungry?” he asked.She snuggled closer, then snaked a slender leg over his, crawling on top. She smelled like him, musky and earthy. He’d stamped every corner of her body with his scent, asserting his ownership. “Yep.” Her lips caressed his skin as she scattered gentle kisses up his neck and nibbled his ear.“I meant for food.” He laughed and seized her mouth, inhaling her passion and answering ten-fold. “If we’re to do this another half dozen times then I need to be energized.”Her stomach rumbled loudly and Emma broke the kiss, smiling wickedly. “I suppose we could take a break for nourishment.”“I’ll be right back.” He slipped from the warmth of his bed and tucked the covers around her. Pulling on his jeans, he padded out of the bedroom and into his living room.An antique roll top desk sat beside the door. A pile of documents caught his eye, and he stopped before leaving the room.He prayed when the time came Emma would choose what her heart demanded and not what she thought she should do. That she would, as his father put it, not seek to fill other people’s needs, ignoring her own.Taking the stack of papers and sliding them into the desk drawer, his fingers outlined the embossed lettering. Slamming the drawer shut, he tried to ignore the fear that seared his skin. He turned his thoughts back to Emma and away from the future. Away from the Contract of Sale.",

      "title": "Chapter 17",
      "content": "Chapter Ten “No.” That single word ripped from Stone’s lips with the savagery of a jagged knife. Emma snuggled closer and murmured comforting words. His head tossed, she soothed, he slept.It’d been like this for the past eight weeks. Each night spent together pulled them closer yet created an ache deep within her soul which grew stronger every moment his nightmares escalated their intensity. And this week’s midnight trips to hell ranked high on Emma’s top ten list of places she’d never want to visit.How do I fix this? Running her palm down his back, she smoothed tense muscles and traced her finger along the multiple scars that decorated his skin in a macabre crossword puzzle. How egotistical of her to believe her love could heal his wounds. It wasn’t that simple. These rivers of black ran with a current she didn’t understand, and it frightened her.A vicious gust of wind slammed into the French doors, rattling the pane and signaling another winter storm. Emma slipped from beneath the covers and tugged Stone’s sweatshirt over her naked body. It dropped just above her knees, and she rubbed her arms in an attempt to draw faded heat from the aged fabric. Shoving her feet into his penguin sized sneakers, she shuffled across the floor.Emma reached the fireplace and stacked a fresh round of kindling and seasoned oak on the grate. No guests, a winter storm, and Stone. She smiled at the thought of a lazy morning tucked tightly within his embrace. Tossing a match onto the kindling, she watched as flames burst into life.“The dress code at River Run this morning is exceedingly provocative.”Emma turned and gazed openly at him. He rested on one elbow, the sheets dropping past his hips, barely covering the promise his eyes held.“Really?”“Can’t say I have no inclination to discover exactly what that ratty sweatshirt’s covering.”“Same thing you’ve been discovering the past two months.”Stone grinned then shook his head slowly. “Every time there’s something new, something wonderful.”Emma’s heart caught. She knew exactly how he felt and wondered, if by a miracle, he might love her even half as much as she loved him. It’d be enough.“Well then, Marco Polo, let’s see what treasures you can find this morning.” Tossing off his shirt and shoes in one quick movement, she dove for the bed.Stone caught her as she landed beneath the covers, pulling her hard against him and devouring her mouth in a hungry kiss. Her mind blurred beneath his passion. A thought flickered then dimmed as his hands touched and caressed, burning against her skin. Is this love or a need to banish the nightmares? *** “No.”This time, Stone’s voice hinged on exasperation. Emma moved swiftly around the kitchen, the rich aroma of fresh brewed coffee wafted from the steaming cup she held between her hands.“People expect it,” she said for the umpteenth time that morning.“Why are you pressing me?” Stone sat behind the counter, an angry flush creeping up his neck. They’d been arguing about the annual holiday party for the past week. He refused to allow Emma to continue a tradition Margaret began more than fifty years ago.“Because, without Margaret, this holiday’s gonna be tough on a lot of people. They need the party to remember her and honor her.”“That’s a bunch of crap and you know it.” Stone pushed off the barstool and strode around the counter. He put her mug on the table, pulling her into a light embrace. “Stop trying to please everyone else and look to your own needs instead.”“I am, Stone.”“No. You’ve decided this is some twisted sense of duty. I won’t allow it. Emma, you need to start taking what you want and send the rest of the world packing.”“I want this.” She knew this battle was lost but tried one more time. “I really want this.”“Well,” he whispered against her ear. “I don’t.”Resigned to the fact that the annual holiday gala had met its destroyer, she slipped from Stone’s arms. “Fine. I’ve some things to do in the office. I’ll see you later.”Emma didn’t bother to look over her shoulder. She knew he’d be angry. But her inner voice wouldn’t be quiet, and if it demanded release, fireworks would begin within the comforting walls of River Run. And she didn’t want to fight. Actually, she suddenly realized, the past eight weeks she’d done everything in her power to avoid confrontations with Stone.Instead of entering the office, Emma went to her bedroom. Opening the closet, she pulled a hanger from the back recesses. A thick plastic cover hid what hung beneath. Margaret had bought this for Emma in the post-season sales that flooded the boutiques in early January. She’d hoped to wear it at the party this year.Peeling off the plastic, she touched the shimmering gown. Her fingers caressed the rich, velvet green then traced the pearl rimmed bodice and flared sleeves. She remembered Margaret’s face when she’d tried on the dress. She’d called her a fairy princess. An endearment her mother started the day Emma was born, words she remembered with love.Sighing deeply, she hung the dress back in the closet. The deep rumble of the Jeep’s engine signaled Stone’s departure. Emma gave in to impetuousness and grabbed the dress back. Taking off her jeans and sweater, she slipped the heavy fabric over her head adjusting the shoulders so they barely skimmed her skin.She twirled to face the mirror and froze.Stone stood in the doorway. Her heart hammered. She couldn’t contain the embarrassment at being found trying on clothes. Emma silently chastised herself for feeling like a kid being caught with all the cookies.“I’m just seeing if it still fits. I need to clean this closet and give all my old stuff to Goodwill.” Wincing, she knew she rambled.“The tag’s still on the dress.”“Oh? That…silly, it’s just a bargain piece I never should’ve picked up.”He stared at her for a long moment. His face unreadable, making her squirm beneath his icy gaze. Finally, he shrugged and backed out the door. “Whatever. I’m on my way into town to pick up thick stationary.”“What for?”“We can’t have a party without invitations, can we?” *** Stone sped down the gravel drive. He should never have left the Jeep. The vision of Emma dressed in that gown completely unraveled his resolve. He’d gone to her room to demand she cease all topics regarding the holiday bash and instead ended up agreeing to host the stupid event.It wasn’t until that instant when she’d turned, her auburn hair spinning in a soft halo that he realized exactly how deep his feelings ran. She’d quickly become his life, and he found it hard to deny her anything, including the opportunity of wearing a gown that transformed a beautiful woman into a radiant treasure more alluring and breathtaking than King Solomon’s mines. *** Emma sat before the roaring fire, snuggling beneath a thick wool blanket. The tantalizing scent of garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and olives wafted from the kitchen. Her brain whirled in a frantic circle, checking and rechecking all the preparations for tomorrow night’s party.Stone was wonderful. After balking only once at the guest list, he’d buckled down and run every errand she requested. The only oil stain on the event poured from his refusal to permit Nate to attend. He’d made her promise, several times over, that his father wouldn’t be allowed to step foot on River Run. She’d agreed, but not without guilt tugging at the frayed edges of her heart.A frigid blast of air preceded the slamming of the front door. Emma twisted around and smiled as Stone stomped his snowy boots on the large, woven door matt then dumped an armful of packages on the kitchen table. He muttered and cursed beneath his breath, causing her to rise from the couch and explore the situation.“What’s the matter?”“It’s damn cold out there.” He stripped off his fleece lined denim jacket and rubbed his hands together.“Here, let me do that.” Emma gathered his hands and slipped them beneath her shirt. She shivered as their coldness tickled her skin but ignored the sensation and wrapped her arms around his neck. He grinned and pulled her close, seizing her mouth in one of his famous mind-sweeping kisses.A grunt and snuffle around her ankles pulled Emma’s attention away from the path her ever-present, over-heated hormones were taking her. Glancing down, she smiled at Pocahontas.“What’s she doing in here?”“It’s too cold in the barn. I’ve shut all the doors and battened the stall windows, but it’s still too cold for her. I found her shivering in her pen.”That frightened Emma. Normally, Pokey weathered the winter fine. She knelt and stroked the pig’s head and neck. Everything seemed okay-clear eyes, perky ears, same disgusting slobber decorating her nose.“I’ll make a bed for her in the laundry room.” Emma stood and kissed Stone passionately. “Thank you.”His face suddenly flushed bright pink. “You’re welcome.”He stepped over the pig and went directly to the bar. “I think I’ll have a glass of wine. Care for one?”“Need you ask? Dinner’s almost done. I’ll tuck in Pokey then we can review the final checklist for the party.”“I’d rather not.” Stone’s tone sounded strained, and she turned to look at him carefully. There were tight lines around his mouth detailing a strong running emotion floating beneath his carefully masked reserve. “What’s up?”“We need to talk.”“That sounds ominous.”His lips curved up in a half smile. “Not nearly as ominous as Porkahontas’s mean streak.”“Don’t joke. What’s wrong?”“Nothing that can’t be dealt with.” He turned away, preventing her from reading what flashed in his eyes. “Go put Porkie to bed.”“Okay,” she said softly, her insides shredding into tiny shards of hot fire. This was it. He couldn’t handle her or her demands any longer. The party must’ve tipped the scales, forced him back into the hole he loved to bury himself within.He’s going to leave.Thoughts of River Run without Stone dominated her mind. She absently laid a comforter on the floor of the laundry room for Pocahontas then tossed an old pillow and blanket next to it. The pig grunted, snuggled into the downy pile and closed her eyes with a soft sigh of appreciation. Emma knelt next to her, covering her up and rubbing a hand along her side.“What am I to do?”Pokey didn’t answer. Emma stood and decided she’d better face the beast or else a serious bout of brooding threatened to erupt. Leaving the solace of her old friend, she stopped in the kitchen to check the status of dinner. The roast steamed and she pulled it out of the oven to allow it to finish the final stages of cooking.She could feel Stone hovering behind her.“Here’s your wine.”“Thanks,” she said, turning to accept the glass.Their eyes connected and a shiver ran through her entire system. He reached a hand across the slick granite surface separating them, and she reached back. Their fingers twined. He tugged her toward him, their bodies bent over the countertop placing their faces less than an inch apart.“I need you,” he said hoarsely.Her breath hitched. She suddenly understood the heart-in-throat analogy because words wouldn’t come. Emma felt tears burn the back of her eyes and blinked them away. “Are…are you leaving?” she finally managed to blurt out. His intense eyes floated with all sorts of emotions that were impossible to label.“Someday.” Stone leaned closer, kissing her gently. “But not today.” He kissed her once more. “And when I go,” his tongue flicked out, teasing her mouth open. She inhaled his scent, welcoming the sweet invasion. “I hope I won’t be alone.”Emma swallowed then broke the kiss, banking the desire curled deep within her core. “What are you saying Stone?”She slipped her hand from his and walked around the counter to stand before him. He gazed down into her face, stroking her cheek with his knuckle.“I don’t know what I’m saying. But I know what I’m feeling.”“What’s that?” her heart paused, waiting, praying for three little words that would release the killing grip on her soul.“Like someone crawling out of the devil’s hole and grasping the wing of an angel. And you’re that angel, Emma. You’re my ticket back to life.”She didn’t try to stop the tears that welled then fell in a hot stream down her cheek. It wasn’t a declaration of love, but it rang true enough for her.“I love you, Stone.” Her heart stopped, and she couldn’t meet his eyes. Glancing beyond him, she focused on the milky-white moon cresting the jagged peaks of the Tetons. It cast a soft blue glow on the snow-capped ridge, sending waving fingers of shadowed light down toward the valley. She kept waiting for the cold touch of that ethereal hand to enter River Run and squeeze her soul into nothingness, to kill her hope.She felt his touch instead.A tentative stroke on her cheek, then a stronger pressure forcing her to look into his eyes. The light in the room shrank beneath the darkened evening, and she cursed her thoughtlessness at not switching on any lamps. She couldn’t read his face. “We’ve a lot to work through, Emma. That’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.”This is his response to my soul bearing declaration? She was stunned. “Such as?” Disappointment caused a harsh edge to her words. Emma retreated from Stone’s touch and slipped around him. She flipped on low wattage lamps and lit a myriad of candles scattered around the kitchen and living room.A fire crackled warmly in the hearth. Stone sighed in exasperation and strode over to stoke the burning logs, coaxing the flames higher before he added more seasoned wood. “This isn’t easy for me,” he said.“What isn’t? Obviously, you hold the upper hand because I’ve no clue what’s eating at you.” He stepped away from the hearth and turned a cold gaze in her direction.“No clue?”“No.” She swallowed past the lump in her throat and stood her ground.“I feel your touch on my skin every night. Calming, soothing, attempting to erase my nightmares. Until I’m able to forget the past, Emma, I don’t see how I can have a future.”The pieces of the puzzle were beginning to come together. She stepped toward him. He wasn’t rejecting her, he was rejecting himself. “You’ll never be able to forget, Stone. It’s not possible. What you have to do is remember…not just the pain, but the happiness as well. In time, the bad does fade and the days become greater between sadness. Each year,” she touched his arm and forced his attention. “I welcome January 1st not because it’s a new year but because it marks more time between the day my heart died and the present.” She shrugged. “It helps. Maybe, if you tell me about it and release some of that guilt…that might help, too.”“I can’t. It’s classified.” He turned away from her and stared into the flickering flames. “I can tell you I killed my men. I led them into an ambush, and they were massacred. Every last one of them…except for me.”He ran his hand over his chin as if looking for the beard he’d shaved away in summer. He’d used it as cover, Emma thought. Hiding from a face he didn’t want to see. “Stone?”He turned, his eyes tortured with memories she could only guess at.“Tell me about the men that died that day. I want to know their names, where they came from, who they were.”“Who they were?” He shook his head in disgust. “They were damn fine soldiers.”She smiled. “The best of the best?”“You betcha. Our team incorporated the highest trained, most lethal squad of Rangers.”She nodded and walked to his side. Placing her hand in his, she stroked his fingers gently. He responded by pulling her close and kissing the top of her head.“It seems to me that a team as deadly as your Ranger squad should certainly have all the right qualifications to think independently under adverse conditions.”“Of course,” he said, his muscles tightening in defense.“Then would you please explain to me why you feel that you’re the only one responsible for the death of this highly trained, elite squad of soldiers?”“I…”“Did you have all the pertinent facts for this mission?” Emma persisted; not giving him a chance to retreat from what she prayed was an attack in the right direction.“I can’t answer that.”“Did you knowingly waltz into enemy territory with the prime objective of obliterating your squad?” Harsh words, harsh reality.“Of course not.”“Did you fire a bullet into the heads of your men?”“Damn, Emma…you know I’d never do something like that.” He hissed the words, narrowing his eyes in defense.“Yes,” she said softly. “I know. Just like I know you’d never willingly endanger anyone. Mistakes, bad judgment of superior officers, poor information, whatever it was, I know in my heart and in my mind, that it wasn’t you. You didn’t kill your men. Circumstances did.” She scrutinized his face. The muscle above his right cheekbone twitched, and his eyes glistened with unshed tears. “Circumstances beyond your control.”He gathered her tightly against his chest. She inhaled his scent, wrapped her arms around his neck and ran her fingers through his hair. Stone held on, she could feel the heat of his tears against her hair and knew her own stream of sorrow dampened his neck.Emma didn’t know how to bridge his hurt, how to heal his wounds. If he couldn’t move forward, beyond this well of grief, then she agreed with him. They didn’t have a future. She wouldn’t accept anything less than love from Stone Connor. And if he didn’t love himself, he’d never learn to love her. Because she loved him with a greater passion than the majestic sweep of the Grand Tetons, and she knew that over time, he’d resent that. His back would turn and he’d leave…away from her, away from love.He released her, cleared his throat and moved quickly past her into the dark recesses of his suite. Emma let him go. Sinking into the sofa, she buried her face in her hands and wept. *** The house closed in around Stone. He tugged on his boots and thick woolen sweater, exiting through the French doors. Pausing on his deck, he stared into the night allowing the bitter cold to numb his face and freeze his turbulent emotions.The full moon cast a ghostly sheen on the meadow. Quaking aspens shivered and rubbed their branches together in an eerie symphony. A pack of coyotes howled, and he watched their shadows race across a distant field. His breath caught when he realized the beauty of the surroundings were seeping into his soul, soothing, calming, warming.She’d done this.Emma brought light into his darkness, laughter into his sorrow.I love you.Her whispered words caressed his tortured mind. Did she? Or in some twisted sense of need, were her emotions clinging to him for safety and security?Seamus Adams. They’d been unsuccessful at cramping his campaign and the last conversation with Lazarus, his government inside man, confirmed the Irishman’s frontal assault against all remaining factions of Hugh Gallagher’s organization. Unsettling reports of deadly elimination tactics troubled Stone.He knew what needed to be done.A trip back to hell needed to be made, a quest of freedom…for Emma, for himself.His resolve reaffirmed, he entered the suite. Tossing his sweater on the edge of the bed, he strode to the phone and dialed a number burned into his memory decades ago.A computer voice requested his identification. He gave it and waited while internal security granted access and connected him with Lazarus.“Stone, my man, I’ve been waiting for your call.” A deep gruff voice rumbled through the phone line. If he’d never met Lazarus, Stone could imagine a large, bear of a man sitting behind a desk. But, he’d be wrong. Lazarus more than likely paced the room in short ferret strides, indigenous to his slight physique. His slender form, however, carried an intelligence trusted by men as high as the President.“What’cha got?”“This is tricky. You sure you want in?”“Yeah.”“You know it comes with a price.”“Whatever.”“Stone, you’ll have to go in one more time. Do you understand?”“Yes, dammit. I understand.”A deep sigh reached his ears, and he could almost imagine Lazarus tapping a pencil against his desk. “Can you handle another trip into those jungles?”“I’ll do what I have to do.”“Okay. I’ll arrange it. But Stone…” Lazarus paused, and for a second Stone thought a denial was eminent. “She’d better be worth it.”“She is,” he said and hung up the phone.The pieces were on the board. It was time to start playing the game.",

      "content": "Chapter Eleven “Where were you last night?”Emma looked up from the computer. Stone appeared rumpled and haggard, the bags beneath his eyes a deep purple.“I thought we needed some space.” Her heart hurt. Maybe it’d be better to end things now, before either of them became more emotionally involved.“I don’t need space.” He leaned his hip on the edge of the desk and bent to peer intently into her face. “I need you.”“I need space.”“It’s like that is it?”“Yes, it’s like that.” Her voice dropped to a mere whisper, and she battled against her blurring vision. Turning her attention back to the final checklist that brightened her computer screen, she ignored Stone and the tears that wanted to spill.“Look who’s running now.” He stood, shook his head and left the office, his words hanging in the air. Emma wanted to run. She wanted to race into his arms, have him tell her everything would be fine, have him tell her he loved her. Have him tell her anything but the self-damning pain he’d shared last night.She’d been through this before. Guilt over surviving that tarred a soul until it remained encased in a walking coffin. Breathing, talking but not living. Nate Connor did that. She’d witnessed his hatred, listened to him spew about the unjust, watched as he escaped into the depths of whiskey hell.Too drunk to care, not drunk enough to forget.Well, she wasn’t drunk. She wasn’t willing to waste her life being dragged into a pit full of self-loathing. Emma inhaled sharply. Her thoughts were taking her away from Stone, away from his love. She closed her eyes and rested the back of her head on the chair.Stone and Nate were closer in personality than either one of them wanted to admit. Maybe they needed to face each other, face their demons together.This refusal by Stone to admit his father to River Run itched at her more irritatingly than an angry rash.With a resolve she wasn’t at all comfortable with Emma picked up the phone and called Nate. *** The doorbell rang and both Emma and Stone raced to answer it.“Expecting someone?” she challenged.“This is my home,” he retaliated.“Your home?” Emma bit down on her next words, knowing they’d only exasperate the situation.He tilted his head and challenged her with a raised brow. “I own it.”“For how long?”Stone stepped back as if her words were a physical slap. “For as long as I deem necessary.”Deciding to end this line of discussion, Emma switched the subject. “You’ve never answered the door before.”“I guess I always figured you’d be here. Now, well, now I’m not so certain.”She glared at him, once more drowning the words she really wanted to say. “It’s probably only a delivery for the party tonight. Don’t waste your valuable self-hatred time on worrying about River Run.”He stared at her a moment then shook his head. “You win.” Stone backed off and allowed her to open the front door. She hated this bickering.“What’s he doing here?” Stone pushed her out of the way and ripped the door wide open to reveal an astonished Nate.“I was invited,” the elder Connor insisted.“By who?”“Emma.”Stone’s shocked expression lanced her heart. She knew immediately the grave mistake she’d made. “I thought maybe you two could talk.” Why did she call Nate? Everything about this screamed meddling and lack of support. She desperately wanted this rift to mend, but the look in Stone’s eyes told her this wasn’t the way to accomplish it.Stone covered his hurt with the steely gaze he’d worn the first few weeks at River Run. “When and if I ever choose to talk to my father, it’ll be done on my terms and my decision. You’ve no right.”“I know,” she admitted. “I’m sorry, I made a mistake.” Emma turned and faced another Connor with the same blue eyes and same hurt expression. She’d managed to pour a gallon of salt into this family’s open wound. “Please go Nate. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have called.”He nodded and retreated down the stairs. Emma bit back her tears. She loved him, the broken man who’d nursed her childish wounds and helped her face life with a stiff upper lip.But the man standing angrily behind her consumed her heart, owned her soul. She’d never be free of him, never.“What games are you playing, Emma?”She sighed. “I don’t know.” She turned and walked past Stone, heading back to her little corner of the estate. She didn’t want to fight. “It was poor judgment.”“Don’t walk away from me.” His tone stopped her, the anger clearly audible.“I’m sorry. In my own way, I was trying to help.”He reached her side in two strides, taking hold of her shoulders and spinning her around. She didn’t want to look, didn’t want to see the hurt her actions created.“What’re you sorry for? Dammit, look at me. What’re you sorry for?”She glanced up; the pain in his face forced the tears burning her eyes to fall and snake a hot path down her cheek. “I shouldn’t have called Nate. It’s just you’re both in a bad place, such a bad place, I thought that maybe you’d be able to help one another.”“My father belongs in hell and nothing you will ever do or say will change my feelings regarding that matter.”“That’s harsh. He’s not an evil man.”Stone shook his head. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. And right now I don’t particularly feel like sharing. Remember this and remember it well, that man isn’t to step foot on my property. Ever.”She swallowed and nodded. It didn’t take a degree in psychology to realize she couldn’t fix this problem, for either of them.“He’s not to have any part of what’s mine.”“Okay, I understand.”“That means you.”She felt sick. “Please don’t ask me to choose.”“Would I lose?” Stone stared at her, his words brittle and harsh in the silence of their surroundings. The pale rim around his mouth signaling the amount of emotion he held in check. Emma resisted the urge to lean forward, to brush away the stray lock of hair that highlighted his furious gaze.“Yes.” Her voice caught, tears strangling her ability to speak. Every inch of her body hurt as pieces of her heart crumpled and fell away.Emma pulled away from Stone and walked to her room. She stood in the doorway, attempting to process all the convoluted feelings tying her insides into knots. She felt rather than heard Stone’s presence behind her. His arms reached around her waist, pulling her back against his chest.Closing her eyes, her heart pounded loud enough to be heard on the other side of the Rockies. She turned within his embrace and rested her cheek against his chest.“I’m so sorry.” Her words were muffled as she buried her face in his shirt. He smelled wonderful and she wanted to stay here, within his arms, forever.“Hush, I know you are. Don’t cry.” He ran his hands up and down her back and whispered sweetly in her ear.“I can’t fix you.”“I don’t want you to.”“You can’t love me.”His hands paused, and he pulled back. Knuckling her chin, he forced her to look into his eyes. “Why do you say that?”“Because if you don’t love yourself, how can you love someone else? You’ll end up hating me, hating my love.”He grinned and shook his head. Bending down, his lips touched hers lightly. “I couldn’t ever hate you.” He deepened the kiss, running his tongue along her teeth then searching deeper. She melted into him, taking all he offered. Stone pulled her tightly against him, devouring her mouth, sparking an inferno of desire.“I’m so confused,” she said, when he allowed her a chance for air.“No more talk.” He pulled her shirt up and tugged it over her head. She gasped as cool air tickled her skin, causing goosebumps to sprinkle up her arms. Grinning, he snapped open the button to her jeans and slowly slid the zipper down. Emma closed her eyes and languished within the feel of his touch. His palm caressed her as he pushed her jeans down. In an instant she was naked, standing before him, ready and wanting. He stepped forward and laid her gently on the bed, wiping away her doubts as his head bent to kiss her tenderly. *** Emma listened to the commotion taking place in the kitchen. She snuggled closer to Stone, hesitant to break the tentative bond they’d put back in place.“Don’t you need to go direct or something?”“Probably,” she said. “But I’d much prefer to stay here and play with you.”His chest rumbled with laughter, and he pulled her closer. “I told you this party was a bad idea.”“Right now, I’d have to agree with you.”“Wow, I must’ve been extra good this time around.” He stroked her back and kissed the top of her head. She glanced up and smiled at the light in his eyes. She never wanted to see that steely look again.A knock on the door signaled an end to their privacy. “Stone?” Tilly’s muffled voice could be heard over the raucous activity of the kitchen.“We’ve been caught,” he said to Emma, making her giggle. He sighed and yelled back. “Yeah?”“Um, there’s a man here to see you. I think he said his name was Lazarus or something like that.”Emma felt every muscle in his body tense. His expression darkened and he pulled away both emotionally and physically. “Show him to the dining room. I’ll be right there.”“Okay, boss.”“Who’s Lazarus?” Emma asked, wanting to know the person responsible for his personality reversal.“He’s helping me with that little investigation we started in July.”“Adams?”“That’d be the scumbag.”Emma scrambled out of bed, tugging on her jeans and looking frantically for her bra. “Hold on, I want to come with you.”Stone paused at the door and shook his head. “He won’t meet with you, honey. I need to see him alone.”“But this is all about me. Why wouldn’t he want to meet with me?” Emma frowned.“Trust me, okay?” Stone strode back and planted a kiss on her lips. “Go boss Tilly around.”“But…”He silenced her with another kiss. “Please?”“Okay,” she agreed. “But I want a full report when you’re done.”Stone waved at her, and tossed her a crumpled piece of satin he’d retrieved from his pocket. She caught the object and blinked when she opened her palm to find her missing bra. “I’m not even gonna ask…”“I’d planned on using it to make sure you changed in my rooms this evening.”“I have other bras.”“I know. They’re all in my suite. This was your last one in here.”She smiled and shook her head. “All you have to do is ask.”He leaned against the jamb and stared hard into her eyes. “I’m asking.”“I’ll warm your bed tonight, Stone Connor.”“What about after tonight?”Emma smiled, knowing her heart shone brightly from her eyes. “For as long as you want me.”He nodded. “That’d be forever then,” he said softly, his words barely audible. With a wink and grin, he left her standing alone, his promise wrapping around her heart. *** Stone strode into the dining room, closing the sliding glass partition behind him. Lazarus paced in front of the floor to ceiling windows, ignoring the scenic vistas stretched beyond the paned glass.“Hey, Rex. I’m honored by this personal visit.”Rex Lazarus paused his incessant movement and glanced at Stone, shaking his head. “Don’t be. You’re not going to like anything I have to tell you.”“No how are you? I’ve missed you?”The sly grin that crept upon his best friend’s face warmed another area of Stone’s heart he’d doubted still existed.“You look good, buddy.”“Yeah, well I’m feeling better every day.” A sudden pang of regret pricked his chest. He never should’ve blamed Rex for the last mission or cut him out of his life. This man was like a brother to him. And he’d just proved it. One call and Rex Lazarus delivered.Laughing softly, Stone signaled for Rex to take a seat. He hadn’t changed a bit in the year since Stone left the military, still immaculately dressed, salt and pepper hair shaved short, and a piercing gaze that allowed no mistake as to his seriousness.“I’m glad you called, for my sake at least.” Rex said a little sheepish smile playing around his lips.“Me too.” Stone admitted. That’s enough of that junk, he decided and pulled a chair away from the table and sat down.Rex also sat and tossed a file and package of documents across the table.Time for business.Stone opened them and read the contents, glancing up only once when a name caught his attention.“He’s still alive?”“As far as we can tell.”Stone nodded. “Is it Kabila’s faction?”“Yes,” Rex said. He leaned forward and spread out several papers that when connected displayed a map of the Congo-Uganda border. “Adams contacted the ALiR five years ago when the US-UK alliance began supporting the Rwanda government. He sent funding to the Laurent Kibala regime in the Congo for training, arms, and supplies of ALiR. In return, ALiR provided jails for the bodies Seamus Adams no longer wanted around.”“ALiR,” Stone allowed the name to roll around his mind for a moment. “Army for the Liberation of Rwanda. My favorite jungle jerks. Why would Adams expose himself like this? Why not just dispose of the men permanently.”“Who understands the inner workings of a mad man? My guess would be that they were still politically powerful and might become useful in the future.”“Hugh Gallagher?”“He’s there. Kuffuor’s got him.”Stone felt a cold wash of hatred run through his veins. Asense Kuffuor ran the group of Rwandan terrorists responsible for the massacre of his men. “I see.” He pinched the bridge of his brow in an attempt to hold off the impending headache. “This all seems a bit contrived to me.”Rex lifted his brows and grinned. “That’s because it is. Hugh Gallagher arrived in Kuffuor’s camp two weeks ago. Me thinks Mr. Adams has done his homework.”Stone nodded. “He’s picked the wrong man to bait.”“Honestly, I don’t think he expects you to go after Kuffuor. Apparently, when Laurent Kabila died in 2001, Kuffuor stepped into his place. He’s more powerful now than on your last little visit to the jungle. I believe Adams moved Gallagher there to keep him away from you.”“How long will it take for you set this operation up?”“About eight weeks. Are you sure about this?”“Positive.” The burning sensation in his gut screamed loudly against returning to the Congo. The screams of dying men intertwined with high-pitched squeals of monkeys disturbed by gunfire sang to him every night in an orchestra of horror. “But there’s a condition.”“Other than rescuing Gallagher?”“Adams needs to go down.”Rex stared long and hard at Stone. “We’ll find a way of publicizing his connection with the IRA and ALiR. That’ll be enough to damage his political career.”Stone shook his head. “No. He needs to be taken out.”Rex sucked in a deep breath. “He’s a huge political figure in Northern Ireland. How do you propose we accomplish that?”“I don’t care.” Stone stared hard at his old friend. “You know he won’t stop until he’s exacted his revenge…on Emily, on River Run. Whatever he chooses. This will all be gone.” He inhaled a deep breath. “Besides, I’m owed.”Stone knew that the political miscommunication of his mission into the Congo two years ago resulted in the blood bath. It didn’t stave off the guilt, but it allowed him to direct his anger somewhere. If he finally delivered Kuffuor’s head, it’d certainly help heal some old wounds.Rex nodded. Rising from the table, the government front man frowned as snow poured from the sky. “I guess flying out tonight is out of the question.”“Stay,” Stone said. “We’re having a party.”Rex laughed. “A party? Man, I can’t wait to meet the woman who’s finally whipped you into a human being.”Stone smiled then held up a hand in warning. “She’s not to know anything about this.”“Is that wise?”“It’s top secret isn’t it?”“You know what I mean. She should know her father’s still alive.”“No.” Stone stood and moved next to Rex. He towered above him by more than several inches. “What if I fail?”“You won’t,” Rex answered quietly. “Not this time.” *** Stone stood within a quiet alcove, silently watching people arrive and converse with one another. Emma moved among the crowd with the grace of a feline, soothing egos, creating conversation, catching every man’s eye with her dress. He wanted to hide her from everyone.She’d be furious to discover how deeply he’d meddled in her affairs. It hadn’t taken long to trace Clover’s investigations in Ireland. His father had been right, Hugh Gallagher lived. Damn his old man. He hated thinking he’d almost ruined Emma’s life. It made him wonder what other decisions she was making in order to appease him.“You’ve got it bad.” Rex Lazarus said, sidling up to stand beside him.Stone snorted. “What’s that supposed to mean?”“The way you’re staring at the man talking to Emma, it looks like he’s at the top of your hit list.”“He’s my cousin.” Stone bristled as Seth Connor placed a large beefy paw on Emma’s arm. “If you’ll excuse me.” *** Emma watched Stone cross the main living room. Death in his eyes. She smiled nervously, wondering what could make him so angry.“Stone, I’ve been looking for you,” she said, her stomach tightening at the heat in his gaze.He eyed her then turned to the man on her right.“Seth.”“Stone.”Emma’s eyes widened as Stone glared fiercely at the hand Seth had resting on her arm. She’d grown up with Stone’s cousin and loved him like a brother. Seth tossed his head back and laughed loudly, then clapped a glowering Stone on the shoulder.“I didn’t know, man. I’m sorry.” He walked away and began a lively conversation with Tilly.“What on earth…”Stone grabbed her around the waist and held her tightly against his chest. She didn’t know what to say. He dipped his head and assaulted her mouth, demanding surrender, sparking a fiery passion that flushed her face and left her knees trembling. “Stone,” she said, trying to control her breathing. “What’re you doing?”“Marking my territory.” Releasing her, he stepped back, flourished a bow to the gaping guests and exited onto the back deck.A round of light applause began followed by howls of laughter and wolf whistles. Emma couldn’t prevent the mortified blush marring her face. “He doesn’t like parties,” she explained. “I think he’s a bit uptight.” Alexa Connor, Seth’s sister, stood beside her shaking her head.“You’ve done it.”“Done what?” Emma straightened her dress, her hands still shaking from Stone’s assault.“Wrangled the best looking Connor in Jackson Hole. He’s a tough one, our Stone, but when he loves…it’s with all his heart.”“And when he hates,” Emma said softly.Alexa nodded. “He’ll never forgive Nate.”“Why? What happened the year before I arrived?”“No one really knows. All I can say is whatever Stone’s feeling, he’s probably got the right. Nate was a mean SOB, and that’s putting it lightly.”Alexa’s words pulled a few more threads from Emma’s already unraveling heart. Nate needed her, she couldn’t forsake him, but she feared that if things continued the way they were, someday she’d be forced into a choice.Laughter rang from every corner of River Run. Despite her troubled thoughts she smiled, and focused back on the progression of the party. She made certain the buffet was being met be hungry partiers then stepped outside in search of Stone.He leaned against the side of the house, encased in shadows. Emma stepped close, and he opened his arms for her.“I’m sorry,” he said softly, stroking her curls and tracing them down her back.“No need. It’s not every day a woman can claim to be ravished before a houseful of guests.”“I’m no good at socializing.”She laughed. “Now that’s an understatement if ever I heard one.”“Are you mad?”“No. Are you?”“Maybe at the world, but not at you. Never at you.” He tilted her chin up and kissed her lips gently. She leaned into his warmth, deepening the kiss and twining her arms tightly around his neck.Stone pulled her closer, teasing her lips with his tongue. She wished everyone would go home. He’d been right, the party was a bad idea.“I’ve a present for you,” Stone said.“It’s not even Christmas yet.”“Close enough.” He pushed her away a little, then reached into his pocket and handed her a small brown envelope. She frowned and looked at him. “Open it.”Stepping into the light glowing through the French doors, she split the lip of the envelope. A passport fell into her hands, along with a social security card and birth certificate. Emma couldn’t prevent the slight trembling of her fingers as she cracked open the stiff blue booklet to see her name and picture scrawled across the inside.“What’s all this?”“Your freedom.”Tears welled, and she struggled against allowing them to flow. He’d handed her something she never knew she coveted until this very second. Always accepting her fate of being unknown, in hiding, beyond the simple privilege of ever attaining a driver’s license, finding a job, and buying her own home.Somewhere deep inside, Emma must’ve dreamed about this day because a rainbow of happiness flooded her soul, making her lightheaded. “I don’t know what to say.”“Don’t say anything. The look on your face will carry me for a long time.”“How did you know?”“That you didn’t have any of this? It wasn’t too hard to figure out.”“No.” She shook her head, trying to put all her emotions into the right category. “How’d you know to do this? How’d you know I needed these?” She grinned and moved her shoulders suggestively then slipped the treasure into the bodice of her dress. “Safe.”He gathered her close, crushing her treasures between their bodies. “I wanted to show you that you’re a separate entity from River Run, that you’re Emma O’Malley…period. And that this is only a job.”Something about the way he said that sunk a hook of doubt into her heart. What exactly did he mean?Before she could question him, the decking shook and a deep rumble reverberated from the bottom of River Run. A loud explosion filled the air, followed by a blast of searing heat. She felt herself sliding, away from Stone and into a fiery blaze.",

      "content": "Chapter Twelve Stone watched in horror as Emma’s dress caught on the collapsing deck, pulling her away and down into the burning hell below. Gripping the edge of the house, he leaned forward, reaching for her outstretched hand. His feet balancing precariously on the skirting board that wrapped the edge of the house he stretched as far as possible, grabbing her wrist before the planks beneath her feet shattered to the earth in a loud clap of thunder.Eyes wide with fear, she grasped his hand and held tight. He heard Lazarus yelling from the open French doors. Sweat poured from his face and he yanked with all his might, swinging Emma to the right where Rex grabbed at the folds of her tattered dress, reeling her in.“Take Rex’s hand.” He yelled over the din of screaming guests and burning house. Emma nodded, twisted her body toward the French doors and released her grip on his hand. Rex gathered her close and pulled her into the house. Stone gripped the edge of the window frame and inched his way toward the door. Once inside, he wrapped an arm around a disheveled and frightened Emma.He’d almost lost her.His heart thudded against his chest, and for the first time he could remember, his hands trembled uncontrollably. Pulling her tight against his chest, Stone kissed the top of her head.The center of the house sounded like bedlam. With a shaky sigh, he maneuvered them between the confused crowd. With shouted commands, he quickly began orchestrating everyone’s exit from the resort.“I’ll take her,” Seth said, appearing at his side.Reluctantly, he relinquished his hold and allowed his cousin to escort the only person that mattered to him outside. The resort remained in an uproar.He pushed everyone out through the front door, trying to take some sort of head count. Smoke quickly filled the main level, pluming in gray clouds of sinister waves from the basement.Sirens could be heard in the distance, and Stone silently thanked whoever used their sense and called 911. The floor shook beneath his feet and after one last glance around, he hurried from the burning building.Emma sat huddled against a tree. Seth soothed her but it appeared she wouldn’t listen and continued curling tighter into a ball.Stone strode over, yanked her to her feet and stared into her eyes. Fear swam in the emerald depths, and he shook her gently.“Snap out of it, Emma. We’ve a flock of guests who’re cold and scared.” He couldn’t take her desperation, it tore at his soul like nothing he’d ever experienced.“I ca…ca…ca…can’t.”“You’re stronger than this, better than this.”“You do…do…do…don’t understand,” she said, her voice thin and pathetic.“Then explain it to me, baby.”She clutched at his shoulders and pulled him close to her. The fierceness behind her fear burned his face with its intensity. “You could’ve died.”“I…?”“It was Adams, I know it. And I could’ve killed you.”“Hush, sweetheart. You’re not making any sense. I was safe, remember? You were the one about to plummet ten feet onto hard concrete.” She shook her head, and he pulled her tight to his chest. He didn’t have time for this. The fire trucks were pulling up the drive, and he needed to investigate the source of the explosion.“Can’t think. Go help the others,” she said.“I’d rather stay here, but I have to go.”“I know.” Her hand snaked up to caress his cheek. He bent and placed a tender kiss on her forehead. She stood on her tiptoes, twined her arms around his neck and whispered in his ear. “I love you.”He swallowed his throat thick with emotion. With a nod, Stone left her warm embrace and headed into the disorganized fray of human fear and burning house. *** Emma battled back her tears. She watched as Stone moved with panther like grace through the crowd of people, comforting, directing and solving their problems.Only one fire truck had arrived, and the men were busy around the back of the house fighting the fire. In such a remote area of town, it would take time for all the engines to arrive. Until then, she watched Stone organize.It wasn’t long before he’d spread open the barn doors and directed everyone into its interior. She couldn’t move.A high pitched squeal hit the already noisy evening and to her horror Stone raced from the milling crowd and through the front door of the burning house, his head bent against the angry smoke pouring from inside. She ran after him, screaming his name.“Stone,” Emma clutched the edge of the front door, choking on the heavy air. “Stone!”She listened and above the crackling flames that licked up from the basement a muffled grunt and loud curse reached her ears. She ran toward them and smacked hard into a body of unmoving rock.An arm reached out and wrapped around her neck, strangling the air from her throat. She kicked and pulled forward in an attempt to knock the stranger off balance. Gasping, her lungs burning from the smoke, she hoarsely shouted for Stone.“No one to save you now, ducky.” A voice thick with Irish brogue hissed against her ear.“Stone.” She closed her eyes and struggled fiercely. Her vision dimmed, and she fought against the pin pricks of light that preceded oblivion. A loud grunt and sudden release of pressure on her neck forced her forward, staggering toward the front door.Emma’s head connected painfully with the brass door knob. A brutal shove pushed her down, to her knees. She felt a body pass by her. Her eyes stung from the smoke, watering in rivers of frustration. She couldn’t see the perpetrator, but she could feel hands…loving hands, wrap around her and pull her outside where the cool temperatures eased her burning face.“Stone.” She inhaled and exhaled, attempting to figure everything out. “What happened?”“I went inside for Porkie, heard you scream and came running.” Her eyes focused and she looked into his concerned face.“A man attacked me.”“I know. The police are chasing him. He won’t get far.”“Pocahontas?”“Right here.” Stone moved to the side so she could see the pig nervously stomping around. Reaching out, she tickled the snotty snout and sighed when Pocahontas nuzzled her hand.Emma took a moment to think about the past thirty minutes and the fear and panic returned, knotting into a ball that lodged beneath her heart. She’d done this. She’d endangered Stone. His life could’ve been lost today because of her.She sniffed and stood up, ignoring Stone’s protests. Biting her lip, Emma turned and gazed at the man who encompassed her world, held her heart, owned her soul. “You have to go,” she said. Pain struck in ravaging splinters of broken dreams and dead happily-ever-afters. This man, this gorgeous beautiful soul, couldn’t be here. She’d not damage him anymore. He’d faced a lifetime of hurt and pain and deserved a future full of happiness and love.“What’re you talking about?”“Now, Stone, right now. You have to go.” Emma gripped his arms and stared into his face, burning every wonderful inch into her memory.“I’m not going anywhere.”“Yes you are. You can’t stay here. It’s too dangerous.” She dropped her head and leaned against his chest, whispering softly. “I’m too dangerous.”Stone gently tipped her chin up and forced her to meet his gaze. “Yes,” he said with a grin. “You are dangerous.” He bent and placed a tender kiss on her lips. “But I can’t leave, it’s against the rules.” Her smile froze and the warmth his kiss ignited chilled suddenly as her mind absorbed his words.“River Run?”“Yes. But you can leave,” he said, lifting his hand and signaling for Seth. “I want you to go back to Seth’s ranch.”She supposed the fact that Stone’s focus revolved around his property and not her should ease her mind, but it didn’t. It hurt.Emma stumbled after Seth, refusing to look back, fighting against the urge to cling to Stone and never let go. How simple it’d been to forget that River Run wasn’t hers.It was his.As the first floor shot flames and coughed forth piles of smoke, its destruction and potential danger to Stone tugged at her, striking deep wounds. But it shouldn’t have.Climbing into Seth’s truck, Emma stared blankly out the window, ignoring the excited and concerned chatter of Alexa and her brother. As the soft glow of River Run faded into the horizon, a part of her heart, the one that’d only recently come alive, dimmed and sank beneath a crust of anger. *** Stone watched the last of the rescue brigade drive slowly down the gravel road. His shoulders slumped beneath a mountain of concerns and thoughts, he trudged to the front porch. Sitting down next to Lazarus, he gratefully accepted the proffered brandy snifter.“Rescued these from the rubble,” Rex said.“Good thing.” He took a swift gulp of the heady liquor, luxuriating in the slight burn that trailed down his throat and warmed his chest.“What did the fire chief say?”“Most of the damage is to the lower level. It looks structurally sound but an engineer will need to verify it. The sauna was the source of the explosion…some kind of rigged bomb.” He shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I can’t remember all the details but the guy the police rounded up has a lot to own up for.”“Adam’s lacky?”“Probably, but it’ll be hard to prove.” Stone swigged the rest of his brandy and looked at Rex. “We need to move up the operation. Obviously, Seamus Adams wants Emma gone. I’d really hoped to avoid this. I can’t believe he’s willing to risk exposure in order to silence her. There’s got to be more to this than what we’re seeing,” Stone said.Lazarus refilled Stone’s glass, topping his own off as well. “Emma is the only witness left who saw the true Seamus Adams. The murderer and gangster before the polished politician surfaced. If she went to Ireland and testified, his entire career would be finished, he’d be destroyed.”Stone shook his head slowly. “There’s more, I just know it. Something doesn’t feel right. Why now? Why find her now?”“She slipped up.”“How? Emma’s been hiding here, she rarely goes to town. Before our intervention, the woman had no form of identification whatsoever.”“Clover?” Rex said, with a shrug of his shoulders.“No way.” Stone shook his head and frowned. “I went through all the paper work, and they’d done a damn good job of covering their tracks.”Stone didn’t like the way Rex stared at him. The man appeared to be waiting for something to click, something to make sense.“How do you think Clover knew how to cover its tracks?” Rex asked.“Easy, any two-bit lawyer could…” He stopped when Rex shook his head. Stone thought back to the corporate documents and Clover’s overseas operations. It’d taken him hours of investigation and a good dozen favors to link the company with Ireland. “What aren’t you saying here, Lazarus?”“It ties back to Emma. All reports indicate Adams clearly thought she’d been killed when trying to escape the country after her father was pronounced dead.”“And?”“Nate Connor executed a clean set-up and retrieval.”Stone quirked a brow and glanced sideways at Rex. “My father smuggled her out of the country?”“Yes.”“Why?”“Don’t you know the relationship?”Stone sat back, uncertain whether he wanted to hear this or not. It wouldn’t change his opinion of his father, but it might assist in the rescue of Hugh Gallagher. “No, I’m blind here, so why not flick on the flashlight and enlighten me?”Rex stared at him for a moment, scratched his chin and shrugged. “Hugh Gallagher contracted your father, via Central Intelligence, to assist in unearthing an illegal arms purchase between a rogue US group and the IRA.”“What? Nate’s nothing more than a used up, ex-alcoholic gambler.”Rex shook his head and the steely gaze in the man’s eyes caused an uncomfortable knot in the pit of Stone’s stomach. “What am I missing?”“Your father’s CIA.”A derisive snort escaped Stone’s nose, and he shook his head in denial. “You’re way off base. CIA? Nate Connor can’t even hold a job at the local lumber yard let alone work for the government.”“You think you’re the only Connor with excellent instincts, impeccable firearm ability and the need to protect our country? No way.” Rex shook his head. “You are your father’s son.”Stone stilled. Questions flew through his mind. If this were true, that his father worked for the CIA, then it certainly explained Clover’s ability to remain cloaked. Another thought struck him, which sent a cold chill of fear crackling through his system. If Seamus Adams’ discovered Clover, followed its trail here, came to River Run to investigate, continued to hold Hugh Gallagher hostage, then there’d be no stopping his conviction to eliminate Emma.“Okay, say I believe you. What happened with this arms deal?”“Nate and Hugh went deep undercover. They formed a tight friendship that extended beyond their current assignment. When the mission was finished, Nate visited Hugh in Ireland, helped eliminate several deadly factions of a growing IRA. He’s known Emma since the day she was born.”“How could I miss all this? It’s too much to understand. You’re telling me that my father was some kind of saint to this Irish family then returned home and beat the crap out of me and broke my mother’s heart. Not to mention….” Stone stood up and held his hand out to block Rex’s response. “No. I’m not even going to think of that.” He glared at Rex and pointed an angry finger in his direction. “Why wait until now to tell me all this?”“You weren’t ready.”“Not ready?” Stone ran his fingers through the tangled mess of hair that topped his head. “I’m still not ready. I’ll never be ready. My father was no hero. He’s a drunk, a gambler, and a murderer.”“True on all accounts except the last one.”Stone dismissed Rex’s comment with a shake of his head and a smirk. “This is crazy.”“Yeah, it really is. Hard to believe that one little debt could culminate in such a huge coincidental mess.”“What debt?”“Hugh Gallagher saved your life. Nate owed him.”Stone stood, frozen in place. He barely felt the icy sting of the snow that whipped around his head, nor the bitter breeze that drove it in perpendicular fashion straight into his eyes.“You’ve got your facts wrong. Again. I don’t know any Hugh Gallagher, and I know for certain my father wouldn’t care whether or not I lived or died.”“No? Well how do you explain the long arm of Seamus Adams? How do you explain Emma’s presence here?”He thought about his father. Nate Connor wasn’t a man to take on trouble, in any form. Something must’ve forced his hand, pushed him to raise a parentless teenage girl, but it certainly wasn’t any debt regarding Stone. The memory of facing down a steel barrel convinced him of this.“I can’t explain anything.”“Stone, listen to me. It’s really all black and white. Adams isn’t thinking clearly. He’s shipped off Gallagher because you came too close in your investigation of Clover’s activities. He thinks he’s one up. Feeling cocky, he gives the command to eliminate Emma. And here we stand, in front of a smoky ruined resort. What do you propose to do?”Stone looked straight into the challenging gaze of Rex Lazarus. “Move up the operation.”A tight smile played across Rex’s face and Stone answered it with one of his own. “I’ll see what I can do,” the smaller man said.“Let’s go inside.”“What? In there? Is it safe?”Stone chuckled. “Yeah. We can sleep in Emma’s quarters. They don’t seem to have been affected by the fire.”Rex eyed the resort nervously but followed Stone anyway. “If you say so.”The two men walked through the smoke ravaged rooms. Water stained the walls, floor, and most of the furniture. One glance into his room confirmed that although it was relatively free of damage, the acrid scent permeated the suite, choking the lungs. He closed the door and continued back through the house.Sliding the partition away that separated Emma’s quarters from the main house, he inhaled the fresh air and quickly hustled Rex through before the stagnating smoke filtered into these small rooms.“This is where Emma lives?” Rex asked, obviously amazed at the postage sized rooms.“Yeah, when she’s not in my rooms. But that only happens when I’m a jerk.”“Which would be always then?”Stone glared at Rex, causing the other man to bellow with laughter.“We’re doing okay, considering,” Stone responded.“I never thought I’d see the day the great Stone Connor crumbled beneath the power of a woman.”“For that comment,” Stone opened the office door. “You get to sleep in here.”Rex eyed the room and shook his head. “Where’s the bed?”Grinning from ear to ear, Stone shut the door and entered Emma’s bedroom. He called back over his shoulder, loud enough for Rex to hear. “There isn’t one.” Laughter bubbled up at the muted curses answering him.Sitting on the edge of her bed, he ran a tired hand over his face. It felt as if he’d been tossing all the losing dice, not making any advancement in this cruel game he and Seamus Adams were playing. Inhaling sharply, a sweet jasmine scent tickled his nose, making him ache for Emma.He couldn’t sort out how he felt about his father being CIA. He knew it didn’t change his hatred or his burning desire for revenge. Stone managed to avoid that rather successfully. Revenge didn’t solve any problems. A sudden vision of his men’s faces crossed his mind. This time, they weren’t writhing on the ground in pain, but were laughing as he solidly beat each and every one of them in their ritual one-on-one pre-mission basketball game.He smiled at the memory and suddenly flashes of better times struck his mind in rapid fire. Stone reached back, caressing Emma’s pillow, feeling her presence in every corner of the room. Even without her touch, she healed.Lying down, he rested his head upon her bed and closed his eyes against the tears that burned. He pushed a fist against his heart, pressing hard on the pain.He missed his men. *** Stone stretched then rubbed his face trying to come to a level of consciousness that allowed thought process. Sun streamed through the window, wiping away the remnants of last night’s storm. He sat up and squinted against the bright glare of light on pristine snow. Muted banging could be heard in the background.Realizing he still wore his smoke streaked pants and shirt, Stone stripped, grabbed Emma’s robe from the closet and wrapped it around his waist. He stepped into the hall and stopped short as a startled Rex exited the office.Glaring at the shorter man, Stone silently challenged him to comment on the pink silk fabric. Rex successfully suppressed his grin, at least enough so that Stone didn’t feel the need to send a fist into his gut.“Um, when you’re done doing whatever it is you were about to do, can I have a few moments of your time?” Lazarus asked, his shoulders shaking slightly.“If you laugh, it will be the last thing that comes out of your mouth today. While I take a shower, why not make yourself useful and scrounge up some coffee?”Rex nodded and hurried out the door into the resort’s kitchen. Stone ignored the snort and muffled laughter that filtered back through the partition. Before entering the bathroom, he veered off into the adjacent laundry area and rescued a pair of jeans and flannel shirt from the dryer.Ten minutes later, refreshed and ready to sit down with Rex, Stone emerged into the kitchen. He stopped in surprise as a dozen men traipsed through the upstairs carrying tool boxes, buckets of chemicals and cleaning supplies, and bags of other paraphernalia he didn’t recognize.“What’s going on?”“Apparently, Emma called in the troops. A structural engineer is currently poking and prodding the foundation and these people are from a specialized fire damage control unit.” Rex handed him a cup of coffee and signaled that he should take a seat at one of the kitchen tables.“Where’s Emma?”Rex shrugged. He handed Stone a stack of papers and pointed to their contents. “You need to sign these.”“What are they?”“They’re acknowledgment of your mission and approval to ship a new unit here for training.”“Here?” Stone gulped down several swigs of the black liquid steaming in his mug. “No way. That’ll never do.”“What do you suggest?”“I’ll meet up with everyone at the normal training center.”“You can’t.”“Why not?”“You’ll lose River Run.”Stone sat back in his chair. He didn’t really care about the estate, but he’d already imparted his feelings to Rex regarding the title transfer to Nate. Unacceptable.“What’d the lawyer say?”“If you remain here through the first week of March, he’ll allow you a two week absence to take care of business, but you must return before the first day of Spring.”“Two weeks?”Rex nodded. “Apparently, he’s able to bend the rules enough for that trip as long as you spend the majority of this season here at the resort.”Stone sighed. How was he ever going to explain this to Emma?“When will my unit arrive?”“After the first of the year.”“Mission date?”“March 7.”“No sooner?”“Do you want this resort?” Rex narrowed a look at him, causing Stone to think every aspect through.“No,” he said. “But I’m not giving it to Nate.”“Hugh will survive another two months but will you?”“What’s that supposed to mean?”Rex leaned close. “It means you’re too emotionally involved. Can you train here with the distraction of pretty Miss O’Malley?”“Yes.” Stone pushed away from the table, paused then bent and scribbled his name on the documents scattered across the polished wood. “Bring it on.”The front door flung open and Seth Connor stepped through. Stomping snow from his boots, he pulled off his sheepskin gloves and shrugged out of a heavy denim jacket.“Mornin’ folks. I see everyone’s here just as Emma indicated.”“Where is she?” Stone asked, looking behind his cousin’s back and expecting to find a face his heart ached to see.“Didn’t she call?”“Call? No. I thought she was with you.”Seth looked at his feet and shuffled uncomfortably from foot to foot.“Where is she Seth? Didn’t you take her home last night?”Worry and concern stabbed at Stone’s gut.“Not exactly.”“Tell me where Emma is?”Seth looked up then cast his eyes quickly down. “She wouldn’t come back to the ranch.”“Where’d you take her?” Stone became increasingly angry when Seth wouldn’t look at him. He grabbed the man’s shoulder and shook it.“Tell me.”Seth tossed a desperate glance in his direction, broke free and headed into the living room. He paused, ran a hand through his hair and sighed like the entire world hung on his shoulders.“She’s at your father’s.”",

      "content": "Chapter Thirteen Emma watched the approach of the black Jeep. Her heart hammered in tempo to the vehicle’s headlong push along the bumpy, dirt road.“What’re you doin’?”She turned and looked at Nate, a soft smile creeping upon her face. He’d made breakfast and now busily scrubbed the burnt remnants of scrambled eggs and hash browns from his cast-iron skillet. He looked up at her with brows raised.“Stone’s driving up.”“How close?”“He’s almost here.” She turned back to the window. The Jeep maneuvered around a particularly slick turn and plowed forward, refusing to give an ounce of speed to the deep snowy trenches.“You’d better get your stuff together.”Emma moved away from the paned glass and shook her head. “I’m not going anywhere.”“Yes you are.” He slammed the skillet on the countertop and walked around the kitchen island. “I don’t want trouble with my son. Get your stuff together.”“I…” She couldn’t finish her sentence. Nate’s words stung. She felt lost. Narrowing her eyes, Emma nodded. “Fine. I’m sorry to have caused you any discomfort.” She spun around and gathered the smoky ruins of her evening gown. “I’ll change and leave these sweats in the bathroom.”“Emma…” Nate’s voice trailed after her, but she slammed the door shut, silencing his protests. She couldn’t believe Nate was kicking her out. If anything, she thought he’d be happy to shelter her from Stone.Hearing the Jeep door close with a bang, Emma folded Nate’s sweats in a neat pile and straightened the tattered velvet that hung haphazardly off her shoulders. She stalked out of the bathroom, slipped on her high heels, cast one last glance at Nate and walked out the door into the bitterly cold morning.Stone stood in front of the vehicle, his arms crossed over his chest and thunderbolts of anger crashing from his eyes.“Are you ready to go home?” His voice was calm, but Emma didn’t miss the tightly controlled fury that laced his words.“Yes.” She walked past him and jumped into the passenger seat of the Jeep. Shutting the door securely behind her, he walked behind the vehicle, climbing in next to her. His eyes never once strayed to the figure on the front porch of the cabin.Emma refused to allow her heart to melt at the sight of Nate. His hands were shoved deep into his pockets as he watched them pull away, a weary expression deepening the wrinkles along his brow.He stood alone. A solitary figure framed by an empty house.As the vehicle jostled her, she resisted reaching for Stone’s arm to steady herself, to confirm her existence.She didn’t want to end up like Nate Connor.“What were you thinking?” Stone yanked the wheel to the left and down shifted around a slick ice patch.“You told me to go.”With a violent toss of some extremely creative swear words, he slammed on the brakes and shut the engine off. “So you ran to my father?”“Yes.”“You tell me you love me, and then I discover you went to a place you knew would turn my guts inside out. I don’t understand.”Emma’s anger burned her throat. He’d twisted everything around. “You made it quite clear last night that River Run was your priority. I left to let you to deal with your precious property.”“My precious property?” Stone spit the words at her. “I don’t care about River Run. I wanted you somewhere safe. You looked exhausted.”Emotions rolled in her chest, tangling and tying into snags and snarls of confusion. She’d overreacted. Again. Why did she let him do this to her? Her vulnerability suddenly seemed to loom higher than any obstacle she’d ever had to climb. The thought that he’d come for her. That he’d driven upon land that probably burned his feet like acid to collect her sorry ass meant she was clearly an idiot.She turned from staring at the piles of snow heaped around scarred birch tree trunks and gazed into a face that demanded answers. “Your tone dismissed me.”Stone continued to glare at her, and she noted the slight flush that crept up his neck. “It did not. If I remember correctly, I kissed you right before sending you off with Seth.”“It felt like you dismissed me.” Emma tried to hang tight to her convictions.Replaying last evening in her mind, she couldn’t believe she’d actually asked him to leave. What possessed her? It didn’t matter if a nuclear missile locked on to River Run, Emma craved Stone. He encompassed her soul.He dropped his gaze and banged his head upon his hands wrapped tightly around the steering wheel. “You’re making me crazy, woman.”“Do you want me to leave?”He slanted her a look that almost forced laughter from her chest. She tried not to smile.“No.” Sitting back, he reached over and pulled her roughly into his arms. “What I want is you in my bed.” Without waiting for a response, Stone bent his head and plundered her mouth. His kiss cauterized her hurt, pumped blood into her veins and had her head spinning in wild circles.His hands were hot on her skin. The silence of the Jeep echoed with their gasps of delight and groans of hunger. Emma pulled back. Stone’s blue eyes were dark with passion, and she smiled knowing exactly how to deepen them even further.“I think it’s time to go home.”“Home? To a house full of construction workers?” He pulled her closer, nibbling the sensitive lobe of her ear. It caused shivers of desire to ripple down her neck and pool between her legs. It took a moment for his words to penetrate her lust filled brain.“Construction? Oh dear God, you haven’t left the resort unattended?”Stone shrugged, concentrating on kissing every inch of bare skin from her shoulder to the small hollow of her neck. “Rex is there.”“Stone, stop that. We need to be there. It’s our…” She stopped, shaking her head. “It’s your investment.”“Don’t care.” He grazed his mouth across hers, teasing her lips with his tongue, pouring fire on over sensitive nerves.Emma sighed but pushed away. Her mind filled with visions of hot breath, steamy windows and a Jeep rocking madly on the powdered snow. “This,” she said, “isn’t going to happen.” Pulling her dress back up her shoulders and straightening her hair, she sat primly back in her seat. “I want to go home.”“I was about to take you there.”She tried not to grin at his euphemism but failed. Stone’s eyes twinkled as he turned the key and revved the engine. He drove down the rest of the drive, the softness in his face slowly fading. Emma watched him swallow hard when he swung onto the main road, refusing to look at the dented old mailbox with a hastily scrawled Connor on the side.“I’m sorry.”“For what?”“Making you come here.”He tossed her a look that tugged her heart. “Jose, my second in command, used to have a saying. You create the environment you live in. I never understood it until now.”Emma bit her lip. He’d never spoken about his unit or any of the men that died on his last mission. She didn’t interrupt but nodded for him to continue.“Every damn time,” he said, “I yelled at him for doing something wrong or not being where I expected him to be, he’d shake his head sadly and say those words to me. It used to make me crazy.” He laughed and shook his head. “Jose never took any of my anger seriously.” He frowned and barked out another round of laughter. “In fact, I think he was on some sort of mission to reform me.”“Why? Were you as incorrigible then as you are now?”He smiled and winked at her. “Nah, just an irascible old coot. Jose insisted there was life outside of our little unit, and I told him not for me there wasn’t. But,” Stone shifted gears, and the Jeep sped forward. “I guess he was right after all.”“He’d be proud.” Emma reached over and squeezed his knee.“Yeah,” he said softly. “He’d be damn proud.”She turned her face to the heat of the morning sun. Neither one spoke again. Emma basked in the silence, it sang loudly of their comfort and their closeness. *** Walking amidst the charred ruins of the basement level, she bit back the swell of sadness. After several days of clean up, the upstairs was habitable but this area would take months to put in order. Men dragged water-damaged antique furniture up the stairs and out of the house, hopefully to be saved by the restoration company she’d hired. The burnt feather beds stank like rotten eggs. Puddles pooled in little circles all over the uneven hardwood floor, shimmering with soot.“It’s not too bad,” Stone said from behind her.She turned and tried to hide her grief. “It could’ve been worse.”He traced his finger gently down her cheek. “This will be back to normal before you know it.”“I know. It’s just…” Emma shrugged.“I’ve an idea,” he interrupted. “Why don’t we make a few changes, improve on the old?”“Like what?”“What about a larger weight room, an indoor Jacuzzi, or I know…” He stepped over a pile of burnt rubble and pointed to a partially damaged wall. “Let’s knock down this wall and make a media room. That way when kids are staying here they can use this space as their movie and entertainment area. It’ll save a lot on the wear and tear of the living room.”Emma bit her lip. He had a point. “But we’ll lose a guest suite.”“No we won’t. We’ll expand out, create another suite beneath the new deck.”She smiled, her heart a bit lighter. “Yes, that would work. I’ll begin immediately on a mocked up floor print. When did you say the remodeling company was arriving?”“Day after tomorrow.”“Okay. I can have a rough draft done by then.” Emma’s mind suddenly whirled with ideas. A media room. What a wonderful addition. She turned and hugged Stone fiercely. Standing on her tiptoes, she pulled his head down and whispered in his ear. “I reward for sparks of brilliance.”His chest rumbled, and she nipped his ear. She felt him tense and pull her tighter against his chest. “Let’s kick all these people out. I want to collect.”“Tonight…” Emma kissed him quickly and escaped. She’d tons to do and very little time.Passing Rex in the narrow staircase, she smiled brightly and greeted him. “Good morning. Did you sleep well?”“Merry Christmas.”“What?”“It’s Christmas today, right?” Rex frowned.“Is it?”“December 25th normally means Christmas.”Emma stood with her mouth hanging open. She counted out the days since the party, and Rex was absolutely correct.“Why are all these people working on Christmas?” Oh, this wasn’t right. Not at all.“Maybe they’re Jewish?” Rex offered. She could tell he was trying not to laugh at her and glared at him.“Make them go home.”Turning back around, she led the way into the basement. Stone assisted several men in dismantling one of the four poster beds.“Stone,” she said, tugging on his arm. “It’s Christmas.”“I know, honey.”“Am I the only clueless one here? Tell these men to go home and enjoy the holiday with their family.”“They’re getting double-time. I think for some that means a lot more than Christmas.”Emma shook her head. “No. I won’t have it. Pay them double-time for an entire day but send them home now.”Stone frowned then shrugged. “Okay, you’re the boss.” He turned to the men and began explaining Emma’s instructions. She didn’t wait for their reaction but smiled as cheers reached her ears. Almost to the top of the stairs, another thought crossed her mind.“Rex,” she called back down.“Yes, ma’am.”“Why’re you here?”“Waiting on a shipment.”“Don’t you have family?”He looked up at her and shook his head. “Stone’s about it.”“Well then, make sure you’re properly attired this evening for a full blown Christmas celebration. Once these guys leave, I want you and Stone to hit the woods and bring me back the best Christmas tree you can find.”“Yes, ma’am.” Rex shouted, saluting her.Emma shook her head, swearing to herself. She couldn’t believe she’d not realized it was Christmas. Obviously, the fire had consumed more than the elaborate tree she’d decorated the day after Thanksgiving. It’d fried her brain as well.Turning into the front foyer, Emma heard soft singing coming from the kitchen. Curious, she headed in that direction.She stopped, stunned by the action taking place. Tilly pulled item after item out of about a zillion grocery bags covering the counters. Her normally perfectly coiffed blonde hair was pulled through a scrunchy and piled on top of her head. She had no makeup on, making her look very young and innocent.“What’s going on?”“Well,” Tilly said, wiping her hands on a paper towel after dumping a very large turkey in the sink. “I think I’m preparing Christmas dinner.”“I didn’t ask.”“You didn’t have to.” She held up her hand before Emma could interrupt. “I know I’m not a stellar employee, attitude and all that. But I do love this place, and I suppose that includes you.”“I’m speechless.” Emma couldn’t connect this woman with the nail-sharpening, stiletto-heeled cat who normally appeared for work.“Well Speechless, do you think you could manage a few menial tasks in the way of cooking?”“I believe I could do that, but first how about some music to put us in the mood?”“Oh no,” Tilly raced for the stereo. “You’re not putting on your childhood record of Rudolph.”“Oh yes, I am. Get out of my way, I know Gene Autry’s in here somewhere.”Tilly allowed herself to be pushed aside and went back to the kitchen, muttering beneath her breath. Emma giggled as she popped the album from its cover and placed it on the turn table. She played this every year, and the moment the deep crooning of Gene Autry’s voice hit her ears, she knew…Christmas had arrived. *** Placing the last pie in the oven, Emma surveyed the mess she and Tilly created. It’d been one hurried preparation of turkey and all the trimmings.“Look at what we’ve done,” she said.“Yeah, quite the cooks aren’t we?”“Why don’t you go take a shower and I’ll clean?”“No, it’s okay. I’ll clean this up.”Emma frowned. This flipside to Tilly niggled at her trust cavity. “Really, go use my room and shower up for dinner. I’ll tidy up then find the boys. We should be eating by nine, right?”“Yeah. I’ll change then lay out hors d’oeuvres and cool the champagne.”“Sounds good.” Emma turned and made quick work of the dirty dishes and messy counters.A pair of strong arms circled her waist and she leaned back against Stone’s chest.“Smells yummy in here.” He kissed her head then nuzzled her neck sending shivers of delight down her spine.She turned in his arms and linked her hands behind his neck. “Whatcha up to?”“About to wrangle you a tree. Want to come?”She grinned and nodded. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”They quickly donned heavy jackets and boots. Making their way outside, Stone snagged a saw and tugged at her hand.“Where’re we going?”“Over the back ridge. There’s a great stretch of pines and…” His voice trailed off when he bent his head, but Emma saw a twinkle in his eye and the grin tugging at his mouth made her wonder what was up.The sky mimicked the ground. Heavy white clouds hung low and a light dusting of snow fell gracefully around them. Silence muffled Mother Nature. The snow crunching loudly beneath their footsteps sounded like an invasion. Stone held her hand, and she was content to follow his lead.Crossing the ridge she spotted a trail of smoke rising lazily into the sky. Inhaling the thick pine scent, she broke free of Stone, stretching her arms to the sky and twirling in a circle.“This is wonderful. Do you think those people would mind if we kicked them out of their cabin and stole a few hours of solitude?”Stone raised a brow as she stared into his wind-burnt face. “I don’t think they’ll mind at all. Let’s go.” He grabbed her hand and began running toward the tiny log cabin.“I was kidding,” she said, her breath coming out in thick white plumes.“I’m not.”She pulled back and dug her heels in. “Stone we can’t just barge into someone’s home.”“Yes, we can.”Emma laughed at his craziness. “You’re certifiable. No we can’t.”He pulled her against his chest and bent his head. “Yes, we can,” he said softly against her ear, causing shivers of excitement to stream down her back. His cheeks were cold but she captured the heat of his mouth with her own. The instant fire that burst deep within her soul snatched her breath, leaving her gasping and wanting.“I wish we could.”The passion that sparkled within the deep blue depths of Stone’s gaze hinted at his thoughts. “It’s my cabin.” He swept her up, cradling her within his arms like a baby. “Let’s go christen it.”“Yours?” Emma paused, taking in the surroundings briefly. “Oh right, I’d gotten turned around. This is the old tackle lodge.”“That’s right.”“But I thought we were hunting shrubbery.”Stone shook his head and winked. “I lied.”“Remember what happened the last time you did that?”“Oh yeah,” he said and quickened his pace.Emma laughed, holding on tightly. The lightness in her heart contradicted the weight of her emotions. Love surrounded her, absorbing every inch of her being. It felt wonderful.Kicking the cabin door open, he let her slip from his arms. She stared in wonder. There was a thick blanket in front of the roaring fire laden with wine, fruit, cheese and chocolate. A small gold wrapped box with a red velvet ribbon lay in the center.“Merry Christmas,” Stone said.She turned, tears burning her eyes. “I have nothing…”“Shush,” he reached over and placed a finger over her mouth. “You’re all I need.”“I…” her voice cracked, unable to carry beyond the tightness in her throat.“Love me,” he finished for her. “I know.”All their differences, all their problems disappeared beneath the warmth of his gaze. A future together flared into reality. They’d stay here together forever, raise a family at River Run.Emma smiled and wrapped her arms around his neck. Kissing him tenderly, she allowed the promise of a life bright in love filter from her soul to his.“This is the best Christmas present ever.”“You haven’t even opened it yet.” Stone unhooked her arms and helped her out of her jacket. She shucked her boots and raced to the blanket.Stone followed and sprawled next to her, gathering her around the waist and pulling her snug against his chest. She held the little box tightly, afraid to open it. He flashed her a grin and raised his brows.“Want me to do the honors?”“No,” she said, struggling to a sitting position. “I’ve got it under control.”“I think I’ll have to change that.” He tugged at her shirt and ran warm hands along her skin. She sighed in delight, hastily unwrapping the present.Discarding the bow and paper, she held a small velvet box in her hand. Stone stilled. Emma flipped the lid and gasped as brilliant flashes of green fire glistened in the firelight. A small eagle lay nestled against red satin. Its graceful curves of gold were skimmed with a dazzling line of emeralds. Stone reached around and pulled the pendent from the box, snaking the chain around her neck and fastening it at her nape.“It reminded me of you.”She turned and threw her arms around his neck, knocking him back onto the blanket. “It’s beautiful. I love it.”He captured her kiss and held her tight, the feel of his heart beating wildly against her chest. “When did you say dinner starts?”“Nine.” Emma slipped her shirt off, straddled his hips and slowly unbuttoned Stone’s top. Fire light flickered, casting dancing shadows upon his chest.“Plenty of time.” Stone inhaled sharply as she bent and rolled her tongue around his nipple.He unbuttoned her jeans, easing the zipper down and running his hands across her hips. Smiling into his eyes, she settled her lips against his and whispered into his mouth. “I love you.”She felt Stone’s lips curve upward. He pulled her closer, deepening the kiss.“I see many more years of sneaking out to this cabin,” Emma continued, nibbling at the corner of his mouth.“That, I promise.” Stone answered tugging her jeans the rest of the way down. She helped him discard his clothes and before a lucid thought crossed her mind, his passion painted all the words he didn’t speak out loud. *** Stone clasped her hand beneath the cherry red linen tablecloth. Her stomach stuffed, her heart full.“The resort on St. Thomas was a hoot,” Tilly said. She’d been regaling Rex with tales of her vacation adventures for the better part of the meal.“Tell me more about the hot tub,” Rex encouraged, leaning forward in interest.Hiding a grin, Emma figured that Rex’s Christmas present would be unwrapping Tilly.This new-and-improved-attitude River Run’s chef adopted still bothered her. Tilly never did anything without expecting a huge return. It didn’t make sense. However, in the Christmas spirit, she refused to analyze it too deeply.“I’ve got to write down that resort,” Rex said. “Emma do you have any paper?”At the mention of her name, she refocused on the conversation. “Huh? Paper? Yes, of course I do. I’ll be right back.” Kissing Stone on the forehead, she scooted behind him and decided to grab a pad and pen from his suite. It was closer than the kitchen.She shut the door, closing off Tilly’s squeals of laughter. Okay, the woman was becoming annoying. Flicking on the light switch, she headed for the desk. The drawer wouldn’t open. It must have swelled with all the humidity caused by the water from downstairs. Tugging on the knob, it finally slid out and she stumbled back, spilling the contents on the floor.Emma tucked a pad of paper and pen to the side and began restacking the drawer. She picked up a pile of papers and placed them on the bottom before adding smaller stuff on top. As she rested the calculator on the ivory pages a name caught her attention. Peering closer, she confirmed it was the title of her attorney’s office.Curious, she pulled the papers back out to look at them more closely.Dear Mr. Connor,It is with great pleasure that I enclose a fully executed Contract of Sale for River Run. The closing is scheduled for August 15th, which more than adequately falls within the terms of your Aunt’s Last Will and Testament…The rest of the letter blurred. Emma’s heart stopped beating and her hands shook as she set it aside to peer at the contract. Glancing at the front page, a sum of seven million dollars burned her eyes with the devil’s own fury.“Emma?” Stone called from the dining room. She could hear his chair scrape against the floor and with numb hands, she hastily shoved the documents in the drawer, piled all the other stuff on top and shoved it back into place.“Hey,” Stone opened the bedroom door. “What’s taking so long?”“Nothing,” she said, praying her voice sounded normal. “I just needed to use the bathroom first. Here’s the pad and pen Rex wanted.” She handed everything to Stone and turned to head into his bathroom.“I thought you said you already did that?”“Oh,” she paused and clenched her hands together to stop their trembling. “I forgot to wash my hands.”Frowning, he shrugged. “Okay, but make it snappy. I miss you.” He shut the door, and she heard Rex yell some kind of lewd comment at him which he laughed at and then all sound faded to a harsh buzz as Emma’s world slowly shattered.",

      "content": "Chapter Fourteen Stone eyed the massive peaks of the Grand Tetons. Ever since Christmas, it felt as if Emma had built a wall around her heart rivaling the majestic rocky mountain. She slept in his bed, loved his body, but her heart remained distant.The pendant he’d given her lay nestled within its box. Its legacy never recognized. When he’d visited one of the local Jackson Hole artists and explained the dynamics of his idea, the craftsman accepted the challenge with excitement. For Stone, the eagle represented Emma’s freedom. He’d hoped she would witness within the graceful bird her own beauty and perfection.He wanted her to fly. He prayed she’d no longer fear. Instead, the piece of jewelry remained captive, denied the light and life her warmth would create.He needed to do more.Furrowing his brow and digging deep inside, he knew he’d find the answer. She deserved more from him, more than his rescue of her father, more than River Run.A thought crossed his mind, and he shuddered at the task it demanded.“Stone?” He turned at the sound of Rex’s voice. The sun faded against the snowy backdrop, dropping the living room into a dusky rose and quickly chilling the air.“Yeah?”“I thought you might want to know that your unit will arrive on Monday.”He nodded. “I’ve cleared enough space downstairs for them.”“Are we doing anything tomorrow for New Year’s Eve?”Stone shrugged then walked to the fireplace in disgust. Stacking logs on top of kindling, he flicked a match and watched as it burst into flame. “I haven’t asked Emma. She’s been too busy canceling next year’s reservations.”“How long is River Run out of commission?” Rex came to stand next to him. Stone poked at the fire.“I think she’s cancelled everything up until May.”“Is that why she seems depressed?”Stone glared at his friend. “Don’t you need to be back in Washington?”Rex laughed and shook his head. “I’m here until your men arrive.”“Great.” Stone stepped back from the fire, absently wondering where Emma might be.“You gonna make a life here?” Rex said.He thought carefully before answering. “I thought I might, but I’m not so sure now.”“Why?”“Too much pain. The past, my father…” he paused, running his hands through his hair. “It’s too much.”“What’s too much?” Emma said from the kitchen. He glanced up and smiled. Her hair was windblown, and her cheeks red from being outside. She slipped out of her barn coat and rubbed her hands together.“This weather,” Stone replied. “Does it ever stop snowing?”“Yeah, in July.” She smiled but backed away when he approached. “Chili all right for dinner?”“Fine.” Stone hated her retreat, both physical and emotional. He decided it was another reason to avoid that head long dive into permanent commitment. He was thankful he’d never told her how he felt. If she couldn’t accept a simple pendant, she’d never agree to wear his ring.“Emma?” Rex walked over, interrupting Stone’s thoughts.“Chili not good with you, Rex?”“Oh no, it’s fine. But I’m afraid I’ve something to tell you, and you’re probably not going to like it.”Stone panicked. He attempted to catch Rex’s eye and prevent him from speaking, but the man ignored him.“What?” Emma scooted up on a barstool and waited patiently.Stone closed his eyes. He didn’t want to witness the hurt that he knew would hit her eyes the second Rex opened his mouth.“I’m having a Ranger unit flown in on Monday. They’ll be staying in the basement and training with Stone.”“I see,” she said softly. Stone turned and left the kitchen. He couldn’t face her, didn’t want to know what she might think. Wasn’t it obvious she couldn’t love him? And now, seeing this side of his life, she’d never relinquish control of her heart…no matter how hard he tried.Stone convinced himself it was for the best. It’d never work. At some point she’d want him to make peace with his father. Never, he swore silently. That would never happen. *** Emma moved around the kitchen. A chuck roast steamed on the stove, waiting to be chopped and added to the chili. The aroma of the garlic-seasoned meat drifted in the air. It’d been a shock to learn that Stone reenlisted in the military, but it told her many things.He needed to sell River Run.He was leaving.Tears wanted to flow, but she bit them back. No more crying. She sickened herself with her weakness. Emma O’Malley needed to take control of her life. If it meant living without the man she loved, then that’s what it meant. Stone had given her a gift, and she planned on using it.Pausing, she glanced out the kitchen window. It seemed impossible. The mere thought of walking beyond the gates of River Run with an identity brought nervous flutters to her stomach.She’d do it, though.She sliced the onion, chopping frantically. Straightening her back, Emma vowed to herself that it was her time…her chance at a life. A real life. No running, no hiding, no fear. *** She’d slipped back into her own rooms. The men arrived last night, and Stone didn’t even notice her absence. Morning sun poured through her window, filling her with courage and a hope she barely felt. Emma smiled when she saw the nose of Seth’s truck pull through the gates. She finished gathering everything needed and rushed out of the house.Masculine voices resonated from the basement. Shouts and drills echoed against the sheetrock with an eery chant. Ignoring the shiver up her spine as Stone barked his commands, Emma escaped into the chill embrace of the outside.“Ready?” Alexa said, rolling down her window.“Yeah, I guess so.” Climbing into the truck, she clasped her bag to her chest. The sudden confining space sucked all her courage. “I don’t think I can do this.” Reaching for the handle of the truck, she halted when Alexa grabbed her arm.“Yes you can. You’ve been driving for years around the ranch, this is no different.”“Are you sure?” The thought of having a license frightened and thrilled her at the same time.“Positive. And after the test, we’re going to celebrate.” Alexa paused and made sure Emma was looking at her. “Connor style.”A bubble of laughter reached her lips, and she allowed it to spill over and calm her fried nerves. Margaret always used that term whenever they went on a shopping spree. Yes, she needed to do that. She wanted to celebrate.They drove into town, chattering about local gossip and the stores they intended on visiting. Entering the motor vehicle department, Emma hesitated. A quick shove from Alexa sent her stumbling forward and laying all the required documents out for the clerk.In a whirlwind of computer technology, she’d completed the written exam in less than thirty minutes.After another hour long wait, Emma faced down a stern, don’t-mess-with-me driving instructor. Although her nerves jumped each time he demanded an action, she bit her lip and maneuvered appropriately.Standing once more in line, she pressed her thumb to the finger print pad, smiled for the camera, and walked away clasping a still warm little plastic card in her hand.“You did it,” Alexa said.“Wow.” Emma slumped onto a wooden bench outside motor vehicles and stared at her driver’s license. She looked up at Alexa and grinned. “I want to go to the bank next and open a checking account. Give me your cell phone.” Alexa handed her the tiny silver phone. Emma dialed a number that connected with the investment firm handling her inheritance. They confirmed that a wire transfer of funds could take place immediately. “Let’s go. I think the art of celebrating in the Connor fashion is about to take an entirely new twist.”Alexa grinned. “What’re we waiting for? Let’s go!” *** Emma ran her hand across the hood of her brand new jet-black Ford F250.“I can’t believe you bought a truck,” Alexa said in disgust.“It’s practical, not to mention beautiful. And listen to the purr of that Triton V8 engine.”“You should’ve bought the convertible.”Emma gaped at Alexa. “Like that would get me to the grocery store in winter.”“Woooooweeeeee, look at this pretty baby.” Emma spun around and smiled as one of the young Rangers came loping down the front stoop. She didn’t know his name. Stone hadn’t introduced her to any of the squad.“Hello, I’m Emma O’Malley.”“Yes ma’am, I know. I’ll probably be giving Colonel Connor a hundred push-ups for speakin’ to ya, but I’ve just gotta look at this truck. She’s a beaut.”Emma nodded enthusiastically. Colonel? She thought Stone’s rank was Captain. Shaking away her thoughts, she concentrated on the young soldier. “Want to check out the engine?”“Yes, ma’am.”Running around to the driver’s side, she popped the hood. Alexa stood in the background shaking her head. Emma just tossed her a grin and ignored her irritation. Nate taught her years ago all about working on trucks, and she could swap out brake pads, change the oil, and perform tune-ups with the best of Jackson Hole’s mechanics. It’d been their time together when she was growing up.To own a truck…well, her heart skipped a beat. It was a dream come true. One more step to independence. She’d never considered this day, not until Stone handed over the packet of identification.“Tucker.”Emma cringed at the tone of Stone’s voice and turned slowly to stare into the face of a stranger.“Yes, sir.” The young soldier snapped to attention.“Return to your quarters.”“Yes, sir.” He saluted, nodded at Emma, and jogged past the man on the front porch.“Um, I’m going to go,” Alexa said and Emma barely acknowledged her leaving. She was focused entirely on the man approaching her.He’d shaved. Not only his face but all the glorious thick locks of black hair were gone. This man, this soldier who stepped onto the driveway and stared into her face wasn’t anyone she wanted to know. His attire was strictly military. The fatigues drained away the man, leaving behind a stern faced Ranger and an unfamiliar person.“Emma? What’s wrong?”“Your hair.”Stone reached up and ran his hand over the small stubble that remained. He shrugged, and she watched his face soften. Her heart skipped, and she battled to stay put…stay distant. “It’ll grow back.”“When are you leaving?”“You want me gone that bad?”“Why did you re-enlist?”He chuckled and walked toward her. She backed up but the truck held her captive, and she couldn’t go any farther. A spark of interest caught in Stone’s eye. He advanced on her, causing her breath to hitch. Placing an arm on either side, his body pressed against hers.“So many questions…”Emma reached up and framed his face with her hands. She missed his hair, missed the man she fell in love with. “I don’t know you.”His gaze hardened. He kept her pinned for a few more seconds, swore violently, and pushed back off of the hood of the truck and away from her.“Did you ever?” Stone demanded.“I thought I did. I thought…” She paused and inhaled sharply, reining in her emotions. “I don’t know what I thought.”“If I ask you to trust me, will you? If I tell you that in a few months all of this won’t matter, will you believe me? If I remind you of the cabin, will you love me again?” Stone stood still as the rocky cliffs behind him. She didn’t know what he wanted from her, what promises he was making.“I never stopped loving you.” The relief that washed across his face made her almost believe he loved her as well.“I’ll be leaving the second week in March.”“And River Run?”“It’s fine. It won’t revert to my father, the lawyer worked out the details.”Emma’s heart dropped. That wasn’t what she’d meant. If he loved her, he’d tell her about the sale. “And after you return, what will happen then?”“I don’t know.” He stepped closer and cupped her face in his hand. “I guess I’ll leave that up to you.”“And River Run?”“What?” Stone shook his head and frowned. “What about it? It’s only a building, Emma. It’ll survive.”Emma swallowed. She laughed and it rang harshly with her anger. Sidestepping Stone, she strode onto the front porch. “I’ll be dining with Nate tonight.”“I see,” Stone answered.“Yes, I bet you do.” Emma stepped into the house, praying she’d make it to her rooms before losing her hold on the heartbreak that racked her body. *** He didn’t know how long he stood outside. Emma’s independence waving a huge F250 fuck-you behind him. Her stiff retreat screaming heartbreak and pain before him. What had he done?Clueless. I’m absolutely clueless.What about the renovations of River Run concerned her? Didn’t she believe he’d be back? That he’d complete all this work he’d started? He felt the weight of wasted time pressing upon his shoulders and mentally began ticking off the list that haunted him 24/7.The letters.His last task crept closer and closer as the days slipped by. He’d complete it, he knew. But he needed Emma, needed her support and strength.A soft glow of light beamed from her bedroom window. He glanced at it and saw her face framed within the paned glass. Pointing at her, he made a decision.“Stay right there.” He didn’t know if she heard him, so he moved swiftly up the stairs and into the house. Rounding the bend into her quarters, he strode through the door separating her bedroom from the hall.“You didn’t knock,” she said, apparently not surprised to find him there.“I’m not knocking anymore. As a matter of fact, I’m no longer giving you the power to retreat and hide. I don’t understand your focus on River Run, but I’m here to tell you it has nothing to do with your feelings for me.”“Oh, really?” She sat on her bed and stared at him through luminous green eyes. They deepened with anger and another emotion he didn’t want to acknowledge. Betrayal.“What have I done?”“Done? Nothing, absolutely nothing.”“What changed after that day in the cabin? Did you suddenly find in me a man you no longer cared to love?”“If I didn’t love you, do you think I would have allowed you to…let you…” Emma inhaled and her voice wavered.“Allowed me to what?”“Oh never mind, this is ridiculous. We’re never going to work, Stone. Stop fighting for what won’t ever be.”“Why won’t we work?” He knelt down before her and lowered his voice, trying to ease her panic. “Tell me, Emma. Why can’t we be together?”“You’ve gone back to your former life, for one.”“Only this mission.” He gazed into her eyes, wanting her to see how deeply he cared, afraid to speak the words.“Why go at all?”“I have to.”“Tell me.”He shook his head, wishing he could. But he didn’t want to raise her hopes or worry about where he was going. “It’s classified. If I told you,” he said, frowning and leaning in her direction. “I’d have to kill you.”“You’re doing that already.”“Oh God, Emma, don’t say that.” He stood and pulled her into his arms.“You are,” she said. “Every second we’re apart, ever bitter word we speak, a part of my heart dies. I don’t want to care. I don’t want to love you.”“But you do, don’t you?” Stone held her tightly, running his hands up and down her back.“Where can we go from here?”“Anywhere,” he whispered against her hear. “Anywhere at all.”She pulled back and gazed into his eyes.“Are you selling River Run?”“No.” He answered honestly, thankful he’d had the foresight to cancel the contract of sale before the holidays. He loved Emma, and she loved River Run. He’d never take that away from her.Her eyes narrowed slightly. “What about your father?”Stone tensed. His heart beat wildly, and he swallowed past the lump in his throat. “You’ll have to choose.”She sagged against him, and her eyes brightened with tears. He swore silently. The pain and anger that burned his soul whenever she spoke his father’s name, let alone threatened to visit, had made him realize an important factor. In this, there was no compromise.“And your mission? Can you tell me where you’re going?”“No. But when I return, the healing can begin.”Emma chewed the bottom left corner of her lip. He wanted to bend and replace her teeth with his tongue, remind her of their connection. He didn’t. She needed to make decisions.“This…” she patted his chest then her own. “Is tearing me apart.” She reached up and traced a gentle finger across his brow. He closed his eyes, the touch telling him all he needed to know.“Me too.” He heard the hoarseness of his voice and cringed against his weakness. Opening his lids, he silently challenged her to fight against their obstacles.“Your words and demands aren’t making this easy.”“I won’t apologize.”A grin brightened her face and spark of mischief sizzled within the depths of her eyes. “No, I didn’t think you would.”“What’s happening here, Emma?”“A relationship,” she said. “And not a very healthy one at that.” Her laughter lightened the solemn words, giving him a spark of hope.“Will you stand by my side until I return home?”She stared into his eyes for a long time. He didn’t move, didn’t breathe. He’d never been this scared in his entire life.“Yes, Stone Connor. I’ll stand by your side.” Her words slammed into him with the concussion of an explosion. Stunned and elated, he fought the desire to pick her up and whoop for joy. He couldn’t release his love, not yet. There still remained one job to complete. *** Emma sat in the middle of Stone’s massive bed, listening to the drone of male voices. She’d nothing to do. With a frown, she climbed off the bed and watched another winter storm throw more white layers on the already snow-crusted pasture.She knew the men were here because Stone couldn’t go to them. She knew he’d lied to her about the sale of River Run. He’d been honest regarding his father and straight forward on the lack of comment about his mission. It all totaled together for a heartrending emotional catastrophe. Maybe some of Margaret’s insightfulness rubbed into Emma’s soul. Because she believed her decision to stand by this man rang of a wisdom beyond her understanding. It felt right.“Hey gorgeous,” Stone said from the doorway. “Whatcha doing?”“I’m bored. Want to come play?”He grinned. “Wish I could. Why not join us for a hike?”“Really?” The surprise she felt echoed in her words.“Yeah. The men need to get out of the house. Crankiness has set in.”She sighed and moved into the walk-in closet to change. “I can relate. Where’re we going?”“Let’s head down to the river and see where that leads us.”“Fine by me.” She paused and frowned. “Do we have enough snow shoes?”“I believe so. And if not, they can wade through the stuff. It’ll do ‘em good. Some of these boys seem a bit too soft for my liking.”Walking out of the closet, Emma looked closely at Stone. The strain of the past few weeks of intense physical activity showed in black smudged bags beneath his eyes and excess muscles bulging against his shirt sleeve.“They’ll never replace what you lost.”“I know that.” He opened his arms, and she walked into his embrace. It might only be temporary, but their truce felt wonderful.“Rex called today.”“Yeah?”“Our departure date’s been confirmed.”“I understand.” She nodded against his chest, glad he couldn’t see her lying face.“I’m going to miss you.”“How long will you be gone?”“Hopefully, only about a week. At the max, it’ll be two.”Emma’s throat tightened. Two weeks. Where the heck were they sending him? More importantly, why were they sending him? Instead of voicing her concerns, she pushed everything to the back of her mind and showed the face Stone needed.The strong partner. The confident partner.She held tight, stood her ground. The last thing he needed was someone to question his judgment or interfere with this mission.“I’ve something to do tomorrow that I need your help with.”“Oh yeah? What’s that?”“I need to write some letters.”“Letters? What kind?”“The ones that say I’m sorry.”",

      "title": "Chapter 22",
      "content": "Chapter Fifteen Stone stood at the top of the stairs listening to the whir of the treadmill. Emma was taking full advantage of the gym since his men shipped back to base last week. His exit date demanded he leave within the week.Padding silently down the stairs, he stopped in the doorway of the room they’d expanded from a small exercise room to a full-fledged gym. Weight equipment and mats stretched from mirrored wall to mirrored wall. Emma occupied a treadmill before the floor to ceiling windows, jogging steadily, ear phones jammed on her head.She wore tight shorts and a cropped sports bra. A trickle of sweat ran down her back, soaking into the black spandex material of her shorts. He smiled, admiring the view.Auburn curls fell down her back, clasped loosely with a clip. His heart swelled with love. Did he believe in love at first sight?Yes.He realized the moment she’d opened her mouth and welcomed him to River Run, he’d been consumed by her magic.He hated sharing her affection. Stone wanted it all, but he knew until she overcame her fears and took responsibility for her life and the decisions that encompassed, he’d have to be okay with the portion of her heart she chose to share with him.Nate Connor.His father loomed between them with the savageness of the Snake cutting through the mountains. Would she cross to his side or remain out of reach?He walked up behind her and straddled the outside edges of the treadmill. Her heat, her nearness was enough to drive him mad with desire. Closing his eyes, he held tightly to the bars of the treadmill unable to comprehend life without this woman.She felt his weight and slowed the machine down until it stopped then slowly slid backward, connecting with his chest. Wrapping an arm around her waist, he hugged her close, knowing she could feel his need for her through her thin excuse for clothes.“Stone.” Her voice was breathless, and he felt her instant awareness of him. She sighed and leaned her head back against his shoulder.He rubbed his chin against her forehead, inhaling the slight jasmine scent that always surrounded her. Kissing a small bead of sweat from the corner of her eye, he fought against the heartrending day looming on the horizon.Swallowing against sudden panic, Stone trailed a line of kisses down her neck. He heard her gasp and whisper his name.One hand gripped the silver bar of the treadmill while the other lazily explored her breasts, rubbing her hardened nipples through the thin cotton. She felt like heaven and tasted of honey.He kissed the nape of her neck. Emma’s head dropped forward as she wiggled tighter against him making him groan.Did she know how deeply he cared? How strong his love was?He smiled to himself at the thought of her happiness. When Emma saw her father, she’d understand. His heart, his soul-they belonged to her.“Why’re you smiling?” Emma spoke softly, closing her eyes and enjoying his touch.“I’ve never considered making love on a treadmill before.”She twisted around and grinned at him. “I couldn’t think of a better form of exercise.”The glare of sun on white pasture streamed through the windows heating an already electrifying corner of the gym. Her sighs and soft words wrapped around him, exciting and enthralling.“I love you,” she whispered.All thought stopped, only the need to be one with Emma carried him forward. “I don’t have a condom,” he said, swearing silently.“Too late. I want you…now.”Her closeness, her vulnerability edged tighter around his heart.He couldn’t breathe.Emma moved against him, and he was lost.Stone demanded. She gave.He held her trembling body, seeking to regain control of himself. Inhaling in deep, ragged breaths, he wanted to tell her how he felt.He sighed as she pulled away. She twisted around and hugged him tightly. He returned her embrace, holding her fiercely against his chest.“Every time you’re near, I want you,” she said, her voice husky and slightly hoarse.He couldn’t speak. Swearing silently at his inner fear, he kissed her forehead. Finally, the iron grip on his chest released and sanity returned.Stone chuckled. “Obviously I’ve just proved that I agree.” *** Emma lay curled in a corner of the living room couch. Her head hurt, her stomach reeled, and her heart…well, her heart made demands she couldn’t answer.Surrender to Stone, the stupid little organ screamed. If only it were that easy. His plane was scheduled to leave tomorrow and with it a part of herself would disappear. She hated it. Detested the predicament she’d allowed herself to fall into.“Hey,” he said softly from the kitchen doorway.“Hey, yourself.”“Do you have a minute?”“Sure.” She twisted around and noticed he held a folder in his left hand.“I’ve written these letters.” He held up the folder. “I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind reading them. I don’t know if they’re good enough to mail.”She bit down on her lower lip trying to hide her curiosity. “Sure. I’ll do it right now.”“Okay. Thanks. I’ll be downstairs working on the shelves for the media room.”“10-4.”He rolled his eyes at her attempt at military jargon and left the room. The minute she heard the nail compressor turn on, Emma bolted from the sofa and snatched the folder off the table. Holding her head against the sudden pounding, she sat back down and pulled out the first letter.Dear Maria,I realize you’ve probably been waiting for this letter for almost two years, your heart breaking, and your mind searching for an explanation as to how I could’ve allowed your husband to die. Believe me, I’ve asked myself that question every morning and every night.Jose wormed himself into my group right after the two of you were married. I wish he hadn’t. I don’t regret the privilege of knowing him or his wisdom that came from loving you. But I hate myself for denying him the right to watch your daughter grow, to see his grandchildren and rock his days away beside you. For that, I am eternally sorry.A special person has helped me realize that healing doesn’t come from forgetting but from remembering. I’d like to share some memories with you and hope they ease your pain and help you move on.Emma flipped the page, reading paragraph after paragraph of exploits Stone’s unit had undertaken. She laughed at his fine touch of humor, the warmth and love he conveyed in every sentence, every word. Turning to the last page, she realized her barriers against this man were weakening.As you can see, Jose not only touched your life with his passion and love but also mine. I will forever miss him. I will never forget.With deepest regards,Colonel Stone ConnorTears streamed down Emma’s face. Damn, but she was tired of crying and lately it seemed like a daily, almost hourly occurrence.The front door slammed, and she quickly brushed the tears from her face. Glancing through the folder she realized it contained letters to every wife, mother or father that belonged to his deceased unit. The knowledge of the pain Stone bore crushed her chest making it hard to breathe.“Any one home?”Emma smiled, recognizing Alexa’s voice. “In here,” she called, dashing away the tears that kept insisting on flowing down her cheeks.“Hey,” Alexa said, walking into the living room and plopping on the couch next to her. “What’s up?” She frowned and shook her head. “You look like crap. Why are you crying?”A flood of emotions toppled over, and Emma couldn’t control the sobs that broke forth. Alexa scooted over and wrapped her arms around her, hugging her tightly. “I can’t seem to stop.”“It’s okay, let it out. Do you want to talk about it?”“Stone’s leaving tomorrow.” She let out a shaky breath, sat back and inhaled deeply attempting to control herself.“I know. That’s why I’m here. But he’ll be back, you have to know that.”“I do. But…” She paused and exhaled a rush of words. “He’s selling River Run, and I don’t know what that means. He wants me to choose between himself and Nate, and it’s tearing me apart. And he’s gone and written all these wonderful letters, and just the thought of how hard this must have been is making me feel like I don’t deserve to be in the same room with him.” Her eyes watered again, and the damn tears spilled over. She dashed them away, sniffing loudly.“Oh, baby,” Alexa said. “It’ll be okay. You’re just scared. I can’t believe Stone’s selling River Run. He knows how much it means to you.”“He is. I saw the contract.”“I’m sure there’s an explanation. When he comes home, there’ll be plenty of time to discuss River Run and Nate and all these other emotions running through your system.”“No there won’t be. Stone and I…” Did she want to explain? Yes, she needed to tell someone. “We’re all out of time. I’m pregnant.”Alexa stared at her, eyes wide, mouth hanging open. “Pregnant?” She narrowed her gaze and tilted her head. “Does Stone know?”Emma shook her head and pointed a finger at her friend’s chest. “Don’t you dare tell him.”“Emma…”“No,” she interrupted before listening to any of the arguments Alexa was about to say. They probably only mirrored the silent ones she’d been having with herself. “He can’t know. Not yet, at least. I want him to go on this mission with a clear head, clear conscience and absolutely no conflicting emotions.”Alexa shook her head.“No,” Emma repeated. “You have to swear you won’t say a word.”“I won’t say a thing. But I think you’re doing yourself and Stone a great injustice.”“Maybe, but it’s the right thing to do. He needs to be fully focused on this mission.”“He needs?” Alexa rose from the couch and paced in a tight circle. “What about you? How far along are you?”“Ten, maybe eleven weeks.”“You’re almost through your first trimester. Oh Emma, you’re so wrong about all of this. You should be sharing this with Stone.”“No. Don’t make me sorry I told you. He’d worry, and…” Emma leaned her head back and closed her eyes.“And?”“What if he doesn’t want the baby?” There, she’d done it. She’d voiced her greatest fear.“No.” Alexa sat back on the couch and grabbed Emma’s hands. “No, he’d never feel that way.”Looking into her friends eyes, she saw the worry and a flicker of doubt. “Yes he might and you know it.”“I don’t know a thing. Stone’s a difficult man, but he’ll do what’s right. He’ll stand by you.”“I don’t want that.” Emma stood and stared down at Alexa. “I won’t accept anything less than his full love for me and my child. I don’t even know how I’m supposed to choose between him and Nate. How do you just stop loving someone?”Alexa shook her head, and they both dropped into silence. *** “Hey, who died?” Stone stood in the doorway looking from one woman to the next. The emotions in the air were thick enough for him to draw a knife through. “Alexa, what a pleasant surprise.” Neither one answered, they simply stood staring at one another. Alexa’s face was pale, and he thought he noted a tinge of anger building in her posture. Emma seemed frozen, her eyes a watery green and cheeks tear stained.“Ladies, you’re scaring me.”Emma jerked, and turned to face him. She smiled, but it didn’t hide the hurt shining bright within the emerald depths of her gaze. “Sorry, we were just debating the advantages and disadvantages of shopping online.”Stone frowned. “You don’t lie well. What gives?”“Nothing,” Alexa said, rising from the couch. “Emma’s right. We weren’t agreeing with one another, and I’m so tired I gave her a hard time.” She turned and hugged Emma. “I’m sorry, sistah. I love you.”Emma returned the hug, her shoulders more relaxed than when he first entered the room. “I love you, too.” Both women teared up, and Stone backed away hastily.“I think I’ll come back later.”“It’s okay, cuz. I really just stopped by to give you a hug and tell you not to be gone for too long.”He sighed in relief as Emma and Alexa laughed softly. Okay, out of the danger zone. Man, tears scared him more than the thought of returning to the Congo. “Don’t worry. In ten days, you’ll be wishing I’d stayed away.”“I’ll hold you to that.” Alexa hugged him and waved a hand at Emma. “I’ll call you tomorrow, Emmie.”“See ya, Lex. Drive safely.”After Alexa shut the front door, Stone turned on Emma. Something wasn’t right.“What gives?”“Nothing Stone. Drop it, okay?”“Is this about me leaving or about those letters? Because I have to go, but I don’t have to mail the letters if you think they’re not appropriate.”Her face softened and the love that shone from her eyes touched his heart. “The letters are wonderful. You’re an amazing man.”“No, I’m not. I couldn’t have done any of this without you.”He walked over and wrapped his arms around her. Holding her close, the pain of leaving suddenly slammed into his chest with a vengeance. The sharp burn made him wince, and he held tighter.“I can’t believe you’re leaving tomorrow.”“It’s going to be the longest two weeks of my life.”“I know.”“About earlier…I didn’t use any protection, are you okay?”She sighed heavily and nestled closer. “I’m fine.”“You said it was too late, what does that mean? I wanted to ask you then but my attention was elsewhere.” He felt her shoulders shake with laughter, and suddenly she broke away, laughing even harder. Actually, he frowned, she seemed quite hysterical. “Am I missing something here?”“No,” Emma inhaled and swallowed. “I’m on the pill now. Don’t worry.”“Oh,” he said, still perplexed by her behavior. “Why didn’t you say so?” She waved her hand at him and burst into another round of giggles.“I dunno. I guess it slipped my mind. Oh please, stop looking at me like that.” Tears were streaming down her face, and her smile suddenly faltered. A hand squeezed his heart when happy tears melted into sad.“I’m sorry,” he said.“What for?” She bit her lip and sniffled.“Making you cry.” He pulled her back into his arms and held tight. Stone wanted to tell her how he felt, tell her he loved her, but it didn’t feel right. Somehow his words seemed empty. He needed to show her, and to do that…he had a mission to accomplish. *** Stone swung around in the office chair to glance out the window. He waited for Rex’s final call. His duffel bag sat by the front door, an ominous symbol of his departure. He didn’t know where Emma was. The scent of jasmine wafted lightly around the office, signaling her recent occupancy.The second the phone rang, he snatched it off the base unit.“Yeah, I’m ready.” He said, his heart pounding. Scared. That feeling didn’t sit well with him.“Did you call Nate like I asked?”“No, Rex. I’ve arranged for Seth to stay with Emma.”“Stone, Nate knows how Adams reacts. He’d be an incredible asset.”“No. That man isn’t allowed on this property.”“But Emma…”Stone interrupted him, not wanting to hear any more. “She’s chosen me, and that’s all I need.”“You’re a fool.”“Dammit Rex, give me my coordinates and stop acting like a mother hen.”Stone quickly scribbled down his instructions. A trickle of fear skimmed his skin when Kuffuor’s name was spoken, but he tamped it down and focused on the goal. He’d not allow one life to be lost on this mission, Stone silently vowed. Not one life.“And the plan for Seamus?” he asked.He heard Rex take a deep breath. “It’s been approved. Both missions should take place simultaneously.”Stone smiled in satisfaction. “Then Emma shouldn’t be in any danger.”“I’m just covering all bases, Stone. I still think you should involve your father.”“No. End of discussion.” Stone glance at his watch and realized he only had two hours before he needed to be at the airport. “I’ve gotta go. There’s a certain lady I want to find.”“Good luck, buddy.”“No luck needed.” Stone hung up the phone and wrestled with his thoughts.He could do this.He would do this.He had no choice. *** Emma stood in her own room, preparing it for Seth’s occupancy. She could hear the low murmur of Stone’s voice from the office, knowing he’d be discussing his mission with Rex. Indifference. She prayed for the indifference he’d once accused her of possessing.“There you are,” Stone said.She plastered a smile to her face and turned toward him. “Yep, just getting ready for Seth.”“I know you don’t want him here.”“No, I don’t. It’s going to be like spending two weeks with a two hundred pound puppy. The man’s a nuisance.”He grinned at her. “Yes, he is.”She couldn’t help but laugh. “He means well.”“And he’ll make a fine watchdog.”Sobering, Emma thought about Seth’s reason for staying at River Run. “Do you really think Seamus Adams will make a move against me?”“Honestly? I don’t think so. We’ll hit him before he has a chance to retaliate.”Success, Emma thought. One piece of the puzzle confirmed. “So this mission does involve him.”The shock that flared in Stone’s eyes almost made her laugh. Did he think she was an idiot? Then his gaze flitted to amusement. “Caught me red handed.”She shrugged. “I stopped hiding a long time ago. I’m facing a few things I wish I didn’t have to.”Stone stepped into the room and gently traced the gold eagle nesting against her throat. “Thank you for wearing this.”She placed a hand over his, locking his fingers against her skin. “Are you doing this for me?”“It’s complicated, and I can’t discuss the details.”“Revenge never solves anything, Stone. Don’t do it.” He tensed, pulling his hand away from hers.“What’s that suppose to mean?” he said.She touched his shoulder, imploring him silently to listen to her. “Some things aren’t worth your life.”He visibly relaxed. “You’re right.” Stone traced a finger down her cheek. “But you are.”Emma felt the tears prick her eyes. No crying, she screamed silently. “I’m sorry I didn’t wear the necklace right away. I was angry.”“About what?”“It’s in the past.”“No, I want to know.”“It doesn’t matter.” She reached up and twined her arms around his neck. “All that I care about now is your safe return.”“Don’t worry, I’ll be back before Seth has a chance to ruin all the good work I’ve done here.” He kissed her forehead. Emma tilted her head and found his mouth with her own. Hungry, her lips insisted, and Stone responded by plundering and setting fire to her soul. *** They stood within the frame of the front door. He held her tightly against his chest, afraid to let go. If she stepped back, his heart would be firmly in her hand and then how would he ever leave?“Are we okay?” he said. His voice cracked, and he stomped his sadness down.“Yes, we’re okay.”“You’re not planning on leaving while I’m gone?” Stone pulled back and searched her face. An emotion lingered there he didn’t understand, and it worried the heck out of him.“No, I’ll be here.”“Promise?”“Yes,” she said with a soft sigh, touching his face gently.“Good.” He stepped out the door and grabbed his bag. Before he reached his Jeep, he turned and looked at her one last time. He allowed his eyes to absorb her beauty, memorize it and lock it away within his heart.“Tell Porkie I love her.”Emma nodded and waved. The tears streaming down her face burned a path straight to his soul. He spun on his heels and ran the rest of the way to his vehicle, revving the engine, and slamming it into gear. Pulling out of River Run, he refused to look back. *** Emma held one hand to her heart, the other pressed against her abdomen. She watched the Jeep fade into the distance, swallowed by the bend in the road.“Oh baby, pray your daddy comes home. Pray he’ll be there to watch you grow and see his grandchildren. Pray he’ll rock beside me until the end of our days.”",

      "title": "Chapter 23",
      "content": "Chapter Sixteen Days passed in quiet solitude. Seth tried too hard, and Emma cried too much.Hormones.If she’d known pregnancy revolved around emotional insanity, she’d have opted to commit herself into a padded room for nine months.Staring out the kitchen window, she watched the sun burn holes into the snow covered pasture. The dripping of melting icicles splashed against the window panes, and she allowed herself a few dreamy moments in contemplation of Stone’s return.She missed him with an intensity never expected. Emma knew her life would forever revolve around him, whether he loved her or not.She’d called the doctor earlier that morning.After explaining her concern, the ob-gyn had reassured her that a small amount of bleeding could be entirely normal and not to worry.It was now early afternoon, and the spotting hadn’t stopped.Fearing the worst, Emma decided she’d better try and reach Seth or Alexa. *** Emma lay on the living room couch. Her head hurt, her body ached. She was a mess.Nate hovered over her, and she tried to sit up.“Stay still. I want to know exactly what the doctor said.”“Nate, you shouldn’t be here.”“Yeah? Then why’d you call me from the hospital?”“I didn’t know who else to phone. Seth’s out on the range and Alexa’s in New York. I’m better now, so you can leave.”He sat on the arm of the sofa and shook his head. “Why didn’t you tell me about the baby?”“Stone doesn’t even know.”At that, the older man quirked a brow. “I’ll make you some soup then be on my way. But first, what did the doctor say?”“She said I needed to stay off my feet and in bed. They’re afraid of placenta privia.”“Uh huh. Now, convert that to English.”“From what I gather, my placenta is attached to my uterus which is what triggered the bleeding.” Emma sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose, exhausted after the hours spent in the emergency room. “They’ll know more in another month or so when the ultrasound will show exactly what’s going on.”“I’m not going anywhere until Seth returns. You need to be in bed and not move.”“I’ll be fine. I’m sorry I worried you.”“Honey, you were bleeding and that’s not good. Even an old codger like me knows that. You’re pale and look like you’ve run the New York marathon. Let me take care of you.”Emma sank back into the cushions of the couch knowing he was right. The past ten days had been a battle to breathe. She missed Stone with every inch of her body and soul and couldn’t wait for him to return.Four more days.Four more very long days.This little complication with the pregnancy, would definitely make telling him easy. He wouldn’t miss the fact she couldn’t walk around not to mention greet him in the manner her body burned for.The front door slammed.“Emma?”She’d expected to hear Seth’s voice. Instead, the deep baritone of the very man she longed for echoed through the house. Her heart slammed to her chest and before she could grab his attention things whirled out of control. *** “What the hell are you doing here?” Stone couldn’t believe his father stood in the kitchen, stirring a pan of something that smelled suspiciously like chicken soup.“Don’t go jumping to conclusions, son.”“Don’t…son? I can’t process that.”“Stone…”He spun around at the sound of Emma’s voice. He couldn’t see her and then her head popped up over the couch. Was she hiding? Didn’t she even have the decency to tell him face to face that his father owned her heart and not him?“Don’t…” he stepped back, betrayal slamming into every weary muscle of his body. The wound on his shoulder felt like a bug bite compared to the knife in his heart. How could he have been so foolish? Asense Kuffuor’s lifeless face laughed at him, and Stone thought bitterly that his enemy had won after all.“No.” Emma sat up all the way. Her face looked rather pale, but he figured it was due to being caught. “I needed your father…”“Obviously much more than you needed me.”“Stone listen to me, I was in…”“I’m not hearing another lie from your lips.” He stepped into the living room and glared at her. “That man in the kitchen,” he pointed behind him. “The one you hold so dearly to your heart, hated me…abused me and almost killed me.”“No. I won’t believe that. It was a horrible time for him. What about forgiveness? You’re not God, you can’t judge and convict.”“Forgive? Did you forgive the man who murdered your mother?”“That’s different. Your father hasn’t killed anyone.”Stone didn’t even bother to hold back. “Well, love of my life, that’s where you’re wrong. He killed my mother. Flat out shot her dead then turned the gun on his own son. Would’ve shot me too if the police hadn’t arrived.”He watched as she turned shocked eyes to his father. “No,” was all she said.“Oh, yes. But I shouldn’t need to tell you. You promised to stand by my side. I thought you’d chosen me, but I guess I was wrong.”“You weren’t wrong.” Her emerald eyes pleaded for understanding, but he wrapped his heart with concrete and refused to give in.“I’d go to the ends of the earth for you. Actually, I did. The only thing that kept me sane these past two weeks is the thought of you. I’d die if that’s what it took for you to know.”“Know?”“How much I love you. How much I want you to love me.”“Stone…”He held his hand up and shook his head. “I’m not doing this. You’ve made your choice. I wish you only the best.” Before he changed his mind, Stone turned and left the room. He passed Hugh Gallagher in the hall and nodded for him to go in.Striding out of the house, he breathed deeply and jumped behind the wheel of his Jeep. Without another thought or moment to allow the pain in his chest to settle, he left River Run forever. *** Emma sank back into the couch. The betrayal written across Stone’s face burned her eyes, tearing at her soul.“Emma?”She knew that voice.A memory…worn and tattered, surfaced. Chest tight with emotion, she raised her head above the couch. Gasping, she covered her face as tears spilled uncontrollably. Her father, thin and aged, stood less than a foot away.“Papa…” He closed the distance and gathered her in his embrace. All she could think, all she could feel didn’t come close to the splintering and shattering of her heart, the echo of the front door slamming destroying her world. *** “I’m sorry,” Nate said as he tucked the sheets around her.“It’s not your fault.” Emma felt numb. If she hadn’t been incapacitated, she’d run after Stone and pummel sense into him. Instead, she lay in bed her sheets swathing her in heartbreak and endless what ifs.“Is my father settled?”“Yes. He’ll be by after he’s had a nap and shower.”She nodded. Would she ever be able to look at her father without blaming him for the loss of her love? What irony. If only she’d attempted to understand Stone’s feeling toward his own father, she might have avoided the same herself.Damn him. Damn Stone for risking his life to return her father. She didn’t want her father, she wanted him. And that thought alone shot a few more holes through her heart.“I want the truth.”“About my wife?”“About everything. Your wife, your son, the reason you were such a SOB. Lay it on the line, Nate, or get out of my home.”“It was an accident.”“Go on.” Emma leaned back, resting her eyes. She listened to Nate’s story, her heart bleeding for the boy that was Stone.“Katie was a good woman, a loving wife and terrific mother. I wasn’t so great.” Emma ignored the tears that brightened Nate’s eyes. No, he hadn’t been great. “Years before Seamus Adams turned his sight on Hugh, he focused on me. He didn’t kill me. No, first he destroyed everything I held dear. Luring me into the depths of gambling darkness, plying me with booze, turning me into a nightmare.”“You must have helped somehow.” She said softly. “You can’t blame your actions on one man.”Nate nodded. “I loved the booze, as well you know. I’d pretty much reached the bottom when that Irish madman’s fist struck. Stone had been hiking around Jenny Lake one afternoon. He didn’t come home. Katie called the local rangers. That evening they found him at the bottom of a cliff, broken and bloodied. It wasn’t until Hugh showed up at our back door that I realized Adams was behind it.”“Seamus came here?”“Yeah, he saved Stone then disappeared, fearful for his own family. But he didn’t leave before jamming his boot up my butt and making me realize what a heel I’d been.”“Heel? Is that what you’d call it?” Emma felt herself pulling away, shutting doors on Nate’s corner of her heart.“How old was Stone?”“Fifteen.”“Go on…what happened next?”“They came into my home. I was too drunk to understand what was happening. Katie, my dear Katie.” He paused, his voice cracking with emotion. “She fought for her life, but they shot her. I guess that was my punishment. Seamus never planned on physically killing me.”“And Stone? Why does he believe you killed his mother?”“He heard the gunshots and came racing down the stairs. I was inconsolable, out of my mind. I grabbed the gun the men had left and aimed at him. I wanted to kill him. I wanted to kill myself.”“And?”“I pulled the trigger.”Emma couldn’t believe what she heard. Her stomach twisted, a deep pain welled in her chest.Tears streamed down Nate’s face as his memories came tumbling out. “The barrel was empty. Stone never spoke to me after that. I guess I didn’t care. I drank and gambled and beat him every time he turned accusing eyes in my direction. Even though I didn’t pull the trigger that day, I killed my wife. He knew it and so did I.”He looked at her and despair crossed his face. “Don’t say anything, Emma. I see it in your eyes. When Hugh called three years later wanting to collect on the debt I owed, I dried out. For Stone, it was too late. He’d already joined the military and left Jackson. But I thought if I could somehow help my old friend, repay him for saving my son when I couldn’t, then maybe some sense was to be had of my life.”“That’s when you came to Ireland.”“Yes. But I was too late. Your mother was gone and your father presumed dead. You were the only one left.”“I see.” Emma bent her head and listened to her heart. Truly listened, and her path became clear. Running her fingers across the pendant that burned her skin, she understood Stone’s request. It’d taken awhile, but it was time for her to fly. *** “Are you sure about this?” Alexa questioned for the tenth time that morning.“Yes,” Emma answered, trying not to let the exasperation show.“Okay. I found him.”Her heart leapt and the smile that tugged at her mouth felt wonderful. It’d been two months since her world crumbled and now she’d begun to piece it back together. “You’re a doll,” Emma said, hugging Alexa.“I can’t believe you’ve sold River Run.”“After Nate signed the papers over, it was mine to do whatever I wanted with.”“But why?”Emma shook her head and grimaced at how horrible the past weeks had been. “I don’t want River Run. The only thing that matters is Stone. Give me his address.”“Okay.” Alexa handed over the piece of paper.“How’d you track him down?”“He called.”Emma refused to allow any anger or hurt to penetrate this moment. She didn’t expect him to call her, no – she needed to tell him so many things first, prove to him that he was the one she chose. “I see. You didn’t say anything about me, did you?”“No, I didn’t.” Alexa wagged a finger under Emma’s nose. “Even though every little nerve demanded I spill.”“Thanks for being a good friend.”“I don’t understand you.”“Well, I guess that makes two of us.”“Have you spoken to Nate?”“No ma’am, and I don’t intend to either. He doesn’t deserve any part of River Run or any part of my life.”“That’s rather harsh.”Emma shook her head. “He should’ve told me the truth, given me the advantage I needed to help Stone. I’ll take responsibility for my inability to trust completely, but I’ll be damned if that man gets off scot-free.”“You don’t really mean that, do you?”“Yes and no. Time heals everything, Alexa. It’ll heal me too. But right now Nate Connor has no claim on my life or my affection.” Now, if she could convince Stone of her love, maybe everything would work.“How’s the baby?”“Better. I still need to be off my feet most of the day. But the doctor says everything looks just fine.”“So what’re you going to do with this?” Alexa tapped the piece of paper she’d handed to Emma.“Letters. I’m going to write lots of letters. I had my first ultrasound yesterday and the picture is going to be winging its way to…” She looked at the address in her hand. “Utah? What the heck’s he doing in Utah?”“I haven’t a clue, but by the address it looks like he’s ranching.”“A hidden talent I didn’t know about?”“Honey, all the Connors are born to ranch. It’s a genetic thing.”Emma laughed and felt the sunshine kiss her skin. Spring bloomed across the range and life blossomed within. “I can do this,” she said.“I know you can.” Alexa agreed.“Ready to go look at my new home?”“Only if I drive. I’m not going anywhere in that pickup truck of yours.”“Actually,” Emma laughed, “I was hoping you’d offer. I’m not very graceful these days.” *** Emma enjoyed the freedom of the convertible. Alexa maneuvered along the back roads with ease born from familiarity. The wind nipped at their noses, but they both refused to put the top up.“This is closer to our ranch than to River Run.” Alexa said.“Yeah, I know. I did that on purpose. Besides it has a huge barn for the animals.”“Oh, aren’t they staying at the resort?”“Nope. They weren’t for sale.”“I’m going to be nosy and ask what the final sales price was.” Alexa had to shout above the wind. Emma grabbed her ponytail, trying to control the wisps from catching her eyes.“Nine million.”Alexa slammed on the brakes. “Holy bat-guano, Emma. I can’t believe that.”Emma smiled. “Yeah, it’s wonderful isn’t it? What do you think Stone’ll do with all that er…” she frowned then smiled again. “Bat-guano?”“Send it back.” Alexa pushed down on the accelerator again and the car sped around a sharp corner.“That’s what I’m hoping for, with him attached to the other end.”“Oooh boy, lot’s of challenges heading in that boy’s direction.”“He can handle it. Here it is.” Emma pointed to the left and Alexa pulled the convertible onto a gravel drive. They drove in silence as the car hummed quietly along a serpentine path. Topping the ridge, Alexa gasped in surprise.“Oh Emma,” she said. “This is beautiful.”“Yeah, I think so.” The two of them climbed out of the car and walked toward the sprawling cabin. Emma pulled a key out of her purse and they entered the glass and timber home.She’d not bought any furniture yet, but one of the local galleries already delivered and installed her new light fixtures. She’d chosen a rustic décor, native to the area. Chandeliers made of antlers hung in the foyer and the dining room. Emma clapped her hands in delight when she saw them.“Aren’t they cool?”Alexa laughed and nodded in agreement. “What’s really cool is this view.”The house was nestled high upon a hill top. The entire back wall made of glass. It looked over the valley of Jackson Hole with the Grand Tetons framing the vista to the left and the ski slopes dominating the right. Gently flowing pastures rolled down hill until they were divided by one of the many tributaries from the Snake.“I hope this all works.” A sudden sense of dread, invading her good spirits.“You’ll make it work.”“Yes,” she agreed. “I will. I don’t care what anyone else needs, I’m going for what I need.”“Which is?”“Stone Connor. I need Stone.”“Good girl.” Alexa walked back outside and headed to the car. “Come on kiddo, it’s time to get you back to bed.”Emma smiled and as much as she hated leaving, she knew Alexa was right. Besides, in a few more weeks she’d be here permanently. *** Curled in a tight ball, Emma pulled the covers up over her head, muffling her sobs. It didn’t help. She felt the weight of the bed give way and knew her father sat on the edge waiting for her to gain control.“Is there anything I can do, child?” The lilt of his brogue soothed, but her heart still wouldn’t cease its endless ache.“No, Papa. Thanks though.” She held tight to the sheets he tugged away from her.“You need to be strong. If not for yourself, then do it for the wee bairn who has yet to see the light of day.”“She’ll only be coming into a life of misery. No father and a mother too heartbroken to live.”Her father’s soft chuckle didn’t endear him one bit. “Stone’ll come around.”“I’ve been mailing letters every week since May. It’s the end of August and not a word. I thought he’d at least come home to check on his baby, but no. Nothing.”“He has a lot to work through. The Congo hasn’t been kind to him and facing down the man who held me captive must’ve taken a toll. His emotions were so raw.”Emma nodded. “I know. If I could do that day all over again, I’d have gone after him.”“You might’ve lost the baby.”A dark thought crossed her mind, but her heart caught it and banished it. She hadn’t risked the baby, and that had been the right decision.“I’ve moved my stuff into the guest room downstairs.” Hugh said.Emma sat up and dried her eyes. “Why? Is Nate giving you a hard time?”“No. But we both decided that seeing you’re coming up on your due date, it’d be best if someone stayed here.”“You both decided?” Emma allowed a brief burst of bitterness to escape. “Haven’t I made it clear that I’m in charge of my own life? I don’t want to be responsible for anyone else.”“Whoa, child. I’ll be fine just by myself and so will Nate. We don’t want you to care for us. Let us care for you.” Hugh scooted closer and wiped a hand across her face.She reached up and held on. “I’ll be okay. It’s just all these hormones.”“I know you miss him.”“I do. I never realized how much I loved him until he left.”“You only have a few weeks left before your daughter is born. Why not try and carve a little happiness out of those days?”Emma nodded. She knew her father was right. But every time a flash of the future, empty of Stone, crossed her mind, it rendered her senseless. She’d done everything but pound on his door. She’d do that too, if the damn doctors would let her out of bed. The placenta privia hadn’t corrected itself in her second trimester like they’d hoped, leaving her confined to limited activity and no stress.“I’ll try, Papa. Please don’t worry.”“I can worry, it’s my right. I might have missed a great part of your life but I’m here now. My little granddaughter will be raised like a good Irish lass.”“But she’s American.” Emma laughed at her father’s expression.“Bite your tongue.” He stood and patted her cheek. She noted the healthy glow to his skin and how his figure had filled out. It hadn’t taken long for her to overcome the mixed feelings of resentment and love. Love won out. It wasn’t her father’s fault she’d made a bed of nails to sleep in.“Is Tilly here yet?”“Not yet. Isn’t this her morning off?”“Yes, that’s right.” She was still amazed at how Tilly had stepped up and taken over. The woman refused to work for the new owners of River Run, and in a weak moment, Emma offered her a position of personal assistant. She helped around the house and basically performed all the duties Emma’s current incapacitation wouldn’t allow. She’d never regretted the decision.“Would you mind fixing me a cup of tea?” In reality, Emma craved solitude, not tea.“Of course. I think I remember how to boil water.”“Papa…” He made her smile and for that she was grateful.“I’ll be back.” Hugh left her room, and she sank into the comfort of her pillows. Closing her eyes, she fought against the next wave of despair.Why hadn’t he answered?Where was he?Rolling over, she gasped as a sharp pain knifed through her lower belly. Emma sat up and took several deep breaths. The pain receded, and she lay back down. She didn’t think it was labor pains, because she’d been suffering from Braxton Hicks for the past month. This felt more like a slice. Probably gas, she decided trying to remember what she’d eaten yesterday.After a few moments of rest, Emma figured that’s exactly what it’d been and sat up carefully. Her hair lay plastered to her head from the sudden hot flashes she experienced in the middle of the night.The phone rang and Emma answered, a slight flutter to her pulse. Maybe it was him.“Hello?”“Emma sweetie, I’ll be over shortly. Do you need anything?”“No, Tilly, but thanks.”“What’re you doing?”“I’m about to take a shower. I feel yucky after last night.”“Oh those hot flashes again? You know you really need to read that chapter again in the book I gave you. It’s very informative.”“Why bother?” Emma said under her breath. Tilly’d become a virtual Einstein on pregnancy.“What was that?”“I said,” she spoke louder, “I gather.”“Okey dokey, I’ll be there soon.”“Tilly?” Emma suddenly regretted her snotty thoughts.“Yes?”“Thank you. You’re an angel.”“Don’t you blubber at me I’m doing my best with this new leaf, but blubbering and hugging and heart to heart talks won’t make it any easier.”Emma laughed for the second time that morning. Maybe things were becoming easier. Maybe.Stepping from the comfort of her bed, she waddled to the bathroom. Ugh, she couldn’t wait to see her feet again. Ignoring the huge hippo reflected in the mirror, Emma made her way to the shower.She turned the knob and went to pull her nightgown over her head.Another pain stabbed across her belly, but this time it drove her to her knees. The sound of the showerhead spurting water pounded against her brain, mimicking the throbbing fire attacking her insides.Placing a hand upon the tiled wall, Emma inhaled and exhaled trying to use the Lamaze method of pain control. Her vision dimmed, and she fought to remain conscious against the pain.Calling for her father, she swore when her voice came out a pathetic whimper. Another flash of pain and then a warm river of moisture trickled down her legs.Reaching down, she lifted her night gown. Thick ribbons of red pooled on the white tile. Emma’s heart seized and the next stab of pain had her screaming at the top of her lungs. She heard her father’s footsteps bounding up the stairs as she slid down to the floor, no longer able to battle against the treachery of her body.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen Stone stared at the television. With half his mind numbed by beer, he didn’t care what the newscaster discussed. Twisting his head, he counted the empty bottles that lined the coffee table. Almost finished the twelve pack. Another night drowned and finished.A fist struck his door. He ignored the hammering and popped the top off another icy bottle.“Stone,” a familiar voice called from outside.His gut twisted. The past slammed into him, and he bit down on his hatred. Closing his eyes, he swallowed the emotion away and stared at the television.“Go away.”“Open this door or I’ll kick it down.”“Go away.” Didn’t anyone know how to leave a man alone?The sound of a heavy kick and splintering wood echoed through the dilapidated shack. He leapt off the old, moth-eaten recliner and bowed back to shoot a fist straight into his father’s nose.“Hold up, son. I’m not here to make peace with you so don’t go getting all defensive.”Stone narrowed his gaze, fist still in the air and growled. “Whaddya want?”“Look at you.” His father shook his head in disgust. Stone felt a sharp pang of shame then blasted it away with an angry bolt of betrayal.“Don’t like what you see? Go away.”“No,” Nate shook his head. “Unfortunately it looks damn familiar to me, seems I used to look into that face a lot about twenty years ago.”Stone glanced at the lopsided, cracked mirror hung on one wall. His hair was long and unkempt, greasy after several days of work in the field. He hadn’t bothered to shower. His full beard and mustache cloaked his face in black whiskers. He glared at his father.“Get out of here, old man.”“Emma needs you.”Taking a swig of beer, he choked, spewing the carbonated liquid through his nose. “Yeah, right.”“She’s…”“Why would she want me? You’re all she needs.”“I’ve not seen her since the day you left.”Stone eyed his father. “I don’t believe you.”Nate walked further into the room, looking around with obvious distaste. “Haven’t you gotten any of her letters?”“Letters? Yeah, I’ve gotten them.”“Emma’s….”“Bunch a crap if you ask me.” Stone didn’t want to look at his father. He resented the man’s clean clothes and healthy complexion. His father’s heart hadn’t been crushed and shattered, he’d won the war. “If she needs me, you tell her to come here and tell me to my face. I’ve been waiting. Damn.” His voice lowered, and he fought against the rush of emotion. “I’ve been waiting.”“Haven’t you read the letters?”“Why should I?” Stone walked to an end table, shuffled aside some old magazines and threw a stack of unopened envelopes on the floor. “If she wants to hide behind a piece of paper, let her.”“I hate to point a fact out to you, son. But you’ve gone and done the worst possible thing in your book.”“What the hell does that mean?” He glared at his father. “What makes you think I give a damn?”Stone swayed slightly and dashed his half-empty bottle of beer into the garbage, oblivious when beer splashed the sides of the kitchen cabinets and trickled over the edge of the can. He mentally shook himself and looked at his father. What did he want?“You’ve become me.”“I’ve become…” Stone faltered. He was drunk, meaner than a trapped possum, and split so far apart inside his heart bled rivers of blood every waking second.“Yeah, you’ve turned into me. There’s a woman in Jackson who’s dying of a broken heart, and you’re letting her slip away because of some stupid stubborn pride.”Stone swallowed. “She’ll be fine. Emma’s better off without me.”Nate shook his head. “You don’t get it, Stone. Emma’s in the hospital, and she’s dying.”The room tilted and Stone reached to steady himself. His entire body went numb. Fear, self-loathing, anger, love, every emotion possible pushed against his chest. “What happened?” He finally asked.“She hemorrhaged. The baby’s fine, but Emma lost too much blood. It doesn’t look good.”“Baby?”“Read the letters, Stone. I always thought you were the better man. Now prove it.”Stone watched his father leave the room then bent and collected the strewn envelopes from the floor. He sorted them by date and with shaking fingers opened the first one.My love,I wish I could be there to tell you all I feel. But, I can’t. The doctors say I must remain in bed at all times.Oh God, what had he done? A small black square fell from the envelope, and he scooped it up. It looked like a negative. Peering closer, Stone wasn’t sure what it was supposed to be.I’ve enclosed the very first picture of our baby. Take care of it as it’s the only one we have. Isn’t it a miracle?Frowning, Stone peered at the ultrasound picture. He didn’t see anything. But if it was part of Emma then he certainly loved whatever lay within the grainy shadows.You asked me to choose, and I have. I CHOOSE YOU! Please come home, I love you. EmmaHe ripped open a few more envelopes and they all said the same thing. “I choose you. Please come home. I love you.”Opening a letter dated in June, he snatched a slip of paper that floated to the ground. He held a bank check in the amount of nine million dollars. Eyes widened, he read her words.I’m sure you realize you forfeited River Run under the terms of Margaret’s Will. Nate didn’t want the resort and signed it over to me. Without you, it meant nothing. I contacted the buyer you’d signed the contracts with and believe it or not, he thought you’d cancelled because the asking price was too low.She’d seen the contracts?I knew you’d sold River Run. I discovered everything on Christmas, the night we conceived our child. But I didn’t know you’d voided the deal. I should’ve trusted in you, believed in you. I’m sorry.Here’s the money from River Run. I don’t want it. I’m going to keep writing, even though you haven’t responded. I love you, Stone Connor. I choose you. Please come home.He didn’t know what to stay. Tears burned the back of his eyes as he opened another envelope. This held a picture of Emma and her pig. On the picture she’d taped two little scraps of paper. Above the pig it said, “Pokie.” He smiled at the name taped above a picture of herself. “Porkie.”No.Beautiful described her better. Her face was full, her body round, and he wished he’d been there.Ripping open the last letter, his hand trembled, and he needed to place it on the table in order to read it. The writing was shaky and the paper looked water marked.I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to raise a child without you. My heart breaks each day the mail comes and there’s nothing from you. I have no desire to go on. Weak as it may sound…I need you, Stone Connor. Where are you?His tears dropped onto the page, landing next to her dried ones. He dropped his head and swallowed hard.I love you more than life itself. I choose YOU, Stone. Do you hear? I wish I could yell it in your face and beat you senseless with these words. I CHOOSE YOU!“I hear you, Emma. I hear you.” He gathered all the letters and stuffed them in the duffle bag he hadn’t bothered unpacking yet. The bag was full of rancid clothes from his week long fence mending journey. He didn’t care. Getting ready to leave the old cabin, he paused at the door.He couldn’t go like this.Running into the bathroom, he turned the shower on and grabbed his razor. He’d been a fool. The man in the mask of hair was nothing more than a stubborn fool. *** As the small commuter plane glided between the steep peaks of the Grand Tetons, Stone didn’t notice the turbulence or the beauty of the setting sun. He held tight to the stack of paper between his hands.Exiting the plane, he realized he didn’t know exactly where Emma was. He’d assumed St. Johns Medical Center but wasn’t certain. Walking out of the terminal, he pushed the hair out of his eyes as an icy wind bit through his jacket. He looked for a taxi and pulling his cell phone out he began to call Alexa. His eye caught a worn and battered pick-up truck with an equally worn and battered man sleeping behind the wheel.He strode over and yanked open the passenger door. His father jerked awake and eyed him in surprise.“Took you long enough,” Nate said.“Just drive.”They drove in silence for several miles then Nate cleared his throat. “I know you don’t want to hear anything, but I’ve a few things to say.”“I’m listening.”Nate raised his brow and nodded. “She didn’t have anyone to call that day things started to turn bad with the pregnancy.”“I know. She explained it in the letters.”“After you left, I tucked her in bed. Poor bird, her heart was broken.”Stone swallowed, fighting back his emotions.“She demanded the truth.”Surprised, Stone slanted his father a look.“About what?”“Me.” Nate stared straight ahead, his shoulders sagged and he appeared to age before Stone’s eyes. “I told her everything. And she asked me to leave.”“I see.”“No,” Nate shook his head. “You don’t see anything. She hated what I’d done to you, but even if she didn’t, she still would’ve asked me to leave. I haven’t seen her since that day.”“You haven’t been to the hospital?”“No,” Nate shook his head. “Hugh keeps me posted via the phone. It was his idea I come get you.”Stone thought hard. He figured before he could fully help Emma he needed to deal with his father.“I know you didn’t shoot Mom.”Nate shook his head. “Until you blew up at Emma, I’d never even realized my actions had appeared that way to you. But let’s not go there, son. You need to focus on what’s best for the woman we both love.”“How bad is she?”Nate stopped at a red light and looked over. Stone’s heart hitched at the grief on his father’s face. “She’s in a coma.”“What happened?”“Complications. I’m not certain. Placenta privia, hemorrhaging, all sorts of things.”Nate pulled the truck into visitors parking and stepped on the brake. “Here you go. Tell Hugh to call me if anything changes.”Stone reached for the door handle and paused. He looked at his father and saw him for the first time in forever. “Why don’t you park this heap of metal and come in?”“No, I don’t…”“Well, I do. I think that sometimes it’s good to forget. It’s not going to be easy, but I’ll try. Okay?”Nate nodded. “Okay.”“Now let’s go see about waking my sleeping beauty.”They entered the hospital, the scent of ammonia and sterile surroundings assaulted Stone’s nose. He shivered in revulsion and maintained his pace down the white hall.Nate checked at the first nurse station, and they were directed to the delivery ward.“Hold on a minute,” Stone said, ducking into the gift shop.“What are you doing?”“Buying something for the baby.”“Stone, we need to get to Emma’s room.”Stone grabbed a stuffed animal off the shelf and slammed it on the check out counter. “What if she’s awake?”“We’ll celebrate?” Nate gave him a perplexed look.“I can’t walk in empty handed. After all these months of torturing her, I can’t walk into the room empty handed.”They strode out of the gift shop and to the bank of elevators. Nate glanced down at the floppy lump of fur clutched in a death grip between Stone’s fingers.“Don’t say anything, Dad.”“I think a teddy bear would’ve been more appropriate.”“I just grabbed the first thing on the shelf.” Stone stared straight ahead, not looking down.“But it’s a giraffe.”Stone glanced at the silly toy and burst out laughing. Nate’s answering laughter helped ease some of the tightness in his chest. He could do this. Dammit. He could make his woman come home. *** He inhaled sharply as they walked down the long corridor of Labor and Delivery. Spotting Alexa, Ethan and Seth leaning against one wall, he headed in their direction. A crowd of nurses and technicians entered a room opposite them. One glance into Alexa’s eyes and Stone knew it was where Emma lay.He ran headlong into the maze of white jackets and green scrubs. Pushing aside a little cart being taken from the room, Stone tried to reach the bed.“Excuse me, sir, you’ll have to leave.” A nurse yelled, tugging at his arm.“Let go of me. That’s my wife.”The nurse looked confused for a moment, checked the chart in her hand, then shook her head. “Miss Gallagher isn’t married.”“Well she damn well will be the second she wakes her sorry butt up. Let me by.”“Sir, please.” This time the nurse’s tone was softer. “Let them finish their exam.”“Exam? There’s nothing wrong?”“Other than a coma? No. She’s stable.”Stone searched her eyes. He couldn’t ease the panic. “You don’t understand. She’s my life.”She smiled and patted his arm. Looking back at the chart in her hand, she pulled him out the door. “Mr. Connor, you just pushed aside another part of your life that you should go say hello to.”Stone looked at the doctor and nurses running down a checklist of God only knew what then back at the nurse. He nodded and followed her down the hall. The entered a small alcove and he realized it was the nursery.They caught up with the little cart being wheeled down the hall. The nurse gathered a tiny bundle of blankets and handed it to him.“Mr. Connor, meet Katie.”“Oh,” he said softly, accepting his daughter. Tears streamed down his face. “Damn,” he swore. “I didn’t know I could cry this much in one day.”The nurse chuckled and patted his back. “Just wait. You’ve years to watch this one grow and to cry at the most inopportune times.”He smiled and stared in wonder at the tiny pink nose peeking from the blanket. The nurse left him alone, whispering instructions to the young woman attending the baby’s bed. Katie squirmed and opened her eyes. They connected with him, widened, and blinked. He felt the immediate tug on his heart. “Hello, baby girl. I’m your daddy.”In answer, the most precious of all jewels opened her mouth and screamed with the gusto worthy of any Connor offspring. “What?” Stone turned a panicked face toward Alexa who came rushing down the hall. She was laughing and shaking her head. “What did I do?” He said as his cousin entered the nursery.“Nothing, Stone. Nothing at all. She just wants her mommy. The room’s clear now. Why don’t you go see Emma? I’ll take care of your little princess.”Considering the fact that Katie continued to cry, Stone handed her over without hesitation. Before leaving, he bent and placed a tender kiss on her forehead. She smelled sweet. “I’m going to wake your mommy up so she can see what a beautiful little girl you are.”Alexa squeezed his shoulder and nodded for him to leave. He turned and walked the longest ten yards of his life.Pushing the door open, he glanced at the nurse who’d directed him to his daughter. She nodded and motioned for him to come in. Emma lay in a bed next to the window.She looked so small.The hospital bed dwarfed her slender figure, making her appear childlike and vulnerable.He walked over, biting down his fear.Smiling, he stepped to the head of her bed and placed his forehead against hers. “Wake up, Emma. Please wake up.”The nurse pushed a chair over to him and signaled that he sit.“You need to talk to her. Hold her hand, tell a story. Anything. She can hear you, Mr. Connor. You must believe that she can hear you.”“Okay.”He took her hand in his, careful of how frail it appeared. Stroking his fingers along her arm he tried hard not to let the tears fall. “You’re making me cry Emma, and it’s not at all manly. How am I supposed to be the strong silent type when the sight of you in this bed is ripping my heart in half? I’m sorry I didn’t come home. I was too stubborn to read your letters. But I’m here now, and under no circumstances am I leaving without you. Do you hear me? Wake up, Emma. Dammit, wake up.” He rested his head on her hand and continued speaking softly about what he’d been doing for the past six months.Allowing his eyes to close, he breathed in the scent of her skin and whispered to her. He must have drifted off to sleep because he jerked up suddenly when a hand gently shook his shoulder.“I’ll take over for awhile, Stone.”He turned and stared into the troubled eyes of Hugh Gallagher.“I’ll stay.” Stone said.“You need to stretch your legs. You’ve been at it for more than twelve hours.”“I have?” Stone glanced out the window and saw the sun at about mid-morning. Hadn’t it been setting when he’d arrived? “Wow,” he took a deep breath and stretched. “I guess I have. I’ll go grab a cup of coffee.”“And something to eat.”Stone smiled. “And something to eat.”He bent and kissed Emma’s forehead, whispering his love against her skin. Then he found his daughter and repeated the same action. She didn’t cry this time but gurgled and fell back to sleep. Stone didn’t think his heart could handle any more love, but it swelled larger and made room for little Katie.“How is she?” Nate asked as Stone passed the waiting area.“Still the same.” He shook his head. “I don’t know what to do.”“There must be something to let Emma know you’re here. If she knew, she’d wake up.”“I don’t know.” He swore in frustration. An idea began to form. “I need some things from River Run.”“River Run isn’t yours anymore,” Nate reminded him softly.“Where are my things?”“At Emma’s house.”“Right, she sent me pictures. Okay, how do I get there?”“Call Tilly, she’ll get you whatever you need.”Stone looked at his father as if he’d just grown another head. “Tilly’s still around?”“So I hear. She’s been taking care of Emma.”“Really?”“Yeah, pretty amazing isn’t it?”Stone nodded. He exited to an area cell phones were allowed and punched in Alexa’s number. He scribbled down how to reach Tilly and placed his next call. After explaining what he needed, the young woman laughed and told him it was a terrific idea. She promised to be at the hospital within an hour.“Okay,” he said. “Plan B is under way. I need caffeine.”Nate laughed and pointed him in the direction of the cafeteria. *** Stone stood in front of the narrow window, watching the sun sink slowly into the horizon. He tried to imagine what the outside sounded like, but its music appeared beyond his grasp. Glancing over his shoulder, Emma continued to sleep soundly. The doctors told him it was a defense mechanism. Her body was healing.Yes, he understood that. But did they know her heart needed healing too?They’d laughed at him then sobered when they saw he was serious. He’d outlined his plan and although they thought it rather unorthodox, they hadn’t seen any danger.“Mr. Connor?”He turned and recognized the face of the nurse he’d met yesterday evening.“Yes?”“I’m here to help you with the bed sheets.”“Thanks, but I can handle it.”“I don’t think…”Stone shook his head. “I don’t care what you think. I’m doing this for my wife.”“She’s not…”He held up his hand and stopped her from continuing. “If you’re going to tell me one more time she’s not my wife then I might just have to hurt you.”Stone bent over Emma.“I, Stone, take you, Emma, as my lawfully wedded wife. Do you, Emma, take me, Stone, as your lawfully wedded husband?” He gently moved her head up and down and kissed her lips. “See? We’re married.”The nurse chuckled and shook her head. “Let me help you with the sheets. You can do all the rest.”“Okay,” he relented and unpacked a set of soft, high thread count sheets reminiscent of River Run from the bag Tilly delivered earlier.They changed the bed, moving Emma from side to side. Stone smoothed her hair against her favorite down pillow and tucked the feather comforter under her arms.“I’ll take it from here, if you don’t mind.”“Just one more thing…” Stone frowned as the nurse stepped out of the room. She re-entered wheeling the little metal crib where Katie slept. “I think you left someone out of your plan.”He smiled and nodded. “Yes, I certainly did.”“There’s a bottle all prepared on that little metal shelf. Just mark on the sheet what time you feed her and how much she takes. There’s also fresh diapers beneath the cart.”“Bottle? Sheet? Diapers?” Stone swallowed past the sudden panic.“You can do it, Mr. Connor.” She reassured him. “I’ll write up a Do Not Disturb sign for the door.”“Thanks.” Stone stared at the sleeping baby, then turned and dug around the bag some more. He pulled out several vanilla scented candles and lit them and dabbed Emma’s favorite perfume on her neck and wrists. Stripping off her hospital gown, he replaced it with a soft sleep shirt.All that was left was him and little Katie. Undressing slowly, Stone prayed this would work. He slipped into flannel pajama bottoms and splashed his normal cologne lightly on his skin. Gathering Katie from her tightly swathed blankets, he climbed into Emma’s hospital bed. He propped his back up, moved Emma against him and placed Katie between them. He discarded the baby blankets and nestled his daughter within the arms of her mother.Touch, scent, sound. Stone began to talk.“We’re home now, Emma. Smell the scent of your favorite candles I’ve just lit. You’d better wake up soon, because little Miss Katie will be terribly hungry, and she misses her mommy. She’s perfect Emma. She’s in your arms. Can you feel her? Her skin is just like yours, soft and sweet. I think she has my temper, which might not be a good thing, but she’s so beautiful.”Nothing.“Do you remember last Christmas? The cabin that was our hideaway? We made love, created this little life, then we let it all slip away. I’m sorry for everything. I’m sorry I didn’t understand.”No response.Stone stroked her hair, her arm, traced his finger lovingly along her chin.“I went back to the jungle,” he said softly, his lips touching her hair. “Seamus Adams was one smart SOB. He’d given your father to the one man he knew I feared. The same rebels that killed my unit. I won this time. No casualties and a successful extraction.”He felt her sigh. His heart skipped a beat, and he continued to talk. Stone spoke until his voice grew hoarse.“Seamus Adams is gone. Apparently, he suffered a terrible auto accident and didn’t survive.”Katie squirmed and mewed softly. Stone frowned. He hated to leave the bed, but if his daughter needed feeding, he supposed he’d better try and take care of her.“Dammit Emma, you’ve held my heart for four seasons. I’ll not walk into the fifth season without you by my side.”Her hand moved. Katie screamed.He didn’t care about his tears this time. He pulled her close and let them fall. “I love you, Emma.”His daughter fisted her little hands and screamed again. As Emma slowly fluttered open her lids, he smiled and kissed her fully on the lips. “Be right back,” he whispered against her mouth.Juggling Katie in his arms, he snatched the buzzer from the side of the bed, pressed the red button and called for the nurse. Stone shuffled to the crib, one eye on Emma and another searching for Katie’s bottle.The nurse from earlier ran into the room. Her eyes widened slightly at his choice of clothing, but she quickly smiled at the look on his face.“She’s awake?”He nodded and stepped back to allow the doctor through. Stone fed Katie. The apprehension curling in the pit of his stomach made him antsy.Emma’s eyes flicked open then closed again.“Mr. Connor, would you come over and continue talking to her?”Stone moved next to her head. Katie slurped loudly on her bottle, and he shuffled her to his shoulder, patting her gently on the back.“Emma, your daughter just burped.” The nurse smiled, and Emma opened her eyes once more. He could see her attempt to focus then her lashes fluttered down.“It’s all right, Mr. Connor. This is perfectly normal. Despite what the movies show you, coma patients don’t just open their eyes and sit up in bed ready to tackle the world. It takes time.”Stone stroked Emma’s head and continued murmuring nonsense. *** Cold. A sudden chill beside her took the warmth away, the warmth that had pulled her from a dark place. At the first pang of heartache, she fluttered her eyes closed and began slipping back to comfort of oblivion.“Stay with me Emma,” a voice spoke above her.Stone.He was here. She hadn’t imagined it.Another warmth spread around her. This one started at her toes and crept up her body, urging her awake.Love.She slowly opened her eyes, again. It hurt. She’d been safe in the black recesses of her mind. The room was dark, lit only by soft flickering flames. Turning her head to the side, she saw Stone peering at her in concern.A little bundle was clutched to his chest. He juggled it gently while holding something against its face. A bottle?Their baby.“Hey,” she said, sounding like a frog, her throat tight and hoarse. She licked her lips and tried to sit up.“Shush, it’s okay. Just rest.”“How long?”“You’ve been in and out of consciousness for the past few hours.”She felt another set of hands checking her pulse. A pair of warm brown eyes peered at her. She smiled at the nurse.“You’ve got a fine man here, Mrs. Connor.”“Mrs…” Emma frowned finding it difficult to focus.“Hush, sweetheart. I’ll explain everything later.” Stone was chuckling as he pressed a kiss to her forehead.“I’m sorry.”“No more apologies.”“I love you.”He nodded and kissed her once more. A warm little body was pressed into her arms, and she bent to stare into the face of her daughter. “I love you more.”His words wrapped around her heart, and she gazed from Stone to her daughter. “She’s beautiful.”“Will you marry me?”Emma smiled, feeling as if she’d just stepped into the sunshine. Unable to speak past the tears clogging her throat, she nodded, wrapping an arm around his neck and pulling him close. Touching her lips to his, she sighed. She was home.",

      "content": "Chapter Eighteen Emma stretched in bed. Glancing out the window, she exhaled in excitement. The first flakes of winter trickled lazily from a low blanket of white clouds. It wasn’t quite Halloween, and the ground lay covered in fluffy white waves.“Stone,” she called.“Down here.”She smiled as she heard him talking to Katie. He must’ve taken the early morning feeding, allowing her to sleep in. Happiness ballooned in her chest, and she laughed out loud.Leaping from beneath the covers, she pulled on her jeans, yanked one of his sweatshirts over her head and padded into the bathroom.A few minutes later she walked down the stairs. The breathtaking view of sparkling paddocks and mountains glittering with snow was easily outshone by the vision of her husband and daughter snuggled together before a roaring fire.“Good morning.”He turned and faced her. Smiling, Stone held a finger to his mouth. “She’s almost asleep.”Emma nodded and went to pour them both a cup of coffee. He rose and settled Katie in her downstairs bassinette, tucking little blankets around her. Walking over, Emma peered in at the beautiful sight of her little baby, snuggled beneath her blankets, eyes closed, safe and secure. “Thanks for getting up.”Stone wrapped an arm around her and held her close. “We’ve a big day today.”“Oh yeah? What’s planned?”“Nate and Hugh are coming over to take Katie,” a wicked grin lighting his face.“And why is that?”He nibbled her ear and a shiver of desire ran down her spine. “I thought we’d carve our pumpkins, and then I’d make you mad so you could smash the insides all over my chest.”Emma grinned. “And I suppose we’d have to take a shower to clean up?”“My thoughts exactly.”“Love you Mr. Connor.” She snuggled against his chest, thinking his idea sounded wonderful.“I love you too, Mrs. Connor. *** Emma watched Stone greet Nate and her father. The tension still swam beneath the surface, but father and son were making great strides at mending their damaged relationship.Time healed.“Okay, kids.” Nate called from his truck. Katie lay nestled in her car seat, securely fastened and ready to spend the day with her grandfathers. “We’ll bring her back in the morning.”“Tomorrow?” Emma went to dash off the front porch and retrieve her daughter, but Stone stopped her.“Easy does it, love. We have a belated honeymoon night coming to us.”“I can’t be apart from Katie.”Stone studied her face and smiled. “Okay, I’m sorry.” He walked over to the truck, and she followed.“Dad, please bring Katie home around eight.”The devastation written across Nate and Hugh’s faces made her laugh. She peered in the window at her daughter and decided that one night would be okay. She grabbed Stone’s hand, inhaled her courage and nodded.“If either one of you old coots teach her any bad habits, I’ll hunt you down and shoot you.”Hugh grinned. “She’s only a wee bairn, Emma. What could we possibly teach her?”“I know,” Emma agreed. “It’s just…”Stone interrupted her and signaled to Nate. “Bring her home. We’ll be back at the house around seven.”“Okay, son.” Nate answered.Emma stumbled after Stone as he pulled her toward the front porch. “Back at the house?”“You need to go change into grungier jeans and hiking boots.”“I thought we were carving pumpkins?”“Oh, we will, but first I have a belated wedding present for you.”“Really?” Emma grinned, her curiosity peaked. “What is it?”“I’m not telling.”“Stone!”“Go get ready.”Emma laughed then raced up the stairs. As soon as she’d been released from the hospital, they’d had a simple wedding. Only immediate family attended. Neither one had been willing to leave Katie, so they’d skipped a formal honeymoon and settled into their new home.She couldn’t begin to guess what this surprise entailed, but as long as Stone was beside her, she’d be happy. *** Stone’s heart raced. He wondered if she’d receive this gift with as much joy as he felt in giving it. The arrangement of everything hadn’t been easy, but Ethan and Seth called an hour ago to confirm that all was in place.Emma walked down the stairs and the sight of her still stole his breath. He figured he was the luckiest man in the world.A beautiful wife.A gorgeous daughter.A perfect life.He held his hand out and she wrapped her fingers around his. “Ready?”“Absolutely, Colonel Connor, lead the way.”“That’d be retired-Colonel Connor.” He chuckled at her exasperation and guided her out the back door. She frowned at him, but he just grinned.“Rex called yesterday, didn’t he?”“Uh-huh.”She tugged on his hand, and he tried not to laugh. “What did he want?”They walked through the first pasture, and he climbed a steep slope leading into the woods. When he turned to help her up the path, she stuck her tongue out at him.“He wants me to consult.”“Oh.”Her audible sigh shocked him. He stopped and gathered her in his arms. “You didn’t think I’d agree to return to active duty, did you?”“I…” Emma dropped her gaze and shrugged. “I wasn’t sure what to think. You sounded so serious on the phone I knew it wasn’t a social call.”Stone closed his eyes, feeling horrible that he’d caused her one second of doubt. “My life is here with you. I’ll never leave, but I need to work – to do something.”She reached up and kissed him. “I understand. I’m sorry I doubted you.”Stone pulled her close, kissing her, allowing her to feel the intensity of his love. “No apologies. Now close your eyes, sweetheart. I’ve something to show you.”He carefully guided her around the bend and positioned her for the best view.“Open your eyes.”After a brief second, she squealed in delight and bounded toward the cabin. “Is it ours? The same one?”Stone nodded and grinned at her excitement. “I promised you.”She stopped and turned slowly. “Yes, you did. Every Christmas…”“Yeah,” he said. “And I figured every Halloween, too.”“Why stop there?” Emma said, launching herself into his arms and kissing him madly. “How about Thanksgiving and Valentines’ Day and Easter and…”“I love you, Emma.” He returned her kiss until they were both breathless with need. Swinging her off her feet, he walked into the cabin and laid her on a familiar blanket, before a familiar fire and made love to his wife with the same tenderness as the night they’d conceived their daughter.

      "title": "Chapter 26",
      "content": "ANGEL FALLSCOMING: FEBRUARY 2013 PREVIEW Brazil, South of the Venezuelan Border Dr. Cassidy Lowell felt the whisper of a defining moment. It presented itself in the form of an obese, crooked-toothed Brazilian miner and the black cylindrical end of a rifle.Waves of perspiration and bad breath assaulted Cassidy, and she fought the urge to back away. A brief scrutiny of the area behind the man fired internal alarms at a level she’d failed to experience since the Niger Delta. Danger silenced the incessant chirping of hordes of insects littering the jungle.Silent rage spread from the edge of the tree line as morning filtered through the heavy canopy of leaves, highlighting men twisted by poisonous work conditions and elemental greed.Cassidy glanced over her shoulder to confirm that her assistant ushered women and children to the back of the rustic village and out of harms way. They’d been studying this small encampment of Yanomami for a little over a fortnight. Indigenous men sat crossed-legged upon the hard packed earth, pretending indifference. The Amazon had become a battlefield, and this once peaceful tribe, its warriors.She refocused on the latest threat. “Señor, can I help you?” Cassidy stepped forward, a gun held loosely against her palm. She handled the weapon as if it were nothing more than something to fiddle with, appearing to put no importance or threat in the Glock.“You the cat doctor?” His voice held the rough edge of too many cigarettes and an abundant amount of tequila.“I’m Dr. Cassidy Lowell a zoologist with the Zoological Environmental Bio Research Agency. I’m certain you’ve heard of ZEBRA, my organization?” Three months in this area and word spread. She knew this man wouldn’t be a fan of ZEBRA’s operation.His eyes roved her body, making her feel dirty and indecent. There was nothing sexy about her well-worn jeans and light weight cotton shirt, but Cassidy supposed based upon his attire she’d appear damn right clean and airy.He tilted his head and swung his rifle downward so that it no longer pointed at her navel. “The jaguar…you are familiar with this animal?”Cassidy smiled and nodded. “I’ve had the privilege of studying a few of them while helping to clear the area of poison.” She purposely challenged him with her eyes. The mercury and cyanide levels in the water were at an all time high caused by mines operated by men such as him. The native people of the Amazon basin were in trouble.He ignored her insinuation and moved closer, dropping his voice an octave lower. “Have you ever seen them hunt together?”Cassidy recoiled slightly at the man’s stench, shook her head and answered. “No. They’re solitary creatures.”“Gatos de fantasmas.” He ran stubby fingers through a head full of greasy hair. “They are here and killing my people.”Cassidy gazed beyond his shoulder at the line of men standing in the shadows. They were a surly bunch, dirty and disheveled. Sweat stained wife-beaters, muddied jeans and angry mouths had drawn her attention earlier but now she recognized the vast amount of bloodied bandages the men wore. “You’re telling me a cat did this?”“Not just one.” The man answered, signaling for the men to move forward.Cassidy had been traveling this region for several months, teaching the Yanomami about the danger of the polluted water and working closely with the Brazilian government to offer up a solution to the land crisis of the Amazon. This was ZEBRA’s official White Stripe mission. Although Cassidy did hold the Special Forces elite Black Stripe status, she hadn’t been briefed on any secret military operations for this assignment.She’d heard rumblings about ghost cats and recently sent a request to ZEBRA to issue approval for an investigation into the rumored albino jaguars.The lead man dropped into silence as Cassidy approached his men. Unpeeling a length of gauze from the closest man’s arm, she scrutinized the wound in the pale morning light. Her nostrils flared at the foul odor of sepsis. “Come with me,” she demanded. “All of you, follow me.”Cassidy strode through the camp waving at Malia, her biologist, to leave the women and children. When Malia reached her side, Cassidy lowered her voice. “We’re in no imminent danger. These men are hurt. Badly. What do we have in medical and where’s the closest doctor?”Malia pulled out her global satellite phone and punched in a few numbers. “I’ll radio for medics from São Gabriel. They can make it here by chopper pretty quick. The med kit should be in our main tent.”“Okay.” Cassidy gently slid one arm around the back of the wounded man and urged him forward. “I don’t know when Jake’s group will return. We need to set up temporary facilities for the wounded.” She urged the man to follow her but froze at a loud snap of gunfire. Caterwauls and screeches of startled animals created a din loud enough to muffle an ensuing attack, disorientating Cassidy.The miner collapsed at her feet, a pool of blood forming on the hard-packed dirt beneath his head.Cassidy’s ears rang with a tinny echo as gunshot filled the camp. Men fell. Their chests ripped apart by the onslaught of bullets, streams of red streaked the dry earth. Panic stricken, Cassidy searched for cover. She inhaled sharply when the lead miner’s head exploded, spattering her white shirt with crimson blood and brain matter.Chaos loomed as bullets rained deadly fire upon the camp. Cassidy dove at Malia, shoving her behind a generator. “Call Jake.” She scrambled forward on her belly, gun held in front and posed to shoot. Her fingers shook and Cassidy willed herself still. Glancing over her shoulder, she noted Malia rooted in fear. “Call Jake! Now!”Shrieks of pain wove between the staccato percussion of AK-47 rifles. Cassidy concentrated on the mundane, isolating the origin of the attack and scrutinizing her defense. She needed to step outside of her comfort zone and think like Jake. Fight like Jake. She gagged as blood wafted from every corner of the tiny village. Innocent lives were hers to protect. At the edge of the tree line, shadows moved. Cassidy saw sparks of muzzles.She’d been trained by the best of the best. Inhale. Exhale. Find the target.Aim.Fire.A body fell.Ignoring the horror that soaked through every essence of her being, Cassidy continued her attack on the invisible shadows in the jungle. Morning sun glinted dangerously, filtering through the leaves in beams of light and marking her targets as it kissed the edge of metal.Death angled in her direction, she rolled avoiding the fire of deadly metal and grabbed a weapon from the grasp of a still miner maintaining her defense against the marauders. Where the hell was Jake?“Kill or be killed,” Cassidy muttered to herself. She moved to the left, bumping into the body of one of the villagers. Her world froze as the face came into focus. Just this morning the man, a Yanomami elder, had shown her a hidden pocket of water and delighted in her discovery of a breathtaking waterfall.Horror slowed time and shock held her breath. A deep righteous anger flooded Cassidy’s soul, sparking revenge and a hatred she hadn’t felt in months. “Bastards,” she screamed and stood glaring at the leafy blockade that shadowed her enemy. *** Jake Anderson, captain of the elite Special Forces Black Stripe ZEBRA squad, heard the gunshot before the call reached his radio. “Duncan,” he yelled signaling to his second in command. “We’ve no time. Let’s go.” Duncan alerted the balance of the men and they snapped weapons into place, discarding all pretense of their scientific cover.They abandoned their attempts at uprooting the stubborn tire of their truck from a muck filled riverbed and fell into formation running at breakneck speed in the direction of the camp.Jake’s heart pounded, fear freezing the blood in his veins. Cassidy was trained, but he’d spent the past year fighting and negotiating with ZEBRA to keep her off Black Stripe assignments. She couldn’t kill a bug let alone a person which left her vulnerable and in extreme danger.Jake calculated the distance. Another few minutes would place them at the camp, but he needed to slow their motion and fan the men outward. There were only five operatives assigned to Cassidy’s pod. Well trained and battle hungry, the men executed their tasks with brilliant precision.They approached from the rear, the advantage theirs. His men began picking off the shooters as Jake edged past toward the heart of the village.In the center, a warrior stood.A blend of strength and steel that stole the breath from his lungs, igniting a heated attraction that flamed from the most visceral edge of his being.She was beautiful.Blond hair fell in loose wavy locks, swirling around slender shoulders as the fighter twisted and turned railing bullets at her enemy. She dropped an emptied rifle and dove forward, gracefully snatching a weapon from a body that no longer had the need of defense. Rising on one knee, shirt torn and tattered, blood streaming from a wound on her upper arm, Cassidy aimed and fired. A movement to her left had Jake seizing his weapon, but she pulled a knife from her belt and tossed it effortlessly into the chest of a man racing toward her.As her bullets were met with silence, Cassidy ceased her attack, rose and turned slowly to meet Jake’s shocked gaze.He fell to his knees, the overwhelming truth of what he’d done to the woman he loved too much to bear. Jake heard his men calling to one another, checking status. He heard the whomp of helicopter blades. He heard the voice of his second in command, yelling for order. But loudest of all, he heard Cassidy whisper his name as she stood, bloodied and victorious, her hands shaking so badly they prevented a clean grip on the weapon dangling from her fingers and an expression of self-loathing on her face that shattered his heart.",

      "content": "Chapter One Emma O’Malley stared out her office window. Sunlight reflected from the river, striking her eyes and making her squint.“The new owner of River Run will be arriving sometime today,” Margaret’s estate lawyer stated in a blunt and matter-of-fact tone, not realizing he was ripping her world apart.The sharp, clipped words hopped an unstoppable merry-go-round in Emma’s mind. She inhaled and exhaled rapid breaths, battling against the suffocating clutches of a full-blown panic attack. “I don’t understand. It can’t be true. It’s not fair.” She cringed inwardly at her whiny teenager-like voice.“There’s not much to understand,” the man said. “Stone Connor is Margaret’s grandson. Please have the resort prepared for a tour and provide him with appropriate accommodations.”Emma avoided eye contact and continued to focus on the scenery beyond the glass pane. Summer kissed the rambling fields with a vibrant green that became blurred and distorted with shock. “You can’t be serious? I know you’re Margaret’s attorney, but you were also her friend. She’d never leave this place to someone she barely knew.”Her world crumbled last week, but she’d survived. Emma’s throat caught, and she pushed down the rock of grief.She’d not only lost a woman she loved dearly, but also fifteen years of happiness, success, and security shattered by the power of the Almighty.Sorrow was still very much an overwhelming camper within Emma’s heart. But now, that pain was being forced aside by an even deeper and well known invader…fear.Losing River Run was something she’d never considered.“Emma, Margaret has provided quite well for you. You have a healthy trust fund, but River Run has passed to her grandson. I’m sorry. I know how much you love the place. He’s mentioned the fact that he’ll be selling the resort. Maybe you can inquire as to a position with the new owners.”“I don’t want her money.” I want River Run, I need River Run.Tilting her head, she listened to her surroundings. Tick tock. Tick tock. The usual comfort the antique grandfather clock afforded suddenly resembled the last thirty-second countdown of her life. Doomsday dead ahead, it clipped.“I’ve an appointment, Emma. As I said, Stone Connor will be arriving today. Now, if you’ll please excuse me. I’ll check back with you after he’s settled.”Emma nodded and rose, shaking the meaty hand of the attorney. “Thanks, Matthew, for coming out here personally and explaining. I’m sorry for my rudeness.”The elderly man smiled and wrapped her in a gruff bear hug. “Life has a funny way of challenging us. I realize this is a huge adjustment for you, but I know deep down that Margaret was only looking out for your best interests. These were not decisions she made lightly.”Emma nodded, swallowed and swore under her breath when a tear escaped the corner of her eye. “I know. I’ll be fine.”As Margaret’s attorney exited the resort, Emma tightened her mouth and inhaled a few sharp breaths. Stone Connor hadn’t even bothered to attend his grandmother’s funeral. His claim to River Run was a travesty. He had no right. With a glance at her desk, she traced the large flourished letters of Margaret’s Last Will and Testament with her fingertip.Fear.Anger.Resentment.Her mind waded through the maze of emotions, trying to find a way out. Every turn of thought increased her frustration until the need to scream scratched her throat.She rose and stalked out of the office and into the main section of the resort. The ten thousand square foot estate nestled in a remote corner of Jackson, Wyoming held five suites. Featuring seven bedrooms, numerous fireplaces, extensive decks, three lounges, pool table, and exercise room, River Run was a favorite retreat for the wealthy. Emma was losing more than her job…she was losing her home.Crossing the main living room, she walked down the stairs to the lower level and entered the first suite to her left. She ran her hands slowly across the down bedding that covered an antique, four-poster bed and smoothed non-existent wrinkles.Emma sighed as her fingers glided against the crisp, white cotton. It felt heavenly soft and called to her with an irresistible invitation to Neverland.Verifying that the dresser and nightstands shone brightly, she nodded in approval when the late morning sun reflected its beams of light upon the gleaming surface. A slight lemon-scent remained from the furniture polish, tickling her nose and springing forth a memory of Margaret performing her daily white-glove inspections.If only she could bring the peaceful surrounding within, it might make the future manageable.A soft chime signaled the approach of a vehicle. Emma installed the underground security wire several years ago after a group of over-zealous reporters tracked one of their celebrity guests to the lodge. The signal was the first alert, the second alert was at the gated front entrance, where you either needed a code to enter or call the office for admittance.Due to the fact that there were no guests this week, she’d released the staff to privately grieve for Margaret and spend personal time with their own families.She hurried up the stairs, jogging down a narrow hall and into the office. Swearing with the voracity of an Irish sheepherder, Emma sat down and stared at the image in the security camera. The slight trembling of her hands an annoyance.It must be him, she thought. Stone Connor currently stood at the end of the long gravel drive. Threatening and dangerously close to the only place she’d ever called home.He was leaning against the front of his Jeep Wrangler, gazing around the massive property. Even though the picture was grainy, she didn’t deny that the man had the presence of someone who knew what he wanted and intended to achieve his goals, at all cost. With a start, she realized he wasn’t admiring the property but taking stock.As if he felt her presence, Stone turned his head and glared into the surveillance camera.Emma gasped then released a shaky laugh. It was impossible for him to know she was watching.Wasn’t it?He was scruffy. And she leaned forward to see what lay beneath the beard and mustache. The picture was too fuzzy, and it was impossible to obtain any idea of his motivation.Her eyes widened when he snarled, shook his head in disgust, and walked around the vehicle. Jumping behind the wheel, he gunned the engine and sped through the gates. Margaret’s attorney must have given him the code, she realized. Resentment sparked and fired.He was coming.Emma began to shake. “Stupid woman. He’s not the enemy.” She inhaled and exhaled several times, attempting to smooth her anxious nerves.Wiping her sweaty palms on the front of her jeans, she walked out of the office, through the kitchen, and opened the large mahogany front door. This was her territory. He might be the owner, but he didn’t belong here.She did.River Run would be hers. *** Stone was irritated.Why hadn’t he been informed of his grandmother’s death? Granted, he’d cut ties a lifetime ago, but someone could have notified him. A small pang of regret and sadness clenched his heart, and Stone quickly doused it. No good to start caring at this late date, but he’d like to have been at the funeral. The old woman hadn’t ever pushed him or pried into his soul like everyone else. She’d been okay in his book…until now.He didn’t understand Margaret Connor’s motivation for leaving him River Run. He didn’t want it.Stone prided himself on being a man with no connections.No strings.No roots.Those only caused pain when Death came to visit. And Death was always there, waiting until the perfect moment to rip into your soul. He knew. He’d seen it.Hundreds of lifeless eyes wavered before his face and behind each set were thousands more filled with an aching anguish no living person should witness.Not for him.Even before he’d entered the Army’s Ranger program, Stone realized the detachment he coveted so dearly was steadfastly established. War merely reaffirmed it.Yet, here was something that threatened to invade his territory. A possession.“Never,” he said softly. He’d sell this place, donate the money somewhere and be on his way.No strings.No roots.No emotion.Pulling the Jeep to the front of the lodge, Stone mentally noted the missing roof shingles and peeling paint. He didn’t care. River Run could rot.The woman framed within the mammoth front doors was another thing all together. She was tiny, but the invisible mini-Teton lodged firmly on her shoulder was an entirely different matter. Dark amber hair swept back from a pixie face in waves of soft curls while green fire crackled from beneath thick lashes. At least, green was the color he imagined. Clad in jeans and a white polo shirt sporting the resort’s logo, she silently challenged him to move forward.Stone hissed between his teeth. This was a complication.Margaret’s attorney had warned him…this woman and River Run were one in the same.Hell, she could have the damn place. In fact, he’d gladly sign it over and be done with it all. Except that wasn’t the provision of the Will. Four seasons. He had to spend four insufferable seasons here.If he didn’t, then possession reverted to his father. And that wouldn’t do.He’d never allow that.And that meant River Run was his for the next twelve months.So, here he was, in an uncontrollable situation. Again. *** “Mr. Connor?” Emma couldn’t believe the man stood there staring at her as if she radiated some sort of black plague. How rude.“Yes, ma’am,” he answered in a gruff, raspy voice. Stepping away from the Jeep he sauntered slowly in her direction. Hands shoved within the pockets of his faded denims, head cocked slightly to the side, eyes roving everywhere and nowhere all at once. What was he searching for?She tried not fidgeting, but her hands twisted together of their own accord. He was taller in person than on the video camera. Thick strands of jet-black hair hung well past his collar adding an element of disheveled danger. “Welcome to River Run.”After an interminable amount of time, Stone Connor reached the front porch. Emma looked up into his face then quickly cast her eyes downward. The emptiness behind his steel blue eyes scared the stuffing out of her. She’d seen that look before. It was the gaze of a trained hunter...a trained murderer.“Thanks,” he said and pushed rudely past her into the resort. Whistling softly, he inspected the kitchen and main living area. “This is some place.”“Yes, yes it is. If you like, I’ll show you around.” Emma moved toward him and pointed to the other end of a small sitting area. “Behind those double doors is the master suite. I’ve done some juggling and rearranged the rooms so that you can occupy that area yourself.” She started to walk past him, but his hand whipped out and grabbed her arm. Emma stilled.“What do you mean juggling?”Emma narrowed her eyes and glared down at the fingers gripping her skin. His voice might sound like something from the crypt, but she’d be dammed if she’d allow him to physically intimidate her.“The rooms are fully booked until the end of the season,” she said, prying his hand off her arm and knocking it away.“Fully booked?” he responded, not paying any heed to the triumphant gleam in Emma’s eyes. “I’m not living with a bunch of people underfoot. Cancel them.”She frowned, closed her eyes, and begged for patience. He’d been granted a gift that Emma would give her left arm for, not her right…because she needed that to run the resort but definitely her left. She swore silently. He was nothing more than a selfish, arrogant, pretentious jerk. Counting back from five, Emma concentrated on calming the anger that threatened to spew forth giving Old Faithful a run for its money.She’d worked long and hard to make River Run attain the status of a five-star resort, and he wanted her to cancel the reservations?“Mr. Connor let me explain...” she paused as he turned angry eyes on her.“No, Miss...What the hell is your name anyway?”“O’Malley, sir. Emma O’Malley. As I was saying before you rudely interrupted, our guests pay a minimum of fifteen thousand dollars per week to vacation here. I doubt you’d want to give the ranch a bad name by canceling these reservations.” Every muscle in her body wanted to fling itself at Stone Connor, knock him back out the front door, and pray he never returned.“Fifteen thousand dollars?” Stone stood there, his mouth hanging open.He looked like the Bass she’d caught several years ago. It was mounted and hung in the living room, a reminder of more carefree days.“Who would pay that to stay here?”“A lot of people, sir. We’re booked solid until the holidays.” Emma wished she could take him to the taxidermy and mount him out front with a plaque that said Rude and Uncaring Grandson.“What? That’s nearly six months away?”“I’m certain you’ll manage. Have you hired a new manager?” Emma swallowed past the lump in her throat. It hurt to imagine someone else performing her duties, duties that she had created and perfected.“A what? What on earth are you going on about?”His eyes were a flat screen of nothing as he stared at her, demanding an explanation. Emma sighed deeply. Slapping the pointy end of her Irish temper back in place, she spoke slowly and deliberately. “A new manager. I’ll be leaving shortly, Mr. Connor, per your wishes.”“I don’t make wishes, Ms. O’Malley. And I certainly don’t recall asking you to leave.”“Are you selling this place or not?” she demanded, her fear making her sound slightly hysterical.“Of course I’m selling.”Emma’s heart battered against her chest. The mere thought of having to begin filling in applications for rent and work ignited a panic that made her feel as if she’d waded into wet concrete. But none of it showed. Her eyes remained calm, her hands clasped firmly against their insistent quaking. “Then I’m leaving.”“You don’t have to leave for another twelve months,” he stated lightly as if it meant no more to him than asking for a piece of paper.Had she heard right? Emma shook her head and glared at the man before her. “What’re you talking about Mr. Connor?”“The provision of the Will is that I remain here for four seasons or else it reverts to someone else.”Furrowing her brow, Emma attempted to process all angles. It seemed to her that his solution stood right before him; but when she went to open her mouth to say so, his hand shot up to silence her.“No more questions,” he grumbled, his voice rough and edgy. “But you can stay, at least until you figure a way to dump these guests.”She bristled at his caustic comment regarding River Run’s patrons. “Mr. Connor may I point out a fact to you?”He sighed and stood silent, raising his brows for her to continue.She shook her head and inhaled in an attempt to not physically smack the arrogance off his face. “If you choose to close River Run, then it won’t be a very profitable business to sell next summer, will it?”Emma’s saw his mind working. His eyes never showed one iota of emotion, but his jaw tensed and he frowned.“I need to think on that.”She offered a half-smile, praying she’d won her first battle. If she could convince him to stay, make the resort work, and show him exactly how valuable an employee she was, maybe he’d reconsider selling.Her identity would be safe.She would be safe.“Don’t look at me like that,” Stone commanded.“Like what?” Emma replied, shocked at his anger.“Like I’m gonna save ya,” he said. “I’m a long time gone from that business.”Emma shook her head and stepped back, slightly discombobulated at his insight. She looked at Stone Connor closely for the first time since he’d arrived. For all she’d been through in her twenty-eight years, Emma had become a very good judge of character. Maybe it was due to her father’s coaching in her early childhood on working the room with visiting political members, but she had an innate ability to read people and instinctively understand what made them tick and how to approach them. It’d been an invaluable asset in managing River Run. She swore when she realized her pre-occupation had blocked this sense.Stone snarled once more and strode past her to the back deck. She recognized the defensive I don’t give a damn armor. It didn’t bother her; two could play that game. She traipsed behind him.“That’s a tributary from the Snake River,” she said, trying to connect on some level, attempting to allow her sixth sense its freedom and provide her with insight.He remained silent. Aloof. Emma studied his face. High cheekbones dropped to a firm, intense mouth. No laugh lines there, she mused. At least she figured there weren’t any -- his entire face was cloaked in hair.She avoided direct contact with his eyes. Their empty, soulless depths bothered her. He topped her by a good foot. Every muscle rippled, tensed to battle some invisible enemy. The fact that Margaret had rarely spoken about Stone suddenly dawned on her.“Over to the left,” she rambled. “Is an old graveyard that belonged to the family who first settled here in the early eighteen hundreds.”She stepped back as he turned to her, piercing her with steely eyes.“Why do I need to know this?”She shrugged, her unease flooding back. “I thought you might be interested,” she said kicking herself internally for her mousy voice.“You thought wrong. Where’d you say my room was?”Squaring her shoulders, Emma met his gaze. “There’s no need to be rude.”“There’s no need to be friendly.”“I wasn’t being friendly, I was being polite. There’s a huge difference. Friendly would mean I care.” Let him fire her. She ignored the stream of fear gurgling beneath her pitiful display of courage. He was a hideous man with no manners, and she’d not tolerate him. A deep rumbling emanated from his chest followed by a derisive snort.Was he laughing at her?She stood as tall as possible, her back as straight as the Lodgepole Pines scattered across the yard. A grin spread across Stone’s face, sending an unfamiliar parade of sizzling sparks along her nerve endings.His eyes lit, and she thought a spark of something flashed within their steel depths, but it was gone as quick as it came.“I think we’ll get along just fine Ms. O’Malley. Just make sure you stay polite,” he said.“Polite won’t be a problem, Mr. Connor. Please follow me. I’ll show you to your room.” Curiosity snuck out from behind her emotional fence and tickled her mind. Stone Connor was an enigma, and it bothered her.They entered the house, and she led him toward the western corner.“Tell me, Ms. O’Malley, how long have you been employed here.”She tensed at his question but quickly realized it was normal under the circumstances. “Fifteen years, Mr. Connor. I’ve lived here for fifteen years.”“You were only a child?” he said, his voice laced with astonishment. “Why would Grandmother hire a child?”“I was more than capable,” she responded icily. She needn’t elaborate on her past. He was prying.“Capable of what? Doing your homework?”“My past really is of no concern to you, Mr. Connor. I’m more than qualified to perform my duties.”Stopping in front of a large wooden door, Emma twisted the glass knob and opened it. She walked into the center of the sitting room for the master suite, verifying everything was in order. With a nod, Emma turned to head out and slammed smack into a concrete wall.Eye level with his chest, she inhaled sharply as his scent invaded her senses.Stone grabbed her upper arms, his fingers tightened painfully, and she winced.Gazing up, her eyes met an entirely different wall. A wall of blue fire that burned right into the center of her soul.“What game are you playing?”“I don’t understand?” Emma said, trying to clear the cobweb of physical awareness that spread across her brain.“You and my grandmother? What game is this? You’ve lived here for fifteen years, and she willed the place to me? If this is some hair-brained scheme to reintroduce me into society, then you can stop the charade right now. I’ll have nothing to do with it.”Emma’s heart was doing a great rendition of a paddleball game. She hated this feeling. “Let go of me, you’re hurting my arms.”“Not until you tell me the truth.”“The truth?” She cringed as her voice rose several octaves. “I don’t understand this madness any more than you do. I created this place. I brought the clientele here. I wanted nothing in return but a little security. Nothing but a home to stay in.” Her voice rose in crescendo until she practically screamed the last few words at him.He released her in obvious shock. She swallowed quickly controlling anymore words from spewing forth and continuing this regrettable outburst. “I’m entitled to my rages as well, you know. You haven’t cornered the market yet,” she said, fighting to regain her internal balance.He flashed that grin again. Emma ignored the gone-over-the-hill-too-fast-left-my-tummy-behind jig feeling it evoked.She needed air. “I’ll be preparing dinner for eight o’clock, until then help yourself to whatever you want in the kitchen.”Emma spun and exited the suite before she did something stupid like slug him. These were uncommon urges for her and extremely unsettling. She raced through the resort into the comforting environment of her private apartment.Emma paced from cubby-sized room to cubby-sized room, absently rearranging knick-knacks given as parting gifts from appreciative guests.Space.She needed space. Stripping out of her jeans and into a pair of grungy khaki gardening shorts, Emma knotted her hair on top of her head and headed outside.Retrieving a rusty blue wheelbarrow from the barn, she piled her pruning shears and gloves inside.The scent of hay and the warm summer sun smoothed her tangled emotions. Emma wove between the white hens that were scattered across the barnyard and headed out past the horse pasture.“Tomorrow would be a good day to gather eggs,” she said to herself, realizing she’d forgotten this morning.She couldn’t prevent the giggle that emerged as the back of her legs were nudged by little furry heads. Rhett and Scarlet, the resort’s pair of Pygmy Goats, danced behind her. They followed her happily, frolicking in the grass and chasing butterflies. Passing a grove of quaking aspens, Emma arrived at her destination.A patch of wildflowers grew in abundance, shimmering beneath the sunlight in an ocean of blues, purples and yellows. Emma carefully selected the flowers she wished to display, clipped them, and placed them gently in the wheelbarrow. She then knelt and pulled at the stubborn weeds sprouting from between the carefully laid brick border. She smiled at the silly antics of the goats. They were everywhere. In her garden, down the field, back to the garden, and up to the house.It was times like this that all her troubles faded away. Life was good and wonderful. The velvet petals on her Black Eyed Susans were a miracle of nature, fragile yet sturdy enough to battle the stiff western breeze that blew through the valley.Emma inhaled the sweet afternoon scent. Suddenly, things weren’t all that bad. She’d tolerate Stone Connor, and maybe…somehow, talk him into keeping River Run. Her heart swelled to near bursting at the thought of not having to leave the ranch.A loud curse and panicked squeal spurred Emma out of her daydreams and into a dead run. She raced up the hill, the goats grunting happily as they nipped at her heels. Hurdling the white picket fence outside the master bedroom, she darted through the open French doors and discovered what she’d feared.Stone, crouched in a fighter’s stance, waved a malicious looking knife at the one thing she valued more than River Run.",

He had to spend four insufferable seasons here.If he didn’t, then possession reverted to his father. And that wouldn’t do.He’d never allow that.And that meant River Run was his for the next twelve months.So, here he was, in an uncontrollable situation. Again. *** “Mr. Connor?” Emma couldn’t believe the man stood there staring at her as if she radiated some sort of black plague. How rude.“Yes, ma’am,” he answered in a gruff, raspy voice. Stepping away from the Jeep he sauntered slowly in her direction. Hands shoved within the pockets of his faded denims, head cocked slightly to the side, eyes roving everywhere and nowhere all at once. What was he searching for?She tried not fidgeting, but her hands twisted together of their own accord. He was taller in person than on the video camera. Thick strands of jet-black hair hung well past his collar adding an element of disheveled danger. “Welcome to River Run.”After an interminable amount of time, Stone Connor reached the front porch. Emma looked up into his face then quickly cast her eyes downward. The emptiness behind his steel blue eyes scared the stuffing out of her. She’d seen that look before. It was the gaze of a trained hunter...a trained murderer.“Thanks,” he said and pushed rudely past her into the resort. Whistling softly, he inspected the kitchen and main living area. “This is some place.”“Yes, yes it is. If you like, I’ll show you around.” Emma moved toward him and pointed to the other end of a small sitting area. “Behind those double doors is the master suite. I’ve done some juggling and rearranged the rooms so that you can occupy that area yourself.” She started to walk past him, but his hand whipped out and grabbed her arm. Emma stilled.“What do you mean juggling?”Emma narrowed her eyes and glared down at the fingers gripping her skin. His voice might sound like something from the crypt, but she’d be dammed if she’d allow him to physically intimidate her.“The rooms are fully booked until the end of the season,” she said, prying his hand off her arm and knocking it away.“Fully booked?” he responded, not paying any heed to the triumphant gleam in Emma’s eyes. “I’m not living with a bunch of people underfoot. Cancel them.”She frowned, closed her eyes, and begged for patience. He’d been granted a gift that Emma would give her left arm for, not her right…because she needed that to run the resort but definitely her left. She swore silently. He was nothing more than a selfish, arrogant, pretentious jerk. Counting back from five, Emma concentrated on calming the anger that threatened to spew forth giving Old Faithful a run for its money.She’d worked long and hard to make River Run attain the status of a five-star resort, and he wanted her to cancel the reservations?“Mr. Connor let me explain...” she paused as he turned angry eyes on her.“No, Miss...What the hell is your name anyway?”“O’Malley, sir. Emma O’Malley. As I was saying before you rudely interrupted, our guests pay a minimum of fifteen thousand dollars per week to vacation here. I doubt you’d want to give the ranch a bad name by canceling these reservations.” Every muscle in her body wanted to fling itself at Stone Connor, knock him back out the front door, and pray he never returned.“Fifteen thousand dollars?” Stone stood there, his mouth hanging open.He looked like the Bass she’d caught several years ago. It was mounted and hung in the living room, a reminder of more carefree days.“Who would pay that to stay here?”“A lot of people, sir. We’re booked solid until the holidays.” Emma wished she could take him to the taxidermy and mount him out front with a plaque that said Rude and Uncaring Grandson.“What? That’s nearly six months away?”“I’m certain you’ll manage. Have you hired a new manager?” Emma swallowed past the lump in her throat. It hurt to imagine someone else performing her duties, duties that she had created and perfected.“A what? What on earth are you going on about?”His eyes were a flat screen of nothing as he stared at her, demanding an explanation. Emma sighed deeply. Slapping the pointy end of her Irish temper back in place, she spoke slowly and deliberately. “A new manager. I’ll be leaving shortly, Mr. Connor, per your wishes.”“I don’t make wishes, Ms. O’Malley. And I certainly don’t recall asking you to leave.”“Are you selling this place or not?” she demanded, her fear making her sound slightly hysterical.“Of course I’m selling.”Emma’s heart battered against her chest. The mere thought of having to begin filling in applications for rent and work ignited a panic that made her feel as if she’d waded into wet concrete. But none of it showed. Her eyes remained calm, her hands clasped firmly against their insistent quaking. “Then I’m leaving.”“You don’t have to leave for another twelve months,” he stated lightly as if it meant no more to him than asking for a piece of paper.Had she heard right? Emma shook her head and glared at the man before her. “What’re you talking about Mr. Connor?”“The provision of the Will is that I remain here for four seasons or else it reverts to someone else.”Furrowing her brow, Emma attempted to process all angles. It seemed to her that his solution stood right before him; but when she went to open her mouth to say so, his hand shot up to silence her.“No more questions,” he grumbled, his voice rough and edgy. “But you can stay, at least until you figure a way to dump these guests.”She bristled at his caustic comment regarding River Run’s patrons. “Mr. Connor may I point out a fact to you?”He sighed and stood silent, raising his brows for her to continue.She shook her head and inhaled in an attempt to not physically smack the arrogance off his face. “If you choose to close River Run, then it won’t be a very profitable business to sell next summer, will it?”Emma’s saw his mind working. His eyes never showed one iota of emotion, but his jaw tensed and he frowned.“I need to think on that.”She offered a half-smile, praying she’d won her first battle. If she could convince him to stay, make the resort work, and show him exactly how valuable an employee she was, maybe he’d reconsider selling.Her identity would be safe.She would be safe.“Don’t look at me like that,” Stone commanded.“Like what?” Emma replied, shocked at his anger.“Like I’m gonna save ya,” he said. “I’m a long time gone from that business.”Emma shook her head and stepped back, slightly discombobulated at his insight. She looked at Stone Connor closely for the first time since he’d arrived. For all she’d been through in her twenty-eight years, Emma had become a very good judge of character. Maybe it was due to her father’s coaching in her early childhood on working the room with visiting political members, but she had an innate ability to read people and instinctively understand what made them tick and how to approach them. It’d been an invaluable asset in managing River Run. She swore when she realized her pre-occupation had blocked this sense.Stone snarled once more and strode past her to the back deck. She recognized the defensive I don’t give a damn armor. It didn’t bother her; two could play that game. She traipsed behind him.“That’s a tributary from the Snake River,” she said, trying to connect on some level, attempting to allow her sixth sense its freedom and provide her with insight.He remained silent. Aloof. Emma studied his face. High cheekbones dropped to a firm, intense mouth. No laugh lines there, she mused. At least she figured there weren’t any -- his entire face was cloaked in hair.She avoided direct contact with his eyes. Their empty, soulless depths bothered her. He topped her by a good foot. Every muscle rippled, tensed to battle some invisible enemy. The fact that Margaret had rarely spoken about Stone suddenly dawned on her.“Over to the left,” she rambled. “Is an old graveyard that belonged to the family who first settled here in the early eighteen hundreds.”She stepped back as he turned to her, piercing her with steely eyes.“Why do I need to know this?”She shrugged, her unease flooding back. “I thought you might be interested,” she said kicking herself internally for her mousy voice.“You thought wrong. Where’d you say my room was?”Squaring her shoulders, Emma met his gaze. “There’s no need to be rude.”“There’s no need to be friendly.”“I wasn’t being friendly, I was being polite. There’s a huge difference. Friendly would mean I care.” Let him fire her. She ignored the stream of fear gurgling beneath her pitiful display of courage. He was a hideous man with no manners, and she’d not tolerate him. A deep rumbling emanated from his chest followed by a derisive snort.Was he laughing at her?She stood as tall as possible, her back as straight as the Lodgepole Pines scattered across the yard. A grin spread across Stone’s face, sending an unfamiliar parade of sizzling sparks along her nerve endings.His eyes lit, and she thought a spark of something flashed within their steel depths, but it was gone as quick as it came.“I think we’ll get along just fine Ms. O’Malley. Just make sure you stay polite,” he said.“Polite won’t be a problem, Mr. Connor. Please follow me. I’ll show you to your room.” Curiosity snuck out from behind her emotional fence and tickled her mind. Stone Connor was an enigma, and it bothered her.They entered the house, and she led him toward the western corner.“Tell me, Ms. O’Malley, how long have you been employed here.”She tensed at his question but quickly realized it was normal under the circumstances. “Fifteen years, Mr. Connor. I’ve lived here for fifteen years.”“You were only a child?” he said, his voice laced with astonishment. “Why would Grandmother hire a child?”“I was more than capable,” she responded icily. She needn’t elaborate on her past. He was prying.“Capable of what? Doing your homework?”“My past really is of no concern to you, Mr. Connor. I’m more than qualified to perform my duties.”Stopping in front of a large wooden door, Emma twisted the glass knob and opened it. She walked into the center of the sitting room for the master suite, verifying everything was in order. With a nod, Emma turned to head out and slammed smack into a concrete wall.Eye level with his chest, she inhaled sharply as his scent invaded her senses.Stone grabbed her upper arms, his fingers tightened painfully, and she winced.Gazing up, her eyes met an entirely different wall. A wall of blue fire that burned right into the center of her soul.“What game are you playing?”“I don’t understand?” Emma said, trying to clear the cobweb of physical awareness that spread across her brain.“You and my grandmother? What game is this? You’ve lived here for fifteen years, and she willed the place to me? If this is some hair-brained scheme to reintroduce me into society, then you can stop the charade right now. I’ll have nothing to do with it.”Emma’s heart was doing a great rendition of a paddleball game. She hated this feeling. “Let go of me, you’re hurting my arms.”“Not until you tell me the truth.”“The truth?” She cringed as her voice rose several octaves. “I don’t understand this madness any more than you do. I created this place. I brought the clientele here. I wanted nothing in return but a little security. Nothing but a home to stay in.” Her voice rose in crescendo until she practically screamed the last few words at him.He released her in obvious shock. She swallowed quickly controlling anymore words from spewing forth and continuing this regrettable outburst. “I’m entitled to my rages as well, you know. You haven’t cornered the market yet,” she said, fighting to regain her internal balance.He flashed that grin again. Emma ignored the gone-over-the-hill-too-fast-left-my-tummy-behind jig feeling it evoked.She needed air. “I’ll be preparing dinner for eight o’clock, until then help yourself to whatever you want in the kitchen.”Emma spun and exited the suite before she did something stupid like slug him. These were uncommon urges for her and extremely unsettling. She raced through the resort into the comforting environment of her private apartment.Emma paced from cubby-sized room to cubby-sized room, absently rearranging knick-knacks given as parting gifts from appreciative guests.Space.She needed space. Stripping out of her jeans and into a pair of grungy khaki gardening shorts, Emma knotted her hair on top of her head and headed outside.Retrieving a rusty blue wheelbarrow from the barn, she piled her pruning shears and gloves inside.The scent of hay and the warm summer sun smoothed her tangled emotions. Emma wove between the white hens that were scattered across the barnyard and headed out past the horse pasture.“Tomorrow would be a good day to gather eggs,” she said to herself, realizing she’d forgotten this morning.She couldn’t prevent the giggle that emerged as the back of her legs were nudged by little furry heads. Rhett and Scarlet, the resort’s pair of Pygmy Goats, danced behind her. They followed her happily, frolicking in the grass and chasing butterflies. Passing a grove of quaking aspens, Emma arrived at her destination.A patch of wildflowers grew in abundance, shimmering beneath the sunlight in an ocean of blues, purples and yellows. Emma carefully selected the flowers she wished to display, clipped them, and placed them gently in the wheelbarrow. She then knelt and pulled at the stubborn weeds sprouting from between the carefully laid brick border. She smiled at the silly antics of the goats. They were everywhere. In her garden, down the field, back to the garden, and up to the house.It was times like this that all her troubles faded away. Life was good and wonderful. The velvet petals on her Black Eyed Susans were a miracle of nature, fragile yet sturdy enough to battle the stiff western breeze that blew through the valley.Emma inhaled the sweet afternoon scent. Suddenly, things weren’t all that bad. She’d tolerate Stone Connor, and maybe…somehow, talk him into keeping River Run. Her heart swelled to near bursting at the thought of not having to leave the ranch.A loud curse and panicked squeal spurred Emma out of her daydreams and into a dead run. She raced up the hill, the goats grunting happily as they nipped at her heels. Hurdling the white picket fence outside the master bedroom, she darted through the open French doors and discovered what she’d feared.Stone, crouched in a fighter’s stance, waved a malicious looking knife at the one thing she valued more than River Run.",

      "content": "Chapter Two Small, beady eyes flared with rage. Stone shuffled sideways, careful not to make any aggressive movements.“Easy, boy…nice pig.”It moved closer and snarled, displaying an amazing amount of jagged, yellow teeth. Stone made a quick survey of the room. He didn’t want to inflict too much damage, but if the pig charged he’d be forced to go for the jugular. Blood would be everywhere.“Put that knife away, Mr. Connor,” Emma O’Malley demanded, pushing in front of the rabid, walking roast and glaring fiercely at him. He didn’t know what to do first. Kill the pig or kill the pain-in-the-butt-know-it-all resort manager.“Get back, Ms. O’Malley. I know what I’m doing.” He crouched lower as Porkchop snarled louder.“She’s not dangerous. Put your weapon away.”“I don’t think so, ma’am. That hunk’o’ham’s about to make me the laughing stock of Jackson Hole.”“You’re right about that. It doesn’t take much of a man to kill a defenseless old pig.”His eyes widened when the woman actually knelt down and wrapped her arms around the ugly round critter. This was certainly no Wilbur. Its hide was covered with gray, bristly hair and a layer of green slime decorated its snout. By her actions, it was clear Emma O’Malley loved this disgusting creature.Snapping his knife shut, he listened as she spoke in a honey tone of soothing words that spread a disquieting flicker of sensation down his spine.“I was referring to the fact that I’d make the front page news as being the first human to ever die from a rabid pig,” he said, straightening up and backing further away from the odd couple sitting in the middle of his bedroom.The woman turned watery green eyes in his direction, causing a lump to form at the back of his throat. She looked sad, as if someone had yanked the world right out from beneath her milk and honey perfection.“Pocahontas isn’t rabid. In fact, she thinks you’re the intruder here. The only thing she did wrong was assume that this was my room.”“And is it?” Stone concentrated on maintaining a straight face and not responding to the pig’s name. Who in their right mind would name an ugly, old pig Pocahontas?“Is what?”“Is this your room?” He frowned as she continued to croon softly and stroke the pig’s side.“Not anymore,” she sighed. “It seems River Run is under new management.”“Oh for cryin’ out loud, I already told you that your stay here has been expanded to a year. How long will it take you to find a new place and a new job?”“Forever,” she said. Without so much as a see-ya-later, Emma O’Malley stood up, shuffled the filet of flesh out the door and exited the suite. He swore the three-hundred-pound pork chop smirked at him before disappearing around the corner.Stone stood within the silent confines of the master suite. Running his fingers through his mop of hair, he suddenly realized the enormity of what’d been handed him.He didn’t want to be responsible. The bullet that tore through his upper torso more than a year ago left a bigger emotional scar than the visible puckered skin around his shoulder.Inability to make decisions.No longer a leader.Scared of Death.But not scared to die. Oh no, he wasn’t scared to die. In fact, he’d tried to stay with his men...die with them. But that damn baby was pushed into his arms, and he’d made a dash for safety, leaving behind the cries of pain and the only family he’d acknowledge. Dead. All of them. Killed in a massacre the world would never know about.They’d asked him to retire...said it was for the best. Said he should have a life filled with happiness and not war. What did they know?Stone walked into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. He flipped the silver knob to the shower and waited for steam to fill the room. Glancing around, his mind fantasized imagining Emma O’Malley languishing in the marble jacuzzi or standing beneath the wide spray of water from the showerhead. He could almost see her sheer, silken nightgown, white as a lily with no other adornments but the glow of her flawless skin. Shaking his head, he realized he did see her nightgown. It was hanging on a hook on the back of the door.He guessed that confirmed her answer. She must occupy these rooms when the place was empty.Stepping beneath the stream of hot water, Stone concentrated on what he faced.Disregarding the faint stirrings of a physical attraction, he figured he didn’t particularly care for the prickly Miss O’Malley. But if she was willing to run the day-to-day operation of the resort, then he supposed he’d better get used to her.What other choice did he have? Allow his father to inherit? He wouldn’t give that man one thing that belonged to him, not even if it meant living with a million different people over the next twelve months.Stepping out of the shower, he grabbed a towel and spent a quick second in appreciation of the thick Egyptian cloth.He’d never been one for luxury, but he had to admit it had its perks.Staring in the mirror, he toyed with the idea of shaving. He wouldn’t do that, fighting a quick pang of fear at having to face his clean-shaven image. That man was a killer. He didn’t want to see that person again.Stone pulled on his jeans and an army-issued t-shirt and walked out the French doors. He looked around, ignoring the breathtaking vista that lay before him. There’d been a time when the mountainous range of the Grand Tetons embraced him in their beauty, grabbing his breath, and making him thankful to be alive.But time passed. He was no longer thankful to be alive and didn’t want to acknowledge the wonders that surrounded him.A radio blared from above, and he climbed the wooden stairs that led to the back deck. Sliding silently between the open double doors, Stone stole a few moments to absorb the woman before him.Emma O’Malley, chief cook and bottle washer, moved gracefully around the kitchen. Her back was to Stone. He admired her quick, precise motions. The way her faded jeans hugged her entirely too enticing derriere as she pulled vegetables from the refrigerator, rinsing, then chopping. He frowned when she wiped the back of her hand across her face.Why was she crying?He hated tears. Backing away, Stone stumbled over a needlepoint-covered footstool and knocked a stack of books off the coffee table. He closed his eyes at the outburst sure to follow.“Are you spying on me?” Emma demanded.“I wasn’t spying,” he grunted, picking up the books and replacing them on the table.“Yes, you were,” she said.“Why are you crying?” He stood up and looked straight at her tear-stained face. Green eyes flashed back through wet lashes and a blush that would make a strawberry patch proud spread across her face.“I’m not crying.”“And I’m not spying.” He threw her what he prayed was a dangerous glare and retreated back through the French doors. Enough of that. Tears and sadness were nothing he could help with. Glancing up at the roof, he frowned. It needed a bunch more shingles and the entire estate could use a fresh coat of paint. If he wanted a quick sale, he’d have to spruce it up.“I was not crying,” a loud voice called behind him. Sighing, he turned and faced the angry woman.“I guess I was wrong then, but it seems to me that tearstains and wet lashes are definitely tell-tale signs of crying.”“This is what’s making my face all funny,” she said, waving a large yellow onion at him. She brought it closer and shoved it beneath his nose. “I don’t waste time on emotional release, it’s too draining.”“I see,” he said, pushing the offending vegetable away. “I apologize for jumping to conclusions.” His eyes widened as a fresh batch of tears pooled in a sudden emerald ocean. She pursed her lower lip and turned away. “Hey, I’m sorry, okay?” he said.“Shut up,” she retorted, a slight waver to her voice. “I’m not crying.”“I can see that,” he said, although he was certain that this time she was definitely crying, especially when the tears spilled over her bottom lashes and snaked lazily down her cheek.“Good, I’m glad you understand my position,” she hiccupped. Waving the knife in his face, she began to say something but stopped when the blade fell off and clattered to the deck. She bent down spewing words that burned even his well-seasoned ears.He was trying very hard not to laugh. It would be mean to laugh, but her language tickled something he’d thought dead a long time ago. “You’d better take your onion back to the kitchen before it has you sobbing.”“Thank you, I’ll do just that.” Emma O’Malley turned to walk back into the kitchen. She glanced one last time over her shoulder, and Stone knew he’d better run…which is exactly what he did. Spinning on his heels, he dashed back down the deck, around the end of the house, and into the safety of the master suite.As soon as the glass doors were shut, he burst out laughing. He laughed so hard, his side hurt. How would his therapist define this behavior? Insanity, he figured.“I have no clue what you’re laughing at,” she said, stopping his heart and scaring him silly.“Where’d you come from?” he gasped.She pointed to the main entrance to his room and swept past him to the bathroom door. “I believe I left something here.”“Yes, you did,” he grinned and started to laugh again. He didn’t understand why this woman’s discomfort made him want to sit down and haul her onto his lap. He wiped his watering eyes and sat down on the bed.“Are you crying?” she asked, an innocent tone to her voice that sent warning signals zinging around his brain.“No, are you spying?” he said.She smiled slightly, a spark of amusement dancing in her eyes. “This was my room.”“You can have it back.”“I don’t want it. I want River Run.”“I can’t do that, I’m sorry.”“I understand.” Emma turned and reached behind the bathroom door. Snagging her nightgown, she wrapped it into a small ball. “I’m sorry I bothered you.”“I’m positive you don’t understand, Ms. O’Malley.” Stone heard the sharp tones to his voice and winced as the fragile string of friendly banter snapped. Just as well, he thought. The fear of this woman suddenly escalated from zero to ten. She was dangerous.She made him feel. *** Emma stalked behind her desk and sank into the worn leather chair that had seen River Run from its days of barely being able to pay the mortgage to its current status. Her fist still clutched the soft fabric of her nightgown.She’d been furious to find him attacking Pocahontas. The Pot Bellied pig was her last link to love and affection. Nate Connor handed her over when Emma first arrived, and she’d latched onto the squirmy, tiny piglet with all the adoration her young heart held. She’d accepted the responsibility and worked hard to make the pig happy. The pet was her lifeline back to reality and away from the horror that often invaded her sleep.Stone was nothing like his father. He’d never offer a kind hand to a kid in need.But he was right about one thing, she didn’t understand. Margaret promised to provide for her, keep her secret, and keep her safe. She’d promised.Her throat caught, and she stifled the sob that threatened to break forth. Closing her eyes, Emma rested her head on the back of the chair. How could she be angry with a ghost? A woman she loved, no less. It wasn’t right. Of course, Margaret would’ve wanted to leave River Run to one of her descendants. It’d been in the Connor family for more than a hundred years.But why hadn’t she left it to Nate?“Just deal with it, O’Malley.” Standing up, Emma headed into the small munchkin-size room she used when the resort was full. She tossed the nightgown on the bed and went to her closet. Standing on her tiptoes, her fingers searched the recesses of the upper shelves finally latching onto the cool surface of a metal strongbox.She pulled it down and caressed the surface lovingly. It’d been too long since she’d sifted through the contents and a little bubble of anticipation rattled in her stomach.Flipping open the lid, Emma settled on the edge of her bed. She carefully pulled out a stack of photographs. Her mother’s bright smile prompted her to smile in return, but it quickly faded into a frown as memories crashed forth shattering the peace.Ireland, a country she barely remembered. The pungent aroma of spiced sausages and yeasty mugs of ale invaded her mind but the surroundings were only shadows. Echoes of laughter and happy carousing skimmed across her ears, but she didn’t know why they were there. She couldn’t remember.“Hey,” a deep voice crashed into the silence of her room, causing her to jump off the bed and spill the contents of the strongbox across the floor.“What’s the matter with you?” she said. “You scared the hell out of me.”“Sorry,” he answered, kneeling down to gather up the loose papers scattered on the carpet.“I’ll get those,” she cried, suddenly panic ridden at the thought of discovery. What a fool she’d been keeping these incriminating items in her possession.“Who’s this?” he asked, handing her a picture. She glanced down at the faces smiling brightly into the camera lens.“My parents.”“Where are they?”“Dead,” she answered, unable to prevent the flicker of glassy eyes and rivers of blood that replaced the couple in the color photo.Her father, Hugh Gallagher, battled all his life against the Provisional IRA. He’d viewed them as nothing more than glorified terrorists. Working furiously to aid in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, his life came to an abrupt halt when her mother was brutally murdered in their home...a violent act that shouldn’t have a place in the memory of a thirteen-year old.“I’m sorry, Emma.” His gentle voice shocked her, and she frowned at him.“Nothing to be sorry about. It was a long time ago,” she said, stuffing the documents back into the safety of her strongbox. This alarm at discovery restated how insecure she’d become. “What can I do for you?”“Not a thing,” he answered, pausing to read an article. “What’s this?”She peered over his shoulder and tried to not let apprehension reach out and betray her. “What does it look like?”“A newspaper article.”“You win first prize, Mr. Connor. I’m happy to see you can read.” She reached over and grabbed the yellowed sheet of paper.“Why do you have an article on the Good Friday Agreement?”“I’m a proper Irish Catholic and keep up on my politics,” she said.“I buy that, but that still doesn’t answer my questions.”“Too bad,” she hissed, relieved that he’d obviously missed the printed names of party members and their families. It wouldn’t take a brain surgeon to connect Emilie Gallagher with Emma O’Malley. “Now, if you don’t need anything then what’re you doing here?”He stared at her.She swallowed the lump in her throat, refusing to acknowledge her fear and insecurity.“I came to apologize, but…” he shrugged, standing up with the grace of a panther, “it seems I’ve only intruded further.”“Apologize for what?” she asked, trying to direct the conversation away from the contents of her box.“For laughing at you. It was rude.” Stone backed out of her room and leaned against the jamb. “I didn’t mean anything by it, and I’m sorry I didn’t respect your privacy. We need to learn to live together, and I was wrong. Again, I’m sorry.” As silently as he’d arrived, Stone Connor disappeared.“How does he do that?”Reaching up and removing the clip from her hair, Emma exhaled a frustrated breath. She snapped the lid closed on the strongbox. One day, she wanted to see these pictures and think of only the happy days. That time wasn’t yet, and if she retained possession of these documents, it might never arrive.But the thought of burning the only link to her heritage created a cavern of sadness large enough to swallow her whole. Absently scratching her head, she ran her fingers through her hair, untangling the snagged clumps.With a quick glance out the window, she realized the sun no longer burned bright but had faded to a late afternoon pale yellow. Time to shower and change then prepare to face Stone. Emma craved peace, but her current predicament guaranteed the opposite. *** Emma lit the last candle and stood back to survey the dinner table. She’d decided on an outdoor meal. The brilliant red of the dying sun burned fiercely in the background casting a soft glow across the backyard. The grill sizzled with seasoned steaks, scalloped potatoes, and thick, marinated asparagus. Her mouth watered at the tantalizing aroma of garlic and onions.She heard Stone clear his voice before walking onto the deck. Turning, a polite smile in place, Emma welcomed him to dinner. “I thought that you might like a sampling of River Run hospitality. Most guests prefer to eat here, and I think it would help for you to experience a bit of the atmosphere we provide.” She noted he’d cleaned up still appeared to be a disheveled wreck, with long hair and scraggly beard. His jeans were clean but well-worn with the knees shredded enough to reveal skin. The dark, long-sleeved shirt bore the name of a football team she vaguely recognized. However, it was the edge of muscle beneath the fabric that bothered her in a way she didn’t want to acknowledge.“Whatever,” he grunted and slid into one of the wooden deck chairs surrounding the small table.Emma shook her head and ignored his bad manners. Consoling herself with the fact that in a few days the place would be bustling with activity, she served the platter of savory meat. Stone dug into his food with the relish of a starved man. He finished his steak, had several helpings of the sliced potatoes and onions and polished off most of the asparagus. Peering at her plate, his eyes sparked when he saw how much meat still remained.“Here,” she sighed in exasperation. “Take it.” Pushing the plate toward him, she couldn’t help but laugh in amazement when he scooped up the meat, giving her a cheeky grin, and scarfing it down in several quick bites.“Thanks,” he mumbled, still chewing. “I can’t tell you the last time I’ve eaten this well.”“You certainly don’t appear to be starving.”“I said eaten this well, not eaten. I consume food for energy, but this…” he pointed his knife around the table. “This is heaven.”“Thanks, I think,” she said.Resting his knife on the edge of the plate, he tossed his napkin on the table and settled back in the chair. Emma started to blush as his eyes raked her from top to bottom, scrutinizing every part of her body. He reached for the red wine and poured himself a liberal helping.“We need to set the game rules in place,” he said after savoring the dry, heady Cabernet.She gulped down a swallow herself and attempted to look at him with as much brazen audacity as he did her. “Game rules?”“Yes. We’ve an entire year to spend beneath this roof and it won’t due for us to be at constant odds and tip-toeing around one another. I don’t feel like being an invader in a hostile camp.”Emma nodded. “I hadn’t meant to make you feel that way. I suppose I’m the one that owes you an apology.” As much as she hated to admit it, he made sense.Stone shook his head and held his hand up to ward off her sputtering. “No more apologies, and no more invasions of privacy. I won’t ask personal questions, and you’ll provide me with the same respect. I shouldn’t have pried earlier. We’re employer and employee and that’s how things need to remain. I expect you to run this resort with the same efficiency and strive for success that you offered my grandmother. In return, I’ll do what I can to ensure that the new owners maintain your services. In the meantime, I’ll begin work on sprucing up the exterior and doing whatever you deem necessary to continue our five-star rating. Is that agreeable?”“Yes,” she whispered, more than a little shocked that he wasn’t being more difficult.“Do you want your rooms back?”“Oh no, I only use them when we’re on downtime like this week. I’m fine where I am, but thank you.”“Okay.” Stretching his legs he rose from the table. “Good night.”“Good night,” she said, successfully hiding the sadness she felt because he was leaving.He paused before entering the house. “By the way,” he said, turning to face her. “Keep your watch-pig away from me.”“Pocahontas?”“Yeah, Porkahontas.”She glared at him and started to rise. Of all the insulting, conceited, ignorant things this man could do, stooping to the level of calling her pig names appeared downright childish in her book.“Pocahontas will remain in the barn.”“What’s the matter?”“What?” She knew she sounded curt, but her anger wouldn’t stay in the background.“You’re frowning. What’s the matter?”“Nothing,” she said. “My brain’s just rushing through everything that needs to get done before the weekend. I’ll see you tomorrow.”He grinned and winked. Emma’s eyes widened when she realized he’d been teasing her. All sorts of foreign reactions sprung forth from within, including little flashes of heat that burned from the pit of her stomach down to the tips of her toes. Damn those muscles.She glowered at the man before her and ignored the throat-tightening response to his wicked smile.“You’re still frowning.”“Don’t make fun of Pocahontas,” she said.Tilting his head back, he laughed loudly.“I’ll make a note of it.” Stone turned and walked into the house. “Let’s meet in the morning to review what needs to be done. I’ll help you prepare for the weekend.”Suddenly the space without Stone Connor seemed too quiet and too empty. “Sure, no problem,” she said absently, watching as he retreated through the living room and back toward the master suite. Picking up the half-full bottle of wine, she filled her glass. With a sigh, she settled in to enjoy the cool evening air. Alone. *** Stone reached his room. His heart beat like a manic drummer, and he crossed the hardwood floors in five angry strides. Flinging open the French doors, he inhaled the crisp air. He’d done it. Made his speech and escaped.The atmosphere, the dinner, the attraction that bristled beneath the well-protected layer of emotional detachment he and Emma devised, accumulated into an extremely volatile grenade.

      "content": "Chapter Two Small, beady eyes flared with rage. Stone shuffled sideways, careful not to make any aggressive movements.“Easy, boy…nice pig.”It moved closer and snarled, displaying an amazing amount of jagged, yellow teeth. Stone made a quick survey of the room. He didn’t want to inflict too much damage, but if the pig charged he’d be forced to go for the jugular. Blood would be everywhere.“Put that knife away, Mr. Connor,” Emma O’Malley demanded, pushing in front of the rabid, walking roast and glaring fiercely at him. He didn’t know what to do first. Kill the pig or kill the pain-in-the-butt-know-it-all resort manager.“Get back, Ms. O’Malley. I know what I’m doing.” He crouched lower as Porkchop snarled louder.“She’s not dangerous. Put your weapon away.”“I don’t think so, ma’am. That hunk’o’ham’s about to make me the laughing stock of Jackson Hole.”“You’re right about that. It doesn’t take much of a man to kill a defenseless old pig.”His eyes widened when the woman actually knelt down and wrapped her arms around the ugly round critter. This was certainly no Wilbur. Its hide was covered with gray, bristly hair and a layer of green slime decorated its snout. By her actions, it was clear Emma O’Malley loved this disgusting creature.Snapping his knife shut, he listened as she spoke in a honey tone of soothing words that spread a disquieting flicker of sensation down his spine.“I was referring to the fact that I’d make the front page news as being the first human to ever die from a rabid pig,” he said, straightening up and backing further away from the odd couple sitting in the middle of his bedroom.The woman turned watery green eyes in his direction, causing a lump to form at the back of his throat. She looked sad, as if someone had yanked the world right out from beneath her milk and honey perfection.“Pocahontas isn’t rabid. In fact, she thinks you’re the intruder here. The only thing she did wrong was assume that this was my room.”“And is it?” Stone concentrated on maintaining a straight face and not responding to the pig’s name. Who in their right mind would name an ugly, old pig Pocahontas?“Is what?”“Is this your room?” He frowned as she continued to croon softly and stroke the pig’s side.“Not anymore,” she sighed. “It seems River Run is under new management.”“Oh for cryin’ out loud, I already told you that your stay here has been expanded to a year. How long will it take you to find a new place and a new job?”“Forever,” she said. Without so much as a see-ya-later, Emma O’Malley stood up, shuffled the filet of flesh out the door and exited the suite. He swore the three-hundred-pound pork chop smirked at him before disappearing around the corner.Stone stood within the silent confines of the master suite. Running his fingers through his mop of hair, he suddenly realized the enormity of what’d been handed him.He didn’t want to be responsible. The bullet that tore through his upper torso more than a year ago left a bigger emotional scar than the visible puckered skin around his shoulder.Inability to make decisions.No longer a leader.Scared of Death.But not scared to die. Oh no, he wasn’t scared to die. In fact, he’d tried to stay with his men...die with them. But that damn baby was pushed into his arms, and he’d made a dash for safety, leaving behind the cries of pain and the only family he’d acknowledge. Dead. All of them. Killed in a massacre the world would never know about.They’d asked him to retire...said it was for the best. Said he should have a life filled with happiness and not war. What did they know?Stone walked into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. He flipped the silver knob to the shower and waited for steam to fill the room. Glancing around, his mind fantasized imagining Emma O’Malley languishing in the marble jacuzzi or standing beneath the wide spray of water from the showerhead. He could almost see her sheer, silken nightgown, white as a lily with no other adornments but the glow of her flawless skin. Shaking his head, he realized he did see her nightgown. It was hanging on a hook on the back of the door.He guessed that confirmed her answer. She must occupy these rooms when the place was empty.Stepping beneath the stream of hot water, Stone concentrated on what he faced.Disregarding the faint stirrings of a physical attraction, he figured he didn’t particularly care for the prickly Miss O’Malley. But if she was willing to run the day-to-day operation of the resort, then he supposed he’d better get used to her.What other choice did he have? Allow his father to inherit? He wouldn’t give that man one thing that belonged to him, not even if it meant living with a million different people over the next twelve months.Stepping out of the shower, he grabbed a towel and spent a quick second in appreciation of the thick Egyptian cloth.He’d never been one for luxury, but he had to admit it had its perks.Staring in the mirror, he toyed with the idea of shaving. He wouldn’t do that, fighting a quick pang of fear at having to face his clean-shaven image. That man was a killer. He didn’t want to see that person again.Stone pulled on his jeans and an army-issued t-shirt and walked out the French doors. He looked around, ignoring the breathtaking vista that lay before him. There’d been a time when the mountainous range of the Grand Tetons embraced him in their beauty, grabbing his breath, and making him thankful to be alive.But time passed. He was no longer thankful to be alive and didn’t want to acknowledge the wonders that surrounded him.A radio blared from above, and he climbed the wooden stairs that led to the back deck. Sliding silently between the open double doors, Stone stole a few moments to absorb the woman before him.Emma O’Malley, chief cook and bottle washer, moved gracefully around the kitchen. Her back was to Stone. He admired her quick, precise motions. The way her faded jeans hugged her entirely too enticing derriere as she pulled vegetables from the refrigerator, rinsing, then chopping. He frowned when she wiped the back of her hand across her face.Why was she crying?He hated tears. Backing away, Stone stumbled over a needlepoint-covered footstool and knocked a stack of books off the coffee table. He closed his eyes at the outburst sure to follow.“Are you spying on me?” Emma demanded.“I wasn’t spying,” he grunted, picking up the books and replacing them on the table.“Yes, you were,” she said.“Why are you crying?” He stood up and looked straight at her tear-stained face. Green eyes flashed back through wet lashes and a blush that would make a strawberry patch proud spread across her face.“I’m not crying.”“And I’m not spying.” He threw her what he prayed was a dangerous glare and retreated back through the French doors. Enough of that. Tears and sadness were nothing he could help with. Glancing up at the roof, he frowned. It needed a bunch more shingles and the entire estate could use a fresh coat of paint. If he wanted a quick sale, he’d have to spruce it up.“I was not crying,” a loud voice called behind him. Sighing, he turned and faced the angry woman.“I guess I was wrong then, but it seems to me that tearstains and wet lashes are definitely tell-tale signs of crying.”“This is what’s making my face all funny,” she said, waving a large yellow onion at him. She brought it closer and shoved it beneath his nose. “I don’t waste time on emotional release, it’s too draining.”“I see,” he said, pushing the offending vegetable away. “I apologize for jumping to conclusions.” His eyes widened as a fresh batch of tears pooled in a sudden emerald ocean. She pursed her lower lip and turned away. “Hey, I’m sorry, okay?” he said.“Shut up,” she retorted, a slight waver to her voice. “I’m not crying.”“I can see that,” he said, although he was certain that this time she was definitely crying, especially when the tears spilled over her bottom lashes and snaked lazily down her cheek.“Good, I’m glad you understand my position,” she hiccupped. Waving the knife in his face, she began to say something but stopped when the blade fell off and clattered to the deck. She bent down spewing words that burned even his well-seasoned ears.He was trying very hard not to laugh. It would be mean to laugh, but her language tickled something he’d thought dead a long time ago. “You’d better take your onion back to the kitchen before it has you sobbing.”“Thank you, I’ll do just that.” Emma O’Malley turned to walk back into the kitchen. She glanced one last time over her shoulder, and Stone knew he’d better run…which is exactly what he did. Spinning on his heels, he dashed back down the deck, around the end of the house, and into the safety of the master suite.As soon as the glass doors were shut, he burst out laughing. He laughed so hard, his side hurt. How would his therapist define this behavior? Insanity, he figured.“I have no clue what you’re laughing at,” she said, stopping his heart and scaring him silly.“Where’d you come from?” he gasped.She pointed to the main entrance to his room and swept past him to the bathroom door. “I believe I left something here.”“Yes, you did,” he grinned and started to laugh again. He didn’t understand why this woman’s discomfort made him want to sit down and haul her onto his lap. He wiped his watering eyes and sat down on the bed.“Are you crying?” she asked, an innocent tone to her voice that sent warning signals zinging around his brain.“No, are you spying?” he said.She smiled slightly, a spark of amusement dancing in her eyes. “This was my room.”“You can have it back.”“I don’t want it. I want River Run.”“I can’t do that, I’m sorry.”“I understand.” Emma turned and reached behind the bathroom door. Snagging her nightgown, she wrapped it into a small ball. “I’m sorry I bothered you.”“I’m positive you don’t understand, Ms. O’Malley.” Stone heard the sharp tones to his voice and winced as the fragile string of friendly banter snapped. Just as well, he thought. The fear of this woman suddenly escalated from zero to ten. She was dangerous.She made him feel. *** Emma stalked behind her desk and sank into the worn leather chair that had seen River Run from its days of barely being able to pay the mortgage to its current status. Her fist still clutched the soft fabric of her nightgown.She’d been furious to find him attacking Pocahontas. The Pot Bellied pig was her last link to love and affection. Nate Connor handed her over when Emma first arrived, and she’d latched onto the squirmy, tiny piglet with all the adoration her young heart held. She’d accepted the responsibility and worked hard to make the pig happy. The pet was her lifeline back to reality and away from the horror that often invaded her sleep.Stone was nothing like his father. He’d never offer a kind hand to a kid in need.But he was right about one thing, she didn’t understand. Margaret promised to provide for her, keep her secret, and keep her safe. She’d promised.Her throat caught, and she stifled the sob that threatened to break forth. Closing her eyes, Emma rested her head on the back of the chair. How could she be angry with a ghost? A woman she loved, no less. It wasn’t right. Of course, Margaret would’ve wanted to leave River Run to one of her descendants. It’d been in the Connor family for more than a hundred years.But why hadn’t she left it to Nate?“Just deal with it, O’Malley.” Standing up, Emma headed into the small munchkin-size room she used when the resort was full. She tossed the nightgown on the bed and went to her closet. Standing on her tiptoes, her fingers searched the recesses of the upper shelves finally latching onto the cool surface of a metal strongbox.She pulled it down and caressed the surface lovingly. It’d been too long since she’d sifted through the contents and a little bubble of anticipation rattled in her stomach.Flipping open the lid, Emma settled on the edge of her bed. She carefully pulled out a stack of photographs. Her mother’s bright smile prompted her to smile in return, but it quickly faded into a frown as memories crashed forth shattering the peace.Ireland, a country she barely remembered. The pungent aroma of spiced sausages and yeasty mugs of ale invaded her mind but the surroundings were only shadows. Echoes of laughter and happy carousing skimmed across her ears, but she didn’t know why they were there. She couldn’t remember.“Hey,” a deep voice crashed into the silence of her room, causing her to jump off the bed and spill the contents of the strongbox across the floor.“What’s the matter with you?” she said. “You scared the hell out of me.”“Sorry,” he answered, kneeling down to gather up the loose papers scattered on the carpet.“I’ll get those,” she cried, suddenly panic ridden at the thought of discovery. What a fool she’d been keeping these incriminating items in her possession.“Who’s this?” he asked, handing her a picture. She glanced down at the faces smiling brightly into the camera lens.“My parents.”“Where are they?”“Dead,” she answered, unable to prevent the flicker of glassy eyes and rivers of blood that replaced the couple in the color photo.Her father, Hugh Gallagher, battled all his life against the Provisional IRA. He’d viewed them as nothing more than glorified terrorists. Working furiously to aid in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, his life came to an abrupt halt when her mother was brutally murdered in their home...a violent act that shouldn’t have a place in the memory of a thirteen-year old.“I’m sorry, Emma.” His gentle voice shocked her, and she frowned at him.“Nothing to be sorry about. It was a long time ago,” she said, stuffing the documents back into the safety of her strongbox. This alarm at discovery restated how insecure she’d become. “What can I do for you?”“Not a thing,” he answered, pausing to read an article. “What’s this?”She peered over his shoulder and tried to not let apprehension reach out and betray her. “What does it look like?”“A newspaper article.”“You win first prize, Mr. Connor. I’m happy to see you can read.” She reached over and grabbed the yellowed sheet of paper.“Why do you have an article on the Good Friday Agreement?”“I’m a proper Irish Catholic and keep up on my politics,” she said.“I buy that, but that still doesn’t answer my questions.”“Too bad,” she hissed, relieved that he’d obviously missed the printed names of party members and their families. It wouldn’t take a brain surgeon to connect Emilie Gallagher with Emma O’Malley. “Now, if you don’t need anything then what’re you doing here?”He stared at her.She swallowed the lump in her throat, refusing to acknowledge her fear and insecurity.“I came to apologize, but…” he shrugged, standing up with the grace of a panther, “it seems I’ve only intruded further.”“Apologize for what?” she asked, trying to direct the conversation away from the contents of her box.“For laughing at you. It was rude.” Stone backed out of her room and leaned against the jamb. “I didn’t mean anything by it, and I’m sorry I didn’t respect your privacy. We need to learn to live together, and I was wrong. Again, I’m sorry.” As silently as he’d arrived, Stone Connor disappeared.“How does he do that?”Reaching up and removing the clip from her hair, Emma exhaled a frustrated breath. She snapped the lid closed on the strongbox. One day, she wanted to see these pictures and think of only the happy days. That time wasn’t yet, and if she retained possession of these documents, it might never arrive.But the thought of burning the only link to her heritage created a cavern of sadness large enough to swallow her whole. Absently scratching her head, she ran her fingers through her hair, untangling the snagged clumps.With a quick glance out the window, she realized the sun no longer burned bright but had faded to a late afternoon pale yellow. Time to shower and change then prepare to face Stone. Emma craved peace, but her current predicament guaranteed the opposite. *** Emma lit the last candle and stood back to survey the dinner table. She’d decided on an outdoor meal. The brilliant red of the dying sun burned fiercely in the background casting a soft glow across the backyard. The grill sizzled with seasoned steaks, scalloped potatoes, and thick, marinated asparagus. Her mouth watered at the tantalizing aroma of garlic and onions.She heard Stone clear his voice before walking onto the deck. Turning, a polite smile in place, Emma welcomed him to dinner. “I thought that you might like a sampling of River Run hospitality. Most guests prefer to eat here, and I think it would help for you to experience a bit of the atmosphere we provide.” She noted he’d cleaned up still appeared to be a disheveled wreck, with long hair and scraggly beard. His jeans were clean but well-worn with the knees shredded enough to reveal skin. The dark, long-sleeved shirt bore the name of a football team she vaguely recognized. However, it was the edge of muscle beneath the fabric that bothered her in a way she didn’t want to acknowledge.“Whatever,” he grunted and slid into one of the wooden deck chairs surrounding the small table.Emma shook her head and ignored his bad manners. Consoling herself with the fact that in a few days the place would be bustling with activity, she served the platter of savory meat. Stone dug into his food with the relish of a starved man. He finished his steak, had several helpings of the sliced potatoes and onions and polished off most of the asparagus. Peering at her plate, his eyes sparked when he saw how much meat still remained.“Here,” she sighed in exasperation. “Take it.” Pushing the plate toward him, she couldn’t help but laugh in amazement when he scooped up the meat, giving her a cheeky grin, and scarfing it down in several quick bites.“Thanks,” he mumbled, still chewing. “I can’t tell you the last time I’ve eaten this well.”“You certainly don’t appear to be starving.”“I said eaten this well, not eaten. I consume food for energy, but this…” he pointed his knife around the table. “This is heaven.”“Thanks, I think,” she said.Resting his knife on the edge of the plate, he tossed his napkin on the table and settled back in the chair. Emma started to blush as his eyes raked her from top to bottom, scrutinizing every part of her body. He reached for the red wine and poured himself a liberal helping.“We need to set the game rules in place,” he said after savoring the dry, heady Cabernet.She gulped down a swallow herself and attempted to look at him with as much brazen audacity as he did her. “Game rules?”“Yes. We’ve an entire year to spend beneath this roof and it won’t due for us to be at constant odds and tip-toeing around one another.

I’m fine where I am, but thank you.”“Okay.” Stretching his legs he rose from the table. “Good night.”“Good night,” she said, successfully hiding the sadness she felt because he was leaving.He paused before entering the house. “By the way,” he said, turning to face her. “Keep your watch-pig away from me.”“Pocahontas?”“Yeah, Porkahontas.”She glared at him and started to rise. Of all the insulting, conceited, ignorant things this man could do, stooping to the level of calling her pig names appeared downright childish in her book.“Pocahontas will remain in the barn.”“What’s the matter?”“What?” She knew she sounded curt, but her anger wouldn’t stay in the background.“You’re frowning. What’s the matter?”“Nothing,” she said. “My brain’s just rushing through everything that needs to get done before the weekend. I’ll see you tomorrow.”He grinned and winked. Emma’s eyes widened when she realized he’d been teasing her.

      "content": "Chapter Three Emma sat up in bed. What was that noise? She thought she’d heard a thump, but couldn’t be certain. She sat and focused on her surroundings then slid from the warmth of her bed and tip-toed to the door. Another loud crash reverberated against the walls of the resort. Her heart slammed against her chest. She grabbed her umbrella as a weapon, flung open the doors and ran into the main kitchen.Nothing.She heard the roosters, General Coleman and Colonel Mustard, announcing daybreak. A quick glance outside confirmed the early morning hour. Emma started to turn her head away from the window when she saw debris smack onto the wooden deck.What on earth?Footsteps shuffled above. There was someone trying to break in through the roof. Rushing down the hall, she knocked quietly on Stone’s door.“Stone.” Emma kept her voice low, attempting not to alert the intruder. When he didn’t answer, she cracked it open. “Stone?”Damn. Where was he?Emma considered her options. She could call the police, but at thirty miles away they’d take forever. She could grab Margaret’s .22 and deal with the intruder herself. Yes, Emma decided. That’s exactly what she’d do. It was time to take a stand and stop being the fraidy-cat her life had molded her into.With light footsteps, she retreated to her corner of the resort. Emma pulled on a pair of jeans and old denim shirt, mentally pep-talking her way through the upcoming scene.Get the gun.Go to the attic.Climb on the roof.Shoot the bastard.Piece of cake.Why wouldn’t her hands stop trembling? She went to the locked safe in the garage and swapped her umbrella for the Ruger. Silently ascending the staircase, Emma passed the upper suites and opened a small, narrow door at the end of the corridor. The squeaky hinge made her wince. Did the intruder hear? And where was Stone?Her step was light, but the age of the rickety staircase leading to the attic signaled her presence. The gun rested in the crook of her arm, a comfort against the dangerous element outside.Bending beneath the low beams and creeping forward, Emma stifled a sneeze silently promising to clean the place out before the next influx of guests. Another crash echoed from outside. For an intruder, this guy wasn’t very sharp.Cursing her pride, Emma realized how difficult she’d made the past few days for Stone. He didn’t feel responsible for River Run because she’d not allow it. It was hers. But it wasn’t. It was Stone’s, and if she’d acknowledged that then he’d be the one protecting the resort and not her.He’d been withdrawn but amiable to any request she made. They’d worked out a schedule. Rolling her eyes, she realized it all revolved around food. Morning coffee equaled discussions on daily duties, sandwiches at lunch meant a review of finances, and dinner always entailed a battle over impending guests and Stone’s involvement. What involvement? She’d refused every appeal he’d made. Emma inhaled deeply. Her mind was rambling.She reached the tiny gable window. Deep breaths. Aim and shoot. Offense not defense. That was the solution.With shaking fingers, Emma slowly slid open the window. She crawled out the narrow space, gun at the ready. The soft trickle of a small pebble washing down the roof caused her baby hairs to stand at attention. Someone was here…but where?A large hand snaked out, snatching the gun and making her lose her foothold. Down she skidded, across the dewy shingles, her momentum gathering speed no matter how hard she tried to slow down.Her arms flailed backward, hands clawing at the air. She connected with a strong arm then a grip of iron seized her, yanking her painfully up, away from the impending death-for-certain sled ride over the roof. Inhaling shakily, Emma raised her eyes and connected with a fury of blue-steel.“What in blazes are you doing up here?” Stone bellowed.“Be quiet,” she whispered.Glaring, he dragged her up the wooden shingles. She scrambled for a foot hold, slipped, and fell into his arms. Eyeing her warily, Stone sat and pulled her down in front of him, tugging her tightly between his legs and against his chest. His heart pounded against her ear, and Emma realized that the calm, cool indifferent persona was a farce.“What’s wrong,” he said, his voice low and barely audible against the blood that throbbed in her head.“There’s someone trying to break in.”“From the roof?”“Yes, didn’t you hear the noise? Someone’s trying to break in.” She looked around and realized they were the only two people up there. Damn, they’d escaped.Emma frowned when she heard Stone’s chest rumble with laughter. Tilting her head away from him, she saw the flicker of amusement riding shotgun to the dark, silent anger.“What’s so funny?”“That was me,” he said.She frowned and shook her head. “Who was you?”“That noise. I thought I’d start early. I’ve been ripping shingles off the roof for the past hour.”“Ripping the…?”“I’m sorry I scared you,” he said. “What on earth were you doing playing Annie Oakley anyhow? And why one earth would anyone want to break into here?”She glared at him. The pride at having taken the attack stance suddenly withered into embarrassment. “You almost made me fall off the roof,” she argued.“Huh, sorry ‘bout that, but you scared the crap out of me. I guess I overreacted.”“Why?”“I thought you were someone else,” he admitted, brushing fractured pieces of clapboard shingles from her clothes.“Who?”“No one important.” The tone of his voice blocking any additional questions.She turned away and stared at the horizon. Emma breathed deeply and surveyed her bird’s eye view curious as to who he thought she’d been. “It’s beautiful.” The sun poured through the Grand Tetons like rivers of gold, highlighting the valley with bright rays that penetrated and melted the misty blankets hanging above the pastures.An eagle screeched, its cry pulling her in.“Hey,” Stone interrupted. “Where are you?”She pointed to the magnificent Bald Eagle circling a narrow stream at the base of River Run’s pastureland. “Up there.”“Huh,” he grunted, scooting back and slowly rising to his feet. He helped her up, and they carefully picked their way across the slick shingles to the attic window. “The next time you go all brave and crazy, call me first.”Emma pulled her hand from his grip. She ignored her tingling skin and damned the awareness that skittered along her spine. “I tried, but you were obviously occupied elsewhere.”“I think, Ms. O’Malley, that there are probably several items we need to discuss.” Stone motioned for her to go past him, into the attic.“Such as?” Emma said, crawling through the window and waiting for him to follow.“Why’d you think there was danger up here?”She stepped quickly to the stairs and headed down. Emma wasn’t confiding her problems to him. She’d spent the last week being interrogated over every aspect of River Run, and his razor sharp mind wouldn’t take anything she admitted at face value. He’d delve into her past with the tenacity of a terrier, destroying all her carefully laid masks. “An overactive imagination?”In all honesty, he’d probably fire her and then where’d she go?Stone Connor didn’t appear to be the type of man that wanted trouble around. And she was definitely trouble.For now, her identity and past would remain a secret.“I don’t buy that,” he said, when they’d reached the kitchen.She whirled around and pierced him with what she prayed was a don’t-mess-with-me stare. “I’m certain that a man as strong and virile as you has never awoken to a nightmare of life threatening proportions and thought the shadows were out to get him. I’m sorry if my petty, female fears seem inconsequential to you, but they exist.”He walked backward, hands held palm forward in defense. “I didn’t mean to get your Irish up.” Stone turned and exited the kitchen, then paused in the living room. “For what it’s worth,” he called. “I do.”“Do what?” she replied, not bothering to hide her annoyance.“Have nightmares of life threatening proportions.”And before she responded, he was gone. *** Once more, Stone found himself gazing out his French doors, blocking the beauty of the view and concentrating on his internal struggle. Damn that woman. Wasn’t she just a walking, talking vampire of emotional upheavals?He’d not slept well the past few nights. The week was quickly coming to an end, and the thought of his father this close to him continued to ignite fireworks of anger and resentment. Why was Nate here? More importantly, what did Emma O’Malley have to do with him?The sound of footsteps creeping up from within the house flashed all types of childhood memories across his mind. He’d not reacted well. His heart still pounded when he thought how close Emma came to falling off the roof.“Damn careless,” he swore and hammered another nail of self-doubt into his coffin.Stone couldn’t help but sense there was more to Emma O’Malley’s story than a simple girl who happened to apply for a job with his grandmother. His mind was trained to analyze situations from every possible angle, scrutinize the enemy, then infiltrate and overwhelm. He was lost here.He didn’t understand the enemy. But, he wanted the enemy. Stone walked into the bathroom and stared at his reflection. What was she doing to him?The feel of her pressed against him on the roof and that one moment where her face lost all traces of worry as she watched the eagle soar caused an aching deep within his soul.Once Emma O’Malley realized what Stone Connor stood for, she’d run. And when she did, she’d take all temptation with her. She’d take away his sudden desire to breathe.She wasn’t for him, anyway. And it had nothing to do with her idealistic, pet-loving, schizophrenic attitude. He refused to care for anyone that associated with his father. Isn’t that why he’d left in the first place?Trill laughter filtered through the closed door of the master suite. He heard voices in the kitchen and wondered who’d arrived. Checking the calendar Emma provided him with, he noted they still had an entire day before guests began invading.Curious, Stone left the safety of his room and ventured back into the kitchen. River Run’s rooms were bursting with activity. People were hugging, crying, laughing, and talking all at once. An elderly gentleman consoled a young, Latino woman to the left. In the center of the room, a group of twenty-something, giggling girls spoke rapidly to one another using their hands when words failed.They were everywhere.He strode over to Emma who stood in the center of this human tornado and grabbed her arm. With a grin, she patted his hand like he was a child and yelled above the din.“Guys, I’d like to introduce the new owner of River Run, Stone Connor.”There was an immediate decent into silence. Twenty pairs of eyes stared at him, some accusing, some shocked.“Mr. Connor, may I introduce the River Run staff.” Emma grabbed his wrist, pulling him toward the crowd of people that had begun to form an uneven line. Her touch burned.When was the last time he’d allowed anyone to lead?He swallowed the longing to pull her closer, to use her as a shield against the inquisitive stares, but instead battled to remain focused and examine the odd assortment of characters wearing identical River Run t-shirts.Emma ticked off name after name along with each person’s occupation, Maid, Landscape Artist, Culinary Assistant, Activities Coordinator, they all quickly became a blur. Stone mentally filed it away. He was wary of the glances that seemed to want his approval or required direction. Leadership wasn’t his responsibility.Finally, Stone shook hands with his last employee. Tilly someone or other, the chef. She was a short, buxom brunette, and if she wasn’t giving him an open invitation into her pants then he was stupider than Porkahontas.“So, like I said,” she cooed. “If you want a private sampling of the menu next week, I’ll be happy to prepare it and bring it to your suite this evening.”“Tilly,” Emma said. Stone gazed down at his resort manager, the sharp tone in her voice amused him. “I’m certain that won’t be necessary.”“How do you know, Em? Maybe Mr. Connor would like a little taste of my mouth-watering wares.” Stone bit his lip. It wouldn’t do to laugh in this woman’s face. He was concerned, however, that she’d treated Emma with a hint of contempt.“Ms. Williams, right?”“Yes, sir,” the chef replied, scuttling forward and stroking his shirt sleeve.“I appreciate your offer of a private dinner.” He didn’t miss the spark of triumph she tossed at Emma. Frowning, he rubbed his hand over weary eyes. Normally, he’d gladly accept the catch-of-the-day, but right now he wanted to land his fist smack in the middle of little-miss-hot-potatoes forehead. “Ms. O’Malley and I have business to discuss. We’ll both dine on the back deck this evening, if it suits her schedule.”Emma gaped at him. He furrowed his brow and glanced at the mounted bass behind her head. Glancing down at her open mouth, he resisted the urge to lift her chin. “Ms. O’Malley, does that suit you?”“Yes sir,” she whispered.He turned and walked out of the room, pausing outside the living room he looked over his shoulder and waved his hand. “Carry on, everyone. I’ll be back before you leave for a daily report.”Closing the door to his suite, he relished the silence. He’d done it. An hour of masquerading as a human being, and no one had seen beyond his façade.Collapsing on the bed, he grabbed his head and dug his palms into the pain that sliced his temples. Thirty dead eyes floated before him. He’d made the wrong choice, they accused.He needed to forget, that’s what his therapist said. Until he pushed these faces down, into the fathoms of his soul, he’d be unable to continue.Stone’s lip twisted up into a savage smile.He’d won this first battle. He hadn’t failed beneath the ever watchful gaze of Emma O’Malley. *** Emma helped Tilly stash the groceries she’d brought. The woman chattered non-stop about their handsome new boss, absolutely ignorant that he’d not been interested in her feminine wiles.“It’ll take a while for him to warm up to me, but you’ll see.” She wagged a finger at Emma. “He’ll come around and then maybe I’ll be your boss one day.” Tilly giggled, grating on Emma’s nerves.“Put the receipt for these items in the office, Tilly. I’m going to work in the barn.” Emma saw the disgusted eye roll the woman tossed at her but avoided the biting retaliation forming on her lips. The barn was an important aspect of River Run. The children adored playing with the animals, not to mention the abundance of fresh eggs her hens provide.Pocahontas, rooting in the barnyard, greeted her with happy little grunts, and she bent over to scratch behind the pig’s ears. She was old, and Emma feared she’d not make another winter, which might be the best. What would happen to her if Emma left?“We’ll not think about that, Pokey, will we?” she said.“Think about what?” Stone asked.“How do you do that?”“What?”“Sneak up on people. It’s very disconcerting.” Emma straightened, brushing green slime off her sleeve where Pocahontas had snuffled against her arm.“That’s gross,” he said pointing at her hand.“She’s a pig. It’s no different than wiping goop out of your dog’s eye.”Stone closed his eyes, shook his head then opened them to gaze at her in amazement. “Are you some type of bunny hugger?”“No,” she frowned. “We don’t have rabbits. Well, we did, but the coyotes got ‘em. It wasn’t a pretty sight.”He snorted and waved his hand at her.“What?” she asked.“I wasn’t referring to cuddling rabbits. A bunny hugger is an animal activist. I’m a bit surprised you didn’t know that?”Emma bristled. Granted, she didn’t follow the news much, it scared her. But she’d always thought of herself as relatively well informed and in tune with things. This was idiotic. “That’s not really a term I hear on a daily basis. Sorry if I disappointed you.”He sighed. “Look, let’s please try and get along. We need to show a united front before the employees.”“I think we’re getting along just fine. Want to help set up for tomorrow?”“What’s tomorrow?”“The arrival of the twin terrors.”“What?”“The Bakers have two twin boys. This’ll be their third visit in two years.”“And?”“The boys are mean to animals.”“Then why let them out here?” Stone leaned against the side of the barn and stared at her.“Because they’re our guests.”“I don’t understand. Just tell them they’re not allowed near the animals.”“That’s diplomatic.” She didn’t try to hide her sarcasm and attempted to walk past him, but he stopped her. She was close enough to smell the spicy scent of his cologne. Tilting her head up, she gazed into his face.Time stopped.His eyes were warm, dark blue and curious. They bore into her soul, searching for something. Emma’s heart caught. And she panicked. Who was this man?“Don’t go,” he said, his voice barely audible.“I’ve things to do.”He nodded, his eyes suddenly clouding over and retreating back to their normal steel. “What do you want me to do?”She swallowed and stepped back, putting distance between them. Emma didn’t understand these emotions, and honestly, she figured she’d never understand them. Better to ignore everything.“Pocahontas’s pen needs to be reinforced with another four by six and the lock switched to the inside, out of reach of little hands.”“Porkie’s got a pen?”She glared and pointed to the end of the barn. “Pokey’s room is just down that way. She’ll show you the way.” Sure enough, Pocahontas trotted down the aisle and opened her door for Stone. He shook his head and followed.Emma mucked stalls, rewired gaps in the chicken coop and made sure all gates had double locks. She attempted to ignore the presence of Stone, but his muttered expletives made her smile. “Quite a creative vocabulary you have there.”“What?” He called from the back of the pig pen.“Your language,” she yelled back. “It’s very colorful.”He glanced over the gate in her direction. “The military offered special courses.” Another stream of curses followed this, and he dove back into the pen. Curious, Emma walked down the aisle and peered over the door.“Oh,” she sighed when she saw what he’d been doing. Instead of one four by six, Stone had re-paneled the entire pen, making sure all holes were filled. He’d cut in a small piggy door with a flap to allow Pocahontas easy access to her home, but it could also be locked down to prevent any unwanted little boys from investigating.Apparently, Pokey was showing her gratitude by stealing Stone’s tools. At present, the pig firmly grasped his hammer between her teeth.“Come on, Porkahontas, give it over.”“Stop calling her names. Pigs are sensitive.”He tossed her one of his get-real looks and turned to face the pig. “Okay, beautiful. Let’s have that hammer.”Pocahontas snuffled then dropped the tool. She stomped past Stone and exited the pen via her new door.“I think she likes you,” Emma said.“Whatever,” he shrugged.“Tell me about the military. What branch were you in?”“Who said I’d been in the military?” he growled, his face suddenly flushed with anger.Emma back-pedaled in her mind. Rut-ro, this was a sensitive subject. “You did, but I’m sorry. We’d promised not to question each other.”He pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head sadly. “No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. Hey, let’s just stop saying we’re sorry, okay?”She smiled, biting back the instinctive apology that almost slipped out. “You got it. I’m done here so I thought I’d check on the progress inside.” Turning away from the most complicated man she’d ever met, Emma headed back to the house.“I’ll see you at dinner,” he called after her.She waved her agreement but didn’t dare glance back. *** Emma stepped from the shower and toweled off quickly. She was late. It’d taken longer than expected to perform her walk-through after housecleaning finished. She’d verified that the rooms were prepared, wine rack stocked, refrigerator full, special items purchased and itinerary finalized.The Bakers were set. For now, at least.What should she wear? Wait a minute, it didn’t matter what she wore. This was only a business dinner.“He’s not my type.” She insisted to the mirror. He was…well, he was just too hairy. Emma imagined trying to find his lips beneath his beard and mustache. At least that thought stopped her fingers from trembling.“Ready?” A deep voice called from her doorway, almost making her drop the towel that was wrapped around her body.It’d never crossed her mind to shut her bedroom door. No one ever ventured into her private section of River Run. “Would you stop that?”“What?”“Sneaking up on me. I can’t stand it. You’re gonna have to start wearing cowbells.”He grinned. “I guess this means you’re not ready.”“No, I’m not ready. Does it look like I’m ready?” She winced at her choice of words.Stone’s eyes darkened, and his mouth parted slightly. He licked his lips and inhaled sharply. An electric bolt shot straight up her spine as she realized the only thing between his burning gaze and her naked body was a tiny, white towel.“I’ll wait for you outside,” he said.“Good idea,” she whispered then slammed the door in his face. A throaty laugh filtered down the hall, and she winced again, hating the way her body responded. Emma opened the closet and rooted for something appropriate.Thirty minutes later, she arrived on the back deck adorned in a crisp white shirt and black pants. She’d moisturized until her skin glowed. Her face wore only the slightest trace of makeup, enough to hide a few freckles and thicken her lashes.Emma nodded to Tilly and glanced around for Stone.“He left,” Tilly said. Emma raised her brows at the obvious bitter edge to the woman’s words.“Really?” A stab of disappointment lodging in Emma’s chest. “Where’d he go?”“I dunno. One minute he was here the next he was gone. Still want to eat?”“Of course,” she answered. Tilly shook her head in disgust and returned to the kitchen. Emma knew she needed to deal with the chef’s attitude, but there always seemed to be something more pressing to resolve. She’d admired Stone’s deft handling of the difficult situation earlier and wondered how he’d learned such diplomacy?The table was lavishly adorned with the best silverware and finest china. A bottle of wine cooled in an ice bucket, and Emma walked over to pour herself a glass.As she placed her hand around the neck of the bottle an arm reached around from behind, taking the bottle from her grasp. Woodsy aftershave signaled the arrival of Stone. He took hold of the wine glass with his other hand, pinning her between his body and the table. Emma was trapped.The warmth of his chest pressed against her back igniting every nerve with sparks of energy until her entire system hummed in anticipation.She spun around within the circle of his arms and gasped in surprise, her anger fading beneath shock.The only familiar feature on the face before her was a set of icy blue eyes warming to a deep azure.",

      "content": "Chapter Three Emma sat up in bed. What was that noise? She thought she’d heard a thump, but couldn’t be certain. She sat and focused on her surroundings then slid from the warmth of her bed and tip-toed to the door. Another loud crash reverberated against the walls of the resort. Her heart slammed against her chest. She grabbed her umbrella as a weapon, flung open the doors and ran into the main kitchen.Nothing.She heard the roosters, General Coleman and Colonel Mustard, announcing daybreak. A quick glance outside confirmed the early morning hour. Emma started to turn her head away from the window when she saw debris smack onto the wooden deck.What on earth?Footsteps shuffled above. There was someone trying to break in through the roof. Rushing down the hall, she knocked quietly on Stone’s door.“Stone.” Emma kept her voice low, attempting not to alert the intruder. When he didn’t answer, she cracked it open. “Stone?”Damn. Where was he?Emma considered her options. She could call the police, but at thirty miles away they’d take forever. She could grab Margaret’s .22 and deal with the intruder herself. Yes, Emma decided. That’s exactly what she’d do. It was time to take a stand and stop being the fraidy-cat her life had molded her into.With light footsteps, she retreated to her corner of the resort. Emma pulled on a pair of jeans and old denim shirt, mentally pep-talking her way through the upcoming scene.Get the gun.Go to the attic.Climb on the roof.Shoot the bastard.Piece of cake.Why wouldn’t her hands stop trembling? She went to the locked safe in the garage and swapped her umbrella for the Ruger. Silently ascending the staircase, Emma passed the upper suites and opened a small, narrow door at the end of the corridor. The squeaky hinge made her wince. Did the intruder hear? And where was Stone?Her step was light, but the age of the rickety staircase leading to the attic signaled her presence. The gun rested in the crook of her arm, a comfort against the dangerous element outside.Bending beneath the low beams and creeping forward, Emma stifled a sneeze silently promising to clean the place out before the next influx of guests. Another crash echoed from outside. For an intruder, this guy wasn’t very sharp.Cursing her pride, Emma realized how difficult she’d made the past few days for Stone. He didn’t feel responsible for River Run because she’d not allow it. It was hers. But it wasn’t. It was Stone’s, and if she’d acknowledged that then he’d be the one protecting the resort and not her.He’d been withdrawn but amiable to any request she made. They’d worked out a schedule. Rolling her eyes, she realized it all revolved around food. Morning coffee equaled discussions on daily duties, sandwiches at lunch meant a review of finances, and dinner always entailed a battle over impending guests and Stone’s involvement. What involvement? She’d refused every appeal he’d made. Emma inhaled deeply. Her mind was rambling.She reached the tiny gable window. Deep breaths. Aim and shoot. Offense not defense. That was the solution.With shaking fingers, Emma slowly slid open the window. She crawled out the narrow space, gun at the ready. The soft trickle of a small pebble washing down the roof caused her baby hairs to stand at attention. Someone was here…but where?A large hand snaked out, snatching the gun and making her lose her foothold. Down she skidded, across the dewy shingles, her momentum gathering speed no matter how hard she tried to slow down.Her arms flailed backward, hands clawing at the air. She connected with a strong arm then a grip of iron seized her, yanking her painfully up, away from the impending death-for-certain sled ride over the roof. Inhaling shakily, Emma raised her eyes and connected with a fury of blue-steel.“What in blazes are you doing up here?” Stone bellowed.“Be quiet,” she whispered.Glaring, he dragged her up the wooden shingles. She scrambled for a foot hold, slipped, and fell into his arms. Eyeing her warily, Stone sat and pulled her down in front of him, tugging her tightly between his legs and against his chest.

Glancing down at her open mouth, he resisted the urge to lift her chin. “Ms. O’Malley, does that suit you?”“Yes sir,” she whispered.He turned and walked out of the room, pausing outside the living room he looked over his shoulder and waved his hand. “Carry on, everyone. I’ll be back before you leave for a daily report.”Closing the door to his suite, he relished the silence. He’d done it. An hour of masquerading as a human being, and no one had seen beyond his façade.Collapsing on the bed, he grabbed his head and dug his palms into the pain that sliced his temples. Thirty dead eyes floated before him. He’d made the wrong choice, they accused.He needed to forget, that’s what his therapist said. Until he pushed these faces down, into the fathoms of his soul, he’d be unable to continue.Stone’s lip twisted up into a savage smile.He’d won this first battle. He hadn’t failed beneath the ever watchful gaze of Emma O’Malley. *** Emma helped Tilly stash the groceries she’d brought. The woman chattered non-stop about their handsome new boss, absolutely ignorant that he’d not been interested in her feminine wiles.“It’ll take a while for him to warm up to me, but you’ll see.” She wagged a finger at Emma. “He’ll come around and then maybe I’ll be your boss one day.” Tilly giggled, grating on Emma’s nerves.“Put the receipt for these items in the office, Tilly. I’m going to work in the barn.” Emma saw the disgusted eye roll the woman tossed at her but avoided the biting retaliation forming on her lips. The barn was an important aspect of River Run. The children adored playing with the animals, not to mention the abundance of fresh eggs her hens provide.Pocahontas, rooting in the barnyard, greeted her with happy little grunts, and she bent over to scratch behind the pig’s ears. She was old, and Emma feared she’d not make another winter, which might be the best. What would happen to her if Emma left?“We’ll not think about that, Pokey, will we?” she said.“Think about what?” Stone asked.“How do you do that?”“What?”“Sneak up on people. It’s very disconcerting.” Emma straightened, brushing green slime off her sleeve where Pocahontas had snuffled against her arm.“That’s gross,” he said pointing at her hand.“She’s a pig. It’s no different than wiping goop out of your dog’s eye.”Stone closed his eyes, shook his head then opened them to gaze at her in amazement. “Are you some type of bunny hugger?”“No,” she frowned. “We don’t have rabbits. Well, we did, but the coyotes got ‘em. It wasn’t a pretty sight.”He snorted and waved his hand at her.“What?” she asked.“I wasn’t referring to cuddling rabbits. A bunny hugger is an animal activist. I’m a bit surprised you didn’t know that?”Emma bristled. Granted, she didn’t follow the news much, it scared her. But she’d always thought of herself as relatively well informed and in tune with things. This was idiotic. “That’s not really a term I hear on a daily basis. Sorry if I disappointed you.”He sighed. “Look, let’s please try and get along. We need to show a united front before the employees.”“I think we’re getting along just fine. Want to help set up for tomorrow?”“What’s tomorrow?”“The arrival of the twin terrors.”“What?”“The Bakers have two twin boys. This’ll be their third visit in two years.”“And?”“The boys are mean to animals.”“Then why let them out here?” Stone leaned against the side of the barn and stared at her.“Because they’re our guests.”“I don’t understand. Just tell them they’re not allowed near the animals.”“That’s diplomatic.” She didn’t try to hide her sarcasm and attempted to walk past him, but he stopped her. She was close enough to smell the spicy scent of his cologne. Tilting her head up, she gazed into his face.Time stopped.His eyes were warm, dark blue and curious. They bore into her soul, searching for something. Emma’s heart caught. And she panicked. Who was this man?“Don’t go,” he said, his voice barely audible.“I’ve things to do.”He nodded, his eyes suddenly clouding over and retreating back to their normal steel. “What do you want me to do?”She swallowed and stepped back, putting distance between them. Emma didn’t understand these emotions, and honestly, she figured she’d never understand them. Better to ignore everything.“Pocahontas’s pen needs to be reinforced with another four by six and the lock switched to the inside, out of reach of little hands.”“Porkie’s got a pen?”She glared and pointed to the end of the barn. “Pokey’s room is just down that way. She’ll show you the way.” Sure enough, Pocahontas trotted down the aisle and opened her door for Stone. He shook his head and followed.Emma mucked stalls, rewired gaps in the chicken coop and made sure all gates had double locks. She attempted to ignore the presence of Stone, but his muttered expletives made her smile. “Quite a creative vocabulary you have there.”“What?” He called from the back of the pig pen.“Your language,” she yelled back. “It’s very colorful.”He glanced over the gate in her direction. “The military offered special courses.” Another stream of curses followed this, and he dove back into the pen. Curious, Emma walked down the aisle and peered over the door.“Oh,” she sighed when she saw what he’d been doing. Instead of one four by six, Stone had re-paneled the entire pen, making sure all holes were filled. He’d cut in a small piggy door with a flap to allow Pocahontas easy access to her home, but it could also be locked down to prevent any unwanted little boys from investigating.Apparently, Pokey was showing her gratitude by stealing Stone’s tools. At present, the pig firmly grasped his hammer between her teeth.“Come on, Porkahontas, give it over.”“Stop calling her names. Pigs are sensitive.”He tossed her one of his get-real looks and turned to face the pig. “Okay, beautiful. Let’s have that hammer.”Pocahontas snuffled then dropped the tool. She stomped past Stone and exited the pen via her new door.“I think she likes you,” Emma said.“Whatever,” he shrugged.“Tell me about the military. What branch were you in?”“Who said I’d been in the military?” he growled, his face suddenly flushed with anger.Emma back-pedaled in her mind. Rut-ro, this was a sensitive subject. “You did, but I’m sorry. We’d promised not to question each other.”He pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head sadly. “No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. Hey, let’s just stop saying we’re sorry, okay?”She smiled, biting back the instinctive apology that almost slipped out. “You got it. I’m done here so I thought I’d check on the progress inside.” Turning away from the most complicated man she’d ever met, Emma headed back to the house.“I’ll see you at dinner,” he called after her.She waved her agreement but didn’t dare glance back. *** Emma stepped from the shower and toweled off quickly. She was late. It’d taken longer than expected to perform her walk-through after housecleaning finished. She’d verified that the rooms were prepared, wine rack stocked, refrigerator full, special items purchased and itinerary finalized.The Bakers were set. For now, at least.What should she wear? Wait a minute, it didn’t matter what she wore. This was only a business dinner.“He’s not my type.” She insisted to the mirror. He was…well, he was just too hairy. Emma imagined trying to find his lips beneath his beard and mustache. At least that thought stopped her fingers from trembling.“Ready?” A deep voice called from her doorway, almost making her drop the towel that was wrapped around her body.It’d never crossed her mind to shut her bedroom door. No one ever ventured into her private section of River Run. “Would you stop that?”“What?”“Sneaking up on me. I can’t stand it. You’re gonna have to start wearing cowbells.”He grinned. “I guess this means you’re not ready.”“No, I’m not ready. Does it look like I’m ready?” She winced at her choice of words.Stone’s eyes darkened, and his mouth parted slightly. He licked his lips and inhaled sharply. An electric bolt shot straight up her spine as she realized the only thing between his burning gaze and her naked body was a tiny, white towel.“I’ll wait for you outside,” he said.“Good idea,” she whispered then slammed the door in his face. A throaty laugh filtered down the hall, and she winced again, hating the way her body responded. Emma opened the closet and rooted for something appropriate.Thirty minutes later, she arrived on the back deck adorned in a crisp white shirt and black pants. She’d moisturized until her skin glowed. Her face wore only the slightest trace of makeup, enough to hide a few freckles and thicken her lashes.Emma nodded to Tilly and glanced around for Stone.“He left,” Tilly said. Emma raised her brows at the obvious bitter edge to the woman’s words.“Really?” A stab of disappointment lodging in Emma’s chest. “Where’d he go?”“I dunno. One minute he was here the next he was gone. Still want to eat?”“Of course,” she answered. Tilly shook her head in disgust and returned to the kitchen. Emma knew she needed to deal with the chef’s attitude, but there always seemed to be something more pressing to resolve. She’d admired Stone’s deft handling of the difficult situation earlier and wondered how he’d learned such diplomacy?The table was lavishly adorned with the best silverware and finest china. A bottle of wine cooled in an ice bucket, and Emma walked over to pour herself a glass.As she placed her hand around the neck of the bottle an arm reached around from behind, taking the bottle from her grasp. Woodsy aftershave signaled the arrival of Stone. He took hold of the wine glass with his other hand, pinning her between his body and the table. Emma was trapped.The warmth of his chest pressed against her back igniting every nerve with sparks of energy until her entire system hummed in anticipation.She spun around within the circle of his arms and gasped in surprise, her anger fading beneath shock.The only familiar feature on the face before her was a set of icy blue eyes warming to a deep azure.",

      "content": "Chapter Four “You shaved.” An uncomfortable pang constricted Emma’s heart. He’d done it. With one swipe of the blade, Stone Connor had flicked off the scab of solitude and opened her soul to a longing she’d never dared contemplate.“Yeah, don’t make a big deal of it. I’m not real happy right now.”“But you look great,” she said, trying desperately to control the frenzied rhythm of her pulse. He’d been roughly attractive before; but now, without all the facial hair masking his chiseled features, Stone Connor was downright gorgeous. The vulnerability hidden smartly behind cynical eyes undid her, luring her into an alien place.Emma studied his face, tracing a finger down the right side of his cheekbone to a strong, square jaw. He tensed and pulled her hand away.She shouldn’t have touched him, but her impulses refused to be disregarded. “Sorry.”“I figured I’d better look the part of an expensive resort owner and not a mountain man.”“I see,” Emma said, a little disappointed. Ridiculous, she silently chided herself. It’s not like he’d do something like this for me. Curbing her bubbling emotions, she remembered the way he’d gazed at her wrapped in the towel. Attraction, in the physical sense, didn’t equal the heartrending sensation rapidly seizing her soul.“Want some wine?” He stepped back, a cold draft snaked its way up her arm, replacing the warm tingle of his skin.“Yes, please. I’ll just slip inside and inform Tilly we’re ready to eat.”“Why not wait a few minutes,” he said, startling her. “I’d like to talk to you.”Emma nodded and took a seat at the table. He smiled, displaying a sexy dimple that snagged her attention.“What? Am I bleeding?”“No. I just hadn’t expected that.” She pointed to his cheek.“What?”“That dimple.”He frowned, the sudden warmth in his eyes fading. “I’d forgotten,” he said.Emma looked at her hands, twisting a napkin between her fingers. Forgotten? How did a person forget their own face?“What do you want to talk about?”“Your salary.”She reached up and gripped the stem of her wine glass. Talk about forgetting. “I don’t have one,” she said.“That’s what the accounting reports indicate, and I’d like to change that.” Stone sat back, sipping his wine. His eyes locked onto hers. She ignored the desire that began twirling in her chest instead focusing on this latest obstacle.“I don’t want a salary.”“I’m not leaving you River Run which means I need to pay you a salary.”“Is that what you think? That I don’t have a salary because I expected Margaret to hand River Run to me on a silver platter?”“What else am I to think?”“You sonofa....” Emma couldn’t finish. Her anger swept the beauty of the evening away. She’d thought maybe he’d changed, warmed up, fit in…made a decision to commit. Isn’t that why he’d shaved?Obviously not.Stone Connor cared only about himself. She could only guess at his motivation, and it certainly wasn’t toward her best interest. He probably wanted to alleviate his guilt, pay her a ridiculous sum in order to convince his warped sense of righteousness that he’d recompensed her appropriately for a lifetime of blood.What did she expect?No, Emma realized, her problems were her own. She hadn’t explained her history because he’d fire her. How could she anticipate his understanding? She needed a plan. An escape route.She needed to quit overreacting.“Hey, don’t go getting all twisted hither and nither. It was an easy assumption.” He leaned forward placing his hand on hers. Emma resisted turning her palm over and grabbing his hand like it was the last rung on a ten-story fire escape. She wouldn’t trust this man.“Stop tearing that napkin to shreds. I’m not being confrontational, but I’d like to right any wrongs from the past.”“Your grandmother provided quite handsomely for me, and I’m no charity case.” Emma refused to fall for his counterfeit charm again. She knew the heart of the beast, and it was solid granite. This salary war wasn’t about paying her--it was about control.“Still, you deserve a salary.”“No.”“Why?”“I prefer to leave things as they are.”“Which is?”“River Run pays my expenses with a bonus at the end of each year. The bonus is based on a percentage of the previous year’s profits, and the sum is then invested in Clover Enterprises.”Stone raised one brow. “Clover is you?”“Yes,” she said, ignoring the skeptical expression.“Funny, I thought it was someone else.”“It’s mine.”Emma said a silent prayer. He’d certainly deduced that Nate Connor’s name signed and authorized all transactions for Clover Enterprises. If he delved any deeper, it could very well explode years of planning.The man sitting across from her would be shocked to discover she had no license, no bank account, no social security number. As far as the computer banks and the government were concerned, she didn’t exist.It needed to remain that way.Stone relaxed, obviously content with her explanation. At least he wasn’t pushing anymore.Emma raised her glass and sipped the wine. It was her favorite. An Italian Chardonnay the color of honey with a smooth, buttery taste. She detested the woodsy overtone of the more popular Chardonnay’s, and her discovery of this wine sprouted a dangerous obsession. She exercised restraint and limited herself to one bottle a week.“This is great wine,” Stone said.“Be careful, it’s addictive.”“Really?”“Uh huh,” she murmured, lost for a moment as the liquid gold slipped down her throat, burning slightly. This was how Stone made her feel, she realized with a start. Careful girl. That kind of thinking would only lead to heartbreak.“Next item on my agenda…” Stone leaned forward and focused all his attention on her face, causing a river of panic to surface. What did he know? “Is a stipulation that if not followed will result in immediate dismissal.”Her throat tightened, and she swallowed back the sudden panic.“My father isn’t to step one foot on this property.”“But...”“No,” he warned. “This is not up for discussion.”Emma sat back, her chest constricting in pain. She didn’t know who this affected the most…him, her, his father? All three of them, she figured.Could she manage a year without Nate? More importantly, could Nate manage a year without her? Leaving River Run and moving in with Nate wasn’t an option. She’d considered it briefly the first night Stone arrived, but the thought of bringing trouble to a man who’d survived a grueling life seemed unfair.She’d protect Nate. He’d sheltered her from loneliness and pain at great personal cost. The man didn’t need any more problems, and the arrival of his son already caused him agony.“I understand your feelings...” she began, but the dangerous shadow that crossed Stone’s face interrupted her.“How could you? I don’t know what lies he’s told you, but I can certainly assure you that you don’t understand. Look at your surroundings, look at where you were raised.”She stood and tossed her napkin on the table. Bending down, her nose practically touching his, she could feel his breath on her face. “Look at where I was raised?” She battled to control her anger and despair. “You know nothing. You could’ve had this...all of this and then some, but instead you ran. But don’t you worry, Mr. Connor, I’ll respect your wishes. However, I won’t be able to stay the year, that’s asking too much.”Emma turned around and collided with Tilly. “It looks like Mr. Connor will be dining alone tonight,” she said.“What do you mean you won’t be able to stay the year?” Stone called to her back. She stopped, turned and faced him.“Your father needs me,” she said. Her anger at his self-centered demand barely remained in check. “He won’t survive.”“But…”She raised her hand, denying any retort. “I’ll be leaving as soon as I find an apartment.” Her heart stuttered. How was she going to find a place to rent? Money wasn’t the problem, it was the application. Her name would be made public. Damn, Stone Connor. Damn him.“Stop,” Stone yelled, rising to his feet and crossing the space in three long strides. He grabbed her arm and stared into her eyes. His steely gaze laced with a hint of desperation confirmed to Emma that his capability to manage River Run was nil. “I don’t want you to leave.”What a snake pit of contradiction. His actions defied his words at every corner of their conversation. He didn’t want her to leave, but he demanded unreasonable restrictions. Unfortunately, her position remained equally as perilous. They needed one another, whether they liked it or not.“I need to see your father.”“Why? What’s he to you?”“Do you really want to know?” Emma pushed his hand off her arm, stepping forward and jabbing a finger to his chest. “You don’t care. You won’t forgive.”“Damn right, I won’t forgive. That man’s nothing but pig slop to me.”“It’s a shame, you know? The two of you have so many wonderful qualities in common it’d be a real show stopper to see who’d out spit the other.”Stone glared at her. “I’m nothing like that man.”“You’d be surprised.” Emma turned once more, heading into the house.“Does he have to come here?” Stone called.She paused and thought a moment. Attempting to lay her emotions aside and think clearly, Emma contemplated her best interests. She faced Stone.“No, I’ll go to him.”“See?” He grinned lopsidedly. “We can do this. You don’t have to run away every time I’m being difficult.”Emma didn’t find any of this humorous. Actually, her stomach felt as if it’d sunk to the bottom of Jenny Lake. She’d go to Nate. She’d stay with Stone. Why then, did it all feel wrong?“I’m no longer hungry.”“What a shame,” Tilly interrupted, scooting in from the kitchen. “Maybe he’ll appreciate a little company of the more friendly kind.” Emma watched in astonishment as the chef gracefully slid into the chair beside Stone. “It’s a shame for all the food to go to waste,” she practically cooed.Turning to see Stone’s reaction, her gut twisted painfully at his obvious interest in Tilly.“Fine, Tilly. It appears Mr. Connor might be up for a little friendly conversation.”Turning, she walked as gracefully as possible across the deck and into the house. She could feel his black gaze burning her back. Damn, but if she wasn’t jealous… *** “So, Mr. Connor, what’ll it be? Appetizers? Or do you want to skip right to dessert?”Stone eyed Tilly. He couldn’t believe Emma walked away leaving him here with this over-bearing, top-heavy, slithering slut. It appeared Ms. O’Malley didn’t care whether or not he accepted Tilly’s unspoken invitation.That bothered him.He slapped away the all too familiar feeling of abandonment. Emotion wasn’t good. Swearing silently, he realized Emma O’Malley was no better than his father. The second something he said or did contradicted her goals, she ran. He hoped the exit door didn’t sting too badly when it hit her on the back.“Just make me a plate, Tilly. I’ll take it to my room.” He rose and grabbed the wine. No use wasting a good chardonnay. “Alone,” he continued as Tilly waggled her brows.“Your loss, boss.” She left the deck and went into the kitchen returning a few minutes later with a steaming plate of food. “Enjoy.”Stone took the plate and headed to his suite. Needing Emma’s cooperation to continue the successful atmosphere of River Run was one thing, but wanting her with every thread of his existence forced him into a territory more dangerous to him than his last mission.Why must she be so difficult?Why did he care? *** Emma sat on the edge of her bed, a faded picture held lightly between her fingers. Tears edged her lashes and dropped silently onto her cheek, weaving a warm path to her chin. She sniffed, grabbed a tissue off her nightstand, and continued staring at the photograph.Nate Connor’s blue eyes stared at her. They were identical to Stone’s and caused an uncomfortable hitch in her heart. These men belonged together. Time hadn’t healed their wounds it only rubbed the salt of anger deeper into the raw flesh. She closed her eyes and images flashed in her mind.A tiny piglet wiggling from strong arms, dashing across the barn yard and straight into Emma’s grasp. How’d Nate known? Was it be possible for a man who’d abandoned his only child to understand that her aching, thirteen year-old soul, needed something to hang on to…something to remind her to live? If that were the truth, then Nate Connor paid more than once for past indiscretions.Emma stood up, swiped the tissue across her face, and exited the bedroom. Her wine was on that back deck, and she’d muck stalls before allowing Tilly to consume that bottleThe deck was empty.Dishes were gone, glasses cleared away and the ice bucket vacant of her coveted fruit.Wow, she thought. They’d moved fast.Ignoring the envious rage building, Emma returned to her rooms.She needed to leave.She wanted to stay.Shaking her head in frustration, she let loose a strangled scream. Could life become more complicated?A soft knock on her bedroom window startled Emma. She peered out the curtains and frowned when Nate’s face smiled back. Damn. She opened the window, and he climbed through.Her heart hammered in fear. If Stone pulled one of his silent approaches, she’d be done for.“Nate, you have to leave.”“Why?” He yanked her into a fierce hug. “I miss you baby girl.”She pushed back, patting his cheek and smiling. “I miss you, too. But Stone’s threatened me with dismissal if he catches you on the property.”“I see,” he said. A familiar cloud descended across his eyes, and she couldn’t hold in her derisive snort. “What?”“You and Stone have a lot in common.”“I should hope not. I’d hate to think he’d fallen down the same hell-hole I did.”“Maybe not the same, but he’s somewhere blacker than a bear’s butt.” Emma walked to her door and made sure she couldn’t hear the approach of footsteps.“Who taught you to speak like that?”“You did,” she smiled then sobered. “I’ll come to you.”He stared at her long and hard then shook his head. “Don’t you dare. It’s too risky.”“No it’s not.”“Emma, there’s been talk in town.”She frowned and wondered at the sudden change in conversation. “What kind of talk?”“An Irish political member, possibly Seamus, is searching for property to purchase in this area. His goons have been blabbing all about his wealth and celebrity status. They’re stinking up the saloons.”His last words froze her in place. “What’re you doing in the saloons?” Why hadn’t she been told? Time for new spies, Emma quickly decided.“It’s not what you think, sweetie. I’m collecting their old bottles and making lamps.”“Lamps? Since when?”“Remember I made the one for the Christmas party last year? Billy Perkins loved it and stuck it in his store. Apparently, a lot of other people loved it too. I’m doing quite well. But this is all beside the point.”Emma’s mind spun. Nate committing to something? Doing something with his life? She’d become used to her job of making sure he felt connected, making sure he didn’t slip down the alcoholic landslide that’d left him broken and alone. “I’m sorry, Nate. I didn’t know.”“It’s okay, baby girl. I wanted it to be a surprise. I’ve started building my cabin on that lot Margaret left me. I feel good.”“I love you,” she said, her eyes tearing up. She’d been a fool to think he couldn’t survive without her.“Back to the men in town…”“It could be anyone,” she said. Her fingers twined together, and she dug her nails into her skin.“It sounds like him.”“Do you think he knows I’m here?”Nate ran his hand over his face and shrugged. “I’m not sure, but it’s too close. If he gained access to privileged files, he’d know about me. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to put two and two together. He’s done it before.”“But why now? Why fifteen years later?”Nate scratched the back of his head. “Elections, I gather. Let me do some more digging and see if something’s triggered this renewed search, if that’s what it is. Then again, baby girl, it could all be innocent.”If Seamus Adams were here, her life flipped from complicated to impossible. The man that scraped a bloody knife across her mother’s throat and watched coldheartedly as life slowly seeped from eyes that used to bathe Emma in love, was closing in. “I don’t think so. I’ve felt exposed and wary ever since Margaret passed away. I’m thinking now’s a good time to trust my spidey sense.”“No, you’re hurting. We’re all hurting. But I want you to promise me something.” He squeezed her shoulder.“Anything, Nate. What can I do for you?”“No. It’s what you can do for yourself.”“What?”“I want you to ask my son for help.” His words slammed into her like an icy snowball.“No.”“He’ll help you,” he said. “I can’t anymore.”“No. He’s not the boy you remember, Nate. He’s no hero just a broken man mad at his father and the world.”Nate frowned and shook his head. “I think you’re wrong, at least partially. I’m sure he’s mad at me. I did some unforgivable things. But he’s not broken, not my son…not a Connor.”“Whatever,” she sighed. “But I’m not asking for his help.”“I’ll not leave until you promise.”“I can’t make that promise. You’d better go. Old soft shoe himself could come barging in here at any moment and send us both out on our skinny butts.”Instead of going to the window, Nate walked to her door. He opened it and proceeded to walk out.“Where’re you going?”“To tell my son you need help.”Emma’s heart stopped. No. If Nate knew how much Stone hated him, it’d send him back to the bottle for sure. If Stone knew Nate was here, it’d send her right out into the cold and smack in the face of Seamus Adams.“I promise,” she said softly.“I didn’t hear that?”“I promise.”Nate grinned, stepped back into the room and kissed her cheek. He then slipped silently out the window. Emma swore silently. With the threat of Seamus Adams, she needed to insure her job was safe. As much as she hated the idea, an apology was in order, but she’d hold off on her promise. Nate hadn’t specified when she needed to confess. *** Emma stood outside Stone’s door. She hated groveling but revenge wasn’t a worthy ally.One cheek biting apology needed delivering.Knocking gently on the door, she waited. Was Tilly still inside performing all sorts of contortions on his body? Jealousy wasn’t an attribute she usually labeled herself with, and she didn’t like it one bit.Knocking once more, her breath hitched when she heard a soft moan.A muffled scream followed. Emma turned to leave, hating the bitter emotions swirling in the pit of her stomach. Another yell stopped her. That wasn’t erotic, it was panicked. The following howl, propelled her forward, through the door at a dead run. Something was wrong.Stone was in bed, alone, tossing back and forth fighting an invisible demon. Emma rushed to his side. She grabbed for his arm.“Stone, wake up.”He struck out. His fist connected with her cheek, knocking her off the side of the bed. Scrambling back to her feet, Emma climbed on the mattress and straddled his chest. She couldn’t match his strength. Struggling against his powerful muscles, she called his name.“Dammit, Stone, wake up.”All motion stopped. She exhaled in relief when his eyes opened. Her heart caught as her gaze fell into sapphire pools of raw pain.“You were having a nightmare.” Heat soaked through the sheet, through the fabric of her pants, and straight into her core.The anguish written across his face sliced through her soul. Wherever he’d just been must have been three levels lower than hell.He reached up, caressing her cheek. His touch sparked flames that simmered and burst into a raging inferno. She closed her eyes. Pulling her down slowly, he touched his lips hers. Jolts of desire slammed into her chest, causing her breath to catch. Stone deepened the kiss, running his tongue across her mouth and then tugging her closer and plundering within.He needed. She gave.It was a kiss meant to heal but instead Emma felt as if her world disintegrated into nothing more than the ashes left behind by summer firestorms. He consumed her, touched and taking with his tongue more than she’d bargained for.Blood pounded through her brains. Emma knew if she didn’t break the kiss, she’d be lost forever. *** Stone was dying. Every nerve fired blasts of desire and need, burning through his reserve. The feel of Emma’s lips against his triggered emotions he knew weren’t ready to see the light of day.Taking one last sip of pure ecstasy, he held her face gently between his hands. Running his tongue lightly over the sweet edge of paradise, he inhaled the light scent of jasmine that swirled and touched his senses then committed it all to memory.He couldn’t have this.Stone closed his eyes, pushed Emma back and pulled away.“Sorry ‘bout that,” he said. He brought forth the memory of the life fading from his men--it helped crash down the gates against the enticing allure of Ms. Emma O’Malley.“You were having a nightmare.” The sudden confusion in her voice twisted his gut into knots.“I thought you were someone else.”“Oh, I see.” It didn’t matter that she hid her face and scrambled off the bed faster than a coyote leaping for its kill, Stone saw the pain. He also saw a huge dark smudge beneath her left eye.“What the hell?” Reaching across the bed, he grabbed her arm and pulled her closer so that the dim light of the bathroom highlighted her face. She turned away. “What happened to your face?”“Nothing.”“Don’t lie to me. It looks like you’ve been hit.” Lifting her head slowly, Stone inhaled at the anger blazing from her emerald eyes…eyes that belonged in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow and not shadowed by fear and disgust.“I was.”“Who?” He ran his finger across the swelling flesh, and she pulled back as if his touch revolted her.“You. You hit me.” Emma jumped off the bed and dashed from the room.Stone collapsed back onto his pillows. His head pounded and felt too heavy to hold up. Scrunching his eyes closed, he tried to breathe past the pain in his chest. Another person he’d hurt. Another innocent life his poisoned fingers had touched. He could remember her smile, remember her laugh at his clumsy attempt to help her pig, remember the wonder on her face as she watched an eagle fly. But he couldn’t remember his fist connecting with her soft skin. What fuck-up.Laying quietly, he ignored the tear that slipped from the corner of his eye.",

      "content": "Chapter Four “You shaved.” An uncomfortable pang constricted Emma’s heart. He’d done it. With one swipe of the blade, Stone Connor had flicked off the scab of solitude and opened her soul to a longing she’d never dared contemplate.“Yeah, don’t make a big deal of it. I’m not real happy right now.”“But you look great,” she said, trying desperately to control the frenzied rhythm of her pulse. He’d been roughly attractive before; but now, without all the facial hair masking his chiseled features, Stone Connor was downright gorgeous. The vulnerability hidden smartly behind cynical eyes undid her, luring her into an alien place.Emma studied his face, tracing a finger down the right side of his cheekbone to a strong, square jaw. He tensed and pulled her hand away.She shouldn’t have touched him, but her impulses refused to be disregarded. “Sorry.”“I figured I’d better look the part of an expensive resort owner and not a mountain man.”“I see,” Emma said, a little disappointed. Ridiculous, she silently chided herself. It’s not like he’d do something like this for me. Curbing her bubbling emotions, she remembered the way he’d gazed at her wrapped in the towel. Attraction, in the physical sense, didn’t equal the heartrending sensation rapidly seizing her soul.“Want some wine?” He stepped back, a cold draft snaked its way up her arm, replacing the warm tingle of his skin.“Yes, please. I’ll just slip inside and inform Tilly we’re ready to eat.”“Why not wait a few minutes,” he said, startling her. “I’d like to talk to you.”Emma nodded and took a seat at the table. He smiled, displaying a sexy dimple that snagged her attention.“What? Am I bleeding?”“No. I just hadn’t expected that.” She pointed to his cheek.“What?”“That dimple.”He frowned, the sudden warmth in his eyes fading. “I’d forgotten,” he said.Emma looked at her hands, twisting a napkin between her fingers. Forgotten? How did a person forget their own face?“What do you want to talk about?”“Your salary.”She reached up and gripped the stem of her wine glass. Talk about forgetting. “I don’t have one,” she said.“That’s what the accounting reports indicate, and I’d like to change that.” Stone sat back, sipping his wine. His eyes locked onto hers. She ignored the desire that began twirling in her chest instead focusing on this latest obstacle.“I don’t want a salary.”“I’m not leaving you River Run which means I need to pay you a salary.”“Is that what you think? That I don’t have a salary because I expected Margaret to hand River Run to me on a silver platter?”“What else am I to think?”“You sonofa....” Emma couldn’t finish. Her anger swept the beauty of the evening away. She’d thought maybe he’d changed, warmed up, fit in…made a decision to commit. Isn’t that why he’d shaved?Obviously not.Stone Connor cared only about himself. She could only guess at his motivation, and it certainly wasn’t toward her best interest. He probably wanted to alleviate his guilt, pay her a ridiculous sum in order to convince his warped sense of righteousness that he’d recompensed her appropriately for a lifetime of blood.What did she expect?No, Emma realized, her problems were her own. She hadn’t explained her history because he’d fire her. How could she anticipate his understanding? She needed a plan. An escape route.She needed to quit overreacting.“Hey, don’t go getting all twisted hither and nither. It was an easy assumption.” He leaned forward placing his hand on hers. Emma resisted turning her palm over and grabbing his hand like it was the last rung on a ten-story fire escape. She wouldn’t trust this man.“Stop tearing that napkin to shreds. I’m not being confrontational, but I’d like to right any wrongs from the past.”“Your grandmother provided quite handsomely for me, and I’m no charity case.” Emma refused to fall for his counterfeit charm again. She knew the heart of the beast, and it was solid granite. This salary war wasn’t about paying her--it was about control.“Still, you deserve a salary.”“No.”“Why?”“I prefer to leave things as they are.”“Which is?”“River Run pays my expenses with a bonus at the end of each year. The bonus is based on a percentage of the previous year’s profits, and the sum is then invested in Clover Enterprises.”Stone raised one brow. “Clover is you?”“Yes,” she said, ignoring the skeptical expression.“Funny, I thought it was someone else.”“It’s mine.”Emma said a silent prayer. He’d certainly deduced that Nate Connor’s name signed and authorized all transactions for Clover Enterprises. If he delved any deeper, it could very well explode years of planning.The man sitting across from her would be shocked to discover she had no license, no bank account, no social security number. As far as the computer banks and the government were concerned, she didn’t exist.It needed to remain that way.Stone relaxed, obviously content with her explanation. At least he wasn’t pushing anymore.Emma raised her glass and sipped the wine. It was her favorite. An Italian Chardonnay the color of honey with a smooth, buttery taste. She detested the woodsy overtone of the more popular Chardonnay’s, and her discovery of this wine sprouted a dangerous obsession. She exercised restraint and limited herself to one bottle a week.“This is great wine,” Stone said.“Be careful, it’s addictive.”“Really?”“Uh huh,” she murmured, lost for a moment as the liquid gold slipped down her throat, burning slightly. This was how Stone made her feel, she realized with a start. Careful girl. That kind of thinking would only lead to heartbreak.“Next item on my agenda…” Stone leaned forward and focused all his attention on her face, causing a river of panic to surface. What did he know? “Is a stipulation that if not followed will result in immediate dismissal.”Her throat tightened, and she swallowed back the sudden panic.“My father isn’t to step one foot on this property.”“But...”“No,” he warned. “This is not up for discussion.”Emma sat back, her chest constricting in pain. She didn’t know who this affected the most…him, her, his father? All three of them, she figured.Could she manage a year without Nate? More importantly, could Nate manage a year without her? Leaving River Run and moving in with Nate wasn’t an option. She’d considered it briefly the first night Stone arrived, but the thought of bringing trouble to a man who’d survived a grueling life seemed unfair.She’d protect Nate. He’d sheltered her from loneliness and pain at great personal cost. The man didn’t need any more problems, and the arrival of his son already caused him agony.“I understand your feelings...” she began, but the dangerous shadow that crossed Stone’s face interrupted her.“How could you? I don’t know what lies he’s told you, but I can certainly assure you that you don’t understand. Look at your surroundings, look at where you were raised.”She stood and tossed her napkin on the table. Bending down, her nose practically touching his, she could feel his breath on her face. “Look at where I was raised?” She battled to control her anger and despair. “You know nothing. You could’ve had this...all of this and then some, but instead you ran. But don’t you worry, Mr. Connor, I’ll respect your wishes. However, I won’t be able to stay the year, that’s asking too much.”Emma turned around and collided with Tilly. “It looks like Mr. Connor will be dining alone tonight,” she said.“What do you mean you won’t be able to stay the year?” Stone called to her back. She stopped, turned and faced him.“Your father needs me,” she said. Her anger at his self-centered demand barely remained in check. “He won’t survive.”“But…”She raised her hand, denying any retort. “I’ll be leaving as soon as I find an apartment.” Her heart stuttered. How was she going to find a place to rent? Money wasn’t the problem, it was the application. Her name would be made public. Damn, Stone Connor. Damn him.“Stop,” Stone yelled, rising to his feet and crossing the space in three long strides. He grabbed her arm and stared into her eyes. His steely gaze laced with a hint of desperation confirmed to Emma that his capability to manage River Run was nil. “I don’t want you to leave.”What a snake pit of contradiction. His actions defied his words at every corner of their conversation. He didn’t want her to leave, but he demanded unreasonable restrictions. Unfortunately, her position remained equally as perilous. They needed one another, whether they liked it or not.“I need to see your father.”“Why? What’s he to you?”“Do you really want to know?” Emma pushed his hand off her arm, stepping forward and jabbing a finger to his chest. “You don’t care. You won’t forgive.”“Damn right, I won’t forgive. That man’s nothing but pig slop to me.”“It’s a shame, you know? The two of you have so many wonderful qualities in common it’d be a real show stopper to see who’d out spit the other.”Stone glared at her. “I’m nothing like that man.”“You’d be surprised.” Emma turned once more, heading into the house.“Does he have to come here?” Stone called.She paused and thought a moment. Attempting to lay her emotions aside and think clearly, Emma contemplated her best interests. She faced Stone.“No, I’ll go to him.”“See?” He grinned lopsidedly. “We can do this. You don’t have to run away every time I’m being difficult.”Emma didn’t find any of this humorous. Actually, her stomach felt as if it’d sunk to the bottom of Jenny Lake. She’d go to Nate. She’d stay with Stone. Why then, did it all feel wrong?“I’m no longer hungry.”“What a shame,” Tilly interrupted, scooting in from the kitchen. “Maybe he’ll appreciate a little company of the more friendly kind.” Emma watched in astonishment as the chef gracefully slid into the chair beside Stone. “It’s a shame for all the food to go to waste,” she practically cooed.Turning to see Stone’s reaction, her gut twisted painfully at his obvious interest in Tilly.“Fine, Tilly. It appears Mr. Connor might be up for a little friendly conversation.”Turning, she walked as gracefully as possible across the deck and into the house. She could feel his black gaze burning her back. Damn, but if she wasn’t jealous… *** “So, Mr. Connor, what’ll it be? Appetizers? Or do you want to skip right to dessert?”Stone eyed Tilly. He couldn’t believe Emma walked away leaving him here with this over-bearing, top-heavy, slithering slut. It appeared Ms. O’Malley didn’t care whether or not he accepted Tilly’s unspoken invitation.That bothered him.He slapped away the all too familiar feeling of abandonment. Emotion wasn’t good. Swearing silently, he realized Emma O’Malley was no better than his father. The second something he said or did contradicted her goals, she ran. He hoped the exit door didn’t sting too badly when it hit her on the back.“Just make me a plate, Tilly. I’ll take it to my room.” He rose and grabbed the wine. No use wasting a good chardonnay. “Alone,” he continued as Tilly waggled her brows.“Your loss, boss.” She left the deck and went into the kitchen returning a few minutes later with a steaming plate of food. “Enjoy.”Stone took the plate and headed to his suite. Needing Emma’s cooperation to continue the successful atmosphere of River Run was one thing, but wanting her with every thread of his existence forced him into a territory more dangerous to him than his last mission.Why must she be so difficult?Why did he care? *** Emma sat on the edge of her bed, a faded picture held lightly between her fingers. Tears edged her lashes and dropped silently onto her cheek, weaving a warm path to her chin. She sniffed, grabbed a tissue off her nightstand, and continued staring at the photograph.Nate Connor’s blue eyes stared at her. They were identical to Stone’s and caused an uncomfortable hitch in her heart. These men belonged together. Time hadn’t healed their wounds it only rubbed the salt of anger deeper into the raw flesh. She closed her eyes and images flashed in her mind.A tiny piglet wiggling from strong arms, dashing across the barn yard and straight into Emma’s grasp. How’d Nate known? Was it be possible for a man who’d abandoned his only child to understand that her aching, thirteen year-old soul, needed something to hang on to…something to remind her to live? If that were the truth, then Nate Connor paid more than once for past indiscretions.Emma stood up, swiped the tissue across her face, and exited the bedroom. Her wine was on that back deck, and she’d muck stalls before allowing Tilly to consume that bottleThe deck was empty.Dishes were gone, glasses cleared away and the ice bucket vacant of her coveted fruit.Wow, she thought. They’d moved fast.Ignoring the envious rage building, Emma returned to her rooms.She needed to leave.She wanted to stay.Shaking her head in frustration, she let loose a strangled scream. Could life become more complicated?A soft knock on her bedroom window startled Emma. She peered out the curtains and frowned when Nate’s face smiled back. Damn. She opened the window, and he climbed through.Her heart hammered in fear. If Stone pulled one of his silent approaches, she’d be done for.“Nate, you have to leave.”“Why?” He yanked her into a fierce hug. “I miss you baby girl.”She pushed back, patting his cheek and smiling. “I miss you, too. But Stone’s threatened me with dismissal if he catches you on the property.”“I see,” he said. A familiar cloud descended across his eyes, and she couldn’t hold in her derisive snort. “What?”“You and Stone have a lot in common.”“I should hope not. I’d hate to think he’d fallen down the same hell-hole I did.”“Maybe not the same, but he’s somewhere blacker than a bear’s butt.” Emma walked to her door and made sure she couldn’t hear the approach of footsteps.“Who taught you to speak like that?”“You did,” she smiled then sobered. “I’ll come to you.”He stared at her long and hard then shook his head. “Don’t you dare. It’s too risky.”“No it’s not.”“Emma, there’s been talk in town.”She frowned and wondered at the sudden change in conversation. “What kind of talk?”“An Irish political member, possibly Seamus, is searching for property to purchase in this area. His goons have been blabbing all about his wealth and celebrity status. They’re stinking up the saloons.”His last words froze her in place. “What’re you doing in the saloons?” Why hadn’t she been told? Time for new spies, Emma quickly decided.“It’s not what you think, sweetie. I’m collecting their old bottles and making lamps.”“Lamps? Since when?”“Remember I made the one for the Christmas party last year? Billy Perkins loved it and stuck it in his store. Apparently, a lot of other people loved it too. I’m doing quite well. But this is all beside the point.”Emma’s mind spun. Nate committing to something? Doing something with his life? She’d become used to her job of making sure he felt connected, making sure he didn’t slip down the alcoholic landslide that’d left him broken and alone. “I’m sorry, Nate. I didn’t know.”“It’s okay, baby girl. I wanted it to be a surprise. I’ve started building my cabin on that lot Margaret left me. I feel good.”“I love you,” she said, her eyes tearing up. She’d been a fool to think he couldn’t survive without her.“Back to the men in town…”“It could be anyone,” she said. Her fingers twined together, and she dug her nails into her skin.“It sounds like him.”“Do you think he knows I’m here?”Nate ran his hand over his face and shrugged. “I’m not sure, but it’s too close. If he gained access to privileged files, he’d know about me. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to put two and two together. He’s done it before.”“But why now? Why fifteen years later?”Nate scratched the back of his head. “Elections, I gather. Let me do some more digging and see if something’s triggered this renewed search, if that’s what it is. Then again, baby girl, it could all be innocent.”If Seamus Adams were here, her life flipped from complicated to impossible. The man that scraped a bloody knife across her mother’s throat and watched coldheartedly as life slowly seeped from eyes that used to bathe Emma in love, was closing in. “I don’t think so. I’ve felt exposed and wary ever since Margaret passed away. I’m thinking now’s a good time to trust my spidey sense.”“No, you’re hurting. We’re all hurting. But I want you to promise me something.” He squeezed her shoulder.“Anything, Nate. What can I do for you?”“No. It’s what you can do for yourself.”“What?”“I want you to ask my son for help.” His words slammed into her like an icy snowball.“No.”“He’ll help you,” he said. “I can’t anymore.”“No. He’s not the boy you remember, Nate. He’s no hero just a broken man mad at his father and the world.”Nate frowned and shook his head. “I think you’re wrong, at least partially. I’m sure he’s mad at me. I did some unforgivable things. But he’s not broken, not my son…not a Connor.”“Whatever,” she sighed. “But I’m not asking for his help.”“I’ll not leave until you promise.”“I can’t make that promise. You’d better go. Old soft shoe himself could come barging in here at any moment and send us both out on our skinny butts.”Instead of going to the window, Nate walked to her door. He opened it and proceeded to walk out.“Where’re you going?”“To tell my son you need help.”Emma’s heart stopped. No. If Nate knew how much Stone hated him, it’d send him back to the bottle for sure. If Stone knew Nate was here, it’d send her right out into the cold and smack in the face of Seamus Adams.“I promise,” she said softly.“I didn’t hear that?”“I promise.”Nate grinned, stepped back into the room and kissed her cheek. He then slipped silently out the window. Emma swore silently. With the threat of Seamus Adams, she needed to insure her job was safe. As much as she hated the idea, an apology was in order, but she’d hold off on her promise. Nate hadn’t specified when she needed to confess. *** Emma stood outside Stone’s door. She hated groveling but revenge wasn’t a worthy ally.One cheek biting apology needed delivering.Knocking gently on the door, she waited. Was Tilly still inside performing all sorts of contortions on his body? Jealousy wasn’t an attribute she usually labeled herself with, and she didn’t like it one bit.Knocking once more, her breath hitched when she heard a soft moan.A muffled scream followed. Emma turned to leave, hating the bitter emotions swirling in the pit of her stomach. Another yell stopped her. That wasn’t erotic, it was panicked. The following howl, propelled her forward, through the door at a dead run. Something was wrong.Stone was in bed, alone, tossing back and forth fighting an invisible demon. Emma rushed to his side. She grabbed for his arm.“Stone, wake up.”He struck out. His fist connected with her cheek, knocking her off the side of the bed. Scrambling back to her feet, Emma climbed on the mattress and straddled his chest. She couldn’t match his strength. Struggling against his powerful muscles, she called his name.“Dammit, Stone, wake up.”All motion stopped. She exhaled in relief when his eyes opened. Her heart caught as her gaze fell into sapphire pools of raw pain.“You were having a nightmare.” Heat soaked through the sheet, through the fabric of her pants, and straight into her core.The anguish written across his face sliced through her soul. Wherever he’d just been must have been three levels lower than hell.He reached up, caressing her cheek. His touch sparked flames that simmered and burst into a raging inferno. She closed her eyes. Pulling her down slowly, he touched his lips hers. Jolts of desire slammed into her chest, causing her breath to catch. Stone deepened the kiss, running his tongue across her mouth and then tugging her closer and plundering within.He needed. She gave.It was a kiss meant to heal but instead Emma felt as if her world disintegrated into nothing more than the ashes left behind by summer firestorms. He consumed her, touched and taking with his tongue more than she’d bargained for.Blood pounded through her brains. Emma knew if she didn’t break the kiss, she’d be lost forever. *** Stone was dying. Every nerve fired blasts of desire and need, burning through his reserve. The feel of Emma’s lips against his triggered emotions he knew weren’t ready to see the light of day.Taking one last sip of pure ecstasy, he held her face gently between his hands. Running his tongue lightly over the sweet edge of paradise, he inhaled the light scent of jasmine that swirled and touched his senses then committed it all to memory.He couldn’t have this.Stone closed his eyes, pushed Emma back and pulled away.“Sorry ‘bout that,” he said. He brought forth the memory of the life fading from his men--it helped crash down the gates against the enticing allure of Ms. Emma O’Malley.“You were having a nightmare.” The sudden confusion in her voice twisted his gut into knots.“I thought you were someone else.”“Oh, I see.” It didn’t matter that she hid her face and scrambled off the bed faster than a coyote leaping for its kill, Stone saw the pain. He also saw a huge dark smudge beneath her left eye.“What the hell?” Reaching across the bed, he grabbed her arm and pulled her closer so that the dim light of the bathroom highlighted her face. She turned away. “What happened to your face?”“Nothing.”“Don’t lie to me. It looks like you’ve been hit.” Lifting her head slowly, Stone inhaled at the anger blazing from her emerald eyes…eyes that belonged in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow and not shadowed by fear and disgust.“I was.”“Who?” He ran his finger across the swelling flesh, and she pulled back as if his touch revolted her.“You. You hit me.” Emma jumped off the bed and dashed from the room.Stone collapsed back onto his pillows. His head pounded and felt too heavy to hold up. Scrunching his eyes closed, he tried to breathe past the pain in his chest. Another person he’d hurt. Another innocent life his poisoned fingers had touched. He could remember her smile, remember her laugh at his clumsy attempt to help her pig, remember the wonder on her face as she watched an eagle fly. But he couldn’t remember his fist connecting with her soft skin. What fuck-up.Laying quietly, he ignored the tear that slipped from the corner of his eye.",

      "content": "Chapter Five Stone entered the kitchen, inhaling the sweet scent of coffee. He sauntered over to the array of silver dispensers, snatched a mug off the counter and filled it with the piping hot brew. Emma pulled a tray from the oven. Steam rose from the top of what appeared to be blueberry muffins. With a frown, he studied the edge of her cheekbone. Over the past days, the mark he’d left on her face went from an innocent light red to an ugly patch of muted yellows and greens. His stomach rolled at the reminder of his weakness.“I’m heading into town this morning. Do you need anything?” He cleared his voice of the rough edge and offered what he hoped was a warm smile. “I’m happy to go wherever.”Emma glanced up from her scrutiny of the muffins. “I’m good. Just testing a new recipe – let me know if you taste the hint of cinnamon in these.” She removed a muffin from the tray, placed it on a small plate and handed it to Stone.Stone glanced at the plate, then put it on the counter and grabbed the muffin. He bit into the center and closed his eyes in sheer pleasure. “This is good.” He polished the rest off in two bites and grinned at Emma. “Don’t know a thing about the cinnamon but that was a little slice of heaven.”Emma rolled her eyes and smiled. The only thing marring the beauty in the frame of his gaze was that horrible bruise. Stone’s smile slipped, and he nodded at her. “Call my cell if you think of anything you’ll need. I shouldn’t be gone more than a few hours.” He hated the warmth that drained from her face the second his tone turned gruff, but he didn’t know how to handle what she offered. Distance was better, for now. *** Stone pulled his Jeep onto the gravel drive of River’s Edge Ranch. He sighed as waves of his childhood crashed across the green fields and licked through cattle fences. The warmth of childhood memories blanketed his unease and anxiety and by the time he reached the main house, the thought of seeing his cousin filled him with an edge of happy. Stone shook his head, exited the Jeep and strode onto the wide front porch. He knocked on the door, turning and surveying the ranch while he waited for an answer.“Stone?” A deep voice boomed as the front door opened. “I couldn’t believe it when Alexa said you were stopping by. It’s great to see you, man.”Stone turned and faced his cousin. They were about the same height, but where Stone was dark, Ethan was light. Except the eyes. Ethan’s were somewhere between honey and mud, and Stone had the Connor blues. “Ethan, long time no see.”Ethan pulled him into a gruff bear hug. “Hate the story I’ve been hearin’.”“I know, man.” Stone slapped him on the shoulder. “It’s been a rough year.”“Care to share,” Ethan grinned and sauntered onto the front porch. They headed down the stairs in tandem step and did what they’d always done as children, walked to the barn.Stone shook his head. “Not particularly. But I would like your help.”“Emma’s story?”They reached the horse stalls, and Ethan tossed him a shovel. Stone grabbed it and flung open the gate to the first bay, his movements honed over years of growing up around River’s Edge. “Yeah, how’d you guess?”“Margaret. She was worried about her decision and asked that when the time was right I help you understand.”Stone huffed out a frustrated breath. “Understand? Hell, she’s pretty much confined me to jail.”“Help me finish the stalls, we’ll grab some brewskies and kick back in the rocking chairs. I’ll spill my guts.” Ethan pounded his fist against the wooden railings. “Deal?”“Deal.” Stone tucked into his chores and allowed the physical workout to heat his muscles and sooth the anger lying beneath his skin. It felt good. To be here, with a person he trusted with his life, and not hear the hollow laugh of Death.“I guess we’re done,” Ethan called from other end of the barn.Stone glanced up, rested the shovel and pitch fork he’d been using to muck the stalls and add fresh hay against the wall and surveyed the length of building. “I’d say it looks that way. Beer?”“You betcha,” Ethan laughed.They headed back to the porch. Stone fell into one of the aged rockers and kicked his boots off. Ethan returned from the house a few minutes later with a bucket laden with ice and half a dozen bottles of a brand Stone recognized as one of the local microbreweries. “This stuff any good?”“Yeah. Who’d figured T. J. would actually be good at anything?”Stone laughed. “Well, his Pa did like making moonshine.”“True that,” Ethan said and grinned. “What can I tell you that you haven’t already figured out about Emma?”“She clearly has issues and an unhealthy obsession with River Run.” Stone popped the cap off his bottle, took a healthy swig and grinned at Ethan. “Good.”“Are you telling me that covert ops Ranger extraordinaire Stone Connor hasn’t accessed confidential databases to unearth the identity and background of Emma O’Malley?” Ethan appeared honestly perplexed.“Why would I have done that?”Ethan barked out a hearty laugh. “Boy, she’s blinded you with those wicked green eyes and Irish red hair.”Stone frowned not finding any of this funny. “I realize 2 and 2 are not adding up to 4 – but why would I ever think to do a background check on her. Is she a criminal?” That thought didn’t sit well, deepening the edge of his frown.Ethan handed Stone another beer. “No. She’s not. She’s actually not a real person.”“I’m listening.” Stone stated, his tone flat in contrast to Ethan’s slightly amused lilt.“Don’t get pissed off until I explain. Apparently your…um, Nate owed Emma’s father a personal debt and agreed to smuggle her out of Ireland and keep her safe here in Jackson. She’s using a false name and has no formal identity in the States. Margaret donated quite a healthy sum to the local schools to keep that fact quiet. So, in a nutshell, she’s kind of in our very own homegrown Connor family witness protection program.” Ethan glanced at Stone and nodded. “It’s the truth.”“You don’t say,” Stone drawled. His mind worried through Ethan’s words and came up with an amount of questions that gave him a headache. “Who is she?”“Emilie Gallagher, daughter of an ex-Irish political leader named Hugh Gallagher. Her mother was murdered in front of her fifteen years ago. Her father disappeared, presumed dead. The man Emma claims murdered her mother is none other than Seamus Adams.”At that, Ethan had Stone’s undivided attention. “The dude running for Prime Minister?”“One and only.”Stone picked at the label on his beer. “I saw him on the news last night. He’s here in town.”“Looking for property, they say.” Ethan tilted his head and shrugged.“You think he knows about Emma?”“I think if I’m vying for the most powerful seat in my homeland, I’d be damned certain there was nothing between me and that election.”“This is a lot to absorb. I need to do some research on our Mr. Adams.”Ethan nodded. “And Emma?”Stone shrugged. “I’ll talk to her. Now, here’s the million dollar question. What the fuck was Margaret thinking leaving me River Run?” He snagged the last beer in the bucket and inhaled a gulp.“I don’t think your grandmother expected you to want River Run. What she expected was for you to protect Emma.” Ethan sighed and squeezed Stone’s shoulder. “I also believe she prayed you and your daddy would find a way back one another.”“That’ll never happen.” Stone recognized Ethan’s silence for what it was. Disagreement. He appreciated his cousin’s refrain from verbalizing what Stone didn’t want to hear.Ethan finally let out a shallow laugh. “And, deep down, I think she was playing matchmaker.”“What? Me and Emma? We’re like oil and water, man. That’s also never gonna happen.”“Really?” Ethan said, his mouth twitched with laughter.Stone glared at his cousin. “Really.”“Have you looked at her? I mean really looked at her?”Stone slid his boots on, stood, tossed his empty bottle in the bucket. “I’m not going there. Ever.”“Okay. Seth will be thrilled to hear that. He’s got a bit of a crush on little Emma.”Stone jogged to his truck and waved back at his cousin. “Fine, she’s all his.”“If you say so,” Ethan laughed as he walked into the house.Igniting the engine, Stone continued to frown. What was it that Ethan said that’d turned the afternoon grey? Emma. Danger. He was on that. No worries. Something else niggled, something about Seth, but it was as elusive as a mole in sunlight.",

      "content": "Chapter Five Stone entered the kitchen, inhaling the sweet scent of coffee. He sauntered over to the array of silver dispensers, snatched a mug off the counter and filled it with the piping hot brew. Emma pulled a tray from the oven. Steam rose from the top of what appeared to be blueberry muffins. With a frown, he studied the edge of her cheekbone. Over the past days, the mark he’d left on her face went from an innocent light red to an ugly patch of muted yellows and greens. His stomach rolled at the reminder of his weakness.“I’m heading into town this morning. Do you need anything?” He cleared his voice of the rough edge and offered what he hoped was a warm smile. “I’m happy to go wherever.”Emma glanced up from her scrutiny of the muffins. “I’m good. Just testing a new recipe – let me know if you taste the hint of cinnamon in these.” She removed a muffin from the tray, placed it on a small plate and handed it to Stone.Stone glanced at the plate, then put it on the counter and grabbed the muffin. He bit into the center and closed his eyes in sheer pleasure. “This is good.” He polished the rest off in two bites and grinned at Emma. “Don’t know a thing about the cinnamon but that was a little slice of heaven.”Emma rolled her eyes and smiled. The only thing marring the beauty in the frame of his gaze was that horrible bruise. Stone’s smile slipped, and he nodded at her. “Call my cell if you think of anything you’ll need. I shouldn’t be gone more than a few hours.” He hated the warmth that drained from her face the second his tone turned gruff, but he didn’t know how to handle what she offered. Distance was better, for now. *** Stone pulled his Jeep onto the gravel drive of River’s Edge Ranch. He sighed as waves of his childhood crashed across the green fields and licked through cattle fences. The warmth of childhood memories blanketed his unease and anxiety and by the time he reached the main house, the thought of seeing his cousin filled him with an edge of happy. Stone shook his head, exited the Jeep and strode onto the wide front porch. He knocked on the door, turning and surveying the ranch while he waited for an answer.“Stone?” A deep voice boomed as the front door opened. “I couldn’t believe it when Alexa said you were stopping by. It’s great to see you, man.”Stone turned and faced his cousin. They were about the same height, but where Stone was dark, Ethan was light. Except the eyes. Ethan’s were somewhere between honey and mud, and Stone had the Connor blues. “Ethan, long time no see.”Ethan pulled him into a gruff bear hug. “Hate the story I’ve been hearin’.”“I know, man.” Stone slapped him on the shoulder. “It’s been a rough year.”“Care to share,” Ethan grinned and sauntered onto the front porch. They headed down the stairs in tandem step and did what they’d always done as children, walked to the barn.Stone shook his head. “Not particularly. But I would like your help.”“Emma’s story?”They reached the horse stalls, and Ethan tossed him a shovel. Stone grabbed it and flung open the gate to the first bay, his movements honed over years of growing up around River’s Edge. “Yeah, how’d you guess?”“Margaret. She was worried about her decision and asked that when the time was right I help you understand.”Stone huffed out a frustrated breath. “Understand? Hell, she’s pretty much confined me to jail.”“Help me finish the stalls, we’ll grab some brewskies and kick back in the rocking chairs. I’ll spill my guts.” Ethan pounded his fist against the wooden railings. “Deal?”“Deal.” Stone tucked into his chores and allowed the physical workout to heat his muscles and sooth the anger lying beneath his skin. It felt good. To be here, with a person he trusted with his life, and not hear the hollow laugh of Death.“I guess we’re done,” Ethan called from other end of the barn.Stone glanced up, rested the shovel and pitch fork he’d been using to muck the stalls and add fresh hay against the wall and surveyed the length of building. “I’d say it looks that way. Beer?”“You betcha,” Ethan laughed.They headed back to the porch. Stone fell into one of the aged rockers and kicked his boots off. Ethan returned from the house a few minutes later with a bucket laden with ice and half a dozen bottles of a brand Stone recognized as one of the local microbreweries. “This stuff any good?”“Yeah. Who’d figured T. J. would actually be good at anything?”Stone laughed. “Well, his Pa did like making moonshine.”“True that,” Ethan said and grinned. “What can I tell you that you haven’t already figured out about Emma?”“She clearly has issues and an unhealthy obsession with River Run.” Stone popped the cap off his bottle, took a healthy swig and grinned at Ethan. “Good.”“Are you telling me that covert ops Ranger extraordinaire Stone Connor hasn’t accessed confidential databases to unearth the identity and background of Emma O’Malley?” Ethan appeared honestly perplexed.“Why would I have done that?”Ethan barked out a hearty laugh. “Boy, she’s blinded you with those wicked green eyes and Irish red hair.”Stone frowned not finding any of this funny. “I realize 2 and 2 are not adding up to 4 – but why would I ever think to do a background check on her. Is she a criminal?” That thought didn’t sit well, deepening the edge of his frown.Ethan handed Stone another beer. “No. She’s not. She’s actually not a real person.”“I’m listening.” Stone stated, his tone flat in contrast to Ethan’s slightly amused lilt.“Don’t get pissed off until I explain. Apparently your…um, Nate owed Emma’s father a personal debt and agreed to smuggle her out of Ireland and keep her safe here in Jackson. She’s using a false name and has no formal identity in the States. Margaret donated quite a healthy sum to the local schools to keep that fact quiet. So, in a nutshell, she’s kind of in our very own homegrown Connor family witness protection program.” Ethan glanced at Stone and nodded. “It’s the truth.”“You don’t say,” Stone drawled. His mind worried through Ethan’s words and came up with an amount of questions that gave him a headache. “Who is she?”“Emilie Gallagher, daughter of an ex-Irish political leader named Hugh Gallagher. Her mother was murdered in front of her fifteen years ago. Her father disappeared, presumed dead. The man Emma claims murdered her mother is none other than Seamus Adams.”At that, Ethan had Stone’s undivided attention. “The dude running for Prime Minister?”“One and only.”Stone picked at the label on his beer. “I saw him on the news last night. He’s here in town.”“Looking for property, they say.” Ethan tilted his head and shrugged.“You think he knows about Emma?”“I think if I’m vying for the most powerful seat in my homeland, I’d be damned certain there was nothing between me and that election.”“This is a lot to absorb. I need to do some research on our Mr. Adams.”Ethan nodded. “And Emma?”Stone shrugged. “I’ll talk to her. Now, here’s the million dollar question. What the fuck was Margaret thinking leaving me River Run?” He snagged the last beer in the bucket and inhaled a gulp.“I don’t think your grandmother expected you to want River Run. What she expected was for you to protect Emma.” Ethan sighed and squeezed Stone’s shoulder. “I also believe she prayed you and your daddy would find a way back one another.”“That’ll never happen.” Stone recognized Ethan’s silence for what it was. Disagreement. He appreciated his cousin’s refrain from verbalizing what Stone didn’t want to hear.Ethan finally let out a shallow laugh. “And, deep down, I think she was playing matchmaker.”“What? Me and Emma? We’re like oil and water, man. That’s also never gonna happen.”“Really?” Ethan said, his mouth twitched with laughter.Stone glared at his cousin. “Really.”“Have you looked at her? I mean really looked at her?”Stone slid his boots on, stood, tossed his empty bottle in the bucket. “I’m not going there. Ever.”“Okay. Seth will be thrilled to hear that. He’s got a bit of a crush on little Emma.”Stone jogged to his truck and waved back at his cousin. “Fine, she’s all his.”“If you say so,” Ethan laughed as he walked into the house.Igniting the engine, Stone continued to frown. What was it that Ethan said that’d turned the afternoon grey? Emma. Danger. He was on that. No worries. Something else niggled, something about Seth, but it was as elusive as a mole in sunlight.",

      "content": "Chapter Six I thought you were someone else, Stone’s voice taunted. After all these weeks, you’d think she’d find a way to fix this scratch in her memory. Stone’s verbalization about his tryst with Tilly grated her mind like nails on a chalkboard.Emma made her way down the winding, gravel drive. Fall snapped its fingers last week and painted the horizon with vibrant orange and red. Two months, she mused. She’d survived two months within the same household as Stone Connor.She wondered whether Stone’s four seasons meant the entire season or if he’d be free of the ranch by springtime. If so, they’d waltzed right into Season Two, and she figured she’d almost crossed the halfway point.Over the past weeks, River Run symbolized a trophy neither Stone nor herself were willing to relinquish. They’d drawn lines, schemed and then arrived at the same conclusion. Working together appeared to be the only solution. Stone stepped into his authoritative duties, protecting his legacy with the iron hand of a military general. Emma catered to the guests, reinforced River Run’s five-star rating, and prayed nightly her boss didn’t turn his razor sharp intuitiveness in her direction.Inhaling the brisk autumn air, she stretched her arms to the late morning sun. Last night, the temperature dropped into the low forties, and the first fire of the season crackled and burned in River Run’s hearth. She could smell the burnt oak each time a soft breeze blew from behind. The sun promised to warm the day, holding at bay the icy wind that blew from the top of the Grand Tetons. It’d be another few weeks before first snowfall.Emma finally reached the main gate. Where was Nate?The crunch of gravel to her back made her sigh with a bit of dread. She turned and waved as Stone Connor pulled his Jeep to the gate. “Hop in,” he barked.“I’m meeting someone.”Emma watched a myriad of emotions cross Stone’s eyes, but he bit back any reference to his father. “Can you call and reschedule. We need to talk.”Panic bubbled in her gut. “Can it wait?”Stone sighed and rolled his eyes. “I haven’t pried into your business with him once over the past few weeks. I’m politely requesting that you reschedule today because we have important things to talk about.” Stone paused. He snagged his ball cap off his head and ran his fingers through the mop of black hair matted to his forehead. “I know who you are, Emilie.”Emma froze. Air drained from her lungs and she slipped to the ground, hugging her knees to her chest. “Who else?” Her voice sounded tinny as she fought against the ring of fear. “Who else have you told?”“What?” Stone jumped out of the Jeep. “No one. I wouldn’t tell anyone and endanger you.”Emma shook her head. “I don’t understand.”“I don’t care who the hell you are, Emma O’Malley – Emilie Gallagher. Doesn’t make a difference. What I do care about is the fact that my grandmother expected me to keep you safe. I can do that…if you let me.” He helped her back to her feet. “If you trust me.”Emma gazed into his eyes. There were no clouds. No dishonesty. “Why?”He shrugged. “Because it’s how I’m made.” He offered her a genuine smile. “They don’t let just anyone into the Rangers, you know.”She grinned and tilted her head. “I know.”Nate Connor’s battered truck pulled up to the gate. Emma waved at him to stay in the vehicle and then offered her full attention back to Stone. “Can this wait just an hour? I promise I’ll be back by two.”The ease exited Stone’s stance, and she hated the fact she’d caused that. “Fine. We’ll talk at two.”Before rational thinking took hold, Emma stood on her tiptoes and kissed Stone’s cheek. He stepped back, but she rested the palm of her hand where her lips had been. “Thank you, Stone.”She backed away, but the flare of emotion flickering in the depths of Stone’s eyes hadn’t gone unnoticed. Emma quickly unlocked and slipped through the side pedestrian gate. Waving at Nate, she jogged to the vehicle, opened the passenger side, and hopped in.“Mornin’, baby girl.” Nate grinned and winked. He put the truck in gear and drove away. “You okay?” He nodded toward the Jeep that headed back up the drive to River Run.“Fine.”They’d managed this weekly rendezvous, and to Emma’s delight it seemed enough for Nate.A few weeks of hyperventilating each time Nate’s truck pulled onto the main road had dimmed to a tiny pinprick of fear. Fifteen years Emma stayed hidden behind the walls of River Run, rarely venturing into town. Now, spending one day a week riding beside Nate, the world waved a carrot under her nose.They’d hiked and explored the wilderness of the national parks that made their corner of the world famous. Nate’s constant state of nervousness dimmed the golden trips to a dull silver, but Emma ignored his concerns, insisting they continue these weekly visits.Leaning over, she planted a kiss on Nate’s cheek. “Where’re we heading today?”“I thought, if you didn’t have to be back for a few hours, you might like to see the cabin.”“Really?” Emma smiled brightly. “Is it done? You’ve been so secretive.”The older man grinned like a kid with his first baseball bat. “It’s done.”She clapped in delight. “I can’t wait.”“How’s my son?” Nate asked.Emma’s heart sank. They danced this fox trot every time he picked her up. She couldn’t dissuade his innumerable questions nor quench his insatiable need to connect with his own flesh and blood. But, damn, if squaring off his son’s hatred and protecting Nate wasn’t becoming an angry cyclone.“He’s fine.”“And River Run, will he keep River Run?”“No Nate, he’s not going to keep the resort. Stone wants nothing more than to fix it up and sell. He’ll never stay.”Nate smiled sadly at her. “You don’t know what a Connor’s capable of. That place’ll crawl beneath his skin soon. You just wait and see.”“Okay, I’ll wait and see.” Emma knew arguing was futile. She glanced out the window. Osprey and bald eagles dotted the trees that grew from the steep ravines of the Snake River. The rapids were flowing, wild and turbulent, kicking up frothy white water with the vengeance of an angry ocean.“Did you review the latest Clover report?” Nate said.She pinched the bridge of her nose and nodded. “It doesn’t look good.”“Has Stone bothered to dig any deeper into the company?”“No,” she said. “I think I shocked him when I insisted Clover belonged to me, but we’ll see come the end of December when the investment check is due. He knows my history, Nate.”“Not surprised. I heard he’d been out to River’s Edge a week or so back. He ‘en Ethan were thicker ‘en thieves growin’ up. Figured Ethan would fill him in. We’re almost there,” Nate exclaimed, his attention diverted from Stone and onto what lay before them.The truck swung off the main road and headed down a dry, dirt path. It bounced and lurched over pot holes and rocks. Holding the dash for safety, Emma couldn’t help but smile at the boyish anticipation lighting Nate’s face. There’d be plenty of time to discuss Clover and Stone another time. The fact he didn’t seem worried about Stone’s knowledge was a comfort. She’d no desire to ruin this day.After what felt like an interminable roller coaster ride, the truck stopped before a small log cabin. Emma sighed. It was perfect. The home was situated next to one of the tributaries of the Snake River, and its wrap-around deck invited you to explore its width and visit awhile. The bubbles and gurgles of a quick flowing stream echoed through thickly pined woods.“It’s beautiful.” She walked across the wooden planks and admired the serenity of Nate’s paradise.“Thanks, Emmie. Want to see inside?”She grinned at the use of her childhood nickname and followed him into the cabin. The sparsely furnished rooms spoke loudly of Nate’s inability to lavish any luxury upon himself. After his wife’s death, Margaret explained to Emma that her son simply stopped believing in his worth. Instead, he poured whiskey down his throat and left his child to face life alone.Stone Connor muddled through years of feeling his father’s wrath and self-deprecation…then escaped. He’d joined the army and never looked back.Emma guessed the last bit. Being raised within the Connor household meant diverting conversation away from Nate’s son, away from past pain, and away from any topic too difficult to face. She’d become an expert at dodging tense dialogue, sparing feelings and healing wounds with soft words.Clover Enterprises lay somewhere between tense and healing. At times, many things were best left unsaid.“Let’s have a quick cup of coffee, Nate, and then you need to take me back to River Run. We’ve a group of guests arriving this afternoon.”“That’s fine, baby girl. Just sit right there and let me serve you for a change.”Nate’s okay, she mused. He’s doing just fine.She wished her own life felt as harmonious. *** “Where’ve you been?” Stone demanded, pacing the front porch intent on either polishing the wood with his shoes or digging a hole with his heels. She was late. The trip to Nate’s cabin consumed more time than expected.“Sorry.” Emma scooted past him and entered River Run.“Okay. I’m sorry I snapped. I need to talk to you about my plan. Guests are due in less than an hour.” He followed her into the kitchen not allowing any room for escape.“What’s the matter, Stone? Afraid you can’t handle a simple welcome-to-River-Run speech?”“No.” He handed her a pad of paper. “There’s been a change of plans.”She took the paper and frowned at his chicken scratch. “I can’t read this.”“It says they’ve added a guest, an important person and would like to make certain he receives appropriate accommodations.”“And?”“It’s Seamus Adams.”Emma froze. “What?”Stone held his hands up. “Don’t panic. Actually, I think this is a good opportunity to determine whether he’s a threat or simply here doing what he says he’s been doing. I didn’t discourage the request.”“There’s no way, Stone. It’s too dangerous.” Emma paced in a tight circle. “I’ll go. I’ll stay with Nate or out at River Edge. You can’t ask me to be in the same room with that man.”“It’s what I’m asking.”She exhaled a shaky sigh. “For a second there I thought we were on the same team.”Emma clearly noticed that Stone bit back a grin. “We are.” He gripped her shoulders gently, rubbing his thumb against the edge of her arm. “Trust me. I’ll protect you. This is a step toward your freedom. There’s just one other slight problem.”Her emotions were ricocheting in all directions and culminated in a shallow laugh. “What other problem could possibly trump this?”“The only available suite is mine.”Emma shrugged and headed into her small cluster of rooms to find some peace and perhaps a Teton sized chunk of bravery. “So? Move.”“Where to?”“You’re the boss, you figure it out.” Her indifference didn’t seem to be sitting well with Stone. When she turned to shut her door, she noted his face was flushed a deep crimson. Her eyes widened as she caught sight of his tightly clenched fist.“I believe then, that I’ll be joining you in your quarters.” He smirked and left her there, open-mouthed and in shock.He couldn’t stay with her. Could he?Emma slammed the door and took stock of her little world. Small office to the left, even smaller bedroom to the right, and tiny bathroom in the middle. Surely, he must be joking.She crossed the miniscule hall and entered her bedroom. Her full sized bed jammed tightly into the corner couldn’t accommodate Stone’s height not that she’d ever entertained any ideas about allowing him access.“I’m here.” Stone spoke softly over her shoulder, and Emma refused the urge to turn around and smack him. She’d tried assimilating his stealth into her daily routine, but he still managed to scare the lucky charms out of her.“You can’t stay, Stone.” She turned and blocked his entry into her bedroom. His shaggy mop had been groomed into a relatively tame cut, but there were still strands that insisted on falling over his brow.“Why not?”“This is my space.” She stared into his steel blue gaze refusing to back down. Stone dropped his duffel bag, eyed her bed thoughtfully and shrugged.“No choice, Emma. I’ll be staying here.” The gate bell rang in her office, and his attention quickly switched focus. He walked over to the security monitor and punched a code into the computer. “The closer we are, the safer you’ll be,” he called over his back. “Our guests have arrived. You’ll need to inform the add-on that his room isn’t quite ready. I’ve already snagged Lola, and she’s cleaning as we speak.”Emma stuck her tongue out and moved gracefully past him and out of the intimate arena. A frustrated sigh escaped, but she focused her attention on the task of welcoming this next slew of vacationers.“Wait for me,” Stone called quickly catching up and matching his pace to hers.She cast her eyes up at his face. Sudden anger suffused her entire body. “This is an evil plan.”His brows shot up in surprise. “Not of my making. But often forces align to show us a window of opportunity.”“I’m glad you find it easy to play with other people’s lives.”Stone flinched. “I don’t play.”“I’m sorry,” She shook her head, mad at herself. The nature of his nightmares testified to a dark story. She hadn’t meant to awaken the memory. Instead, Emma straightened her shoulders, attempted to harvest some courage from the man standing by her side and opened the front door.“Have you locked Porkahontas up? This crew’s never visited before, and I’d hate to face a lawsuit brought on by an overprotective pig.”Emma rolled her eyes at him. She hated his teasing of Pocahontas but knew he was lightening a tense moment. He grinned, a wicked light to his eyes. “Don’t laugh,” she said, opening the front door. “She’s gonna slime you but good one of these days if you keep insulting her.”“Yeah?” He quirked a brow and nudged her shoulder with his. “She loves me, and you know it.”Emma glared. She much preferred the brooding, injured son persona to this roguish rebel. Whenever he pulled a personality back flip, it made it difficult to hide her feelings. “The Leary’s have overbooked their itinerary even though I pointed out they’d never fit in both Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park in one day.”“Hmm, you’ll straighten it out.”“I always do.” The two of them emerged on the front porch at the same time the long, black limousine pulled up. She marveled at how easily they slipped into their roles. *** Stone smiled brightly at the invisible people behind the dark tinted glass of the limo. He knew he’d placed both Emma and himself in a precarious position by invading her rooms, but the presence of Seamus Adams demanded drastic action. Even though he’d professed Emma’s safety, Stone wasn’t convinced. His gut screamed Adams knew her identity. This was either a brilliant plan or one he’d regret for eternity.Four doors opened, spilling eight passengers onto the drive. They climbed over one another intent on absorbing the first view of River Run, talking and pointing and laughing in delight. Stone glanced at Emma. She smiled brilliantly at him, her eyes dancing and face glowing with pride, the twinge of fear only apparent to the most discernible eye. Stone saw it clearly along with a few other aspects that caused him pause.He knew she loved River Run, but his heart caught when he realized how much. Stone turned quickly away, not wanting to ponder his insight or deal with his reaction.A tall man, in well-pressed kahki pants and Rugby shirt exited last. He turned and faced the front door.Stone felt Emma tense. He grabbed her hand and pulled her down the steps, beside him. She backed up, he tugged forward and tossed her a warning glance. Panic and fear raged war against her professionalism and it sliced through his chest, almost decapitating his resolve.Engage the enemy.Offense is better than defense.Nothing he could say would help Emma. She must face the man gazing at them curiously. She must greet her mother’s killer.“I can’t go down there,” she said. Her voice strained to a bare whisper.“You can do this.” He demanded, hating every inch of his plan.She stared at him. Her body trembled from head to toe, but he remained impassive. Emma squared her shoulders, tilted her chin up, and turned to greet their guests. A surge of pride rushed through Stone. This was one tough lady.Reaching Seamus Adams and his entourage, Emma extended her hand and greeted everyone with the professionalism of a polished hostess.Seamus Adams clasped her hand firmly. The touch of the man who’d swam in her nightmares for the past fifteen years threatened to send her to her knees. She swallowed hard, blocking the image of the last time she’d seen his fingers.Bloody. Deadly.Stone walked up and stood behind her, his hand resting protectively upon her lower back. She glanced back, startled by the intimate contact, but he didn’t release her.“Welcome to River Run, Mr. and Mrs. Adams. I’m pleased you were able to join the Leary party. It might be a few moments before your accommodations are prepared, so please won’t you accept a light lunch in the kitchen?”“Aaah, Mr. Connor, I presume. I appreciate your quick acknowledgement to our request for a room. I’m house hunting in the area and when John and Linda invited me and the missus to join them, it was an opportunity I didn’t dare pass.”Stone didn’t miss the covert glances Seamus kept directing at Emma. He focused inward, ignoring the chaotic swell of emotion, and centered himself in a void of nothingness. Because from emptiness came the ability to see the enemy, know the enemy, become the enemy.Stone leaned forward and grasped the outstretched hand of the man currently headlining his soon-to-be-dead list. *** Emma hustled in the babbling crowd of tourists. She remained distantly professional to everyone, answering questions, and directing them to their rooms. The Adams’ stayed with Stone while their suite was being prepared.She felt raw, exposed and vulnerable.The moment Adams’ pale blue eyes met her face, she’d known the future. The man’s thick Irish brogue sparked memories. He’d not spoken to her as if he knew. But no words were necessary…his presence made his point.Her identity was no longer a secret.Inhaling and straightening her shoulders, she walked into the kitchen. The familiar scent of fresh brewed coffee and home baked bread steadied her. Convincing herself the Adams’ were nothing more than another couple looking for an exciting vacation, she plastered a smile on her face. “What can I get for you folks?”Stone glanced over and nodded.“Emma, would you mind checking on the itinerary for tomorrow and confirming the times are all correct?”She opened her mouth to inform Mr. Resort-know-it-all that she’d completed that task three days ago but quickly realized this would be a perfect opportunity to escape and avoid any further contact with Seamus Adams. Stone’s plan.“Of course, Mr. Connor. I’ll do it right away.” She suppressed the urge to curtsy and make a face at Stone and quickly exited the kitchen.By the time she reached the office, her hands were shaking uncontrollably. She dropped into the worn leather chair and inhaled sharply. Stone arrived before she’d been provided an opportunity to collect herself.“You okay?”“Yes,” she nodded. “No,” she recanted.Stone kneeled in front of her chair and rubbed her arms. She sighed and tried to allow the comfort he offered to seep in. He stared into her eyes. “You did great.”Emma bit back a whimper as Stone stood and sat on the edge of the desk. His touch helped, but she wasn’t about to ask him to hold her.“I did some further cross checking and you’d be amazed at the horrible antics Seamus Adams has been participating in. It simply stuns me this man’s succeeded in politics. Then again, I’m also a sucker for good guys winning. It appears Seamus’ perfected the role of the devil-in-disguise.”“I’m not surprised. Do you have a plan?”He shook his head. “It’s in the works. But, I’ll tell you one thing, no one takes what’s mine. Too many lives have been lost that way.”Stone turned and left the office. His words were confusing, his actions mystifying.She didn’t know what to think, but despite all the fear and insecurities twining themselves around her heart, it skipped a little beat, leaping up toward a sunbeam of hope.No one takes what’s mine. *** Stone shut the door that separated the main part of River Run with Emma’s private quarters. The grandfather clock peeled twelve times, stroking in the witching hour. He’d finished his nightly security check, verifying all guests were accounted for and no strangers lurked within the gates of River Run.Peering into the bedroom, he confirmed Emma slept.She lay sprawled upon the top of her covers, still dressed in jeans and River Run shirt. A notepad lay open next to her outstretched arm. Somewhere in the back of his mind he wondered what she’d been doing, but the silky river of red hair caught his breath and held him captive.If ever a fairy were to grace reality, she’d be Emma’s twin. Long lashes rested against her cheek, making Stone’s fingers itch. He longed to hold her, feel her heart beat wildly against his. But no matter what his inflamed senses demanded, he couldn’t relinquish control.He’d not shirk his responsibilities, though. If it took his last gasp of air, he’d see Seamus Adams dead.Stone stepped back from the bedroom and entered the office. Walking around the desk, he sat in the worn leather chair. Emma’s jasmine perfume wafted from the shadows. He closed his eyes and brought forth the memory of that night in his room. The tender kiss and burning desire quickly faded beneath his more memorable vile display of bitterness.Stone picked up the phone and dialed a number he’d sworn never to use again.",

      "content": "Chapter Six I thought you were someone else, Stone’s voice taunted. After all these weeks, you’d think she’d find a way to fix this scratch in her memory. Stone’s verbalization about his tryst with Tilly grated her mind like nails on a chalkboard.Emma made her way down the winding, gravel drive. Fall snapped its fingers last week and painted the horizon with vibrant orange and red. Two months, she mused. She’d survived two months within the same household as Stone Connor.She wondered whether Stone’s four seasons meant the entire season or if he’d be free of the ranch by springtime. If so, they’d waltzed right into Season Two, and she figured she’d almost crossed the halfway point.Over the past weeks, River Run symbolized a trophy neither Stone nor herself were willing to relinquish. They’d drawn lines, schemed and then arrived at the same conclusion. Working together appeared to be the only solution. Stone stepped into his authoritative duties, protecting his legacy with the iron hand of a military general. Emma catered to the guests, reinforced River Run’s five-star rating, and prayed nightly her boss didn’t turn his razor sharp intuitiveness in her direction.Inhaling the brisk autumn air, she stretched her arms to the late morning sun. Last night, the temperature dropped into the low forties, and the first fire of the season crackled and burned in River Run’s hearth. She could smell the burnt oak each time a soft breeze blew from behind. The sun promised to warm the day, holding at bay the icy wind that blew from the top of the Grand Tetons. It’d be another few weeks before first snowfall.Emma finally reached the main gate. Where was Nate?The crunch of gravel to her back made her sigh with a bit of dread. She turned and waved as Stone Connor pulled his Jeep to the gate. “Hop in,” he barked.“I’m meeting someone.”Emma watched a myriad of emotions cross Stone’s eyes, but he bit back any reference to his father. “Can you call and reschedule. We need to talk.”Panic bubbled in her gut. “Can it wait?”Stone sighed and rolled his eyes. “I haven’t pried into your business with him once over the past few weeks. I’m politely requesting that you reschedule today because we have important things to talk about.” Stone paused. He snagged his ball cap off his head and ran his fingers through the mop of black hair matted to his forehead. “I know who you are, Emilie.”Emma froze. Air drained from her lungs and she slipped to the ground, hugging her knees to her chest. “Who else?” Her voice sounded tinny as she fought against the ring of fear. “Who else have you told?”“What?” Stone jumped out of the Jeep. “No one. I wouldn’t tell anyone and endanger you.”Emma shook her head. “I don’t understand.”“I don’t care who the hell you are, Emma O’Malley – Emilie Gallagher. Doesn’t make a difference. What I do care about is the fact that my grandmother expected me to keep you safe. I can do that…if you let me.” He helped her back to her feet. “If you trust me.”Emma gazed into his eyes. There were no clouds. No dishonesty. “Why?”He shrugged. “Because it’s how I’m made.” He offered her a genuine smile. “They don’t let just anyone into the Rangers, you know.”She grinned and tilted her head. “I know.”Nate Connor’s battered truck pulled up to the gate. Emma waved at him to stay in the vehicle and then offered her full attention back to Stone. “Can this wait just an hour? I promise I’ll be back by two.”The ease exited Stone’s stance, and she hated the fact she’d caused that. “Fine. We’ll talk at two.”Before rational thinking took hold, Emma stood on her tiptoes and kissed Stone’s cheek. He stepped back, but she rested the palm of her hand where her lips had been. “Thank you, Stone.”She backed away, but the flare of emotion flickering in the depths of Stone’s eyes hadn’t gone unnoticed. Emma quickly unlocked and slipped through the side pedestrian gate. Waving at Nate, she jogged to the vehicle, opened the passenger side, and hopped in.“Mornin’, baby girl.” Nate grinned and winked. He put the truck in gear and drove away. “You okay?” He nodded toward the Jeep that headed back up the drive to River Run.“Fine.”They’d managed this weekly rendezvous, and to Emma’s delight it seemed enough for Nate.A few weeks of hyperventilating each time Nate’s truck pulled onto the main road had dimmed to a tiny pinprick of fear. Fifteen years Emma stayed hidden behind the walls of River Run, rarely venturing into town. Now, spending one day a week riding beside Nate, the world waved a carrot under her nose.They’d hiked and explored the wilderness of the national parks that made their corner of the world famous. Nate’s constant state of nervousness dimmed the golden trips to a dull silver, but Emma ignored his concerns, insisting they continue these weekly visits.Leaning over, she planted a kiss on Nate’s cheek. “Where’re we heading today?”“I thought, if you didn’t have to be back for a few hours, you might like to see the cabin.”“Really?” Emma smiled brightly. “Is it done? You’ve been so secretive.”The older man grinned like a kid with his first baseball bat. “It’s done.”She clapped in delight. “I can’t wait.”“How’s my son?” Nate asked.Emma’s heart sank. They danced this fox trot every time he picked her up. She couldn’t dissuade his innumerable questions nor quench his insatiable need to connect with his own flesh and blood. But, damn, if squaring off his son’s hatred and protecting Nate wasn’t becoming an angry cyclone.“He’s fine.”“And River Run, will he keep River Run?”“No Nate, he’s not going to keep the resort. Stone wants nothing more than to fix it up and sell. He’ll never stay.”Nate smiled sadly at her. “You don’t know what a Connor’s capable of. That place’ll crawl beneath his skin soon. You just wait and see.”“Okay, I’ll wait and see.” Emma knew arguing was futile. She glanced out the window. Osprey and bald eagles dotted the trees that grew from the steep ravines of the Snake River. The rapids were flowing, wild and turbulent, kicking up frothy white water with the vengeance of an angry ocean.“Did you review the latest Clover report?” Nate said.She pinched the bridge of her nose and nodded. “It doesn’t look good.”“Has Stone bothered to dig any deeper into the company?”“No,” she said. “I think I shocked him when I insisted Clover belonged to me, but we’ll see come the end of December when the investment check is due. He knows my history, Nate.”“Not surprised. I heard he’d been out to River’s Edge a week or so back. He ‘en Ethan were thicker ‘en thieves growin’ up. Figured Ethan would fill him in. We’re almost there,” Nate exclaimed, his attention diverted from Stone and onto what lay before them.The truck swung off the main road and headed down a dry, dirt path. It bounced and lurched over pot holes and rocks. Holding the dash for safety, Emma couldn’t help but smile at the boyish anticipation lighting Nate’s face. There’d be plenty of time to discuss Clover and Stone another time. The fact he didn’t seem worried about Stone’s knowledge was a comfort. She’d no desire to ruin this day.After what felt like an interminable roller coaster ride, the truck stopped before a small log cabin. Emma sighed. It was perfect. The home was situated next to one of the tributaries of the Snake River, and its wrap-around deck invited you to explore its width and visit awhile. The bubbles and gurgles of a quick flowing stream echoed through thickly pined woods.“It’s beautiful.” She walked across the wooden planks and admired the serenity of Nate’s paradise.“Thanks, Emmie. Want to see inside?”She grinned at the use of her childhood nickname and followed him into the cabin. The sparsely furnished rooms spoke loudly of Nate’s inability to lavish any luxury upon himself. After his wife’s death, Margaret explained to Emma that her son simply stopped believing in his worth. Instead, he poured whiskey down his throat and left his child to face life alone.Stone Connor muddled through years of feeling his father’s wrath and self-deprecation…then escaped. He’d joined the army and never looked back.Emma guessed the last bit. Being raised within the Connor household meant diverting conversation away from Nate’s son, away from past pain, and away from any topic too difficult to face. She’d become an expert at dodging tense dialogue, sparing feelings and healing wounds with soft words.Clover Enterprises lay somewhere between tense and healing. At times, many things were best left unsaid.“Let’s have a quick cup of coffee, Nate, and then you need to take me back to River Run. We’ve a group of guests arriving this afternoon.”“That’s fine, baby girl. Just sit right there and let me serve you for a change.”Nate’s okay, she mused. He’s doing just fine.She wished her own life felt as harmonious. *** “Where’ve you been?” Stone demanded, pacing the front porch intent on either polishing the wood with his shoes or digging a hole with his heels. She was late. The trip to Nate’s cabin consumed more time than expected.“Sorry.” Emma scooted past him and entered River Run.“Okay. I’m sorry I snapped. I need to talk to you about my plan. Guests are due in less than an hour.” He followed her into the kitchen not allowing any room for escape.“What’s the matter, Stone? Afraid you can’t handle a simple welcome-to-River-Run speech?”“No.” He handed her a pad of paper. “There’s been a change of plans.”She took the paper and frowned at his chicken scratch. “I can’t read this.”“It says they’ve added a guest, an important person and would like to make certain he receives appropriate accommodations.”“And?”“It’s Seamus Adams.”Emma froze. “What?”Stone held his hands up. “Don’t panic. Actually, I think this is a good opportunity to determine whether he’s a threat or simply here doing what he says he’s been doing. I didn’t discourage the request.”“There’s no way, Stone. It’s too dangerous.” Emma paced in a tight circle. “I’ll go. I’ll stay with Nate or out at River Edge. You can’t ask me to be in the same room with that man.”“It’s what I’m asking.”She exhaled a shaky sigh. “For a second there I thought we were on the same team.”Emma clearly noticed that Stone bit back a grin. “We are.” He gripped her shoulders gently, rubbing his thumb against the edge of her arm. “Trust me. I’ll protect you. This is a step toward your freedom. There’s just one other slight problem.”Her emotions were ricocheting in all directions and culminated in a shallow laugh. “What other problem could possibly trump this?”“The only available suite is mine.”Emma shrugged and headed into her small cluster of rooms to find some peace and perhaps a Teton sized chunk of bravery. “So? Move.”“Where to?”“You’re the boss, you figure it out.” Her indifference didn’t seem to be sitting well with Stone. When she turned to shut her door, she noted his face was flushed a deep crimson. Her eyes widened as she caught sight of his tightly clenched fist.“I believe then, that I’ll be joining you in your quarters.” He smirked and left her there, open-mouthed and in shock.He couldn’t stay with her. Could he?Emma slammed the door and took stock of her little world. Small office to the left, even smaller bedroom to the right, and tiny bathroom in the middle. Surely, he must be joking.She crossed the miniscule hall and entered her bedroom. Her full sized bed jammed tightly into the corner couldn’t accommodate Stone’s height not that she’d ever entertained any ideas about allowing him access.“I’m here.” Stone spoke softly over her shoulder, and Emma refused the urge to turn around and smack him. She’d tried assimilating his stealth into her daily routine, but he still managed to scare the lucky charms out of her.“You can’t stay, Stone.” She turned and blocked his entry into her bedroom. His shaggy mop had been groomed into a relatively tame cut, but there were still strands that insisted on falling over his brow.“Why not?”“This is my space.” She stared into his steel blue gaze refusing to back down. Stone dropped his duffel bag, eyed her bed thoughtfully and shrugged.“No choice, Emma. I’ll be staying here.” The gate bell rang in her office, and his attention quickly switched focus. He walked over to the security monitor and punched a code into the computer. “The closer we are, the safer you’ll be,” he called over his back. “Our guests have arrived. You’ll need to inform the add-on that his room isn’t quite ready. I’ve already snagged Lola, and she’s cleaning as we speak.”Emma stuck her tongue out and moved gracefully past him and out of the intimate arena. A frustrated sigh escaped, but she focused her attention on the task of welcoming this next slew of vacationers.“Wait for me,” Stone called quickly catching up and matching his pace to hers.She cast her eyes up at his face. Sudden anger suffused her entire body. “This is an evil plan.”His brows shot up in surprise. “Not of my making. But often forces align to show us a window of opportunity.”“I’m glad you find it easy to play with other people’s lives.”Stone flinched. “I don’t play.”“I’m sorry,” She shook her head, mad at herself. The nature of his nightmares testified to a dark story. She hadn’t meant to awaken the memory. Instead, Emma straightened her shoulders, attempted to harvest some courage from the man standing by her side and opened the front door.“Have you locked Porkahontas up? This crew’s never visited before, and I’d hate to face a lawsuit brought on by an overprotective pig.”Emma rolled her eyes at him. She hated his teasing of Pocahontas but knew he was lightening a tense moment. He grinned, a wicked light to his eyes. “Don’t laugh,” she said, opening the front door. “She’s gonna slime you but good one of these days if you keep insulting her.”“Yeah?” He quirked a brow and nudged her shoulder with his. “She loves me, and you know it.”Emma glared. She much preferred the brooding, injured son persona to this roguish rebel. Whenever he pulled a personality back flip, it made it difficult to hide her feelings. “The Leary’s have overbooked their itinerary even though I pointed out they’d never fit in both Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park in one day.”“Hmm, you’ll straighten it out.”“I always do.” The two of them emerged on the front porch at the same time the long, black limousine pulled up. She marveled at how easily they slipped into their roles. *** Stone smiled brightly at the invisible people behind the dark tinted glass of the limo. He knew he’d placed both Emma and himself in a precarious position by invading her rooms, but the presence of Seamus Adams demanded drastic action. Even though he’d professed Emma’s safety, Stone wasn’t convinced. His gut screamed Adams knew her identity. This was either a brilliant plan or one he’d regret for eternity.Four doors opened, spilling eight passengers onto the drive. They climbed over one another intent on absorbing the first view of River Run, talking and pointing and laughing in delight. Stone glanced at Emma. She smiled brilliantly at him, her eyes dancing and face glowing with pride, the twinge of fear only apparent to the most discernible eye. Stone saw it clearly along with a few other aspects that caused him pause.He knew she loved River Run, but his heart caught when he realized how much. Stone turned quickly away, not wanting to ponder his insight or deal with his reaction.A tall man, in well-pressed kahki pants and Rugby shirt exited last. He turned and faced the front door.Stone felt Emma tense. He grabbed her hand and pulled her down the steps, beside him. She backed up, he tugged forward and tossed her a warning glance. Panic and fear raged war against her professionalism and it sliced through his chest, almost decapitating his resolve.Engage the enemy.Offense is better than defense.Nothing he could say would help Emma. She must face the man gazing at them curiously. She must greet her mother’s killer.“I can’t go down there,” she said. Her voice strained to a bare whisper.“You can do this.” He demanded, hating every inch of his plan.She stared at him. Her body trembled from head to toe, but he remained impassive. Emma squared her shoulders, tilted her chin up, and turned to greet their guests. A surge of pride rushed through Stone. This was one tough lady.Reaching Seamus Adams and his entourage, Emma extended her hand and greeted everyone with the professionalism of a polished hostess.Seamus Adams clasped her hand firmly. The touch of the man who’d swam in her nightmares for the past fifteen years threatened to send her to her knees. She swallowed hard, blocking the image of the last time she’d seen his fingers.Bloody. Deadly.Stone walked up and stood behind her, his hand resting protectively upon her lower back. She glanced back, startled by the intimate contact, but he didn’t release her.“Welcome to River Run, Mr. and Mrs. Adams. I’m pleased you were able to join the Leary party. It might be a few moments before your accommodations are prepared, so please won’t you accept a light lunch in the kitchen?”“Aaah, Mr. Connor, I presume. I appreciate your quick acknowledgement to our request for a room. I’m house hunting in the area and when John and Linda invited me and the missus to join them, it was an opportunity I didn’t dare pass.”Stone didn’t miss the covert glances Seamus kept directing at Emma. He focused inward, ignoring the chaotic swell of emotion, and centered himself in a void of nothingness. Because from emptiness came the ability to see the enemy, know the enemy, become the enemy.Stone leaned forward and grasped the outstretched hand of the man currently headlining his soon-to-be-dead list. *** Emma hustled in the babbling crowd of tourists. She remained distantly professional to everyone, answering questions, and directing them to their rooms. The Adams’ stayed with Stone while their suite was being prepared.She felt raw, exposed and vulnerable.The moment Adams’ pale blue eyes met her face, she’d known the future. The man’s thick Irish brogue sparked memories. He’d not spoken to her as if he knew. But no words were necessary…his presence made his point.Her identity was no longer a secret.Inhaling and straightening her shoulders, she walked into the kitchen. The familiar scent of fresh brewed coffee and home baked bread steadied her. Convincing herself the Adams’ were nothing more than another couple looking for an exciting vacation, she plastered a smile on her face. “What can I get for you folks?”Stone glanced over and nodded.“Emma, would you mind checking on the itinerary for tomorrow and confirming the times are all correct?”She opened her mouth to inform Mr. Resort-know-it-all that she’d completed that task three days ago but quickly realized this would be a perfect opportunity to escape and avoid any further contact with Seamus Adams. Stone’s plan.“Of course, Mr. Connor. I’ll do it right away.” She suppressed the urge to curtsy and make a face at Stone and quickly exited the kitchen.By the time she reached the office, her hands were shaking uncontrollably. She dropped into the worn leather chair and inhaled sharply. Stone arrived before she’d been provided an opportunity to collect herself.“You okay?”“Yes,” she nodded. “No,” she recanted.Stone kneeled in front of her chair and rubbed her arms. She sighed and tried to allow the comfort he offered to seep in. He stared into her eyes. “You did great.”Emma bit back a whimper as Stone stood and sat on the edge of the desk. His touch helped, but she wasn’t about to ask him to hold her.“I did some further cross checking and you’d be amazed at the horrible antics Seamus Adams has been participating in. It simply stuns me this man’s succeeded in politics. Then again, I’m also a sucker for good guys winning. It appears Seamus’ perfected the role of the devil-in-disguise.”“I’m not surprised. Do you have a plan?”He shook his head. “It’s in the works. But, I’ll tell you one thing, no one takes what’s mine. Too many lives have been lost that way.”Stone turned and left the office. His words were confusing, his actions mystifying.She didn’t know what to think, but despite all the fear and insecurities twining themselves around her heart, it skipped a little beat, leaping up toward a sunbeam of hope.No one takes what’s mine. *** Stone shut the door that separated the main part of River Run with Emma’s private quarters. The grandfather clock peeled twelve times, stroking in the witching hour. He’d finished his nightly security check, verifying all guests were accounted for and no strangers lurked within the gates of River Run.Peering into the bedroom, he confirmed Emma slept.She lay sprawled upon the top of her covers, still dressed in jeans and River Run shirt. A notepad lay open next to her outstretched arm. Somewhere in the back of his mind he wondered what she’d been doing, but the silky river of red hair caught his breath and held him captive.If ever a fairy were to grace reality, she’d be Emma’s twin. Long lashes rested against her cheek, making Stone’s fingers itch. He longed to hold her, feel her heart beat wildly against his. But no matter what his inflamed senses demanded, he couldn’t relinquish control.He’d not shirk his responsibilities, though. If it took his last gasp of air, he’d see Seamus Adams dead.Stone stepped back from the bedroom and entered the office. Walking around the desk, he sat in the worn leather chair. Emma’s jasmine perfume wafted from the shadows. He closed his eyes and brought forth the memory of that night in his room. The tender kiss and burning desire quickly faded beneath his more memorable vile display of bitterness.Stone picked up the phone and dialed a number he’d sworn never to use again.",

      "content": "Chapter Seven Guns? Her mind couldn’t comprehend what she saw.Emma stared at the array of weapons neatly arranged within the center of her bedroom, the dark gray and black metal a stark contrast against her cream flokati rug and cucumber walls.“What’re you doing?”“Preparing,” Stone said. He sat crossed legged next to the weapons. The ammunition lay on her bed as he cleaned and dissected the gun in his hand, his movements deft and precise. The clicking and snapping echoed ominously within the tight space.“For what? An invasion of prairie dogs?”Stone laid his current weapon aside and looked at her. He shook his head slowly, picked up a small handgun and held it out for her to take. “No. An invasion of leprechauns.”“You can’t be serious? Seamus Adams isn’t going to risk his political career and kill me smack in the middle of my own home.” She ignored the proffered weapon and walked to her bed. Pushing the boxes of bullets out of her way, she sat and studied the man before her. “I’m not even certain he knows who I am.”“He knows.” His focused expression punctuated the threat. “I’ve done some checking into Mr. Adams, and he doesn’t ever do anything without an ulterior motive. In case he chooses the stupid path, I want to be prepared.”“Stone,” she said, trying to absorb everything. “This is crazy. He’s been here for almost a week and hasn’t made any move against me. If anything, the Adams seem more concerned with sightseeing and house hunting than the goings on of River Run.”“You hate him here.” Turning back to the weapons, he checked the next chamber.“It doesn’t mean I want to stoop to his level and kill him. What good would that do?”Stone glanced up and tossed her an incredulous look. “Set you free.”Emma didn’t know what to say. His eyes deepened in color, and she glimpsed an emotion he desperately tried to hide. She dropped to her knees and knelt beside him. Lifting her hand, Emma touched his shoulder. “Not this way. I don’t want to be set free this way.”He stilled beneath her caress but didn’t push away. “Don’t you want revenge?”“No.”She stared into the depths of his eyes, a warmth replacing his normally impenetrable wall. He reached up and pushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his fingers grazing her skin. Holding her breath, Emma resisted the urge to lean closer. He’d never touched her like this before, with tenderness washing away the steel.Last night surrounded by his presence, suffocated by his masculinity made walking on hot coals a preferable option. She hadn’t crawled beneath her covers in four nights afraid the intimacy would be too much to resist. Stone never said a word. They’d rested side by side, fully clothed, never touching.She was exhausted both physically and emotionally. Breaking contact, Emma sat down and crossed her legs. Stone appeared relieved.“Revenge,” Emma said, “is not the answer.”“Then what do you suggest?”“I suggest we get our acts together and serve dinner. Tilly’s almost done in the kitchen and the hour’s getting late.”“How can you forget what that man’s done to your family?” Stone demanded, rising to his feet. He reached down and yanked her up. She glared into his face.“How dare you? I haven’t forgotten. But I’ve accepted those memories, placed them where they need to be. Otherwise, the only thing I’d ever remember would be the blood running down my mother’s throat. I’d never be able to think of her without thinking of death. And that’s not acceptable. She gave me a love of life I’m forever grateful for. Her smile and selflessness are things I need to remember, have to remember. Otherwise, what good was it all? I loved my mother and my father.” Emma felt tears prick her eyes and swallowed past the lump in her throat. “But I won’t live in their death.”“Why? It’s not so bad.” Stone responded, his voice flat and unemotional.“You don’t get it, do you? I watch you fight to forget. I feel you toss and turn and attempt to block out whatever nightmares your mind has conjured. But it’s useless. Until you accept your memories, both good and bad, despair will win every time. You can’t make your past go away. So deal with it.”Stone didn’t move. “All this psychobabble isn’t going to change me, so you might as well stay away.”Emma widened her eyes in shock then stepped forward smacking her hand against his chest. “Don’t you dare run. I’m sick and tired of your unemotional, vacant stares. Your refusal to step into the world and participate.”“Participate? You’re a fine one to toss in accusations about participating. In case you haven’t noticed, Ms. O’Malley, there’s an entire life beyond the gates of River Run.”Her breath caught, and she tried not to let his words affect her. “You know why I stay close to home.”“Yeah, I know. Hiding is a great excuse for not living.”“Screw you! My life is this resort, and I live it with a greater passion than most people.” Emma stepped back, putting distance between herself and Stone. The truth of what he said stung.“Passion?” Stone responded, averting his face and rubbing a hand across his eyes. He was tired. She didn’t care.“What’s that supposed to mean?”He glanced back and pierced her with a steely gaze. “Emma, your main concern is to take care of everyone else. Being so focused on righting other people’s wrongs, how could you possibly know desire?”Her heart pounded. She couldn’t believe his attack and how very wrong his judgments were. Granted, Emma’s natural caretaking habits might appear to drown out her own dreams, but they didn’t. Did they? “ You’re a fine one to talk. We’ve been trapped here for months and this is the first time you’ve ever touched me.”“Isn’t that what you want? This indifferent relationship that remains professional at all times. Or would it be better if I yelled at you and told you how you twist my stomach into knots every time you look at me? No,” Stone shook his head. “I don’t think so. You wear your crown of indifference too well.”“I…” Emma didn’t know how to respond. How’d they get so far off topic? “Killing Seamus Adams is wrong. I’m not a killer.”“But I am.”“No.” She said softly. “You’re not a killer.”He smiled bitterly and headed for the door. “Oh, but you’re wrong, Ms. O’Malley, that’s exactly who I am.” Stone stopped before leaving and turned to look at her. “Can you care for a man buried in blood?”“No…” Before she could finish her sentence, he’d left. “But I think I can love you,” she whispered to the empty room. *** Damn, that woman drove him crazy. He swore again as he speared another mountain of dung. It hadn’t taken him long to discover the advantages of mucking stalls and cleaning the barn. No wonder Emma spent half her day out here. The animals never talked back. They listened in rapt attention and every once in a while bestowed you with unconditional love and affection.“Porkey, your mistress has gone too far this time. She needs to mind her own business.”The pig grunted and continued rooting around the stall.“Can you believe I almost spilled my guts? Told her how I feel? What’s the matter with me?” His stomach churned. She’d seen right through him, right into his core, and he hadn’t liked it one bit.Another stack of manure tossed into the wheelbarrow. At this rate, he’d be done with barn duties half an hour ahead of schedule. Stopping, Stone braced himself against the pitchfork. He looked at the pig. She’d halted her nosing about and actually sat gazing at him in interest.“What?”Porky snorted, green slime covering her snout.“That’s just plain disgusting.” Stone stepped forward and wiped his sleeve against the offending gunk. “You’re much prettier without that stuff.”He swore she smiled. Shaking his head, he tossed the pitch fork on top of the wheelbarrow and exited the stall. All there was left to do was add more hay, fill the grain buckets and bring the horses in for the night. Not enough chores to avoid Emma for the rest of the evening.He didn’t want to face her. For the first time in over two years, Stone felt an inner pulse, felt a desire to breathe. She’d woken him from his self-imposed exodus. But for what purpose? Even if there could be a slight chance of her caring, he couldn’t look beyond her affection for his father.It’d never work.No. He’d stick to his game plan. Eliminate Seamus Adams, sell River Run, and get the hell outta Dodge.Away from his father, away from Emma, away from the lure of life.Dumping the contents of the wheelbarrow out back in the compost pile, Stone tried hard not to chuckle at the antics of Rhett and Scarlett. The pygmy goats were the silliest excuse for an animal he’d ever seen. Entertaining, but silly. He leaned against the paddock fence and whistled for the three retired Cutter horses Emma adopted.This place resembled a zoo rather than a resort. He led the first horse into the barn and froze as a shadow stretched from the opposite end.“Interesting choice of duties, Mr. Connor.” Stone immediately recognized the gravely voice.“Mr. Adams, can I help you?” He pushed the horse between himself and the Irishman, swearing silently at his lack of weapons.Opening the stall door, Stone released the Cutter. He turned and faced Seamus Adams. The man stood about five inches shorter than Stone and carried the paunch of a well-fed, pub-hopping father of three. Physically, he wasn’t a threat.“You don’t like me much, do you?”“I’m afraid I don’t really know you, Mr. Adams. However, if you feel we’ve been less than hospitable, I’ll speak with the staff.”Seamus waved his hand and shook his head. “I thought I might take the opportunity to explain that although I’m a politician, I’m an honest man.”“Your political views are no concern of mine.” Stone eyed Pocahontas. She crept from the back of the barn, her teeth barred, and a low growl rumbling in her massive chest. “However, it appears my pig’s got a different opinion. If you’ll excuse me while I put her away for the night.” He shuffled the round body down the barn and into her pen, placating her with soft words. Emma would skin him alive if anything happened to her best friend.“Dangerous animal,” Adams said, stepping back out of the barn.“No. But she’ll bite if you threaten her.” Stone followed the man outside and they walked together back to the house.“I’m not here to threaten,” Seamus said.“Well that’s a relief,” Stone said, not bothering to hide his sarcasm. “Because I tend to bite as well.”“I’ll keep that in mind.”The two men entered River Run. Stone nodded to Seamus, then proceeded into Emma’s rooms. The aroma of baked onions steeped in sherry indicated dinner was almost ready and hosting duties required.He stepped into the bedroom. The urge to kick himself slammed into his gut, and he swore savagely. He’d left the guns laying everywhere. How could one woman rattle him enough to forget his responsibilities?He noted that Emma had pushed the weapons aside and covered everything with a blanket. He swore again, grabbing his clothes from the inch of closet space he’d been allowed.The bathroom light glowed beneath the door, and he leaned against the hall wall, waiting for Emma to finish. Thoughts of steamy air caressing her skin and streams of hot water flowing into places he longed to touch didn’t help in calming his temper.She opened the door. His chest constricted, and he flinched at a longing impossible to deny. *** Emma stepped into the hall, eyeing Stone warily. He looked furious.“I didn’t use all the hot water,” she said.“Thank you.” He wasn’t moving. She pulled the towel tighter around her body and scolded herself for not bringing a robe. A warm tingling spread slowly across her skin, and Emma knew it wasn’t an after effect of the scalding shower. Anger over the mess of guns and his disputatious attitude spurred her into leaving her room half-dressed.“You’re welcome.” Scooting past him, Emma dove for the safety of her bedroom.“Emma?”She stopped, turning to face the keeper of her heart.“Yes?”“I didn’t mean what I said.” He fumbled with the wad of clothes clutched in his arms. “I don’t want you to stay away.”Swallowing the lump in her throat, she nodded. Wincing, Emma wondered if he could hear her heart pounding. “I’m not indifferent.”He didn’t say a word, but his eyes deepened and a slight smile touched his lips. After what felt like an eternity but probably only encompassed a few seconds, Stone stepped into the bathroom. Bathed in the yellow glow of the small fluorescent bulb, he cast one more soul searing gaze in her direction. “I’m not running.”The bathroom door shut, and she heard water spill from the showerhead and closed her eyes against the erotic images torturing her mind.What would it be like to have a man like Stone love you?A round of roaring expletives hit her ears.“Stone? Is everything okay?”“No, dammit,” he yelled. “The water’s ice cold.”She tried not to laugh, but failed. With shaking shoulders, Emma entered her bedroom and proceeded to transform herself from an emotional avalanche into an animated hostess. *** Stone emerged into the main part of the house refreshed from the chilly shower and unusually lighthearted. He felt like smiling which only made him scowl.Candles lit the resort in a soft, yellow glow. The fireplace sparked, crackled and sizzled in bright colors, thanks to a bag of colored pine cones he’d grabbed from the hardware store this morning. Emma stared at the bright blue and green fireworks, mesmerized by their magic.He paused in the doorway. The blaze from the fireplace highlighted her hair, creating a halo of burnt amber. She’d dressed for the occasion. An off-the-shoulder, cream sweater topped a tawny suede skirt that accentuated the curve of her hips. His mouth watered. If he closed his eyes, maybe the room full of people would disappear and allow him a moment to savor her, taste her, claim her.Stone knew he didn’t deserve her. Love and laughter weren’t his future. Maybe tonight he could pretend? Masquerade as a whole man, a worthy man. Swearing softly, he realized a mask didn’t exist thick enough to cover his black soul.“Stone?” Her voice stretched across the distance of the large living room, caressing his ear and shooting straight to the depths of his yearning.He forced himself forward. Standing close enough to inhale her jasmine perfume but not touching. “What’s up?”“Nothing. You seem kind of far way. Is everything okay?”He couldn’t look away from the depths of her emerald eyes. Little jewels in a satin case.She smiled tentatively, a flash of hope, desire maybe, deepening the richness of her sparkling green gems. He wasn’t sure, but in self-preservation, Stone efficiently doused the twinkle.“I’m going to talk with Seamus Adams. I’ll check in with you later.” Ignoring the hurt expression that crossed her face, he headed over to the billiards table. Become the enemy. Stone clapped Seamus on the back and accepted the offered pool stick. “Let’s play,” he said. *** Emma sipped her wine. She refused to look at the other end of the long dining table. Stone and Seamus Adams remained in deep conversation, their voices carrying the length of the room. She smiled politely at Linda Leary.Tilly finished clearing the last of the dinner dishes and began presenting dessert. The tiramisu didn’t tempt her taste buds like it normally did but instead caused her dinner to churn bitterly.“So tomorrow is hiking Jenny Lake, right?” Linda said.“Yes. I think you’ll love it. Make sure you stop in town tomorrow night and collect your picture from today’s rafting trip. It’s definitely worth framing.” The polite words burned her mouth. What she wanted to do was stand in the middle of the table and scream at Stone. How dare he?She froze suddenly. Tilting her head, she confirmed her fear. Seamus Adams had just mentioned Clover Enterprises.“Emma?” the Irishman called.“Yes, sir?”“I was just asking Stone here if he’d ever heard of a local company called Clover Enterprises.”She glanced at Stone. His face remained impassive, but she could see the blood behind his steel blue eyes. “No sir, can’t say that I’m familiar with that business, but that’s not unusual. I tend to stick pretty close to home.”“I see. It appears they’re investing quite a bit of funds in my opponent’s political campaign. I was hoping to meet with them and offer a more viable solution to their investment.”“Seamus,” Stone interrupted. “I’m certain I can inquire around and see if we can’t find someone to talk to.”Emma wanted to faint. This little scenario crossed beyond her wildest nightmares. Seamus Adams knew about Clover? How could he? She disguised her concern and focused back on Linda. “Tomorrow is the staff’s day off so I’ve arranged for you to dine downtown. Every Sunday the local pizza restaurant has an eat all you can buffet involving every possible concoction imaginable.”“That sounds delightful. The kids’ll love it, I’m sure.”Emma smiled and excused herself from the table. She couldn’t wear this mask any longer. It was cracked to the point of disintegration.Walking rapidly from the dining room, she closed the doors behind her. Blocking out the rest of the guests, blocking out Stone.She grabbed the phone and quickly dialed Nate’s number. Her hands trembled violently, and she had to redial several times before getting it right. Listening to the ring, Emma tapped her foot and bit her nails. No one answered.“I think you have a lot of explaining to do.”Emma whirled around and threw the cordless phone at him. “Stop that. Right now, you stop that.” She approached him, waving her finger under his nose. “If you ever again so much as say hi and make me jump, I swear on all the four leaf clovers in the pasture that you’ll be a soprano before you finish your next word.”Stone narrowed his eyes and stepped into the room. “Yeah? That’ll be pretty hard to do when the next time I say hi will be at your funeral.”“Go back to your guests.”“Our guests have all gone to bed. Apparently without a hostess around to direct conversation, it’s rather boring.” He grabbed her finger before she could wave it one more time. The warmth of his touch seeped beneath her skin, sending little flames of fire all along her nerves.“Why?” he said softly. “Why expose yourself this way?”“I didn’t.” Emma swallowed and bit back tears. “I don’t know how he found out about Clover. It shouldn’t be written anywhere in any records.”Stone stared into her eyes. “Are you planning on assassinating Seamus Adams? Is that why you don’t want my interference?”“No.” Emma gasped and tried to pull away. Instead, he wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her closer.“You’re not going anywhere until you explain what’s going on.”She closed her eyes and counted back from ten. Her emotions skittered to the left then to the right, making it dammed impossible to think straight. “Nothing. There’s nothing illegal with Clover. I initiate a donation once a year to aid in the downfall of Adams’ political organization. But it goes through a thousand different companies before ever hitting the soil of Ireland.”Stone stared at her, his brows furrowed. “I don’t know whether to admire you or shake you silly. How stupid can you be?”She bit her tongue. If only he knew the whole of it.“I’m not stupid.”“Did it ever occur to you that this is exactly how he knew your whereabouts?”Emma shook her head slowly.He appeared entirely too caught up in his thoughts to realize how closely they stood. Her hand still caught in his grasp, his other hand pushing her firmly against his chest. Her heart quit beating as his fingers slid slowly down, over her rear. She was wrong. He knew.Stone released her hand and wrapped his other arm around her, pulling her even tighter against him. They molded together, not an inch of space between their bodies. She stared up into his face, into dark pools of desire.“I don’t want this,” he said.“I know.” And she did. She understood his hesitancy, his need to remain distant. He would be gone soon.Their lips touched and everything blurred beneath the longing and desire. Emma let go. She poured every ounce of herself into him, showing him what he’d never accept in words. His breath hitched, and he delved deeper. Pulling her in, twirling her around in an erotic dance.Her head spun…every nerve flaming and wanting only one thing. Stone.His hands raked her hair. She yanked at his shirt, pulling it off his shoulder. He chuckled when his buttons popped, but he never broke the kiss…the earth shattering, smoldering, hotter than Hades kiss.Somewhere she heard an insistent ring.“What’s that?”“The phone, damn…hold on.” Stone bent and picked up the cordless she’d tossed at him earlier. She smiled at his flushed face and erratic breathing, thinking it the most wonderful display of emotion she’d ever seen. He grinned wickedly. Emma rolled her eyes and held her hand to her heart, trying to calm her own mad pounding.Stone glanced at the caller id screen then handed the phone over. The look in his eyes spoke louder than any word.“Hello?” Her heart sank as Nate’s voice rattled down the line. “Yes,” she answered, “I did try to call earlier.”Emma bit her lip, fighting back the sorrow as Stone walked out, quietly shutting the door.",

      "content": "Chapter Seven Guns? Her mind couldn’t comprehend what she saw.Emma stared at the array of weapons neatly arranged within the center of her bedroom, the dark gray and black metal a stark contrast against her cream flokati rug and cucumber walls.“What’re you doing?”“Preparing,” Stone said. He sat crossed legged next to the weapons. The ammunition lay on her bed as he cleaned and dissected the gun in his hand, his movements deft and precise. The clicking and snapping echoed ominously within the tight space.“For what? An invasion of prairie dogs?”Stone laid his current weapon aside and looked at her. He shook his head slowly, picked up a small handgun and held it out for her to take. “No. An invasion of leprechauns.”“You can’t be serious? Seamus Adams isn’t going to risk his political career and kill me smack in the middle of my own home.” She ignored the proffered weapon and walked to her bed. Pushing the boxes of bullets out of her way, she sat and studied the man before her. “I’m not even certain he knows who I am.”“He knows.” His focused expression punctuated the threat. “I’ve done some checking into Mr. Adams, and he doesn’t ever do anything without an ulterior motive. In case he chooses the stupid path, I want to be prepared.”“Stone,” she said, trying to absorb everything. “This is crazy. He’s been here for almost a week and hasn’t made any move against me. If anything, the Adams seem more concerned with sightseeing and house hunting than the goings on of River Run.”“You hate him here.” Turning back to the weapons, he checked the next chamber.“It doesn’t mean I want to stoop to his level and kill him. What good would that do?”Stone glanced up and tossed her an incredulous look. “Set you free.”Emma didn’t know what to say. His eyes deepened in color, and she glimpsed an emotion he desperately tried to hide. She dropped to her knees and knelt beside him. Lifting her hand, Emma touched his shoulder. “Not this way. I don’t want to be set free this way.”He stilled beneath her caress but didn’t push away. “Don’t you want revenge?”“No.”She stared into the depths of his eyes, a warmth replacing his normally impenetrable wall. He reached up and pushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his fingers grazing her skin. Holding her breath, Emma resisted the urge to lean closer. He’d never touched her like this before, with tenderness washing away the steel.Last night surrounded by his presence, suffocated by his masculinity made walking on hot coals a preferable option. She hadn’t crawled beneath her covers in four nights afraid the intimacy would be too much to resist. Stone never said a word. They’d rested side by side, fully clothed, never touching.She was exhausted both physically and emotionally. Breaking contact, Emma sat down and crossed her legs. Stone appeared relieved.“Revenge,” Emma said, “is not the answer.”“Then what do you suggest?”“I suggest we get our acts together and serve dinner. Tilly’s almost done in the kitchen and the hour’s getting late.”“How can you forget what that man’s done to your family?” Stone demanded, rising to his feet. He reached down and yanked her up. She glared into his face.“How dare you? I haven’t forgotten. But I’ve accepted those memories, placed them where they need to be. Otherwise, the only thing I’d ever remember would be the blood running down my mother’s throat. I’d never be able to think of her without thinking of death. And that’s not acceptable. She gave me a love of life I’m forever grateful for. Her smile and selflessness are things I need to remember, have to remember. Otherwise, what good was it all? I loved my mother and my father.” Emma felt tears prick her eyes and swallowed past the lump in her throat. “But I won’t live in their death.”“Why? It’s not so bad.” Stone responded, his voice flat and unemotional.“You don’t get it, do you? I watch you fight to forget. I feel you toss and turn and attempt to block out whatever nightmares your mind has conjured. But it’s useless. Until you accept your memories, both good and bad, despair will win every time. You can’t make your past go away. So deal with it.”Stone didn’t move. “All this psychobabble isn’t going to change me, so you might as well stay away.”Emma widened her eyes in shock then stepped forward smacking her hand against his chest. “Don’t you dare run. I’m sick and tired of your unemotional, vacant stares. Your refusal to step into the world and participate.”“Participate? You’re a fine one to toss in accusations about participating. In case you haven’t noticed, Ms. O’Malley, there’s an entire life beyond the gates of River Run.”Her breath caught, and she tried not to let his words affect her. “You know why I stay close to home.”“Yeah, I know. Hiding is a great excuse for not living.”“Screw you! My life is this resort, and I live it with a greater passion than most people.” Emma stepped back, putting distance between herself and Stone. The truth of what he said stung.“Passion?” Stone responded, averting his face and rubbing a hand across his eyes. He was tired. She didn’t care.“What’s that supposed to mean?”He glanced back and pierced her with a steely gaze. “Emma, your main concern is to take care of everyone else. Being so focused on righting other people’s wrongs, how could you possibly know desire?”Her heart pounded. She couldn’t believe his attack and how very wrong his judgments were. Granted, Emma’s natural caretaking habits might appear to drown out her own dreams, but they didn’t. Did they? “ You’re a fine one to talk. We’ve been trapped here for months and this is the first time you’ve ever touched me.”“Isn’t that what you want? This indifferent relationship that remains professional at all times. Or would it be better if I yelled at you and told you how you twist my stomach into knots every time you look at me? No,” Stone shook his head. “I don’t think so. You wear your crown of indifference too well.”“I…” Emma didn’t know how to respond. How’d they get so far off topic? “Killing Seamus Adams is wrong. I’m not a killer.”“But I am.”“No.” She said softly. “You’re not a killer.”He smiled bitterly and headed for the door. “Oh, but you’re wrong, Ms. O’Malley, that’s exactly who I am.” Stone stopped before leaving and turned to look at her. “Can you care for a man buried in blood?”“No…” Before she could finish her sentence, he’d left. “But I think I can love you,” she whispered to the empty room. *** Damn, that woman drove him crazy. He swore again as he speared another mountain of dung. It hadn’t taken him long to discover the advantages of mucking stalls and cleaning the barn. No wonder Emma spent half her day out here. The animals never talked back. They listened in rapt attention and every once in a while bestowed you with unconditional love and affection.“Porkey, your mistress has gone too far this time. She needs to mind her own business.”The pig grunted and continued rooting around the stall.“Can you believe I almost spilled my guts? Told her how I feel? What’s the matter with me?” His stomach churned. She’d seen right through him, right into his core, and he hadn’t liked it one bit.Another stack of manure tossed into the wheelbarrow. At this rate, he’d be done with barn duties half an hour ahead of schedule. Stopping, Stone braced himself against the pitchfork. He looked at the pig. She’d halted her nosing about and actually sat gazing at him in interest.“What?”Porky snorted, green slime covering her snout.“That’s just plain disgusting.” Stone stepped forward and wiped his sleeve against the offending gunk. “You’re much prettier without that stuff.”He swore she smiled. Shaking his head, he tossed the pitch fork on top of the wheelbarrow and exited the stall. All there was left to do was add more hay, fill the grain buckets and bring the horses in for the night. Not enough chores to avoid Emma for the rest of the evening.He didn’t want to face her. For the first time in over two years, Stone felt an inner pulse, felt a desire to breathe. She’d woken him from his self-imposed exodus. But for what purpose? Even if there could be a slight chance of her caring, he couldn’t look beyond her affection for his father.It’d never work.No. He’d stick to his game plan. Eliminate Seamus Adams, sell River Run, and get the hell outta Dodge.Away from his father, away from Emma, away from the lure of life.Dumping the contents of the wheelbarrow out back in the compost pile, Stone tried hard not to chuckle at the antics of Rhett and Scarlett. The pygmy goats were the silliest excuse for an animal he’d ever seen. Entertaining, but silly. He leaned against the paddock fence and whistled for the three retired Cutter horses Emma adopted.This place resembled a zoo rather than a resort. He led the first horse into the barn and froze as a shadow stretched from the opposite end.“Interesting choice of duties, Mr. Connor.” Stone immediately recognized the gravely voice.“Mr. Adams, can I help you?” He pushed the horse between himself and the Irishman, swearing silently at his lack of weapons.Opening the stall door, Stone released the Cutter. He turned and faced Seamus Adams. The man stood about five inches shorter than Stone and carried the paunch of a well-fed, pub-hopping father of three. Physically, he wasn’t a threat.“You don’t like me much, do you?”“I’m afraid I don’t really know you, Mr. Adams. However, if you feel we’ve been less than hospitable, I’ll speak with the staff.”Seamus waved his hand and shook his head. “I thought I might take the opportunity to explain that although I’m a politician, I’m an honest man.”“Your political views are no concern of mine.” Stone eyed Pocahontas. She crept from the back of the barn, her teeth barred, and a low growl rumbling in her massive chest. “However, it appears my pig’s got a different opinion. If you’ll excuse me while I put her away for the night.” He shuffled the round body down the barn and into her pen, placating her with soft words. Emma would skin him alive if anything happened to her best friend.“Dangerous animal,” Adams said, stepping back out of the barn.“No. But she’ll bite if you threaten her.” Stone followed the man outside and they walked together back to the house.“I’m not here to threaten,” Seamus said.“Well that’s a relief,” Stone said, not bothering to hide his sarcasm. “Because I tend to bite as well.”“I’ll keep that in mind.”The two men entered River Run. Stone nodded to Seamus, then proceeded into Emma’s rooms. The aroma of baked onions steeped in sherry indicated dinner was almost ready and hosting duties required.He stepped into the bedroom. The urge to kick himself slammed into his gut, and he swore savagely. He’d left the guns laying everywhere. How could one woman rattle him enough to forget his responsibilities?He noted that Emma had pushed the weapons aside and covered everything with a blanket. He swore again, grabbing his clothes from the inch of closet space he’d been allowed.The bathroom light glowed beneath the door, and he leaned against the hall wall, waiting for Emma to finish.

      "content": "Chapter Eight Emma woke slowly. Soft rays of sun trickled through half-open blinds, creating golden bridges that blurred into a dust-particle blizzard. Without turning her head, she knew Stone was gone. In fact, she couldn’t be certain he’d even spent one moment next to her last night. Pushing away her unreasonable anger at Nate Connor, Emma sat up.The scent of rich Columbian coffee wafted beneath her door, spurring her to hop out of bed and don her typical outfit of jeans and River Run polo shirt. She exited the tiny bedroom and entered the kitchen.All four tables were filled with excited guests. White water rafting always prompted this nervous thrill from families who’d never experienced the heart-stopping, roller-coaster adventure.“Emma?” Seamus Adams interrupted her thoughts. She poured herself a cup of coffee, locked her emotions away, and turned toward her mother’s killer. Only a few more days, and he’d be gone.“Yes sir?” She smiled sweetly.“Why don’t you join us today? Linda mentioned how you love hiking.”“Oh, I don’t think…” Suddenly the room burst into an uproar, everyone talking at once. They all begged her to come along. The faces of the teenage boys alight with joy. I bet they just want to stare at my ass, she thought as the man-children cajoled and sunk to their knees, prostrating themselves before her. Keeping their octopus hands off her the past week made diving into the icy waters of Jenny Lake an enjoyable experience.“Please, Emma.” Linda ‘Leary stepped forward and squeezed her arm. “I can attest that Seamus’s wife, and I would certainly feel more confident with you on board.”“Really, I appreciate everyone’s encouragement, but I have a full day’s schedule to complete.”“I’ll fill in,” Tilly piped up from behind the counter. Emma glared then quickly covered her expression. A sudden thought tickled her mind. What if she could trick Seamus into revealing a soft spot in his campaign or better yet, what if she could verify once and for all that he truly had no knowledge of her identity?If either prospect succeeded, she’d be a more confident person. “Okay,” she inhaled deeply. “I’d love to join you.” *** The South Junction of Jenny Lake lay a few miles into Grand Teton National Park. Tilly maneuvered the resort van with a skill that sparked a bit of jealousy for Emma. No license. No driving outside River Run. Blocking out the incessant chit-chat between Linda and Seamus’s wife, Emma concentrated on what she wished to accomplish today.“This is very exciting.” Linda Leary jabbered as they exited the bus and lined up in front of their tour guide. “Do you do this a lot?”“At least several times a year,” Emma admitted, although she failed to add that this was the first time she’d joined a tour group. Normally she and Nate hiked the trails, enjoying the scenery and absorbing the serenity of their surroundings.She assisted the group in tightening their hiking books and securing water bottles.“Can I have everyone’s attention, please?” The Leary’s and Mrs. Adams gathered round. Emma noted Seamus still wandered toward the visitor’s center. “The trail that will take us from here to the West Shore boat dock is not overly difficult as far as trails go around these parts. There are steep areas but for the most part the path is clear.” Emma paused to make certain her audience understood. “Once we reach West Shore, we can break into two groups if not everyone wants to hike to Inspiration Falls. There is a shuttle boat that will bring those who are tired back here to the visitor’s center to wait on the rest of the party. Any questions?”Linda raised her hand. “I see all these bear signs. Is this bad territory?”Emma smiled as she noted the woman move closer to her sons. “If you use common sense, we will be fine. Talking in regular tones will warn any unsuspecting bear of our presence and hopefully they will move out of our way before we even know they exist.”Adams rejoined the group and handed his wife a water bottle. “I’ve got an extra,” he offered it to Emma.“Thanks,” she nodded, placing in the pouch hanging off her belt. “Let’s march.”Traipsing across the winding path that edged the lake, Emma couldn’t help but smile as the Leary boys pounded their chests in a Tarzanian testosterone display. They flanked her side, each vying for a snippet of attention.The water was glorious as it glittered with the reflection of the morning sun. Emma allowed her group’s excited chatter to smooth the tense muscles burning her shoulders. She kept the pace moving and slowed it slightly as the incline deepened upward toward the west end of the lake. “Let’s take a quick break and have a drink. Remember, hydration is a major factor in fighting the negative impact of this elevation.”She downed half her bottle of water, wiped the perspiration from her face and motioned for everyone to continue. A group of hiker’s passed them, whispering among themselves about spying a black bear. Emma twisted around and pulled a pair of small binoculars from her pocket. Sure enough, about a quarter mile behind them was a smudge on a hillside. If this was only her and Nate, they’d spend a few moments studying the bear and continue on their way. However, this was a group of rawhides that were her responsibility. “Alright, gang, let’s speed up this snail’s pace.” There was a sharp bend about a half mile up which would put them at a safe distance from the bear. “Come on, boys. Let’s race.”Emma grinned as the Leary teens bolted forward, vying for the medal of first place. Linda Leary glanced at Emma who pointed behind her. “Bear.”“Oh dear, okay. Let’s get a move on.”Emma suppressed her laugh as the women moved forward at a very quick clip. She began to follow. Her head spun and she reached out to brace herself against the nearest tree. Emma blinked a few times to clear her eyes. Jenny Lake misted to a dim pin prick then waved back into view.“Something wrong, Emma?”Emma shook her head and waved Adams forward. “No. I’m fine.”She stumbled and tripped to the right, clutching another limb to prevent a headlong dive into the lake below.Adams loomed before her. She followed his gaze as the group rounded a corner and disappeared from sight. They were alone. Emma knew she was in trouble. Something was terribly wrong but her mind fogged and nothing made sense.“Give my regards to your mother.” Adams whispered against her ear.Shaking her head, Emma pushed against his shoulders. “What?”Emma felt her body being lifted, but her muscles wouldn’t react. In a hideous moment of slow-motion, Adams tossed her from the edge of the precipice. She fell downward, her shoulder smacking painfully into the edge of the cliff. Emma attempted to snag a limb from one of the low hanging trees, but she slid downward at an alarming pace. The world spun and her fingers slid off the rocky cliff. She closed her eyes, reached out but clasped nothing but air.Cold water sliced over her skin. Icy fingers of death snatched precious air from her lungs.Water poured into her mouth. Choking and gasping she took a shallow breath, fighting against the pull of death. Her mind muddled and strength faded. Emma slowly slid beneath the surface, nothing more than a rag doll being lulled to sleep by the embrace of a tranquil lake.Her arm hit something warm and solid. Suddenly, another body slipped under her, wrapping her in strength and pulling her to the surface.She gasped for air, inhaling the sweet scent of life. Allowing the other person all control, Emma concentrated on breathing and filling her starved lungs.Lifted from the water, she turned to thank her rescuer. *** Stone’s heart beat a direct path out of his chest. He bent over, gasping for air and fighting the pain racking his soul. Water poured from his head. He swiped his eyes and stared at the drowned rat lying before him.Emma reached out. He held her hand and bent down so his forehead touched hers. She winced as he moved her arm, checking for any breaks. “I think I’m drugged,” her voice sounded slurred and sluggish.“Don’t ever do something as stupid as that again.” His voice was harsh and ragged from fear. When he’d learned she’d joined Seamus’s group on this expedition, a thousand horrific images plagued his imagination.“I’m sorry. I didn’t think.” Tears welled in her eyes, and he tried to smile. The fear of losing her blocked out all opposing rationale.“Obviously.”“What’re you doing here?” The reflection of the lake clouded her eyes. Stone shook his head and swore viciously. The shock of cold water appeared to have cleared the cobwebs in her brain.“I followed you and shadowed the group.”“Seamus threw me off the cliff,” she admitted.His anger blackened. “I saw.”“Thank you.” She grabbed his head and pulled him down, touching her lips to his. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you.”His nostrils flared and Stone battled to draw air into starving lungs. “Let’s go, we need to warm up.”They stood. Emma caught a glimpse of a blonder version of Stone. “Ethan, watcha doin’ here?” She accepted the blanket handed over by Stone’s cousin.“Figured I was a good back up for your boy, here. I’ve sent one of my men to inform your group about,” his voice dropped an octave lower from anger. “This little accident. They’ve been instructed to take the shuttle boat back to the visitor’s center.”“Where’s Adams?” Emma asked.“Ran like a little toad after his wife.” Stone cursed.Ethan nodded. “I can arrest him.”“No,” Stone shook his head. “We need something more permanent than that.”Emma began shivering. “I’m cold.”“I know baby, I know.” He pulled her tightly against his chest, rubbing her limbs in an attempt to rejuvenate circulation. The closeness of her body scorched away the bone-deep chill of the river.Fear at the thought of losing Emma still coursed violently through his system like the angry Snake. Shocked at his own reaction, he blocked the panic threatening to set in.Orchestrating the return of the resort guests and piling Emma into his Jeep momentarily blocked Stone from dwelling on what snagged at his heart. He worked the vehicle through the winding roads of Grand Teton National Park, mulling over how to exact revenge.Glancing at Emma, he frowned as shivers wracked her body.“Get out of your clothes,” he commanded.“What?” Her teeth chattered so loudly, he had to bite back on the adrenaline laughter threatening to break through.“I’ve some sweats in the backseat. Strip and put them on.”She stared at him as if he’d just grown pointy ears and a little green suit.“I don’t think…think…think so,” she chattered.He clenched his teeth. Stubborn and stupid. Pulling the Jeep off the winding road, he killed the ignition, reached behind her and grabbed his clothes. Jumping out and jogging to her side of the vehicle, he opened her door, picked her up and walked down the slightly sloped shoulder.“What’re you doing?”“I’m providing you with privacy.” He dumped her, not all that carefully, behind a thick cluster of pines. “Now change.”“Oh…oh…oh…kay.”Sighing deeply, Stone looked to the sky for deliverance from the entire soul searing experience. His chest still pounded from fear, his hormones were raging at the mere thought of her naked behind the trees, and his mind demanded he run, fast.“I’m dressed,” she said softly.He turned…and lost his heart.Emma stood ramrod straight, eyes bright with a kiss of tear tipping her lashes. Her hair, a tangle of auburn nests, cascaded wildly past her shoulders. Shivers continued to rack her petite form now swallowed by his navy blue military sweats, but not as often. All of that aside, Stone realized it had nothing to do with the vulnerability etched from head to toe that reached for him but everything to do with the small spark of fire that burned like a homing beacon in her eyes.He wanted that fire.He wanted her. *** Emma gathered the dinner dishes and walked into the kitchen.“Can I do that?” Stone asked.“No, you can’t. I’d appreciate it if you’d stop hovering over me.”“You scared me today.”She paused and gazed at him. His demeanor seemed changed, and it threw her off guard. “I scared myself. Let’s just enjoy an hour of quiet time before the Leary’s and Adams’ return, okay?”He nodded and walked into the living room. She quickly stacked the dishwasher, wiped the counters, and poured them each a glass of red wine. Following Stone’s path, she ended up in front of the warm, blazing hearth. He stood before the mantel, studying a collection of photographs. Emma handed his glass to him and dropped into the overstuffed leather couch.“This feels great,” she said, stretching her feet to the fire.He smiled that wicked little half-grin that made her feel like the tip of a feather caressed her stomach. “We need to talk.”“If you’re going to lecture me again on my poor judgment, I want to plead momentary insanity and be done with it.”“As much as I feel you need a lecture, I’ll refrain for at least a day.” Stone leaned against the mantel, sipping his wine and eyeing her carefully. “I’m going to help you find a permanent solution to this.”Emma tilted her head, ready to listen. “Gee, why does that sound more like a threat than a promise?”Stone chuckled and moved to sit next to her. He didn’t crowd, didn’t allow any physical contact, but the intimacy existed, muddling her mind and igniting her hormones.“Seamus Adams is a threat. He needs to be dealt with before something dangerous happens to either you or River Run.”“River Run…” Emma paused, unable to speak past the lump in her throat. “I understand,” she finally uttered.“I’ve decided to make an official request to the President to investigate his political dealings.”“You can do that?” Astonishment evidently laced her words, because Stone’s reaction bordered on barely-contained indulgence.“Yes. And I think it’ll be a safer road to travel than eliminating him.”Emma snorted her wine. It burned the inside of her nose, causing her eyes to water. “I can’t believe you just said that.”Stone frowned and cocked his head. “Said what?”“Eliminate him,” she repeated, using a deep threatening tone, “as if that were no more trouble than squashing a roach.”Stone tilted his head back, releasing what could only be described as a full-throttle laugh. It tickled her spine and warmed her spirit. “Well,” he said, still chuckling. “To be honest, he really isn’t much more than a roach.” He touched her cheek. Emma stilled, relishing the brief intimate contact. “Remember, killing is as easy to me as mucking stalls.”She saw the flicker of hesitancy and reached forward to mimic his caress. “I don’t believe that.”Stone’s jaw clenched then relaxed.”I have one favor to ask.” His voice suddenly dropped to a low whisper, and his desire ran lightly beneath the surface of his eyes.“Yes?”“You need to cease all Clover activities in Ireland.”Emma’s heart froze. She couldn’t do that. It would mean…no, wait a minute…after that last report, it really wouldn’t mean anything. The search for her father needed to come to an end.Nate’s belief that Hugh Gallagher still lived beneath the menacing hand of Seamus Adams needed to be dissolved. He’d done all he could to help her father, and it was time Emma ended this fruitless search.She trusted Stone.And as much as she hated the idea, she didn’t want to hurt his chances of selling River Run. “All right,” she said softly, burying the deep sorrow that welled in her chest. Nate’s reaction wouldn’t be pleasant, but the time had arrived to face reality.Stone smiled, leaning forward and planting a light kiss on her forehead. “Thank you.”Emma nodded, slightly stupefied by his behavior. “How exactly do you plan on bringing Seamus Adams down?”“I don’t think politically we’ll succeed, but I do believe I can box him into a corner where you’ll no longer be the focus of his concern. I’ll make sure there are more pressing matters within his campaign than a young Irish lass hiding in Wyoming.”“I see.” But Emma didn’t really. Stone obviously disregarded the depth of the politician’s hatred. It wasn’t something that could easily be distracted, but if he had a plan, then she’d trust in him. After all, River Run would be the next target. It was logical to assume that. He’d do what was right for his investment. “Why do you think Adams would try such a stupid maneuver today?”Stone frowned and shook his head. “I’ve no clue. Can you remember saying something that might’ve triggered this reaction?”Emma replayed the few times she’d actually spoken with Seamus Adams and couldn’t remember anything out of the ordinary. “What about Clover?”“What about Clover?” Stone repeated her words, pressing for more than she wanted to share.“Maybe he knows my connection and wanted to punish me.” She offered, touching his hand lightly. Stone glanced down, smiled and twined his fingers through hers.“I have no doubt he knows your connection, but why would it prompt him to attempt murder and ruin his chances of election?”Emma stared into his face. She couldn’t tell him the truth, not now. Not when he seemed finally to be connecting with her. Never, in her wildest dreams, did it occur to her that her actions abroad could inadvertently affect River Run. If Stone knew the potential risk she’d created for his investment, he’d surely back away.“I don’t know.” Shrugging, she bent forward and placed her wine on the table. “I’m tired. I think I’d like to sneak to bed before our guests return.”“I’ll bank the fire and be right there.” He stood, helped her to her feet and gently pushed her in the direction of her rooms. “Emma?”“Hmmm?”“Get under the covers tonight.”Her breath hitched, and she suddenly panicked. “I don’t think it’s a good idea. We’re…”Stone crossed the space separating them and knuckled her chin. “I’m not asking, I’m commanding. I expect my orders to be followed. But don’t worry, I’ll not cross into enemy territory.”“I’m not the enemy.”He touched his lips lightly to hers then backed away, leaving her wanting more. “Yes, Ms. O’Malley, you certainly are.” He winked removing the sting from his words, but it still hurt. She didn’t want to be the enemy. Smiling slightly, Emma turned and walked to her rooms.Away from the heat of the fire and burning desire ignited by Stone, the cool air caused her to shiver. It reminded her of the lake, and she hurried to bury her frozen body beneath the warmth of her down comforter. She changed into sweats, armoring herself against Stone then slipped into bed.Emma drifted to sleep, barely conscious when his weight shifted the mattress. He gathered her into his arms. She accepted his warmth, his protection and smiled dreamily when he whispered good night. *** “I get the shower first, Stone.” Emma called racing ahead of him through the main part of River Run. Rounding the kitchen counter, her socks slid on the hardwood floor sending her flying backward.“Easy girl,” he said, catching her before she hit her head on the ground. They collapsed on the floor laughing. It took her a moment to realize he hadn’t pulled away and continued cradling her against his chest, his arm wrapped protectively around her waist. They hadn’t been this close since the night of the river accident. He’d left her before morning and remained distant ever since.“It’s nice to hear that.”“What?” He inhaled, pulling her tighter. Her skin burned to be touched, she fought the desire to turn around and wrap her arms around his neck. Grabbing the counter for support, Stone hauled them both to their feet.“Your laughter,” she said.“Don’t get used to it. I just needed something to break the tension of having to tip-toe around Seamus Adams. I’m glad they’re gone.”“Me too.” Emma reluctantly stepped from his arms and took off again for the bathroom. She laughed when he grabbed her shirt and yanked her back, against his chest. Battling for a foot hold on the slick floor, she tried to inch forward.“You showered first yesterday, wench.”“Don’t stoop to name-calling, jerk. It’s my bathroom, and I should get the shower first every night. Besides you’ll have yours back as soon as housekeeping is finished.”“I’m not waiting for another two hours. I want a shower now, and I want it hot.” He wouldn’t release her so they penguin waddled into her private rooms. Emma reached for the bathroom doorknob but his hand closed over hers. Twisting around, it suddenly dawned on her how very close they were.He didn’t step back but instead pushed closer. Every inch of him pressed against her. “I’m dirty,” she said.“Really?”Emma eyed him thoughtfully. He’d been different after the accident, more approachable. His hostility toward Seamus Adams escalated each day the vacationers remained. This morning, the Irish politician ran to the limo, tail tucked securely between his legs.“Get your mind out of the gutter, Stone, and let me have my shower in peace.”“You know,” he spoke softly, lowering his head so their lips were nearly touching. “We have the house all to ourselves.”“No we don’t,” she replied. Her lungs burned with the need for air.“Well, except for housecleaning, we do.” He ran his tongue along the edge of her lips. She couldn’t help the little whimper that escaped, causing him to grin wickedly.“House cleaning is very nosy.” Emma leaned into Stone, seeking him with her mouth. He inhaled and dove into her with the want of a hungry man, consuming, overpowering. Her knees buckled, and she clutched his neck climbing closer.Head spinning, body humming, Emma remembered what’d happened last time they were this close. She pushed away and looked into his glazed expression. Passion, lust, and something else she didn’t recognize shone back.“We can’t do this,” she said.“Why not?”The phone rang, breaking the awkward silence with its shrill echo. She broke free and answered. A deep female voice asked for Stone Connor, and her stomach dropped. This was why she needed to protect herself. Handing him the phone, she shrugged.“Because there’s always something new…or someone.”Stone listened to the voice on the other end of the receiver, then glanced up at her. The pain and hurt that crossed his eyes before he turned away crushed her heart. She wished she knew everything about him, could trust all of him.",

Without turning her head, she knew Stone was gone. In fact, she couldn’t be certain he’d even spent one moment next to her last night. Pushing away her unreasonable anger at Nate Connor, Emma sat up.The scent of rich Columbian coffee wafted beneath her door, spurring her to hop out of bed and don her typical outfit of jeans and River Run polo shirt.

I’d appreciate it if you’d stop hovering over me.”“You scared me today.”She paused and gazed at him. His demeanor seemed changed, and it threw her off guard. “I scared myself. Let’s just enjoy an hour of quiet time before the Leary’s and Adams’ return, okay?”He nodded and walked into the living room. She quickly stacked the dishwasher, wiped the counters, and poured them each a glass of red wine. Following Stone’s path, she ended up in front of the warm, blazing hearth. He stood before the mantel, studying a collection of photographs. Emma handed his glass to him and dropped into the overstuffed leather couch.“This feels great,” she said, stretching her feet to the fire.He smiled that wicked little half-grin that made her feel like the tip of a feather caressed her stomach. “We need to talk.”“If you’re going to lecture me again on my poor judgment, I want to plead momentary insanity and be done with it.”“As much as I feel you need a lecture, I’ll refrain for at least a day.” Stone leaned against the mantel, sipping his wine and eyeing her carefully. “I’m going to help you find a permanent solution to this.”Emma tilted her head, ready to listen. “Gee, why does that sound more like a threat than a promise?”Stone chuckled and moved to sit next to her. He didn’t crowd, didn’t allow any physical contact, but the intimacy existed, muddling her mind and igniting her hormones.“Seamus Adams is a threat. He needs to be dealt with before something dangerous happens to either you or River Run.”“River Run…” Emma paused, unable to speak past the lump in her throat. “I understand,” she finally uttered.“I’ve decided to make an official request to the President to investigate his political dealings.”“You can do that?” Astonishment evidently laced her words, because Stone’s reaction bordered on barely-contained indulgence.“Yes. And I think it’ll be a safer road to travel than eliminating him.”Emma snorted her wine. It burned the inside of her nose, causing her eyes to water. “I can’t believe you just said that.”Stone frowned and cocked his head. “Said what?”“Eliminate him,” she repeated, using a deep threatening tone, “as if that were no more trouble than squashing a roach.”Stone tilted his head back, releasing what could only be described as a full-throttle laugh. It tickled her spine and warmed her spirit. “Well,” he said, still chuckling. “To be honest, he really isn’t much more than a roach.” He touched her cheek. Emma stilled, relishing the brief intimate contact. “Remember, killing is as easy to me as mucking stalls.”She saw the flicker of hesitancy and reached forward to mimic his caress. “I don’t believe that.”Stone’s jaw clenched then relaxed.”I have one favor to ask.” His voice suddenly dropped to a low whisper, and his desire ran lightly beneath the surface of his eyes.“Yes?”“You need to cease all Clover activities in Ireland.”Emma’s heart froze. She couldn’t do that. It would mean…no, wait a minute…after that last report, it really wouldn’t mean anything. The search for her father needed to come to an end.Nate’s belief that Hugh Gallagher still lived beneath the menacing hand of Seamus Adams needed to be dissolved. He’d done all he could to help her father, and it was time Emma ended this fruitless search.She trusted Stone.And as much as she hated the idea, she didn’t want to hurt his chances of selling River Run. “All right,” she said softly, burying the deep sorrow that welled in her chest. Nate’s reaction wouldn’t be pleasant, but the time had arrived to face reality.Stone smiled, leaning forward and planting a light kiss on her forehead. “Thank you.”Emma nodded, slightly stupefied by his behavior. “How exactly do you plan on bringing Seamus Adams down?”“I don’t think politically we’ll succeed, but I do believe I can box him into a corner where you’ll no longer be the focus of his concern. I’ll make sure there are more pressing matters within his campaign than a young Irish lass hiding in Wyoming.”“I see.” But Emma didn’t really. Stone obviously disregarded the depth of the politician’s hatred. It wasn’t something that could easily be distracted, but if he had a plan, then she’d trust in him. After all, River Run would be the next target. It was logical to assume that. He’d do what was right for his investment. “Why do you think Adams would try such a stupid maneuver today?”Stone frowned and shook his head. “I’ve no clue. Can you remember saying something that might’ve triggered this reaction?”Emma replayed the few times she’d actually spoken with Seamus Adams and couldn’t remember anything out of the ordinary. “What about Clover?”“What about Clover?” Stone repeated her words, pressing for more than she wanted to share.“Maybe he knows my connection and wanted to punish me.” She offered, touching his hand lightly. Stone glanced down, smiled and twined his fingers through hers.“I have no doubt he knows your connection, but why would it prompt him to attempt murder and ruin his chances of election?”Emma stared into his face. She couldn’t tell him the truth, not now. Not when he seemed finally to be connecting with her. Never, in her wildest dreams, did it occur to her that her actions abroad could inadvertently affect River Run. If Stone knew the potential risk she’d created for his investment, he’d surely back away.“I don’t know.” Shrugging, she bent forward and placed her wine on the table. “I’m tired. I think I’d like to sneak to bed before our guests return.”“I’ll bank the fire and be right there.” He stood, helped her to her feet and gently pushed her in the direction of her rooms. “Emma?”“Hmmm?”“Get under the covers tonight.”Her breath hitched, and she suddenly panicked. “I don’t think it’s a good idea. We’re…”Stone crossed the space separating them and knuckled her chin. “I’m not asking, I’m commanding. I expect my orders to be followed. But don’t worry, I’ll not cross into enemy territory.”“I’m not the enemy.”He touched his lips lightly to hers then backed away, leaving her wanting more. “Yes, Ms. O’Malley, you certainly are.” He winked removing the sting from his words, but it still hurt. She didn’t want to be the enemy. Smiling slightly, Emma turned and walked to her rooms.Away from the heat of the fire and burning desire ignited by Stone, the cool air caused her to shiver. It reminded her of the lake, and she hurried to bury her frozen body beneath the warmth of her down comforter. She changed into sweats, armoring herself against Stone then slipped into bed.Emma drifted to sleep, barely conscious when his weight shifted the mattress. He gathered her into his arms. She accepted his warmth, his protection and smiled dreamily when he whispered good night. *** “I get the shower first, Stone.” Emma called racing ahead of him through the main part of River Run. Rounding the kitchen counter, her socks slid on the hardwood floor sending her flying backward.“Easy girl,” he said, catching her before she hit her head on the ground. They collapsed on the floor laughing. It took her a moment to realize he hadn’t pulled away and continued cradling her against his chest, his arm wrapped protectively around her waist. They hadn’t been this close since the night of the river accident. He’d left her before morning and remained distant ever since.“It’s nice to hear that.”“What?” He inhaled, pulling her tighter. Her skin burned to be touched, she fought the desire to turn around and wrap her arms around his neck. Grabbing the counter for support, Stone hauled them both to their feet.“Your laughter,” she said.“Don’t get used to it. I just needed something to break the tension of having to tip-toe around Seamus Adams. I’m glad they’re gone.”“Me too.” Emma reluctantly stepped from his arms and took off again for the bathroom. She laughed when he grabbed her shirt and yanked her back, against his chest. Battling for a foot hold on the slick floor, she tried to inch forward.“You showered first yesterday, wench.”“Don’t stoop to name-calling, jerk. It’s my bathroom, and I should get the shower first every night. Besides you’ll have yours back as soon as housekeeping is finished.”“I’m not waiting for another two hours. I want a shower now, and I want it hot.” He wouldn’t release her so they penguin waddled into her private rooms. Emma reached for the bathroom doorknob but his hand closed over hers. Twisting around, it suddenly dawned on her how very close they were.He didn’t step back but instead pushed closer. Every inch of him pressed against her. “I’m dirty,” she said.“Really?”Emma eyed him thoughtfully. He’d been different after the accident, more approachable. His hostility toward Seamus Adams escalated each day the vacationers remained. This morning, the Irish politician ran to the limo, tail tucked securely between his legs.“Get your mind out of the gutter, Stone, and let me have my shower in peace.”“You know,” he spoke softly, lowering his head so their lips were nearly touching. “We have the house all to ourselves.”“No we don’t,” she replied. Her lungs burned with the need for air.“Well, except for housecleaning, we do.” He ran his tongue along the edge of her lips. She couldn’t help the little whimper that escaped, causing him to grin wickedly.“House cleaning is very nosy.” Emma leaned into Stone, seeking him with her mouth. He inhaled and dove into her with the want of a hungry man, consuming, overpowering. Her knees buckled, and she clutched his neck climbing closer.Head spinning, body humming, Emma remembered what’d happened last time they were this close. She pushed away and looked into his glazed expression. Passion, lust, and something else she didn’t recognize shone back.“We can’t do this,” she said.“Why not?”The phone rang, breaking the awkward silence with its shrill echo. She broke free and answered. A deep female voice asked for Stone Connor, and her stomach dropped. This was why she needed to protect herself. Handing him the phone, she shrugged.“Because there’s always something new…or someone.”Stone listened to the voice on the other end of the receiver, then glanced up at her. The pain and hurt that crossed his eyes before he turned away crushed her heart. She wished she knew everything about him, could trust all of him.",

      "content": "Chapter Nine Stone lifted the last pumpkin from the Jeep. He glanced up, noting the thick white clouds shrouding the sun and cooling the temperatures. The upper tips of the Tetons were hidden. A storm brewed, and he’d no doubt snow would fall before night settled. Surveying the collection of odd sized orange shapes, he wondered if Emma would help carve. Halloween loomed less than a week away, and the current guests of River Run had a parcel of little tots.With a deep sigh, he sat on the porch steps and reviewed everything they’d gone through the past two weeks. He didn’t understand her adversity toward his therapist. If Emma hadn’t crawled beneath his skin, he wouldn’t have needed to call the damn woman in the first place.He’d hated that.That first call he’d placed after so many months of rejecting therapy. The night he sat in the tiny office, Emma sleeping less than ten strides away, her scent twirling all around making him crazed, he’d picked up the phone and dialed a number he’d sworn never to use again.Psychobabble wouldn’t help him, he knew. But it was the fear that his emotions might possibly damage Emma that forced his hand. He’d never considered her reaction, that she’d hate his weakness.“Mr. Connor?” Stone turned and smiled at Sally Haven. Her heart shaped face, too serious eyes, and outward demeanor of an old lady, snuck beneath the dangerous trip wire around his heart. This five year-old needed to be a child. But, her parents didn’t quite see that.“What’s up Sally?”“Um, I was wondering if I might be of some assistance in, um, carving the pumpkins.”“Sure thing, kiddo. Which one do you want?”“I can choose my own?”“Of course. Just don’t make the face too hard for me to carve.”“Oh,” she said softly. “I wouldn’t know how to make a face.”Stone narrowed his eyes and absorbed the way she shuffled from foot to foot, her hands twisting in time to her words.“Have you ever helped carve a pumpkin?”“Well, no. But I’d like to try.”“What about trick-or-treating?”Little Sally hung her head and shook it slowly. “My parents don’t believe in candy.”“Well then, little girl,” Stone stood and swung her up onto his shoulders, smiling at her shrieks of mock terror. “You’re on vacation which means you’re about to have the best darned Halloween ever.”He performed a mad gallop around the driveway, through the barn and back to the porch. Settling her back on her feet, Stone nodded to the house. “Go put on some old clothes and let your Mom know you’ll be out here with me. We’ll carve these babies then light them up on Halloween.”“Okay, Mr. Connor. I’ll be back.” Sally dashed into the resort, calling for her mother.Stone turned back to the drive, walking thoughtfully around the Jeep. He’d seen Emma down by the gate arguing with Nate. Torn between ignoring his father and protecting the woman he loved, he didn’t know whether or not to interrupt them. Emma didn’t see the truth, didn’t know the animal that lurked beneath his father’s calm demeanor.Making a decision, he walked slowly across the pasture. He’d be out of sight, but within a quick jog should she need his help. *** “I can’t believe you’ve shut down Clover.” Nate’s face flushed crimson as he continued to scream the same thing over and over at her.Once more, she attempted to reason with him. “It’s for the best. Why continue throwing good money after bad? The last report indicated no chance of survival.”“You don’t know that.” His voice rang loudly, laced with an anger she’d never witnessed before.“He’s my father, dammit.”“And you’ve just sentenced him to death.”Emma inhaled sharply. “How could you say that? The minute you brought that little speck of evidence to my attention, I’ve moved Heaven and Earth to discover the truth.”“Why’re you suddenly giving up? I don’t understand this.”“I’m not giving up. I’m being realistic. My father’s dead and nothing I can do will bring him back.”“He’s not dead, and if the roles were reversed he’d go to his grave searching for you.” Nate stepped forward and pointed a shaking finger in her face. “No matter how much money it took.”Emma blanched. Was he right? By doing as Stone asked and ending Clover’s overseas investigations, was she killing her father all over again. Nate pressed closer.“You can’t shut down Clover.”“I have to.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, and she stepped back, away from the angry accusation pouring from Nate’s eyes. It’s the right choice, she told herself silently. Stone’s flesh and blood. My father’s a ghost.The evidence Nate brought her five years ago never panned out. Every tie leading back to that cryptic message went nowhere. The last report received from Clover indicated they’d discovered Hugh Gallagher’s grave, and it apparently contained his remains.She shouldn’t be struggling with this decision.It’s time to move on.“It’s your conscience you’ll be dealing with, Emma. You’ll be the one responsible for burying your father down the line. How do you think that will feel? Knowing he’d been rotting in jail for years while you played mistress to my son?”Emma bit her lip, struggling against the tears. His words knifed her heart, spurting forth guilt and anger all mixed together in a whirlpool of hurt. “That comment was uncalled for,” she said in a soft voice. “Don’t come here anymore until you’ve calmed down. You’ve no right to speak to me that way.”“I owe him my life, Emma.”“He’s gone, Nate. Accept it.” She softened her voice reached for the man who’d raised her. “You don’t owe him anymore. You’ve taken care of me and helped me be the person I am today.”Nate backed away, his gaze burning fiercely. “All I’ve done is hide you and look at the damage that’s created.”His words stinging, she turned and headed up the drive, her heart ripped and bleeding. *** Stone stepped from the shadows and held an arm out to prevent his father from following Emma.“Stone…” Nate said quietly, turning his attention from Emma’s retreating form.“It’s time to leave.”“You don’t understand…”Stone shook his head. “If that isn’t a line I know well. I’m not a little boy anymore, and I damn well do understand. Get off my property.”“You can’t let her do this.”“Do what?”“Shut down Clover.”“What’s Clover to you?” Stone knew about Nate’s interest. It’d bothered him that Emma’s relationship with his father extended beyond River Run, beyond the fact that he’d been a surrogate father. An emotional tie of a phone call every now and then to check on one another seemed far less invasive to Stone than the fact they were in business together. He knew she’d never force Nate out of her life the same way he knew he’d never allow him in to his.“It’s my chance for redemption.”Stone laughed bitterly.“Fine,” Nate said. “I don’t expect you to understand. Do this for Emma then. It’s everything to her. Damn it, Stone, don’t you see? Emma’s doing what she always does. She puts everyone else’s lives and loves before her own.”“I’m not following you and, honestly, I don’t think I care. Now, leave.”“She loves you.”Stone glared at his father. “It’s no concern of yours.”“It is when she’s sacrificing her life…her needs.”“Maybe,” Stone spoke slowly, opening the gate and shoving his father through. “You’d better explain what you mean by that.”“By protecting you and River Run, she’s committing her father to death.”Stone frowned. “Nice try at attempting to invoke more self-doubt, Nate. Her father’s already dead.”“No. He’s not. Ask Emma. She’ll explain all about Clover’s investigations. Then tell her you don’t care and let her find her father. Let her put her own needs above yours.”“I’ve heard enough lies from you old man. You’re more delusional than I thought. Get off my land.”Stone slammed the gate shut, locking it tightly. He didn’t glance at his father again, but jogged up the drive. Afternoon loomed ahead and pumpkins called. A few hours of innocent chatting with little kids and mindless carving of a holiday tradition sounded damn fine to him. He squashed the uncomfortable doubt that tugged at him.Certainly Emma wouldn’t put the best interests of River Run over her father? Would she? *** After calming her inner turmoil and washing away the remnants of tears, Emma headed to the picnic table out back. She paused and watched in amazement.Stone sat between little Sally Haven and her older brother, Matthew. The two children chattered away, digging their small hands into the depths of the opened pumpkins. Piles of seeds and mush scattered the table, the children, and Stone.She inhaled sharply as he turned his head to laugh at something Sally said. He appeared happy. Emma wanted him to act like that with her, unreserved, carefree…alive. The mixed signals drove her nuts. One second, he flirted and tossed her burning gazes full of want and desire…the next, his eyes iced over, pushing her away and declaring his distance.It’s time, she thought. Time for honesty.Emma smiled as she headed for the picnic table. She’d seen the results of Stone’s handiwork for the afternoon. The youngest children were finished with their pumpkins and now lay napping within their parent’s room. River Run’s guests lounged before crackling fires, shooting pool and thoroughly enjoying the respite granted them by the impromptu pumpkin carving project.Stooping for a quick pat and quiet word with Pocahontas, she shivered as a chill breeze swooped across the pasture. Stone rose from the table, making room for her to sit between the last remaining children.“Here,” he said, stripping off his jean jacket and wrapping it around her shoulders. “Who dressed you this morning?”The children giggled, and she rolled her eyes in an exaggerated display of disdain. “Certainly not you.”Stone’s eyes darkened and the brief flare of passion sent her breath racing after the brisk breeze. “I’m contemplating changing that.”“My Mommy dresses my Daddy every morning,” Sally piped in. “She says he’s blinded by color.”Emma laughed and settled comfortably between the children. “Sally, what kind of face are you making?”“I want a happy face,” the little girl said.“She’s such a baby,” Matthew interrupted. “I told Mr. Connor I want a scary pumpkin. One with fangs and horns.”“Horns? My, aren’t we creative. I think I’m going to help Sally and carve her a happy face.”The light banter and distraction created by the children aided in calming the tingles of awareness coursing the length of her body. Stone sat across from her, their knees touching beneath the narrow wooden table, each movement a friction sparking flashes of desire. They worked in silence, answering the children but not one another.She couldn’t look up. Every glance into his wanting eyes pushed her closer to blurting out her demands. And that definitely wouldn’t be proper in front of the Haven kids. Emma stopped all movement. Stone’s foot tickled her shin then moved slowly upward. Her eyes flew up to meet his bemused expression and a treacherous grin tugged at his mouth.“Hi,” he said softly.“What?” She couldn’t think. His touch ignited all sorts of inappropriate responses from her body.“Hi.”“Hi yourself.” Emma frowned and bent her head to hide the crimson flush she knew crept at an alarming rate from her neck to the roots of her hair.“I figured I’d better remind you that I’m over here.”Damn him. His foot continued massaging her leg. “Trust me, I know you’re there.”“I don’t think so.”Emma added the final touch to Sally’s pumpkin and turned the carving around for the little girl’s approval. Sally squealed in delight“Can I go show my Mommy?”“Sure,” Emma answered. “But be careful not to drop it.” Helping Sally lift the fat ball, she made sure the little girl could carry it easily. Matthew traipsed behind his sister, proudly displaying his own creation.Suddenly they were alone. No children to buffer the uncomfortable silence.Stone reached over and grabbed her hands pulling her across the narrow table so her face was barely an inch from his.“I’m tired of dancing.”“Excuse me?”“You heard me. I’m done shuffling awkwardly around this house, snuggling close then hopping backward every time the phone rings. I want you beside me as a partner and in my bed as a lover.” He released her hand and cupped her cheek. “Don’t turn away. I know you feel the same. I see it in your eyes.”Emma inhaled and plunged forward certain her accusations were about to put an end to this ridiculous discussion.“What about your girlfriend?”“My what?” He honestly appeared shocked. He must think her an idiot.“You know, deep, sexy voice on the other end of the phone. Are you willing to give her up? Because I don’t share well.”“Me neither, but I’m willing to try.”“What’s that supposed to mean?”“I have to accept your attachment to my father, and you’ll have to accept my need for a therapist every now and then. Trust me, I don’t give a bat’s flip about myself, but I need to make sure I don’t hurt you or anyone else for that matter. It’s a weakness, I know.” Stone released her and stood up from the table. He glanced at the sky then shot his steel blue gaze down straight into her soul. “But I don’t care. I’m going to fight for us. I’m going to make you understand that we’ve something special here.Emma wasn’t certain how to respond. “Your therapist?”Stone paused his nervous movements and stared at her. “I can’t promise I won’t hurt you. I’m not good at caring. But I can guarantee you there’s no one else in my bed...or in my heart. You’re it. I’ve crossed the finish line. I’m done running.”Picking up a handful of seeds that dripped with stringy pulp, she turned and ignored the don’t-you-dare look that crossed Stone’s eyes. Emma stood, cast one last glance at a face she loved dearly, and smeared the soggy mess from his forehead to his chin. He choked, sputtered and grabbed her waist. “Oh no, you don’t,” Emma said, muffling her giggles and snatching another handful of gunk. This time she dropped it down his shirt and watched his face turn deep red as her palm smashed and crushed the wet slop against his skin. “I have weeks of misery to hand you. I can’t believe how stupid I’ve been. I should have just asked.”“Yep, you shoulda.” Stone stood abruptly, swooped her up in his arms and held her tightly against his sodden chest. He grinned, her stomach fluttered with a million feather swipes of hope and desire. Bits of pumpkin clumped in his hair, and he reeked like day old garbage.“You stink.”His chest rumbled, and she couldn’t prevent her answering laughter. “I’m sorry,” he finally said, placing a sticky kiss on her cheek and nuzzling her neck. She didn’t care. It felt wonderful and delicious.“You need a shower.”Stone paused, the smile slipping from his face. He held her gaze, his eyes burning with emotion. “Not without you.” His words challenged, taunting her to turn her back…retreat into indifference. Replay all their past dances.“Then I’m glad you’re staying in your suite.” She watched the cloud of doubt snake across his eyes, and smiled a sly grin. “My bathroom is way too small for us.”His arms relaxed, and she slid slowly to the ground feeling every inch of his tight body. Stone wrapped his hands within her hair, pulling her face roughly to his. A harsh whisper caressed her ears. “You try my patience.” His lips locked on her mouth, and the world disappeared, tumbling into a vacuum of white clouds and hot breath.When he released her, Emma grabbed his arm to steady herself. Her knees trembled. But she didn’t care. This man knocked her world upside down and that’s all that mattered. “Time for that shower?” she said, walking backward and raising her eyebrows.“You betcha.” He lunged for her, and she ran laughing across the yard, making a bee-line for his suite. With a quick mental tally, Emma knew that Sunday meant pizza night for the resort guests. Her responsibilities were done for the day. *** Emma slipped through the French doors and stopped. Inhaling the pure masculine scent of Stone’s suite, she realized with a start it belonged to him. She’d always held out for the time when she’d be able to reclaim these rooms. Now, all she wanted involved the man standing behind her.“What?” he said. His voice hitched, as if he were afraid she’d change her mind.“I…” Emma turned then frowned. The look on his face silenced the rest of her words. “What’s the matter?”His eyes glistened brightly in the late afternoon light and a muscle twitched above his left cheek. “You’re so beautiful.” Stone’s voice remained soft, but his intentions were clear.“Wow, you had me scared for moment.” She swore if she weren’t attempting to control her legs, her knees would knock together.“Scared?” He walked past her and flipped on the bathroom light. “Yes, I think you should be scared.” Stopping beyond the door, he turned and held his hand out to her. “There’s no turning back now O’Malley…you’re mine.” Everything inside her melted then curled into a tight ball of desire. Her mind couldn’t keep up with her heart. Emotions hot and fast poured through her nerves, sparking and flaring a passionate storm that blanketed all doubts, all reserve.Her lips curved, and she tilted her head. Slipping the jean jacket off her shoulders, Emma allowed it to fall to her feet. With quick precise moves, she removed her shoes and socks then allowed her fingers to lazily unbutton the flannel shirt she wore. Stone’s hand dropped to his side, and he gazed intently into her face.Discarding the shirt, Emma slipped out of her jeans. Stone’s nostrils flared and he leaned against the doorjamb, crossing his arms. The heat lighting his eyes spurred her pulse into rapid fire.She rested her right hand between her breasts and slowly released her bra clasp. He inhaled sharply as satin lace glided to the floor. Emma walked forward, stepping into his arms with the grace of an eagle returning home. His hands grazed her skin, hot, insistent, possessive. Her arms snaked up, twining around his neck. “I’m not scared anymore.”“I am.” Stone dropped his head and laced a trail of fiery kisses from her neck to her shoulder. His hands burned paths of liquid fire as he raked his fingers across her back. He lightly traced the fading bruises that scattered her left shoulder, placing a circle of tender kisses over the yellowed patches.The piercing sound of a ringing phone stilled them both.“If you dare answer that,” he threatened. “I’ll toss you back in the lake.”She shook her head, standing on tiptoes and whispered in his ear. “Promise you won’t regret this.”“Woman, that’s a promise easy to keep.” Yanking her through the door, he slammed it shut, closing out the incessant trill.Emma laughed as he tossed his shirt on the floor, leaving him bare-chested and clad only in jeans. Her eyes followed the cluster of tight curls that surrounded his nipples then drew together in a thin line, dipping down beyond his waistband. She reached out and snapped open his top button.Her hand shook, and she swore if she inhaled her chest would explode. She’d never wanted a man like the one that stood before her. Steel blue eyes burned bright and hot, expecting…demanding. He cocked his head and winked.Stone padded to the shower and turned it on. He glanced at her sheepishly. “You’re gonna have to wait one more second before I perform the duties you so eloquently demanded. I’m a bit sticky.”She slipped out of her panties and stepped beneath the steaming water. “I’ll scrub.”“Emma, you’re killin’ me.” He discarded his jeans and this time she inhaled sharply.“I think I’m scared again.”He leaned forward, snaking his hand behind her head and bringing his lips down onto hers for a tender kiss. “Too late, sugar.” He said softly, running his tongue gently against her teeth. “You and I are about to take a long walk down discovery lane.” *** She smelled like jasmine and honey. He couldn’t catch his breath, it hitched and tightened in his chest. Stone figured his heart might break through his skin at any second. Its rapid pounding mirrored the desire slamming around his gut in waves of exquisite pain, wreaking havoc with his attempts at maintaining an even keel.All his fantasies didn’t come close to the beauty of Emma standing beneath streaming water. His finger followed a trickle of water as it snaked from her shoulder, between her breasts and past her belly button. She gasped as he touched and searched, feeling her heat, amazed at her response to him.She rubbed her hands lightly across his chest, soaping off the last remnants of pumpkin mash. Each touch sent bolts of desire pounding into his gut. Trying to slow his need, he chuckled at the memory of her anger and its consequences. If all his stupidity met with such pleasurable punishment, then he figured he must be in heaven.“Why are you laughing?”He nibbled her ear. She gasped, her nostrils flaring. “You covered me with pumpkin mash,” he said, his tone rough with want. Stone fought against dragging her up and burying himself mindlessly in her. This experience needed to be special. He touched her lips gently and slipped into the passion without fear or doubt, only love. *** They lay nestled beneath the warmth of his covers. Emma’s head rested upon his shoulder and the peace her closeness afforded twisted Stone’s heart. He didn’t know what to do with this love.“Hungry?” he asked.She snuggled closer, then snaked a slender leg over his, crawling on top. She smelled like him, musky and earthy. He’d stamped every corner of her body with his scent, asserting his ownership. “Yep.” Her lips caressed his skin as she scattered gentle kisses up his neck and nibbled his ear.“I meant for food.” He laughed and seized her mouth, inhaling her passion and answering ten-fold. “If we’re to do this another half dozen times then I need to be energized.”Her stomach rumbled loudly and Emma broke the kiss, smiling wickedly. “I suppose we could take a break for nourishment.”“I’ll be right back.” He slipped from the warmth of his bed and tucked the covers around her. Pulling on his jeans, he padded out of the bedroom and into his living room.An antique roll top desk sat beside the door. A pile of documents caught his eye, and he stopped before leaving the room.He prayed when the time came Emma would choose what her heart demanded and not what she thought she should do. That she would, as his father put it, not seek to fill other people’s needs, ignoring her own.Taking the stack of papers and sliding them into the desk drawer, his fingers outlined the embossed lettering. Slamming the drawer shut, he tried to ignore the fear that seared his skin. He turned his thoughts back to Emma and away from the future. Away from the Contract of Sale.",

      "content": "Chapter Nine Stone lifted the last pumpkin from the Jeep. He glanced up, noting the thick white clouds shrouding the sun and cooling the temperatures. The upper tips of the Tetons were hidden. A storm brewed, and he’d no doubt snow would fall before night settled. Surveying the collection of odd sized orange shapes, he wondered if Emma would help carve. Halloween loomed less than a week away, and the current guests of River Run had a parcel of little tots.With a deep sigh, he sat on the porch steps and reviewed everything they’d gone through the past two weeks. He didn’t understand her adversity toward his therapist. If Emma hadn’t crawled beneath his skin, he wouldn’t have needed to call the damn woman in the first place.He’d hated that.That first call he’d placed after so many months of rejecting therapy. The night he sat in the tiny office, Emma sleeping less than ten strides away, her scent twirling all around making him crazed, he’d picked up the phone and dialed a number he’d sworn never to use again.Psychobabble wouldn’t help him, he knew. But it was the fear that his emotions might possibly damage Emma that forced his hand. He’d never considered her reaction, that she’d hate his weakness.“Mr. Connor?” Stone turned and smiled at Sally Haven. Her heart shaped face, too serious eyes, and outward demeanor of an old lady, snuck beneath the dangerous trip wire around his heart. This five year-old needed to be a child. But, her parents didn’t quite see that.“What’s up Sally?”“Um, I was wondering if I might be of some assistance in, um, carving the pumpkins.”“Sure thing, kiddo. Which one do you want?”“I can choose my own?”“Of course. Just don’t make the face too hard for me to carve.”“Oh,” she said softly. “I wouldn’t know how to make a face.”Stone narrowed his eyes and absorbed the way she shuffled from foot to foot, her hands twisting in time to her words.“Have you ever helped carve a pumpkin?”“Well, no. But I’d like to try.”“What about trick-or-treating?”Little Sally hung her head and shook it slowly. “My parents don’t believe in candy.”“Well then, little girl,” Stone stood and swung her up onto his shoulders, smiling at her shrieks of mock terror. “You’re on vacation which means you’re about to have the best darned Halloween ever.”He performed a mad gallop around the driveway, through the barn and back to the porch. Settling her back on her feet, Stone nodded to the house. “Go put on some old clothes and let your Mom know you’ll be out here with me. We’ll carve these babies then light them up on Halloween.”“Okay, Mr. Connor. I’ll be back.” Sally dashed into the resort, calling for her mother.Stone turned back to the drive, walking thoughtfully around the Jeep. He’d seen Emma down by the gate arguing with Nate. Torn between ignoring his father and protecting the woman he loved, he didn’t know whether or not to interrupt them. Emma didn’t see the truth, didn’t know the animal that lurked beneath his father’s calm demeanor.Making a decision, he walked slowly across the pasture. He’d be out of sight, but within a quick jog should she need his help. *** “I can’t believe you’ve shut down Clover.” Nate’s face flushed crimson as he continued to scream the same thing over and over at her.Once more, she attempted to reason with him. “It’s for the best. Why continue throwing good money after bad? The last report indicated no chance of survival.”“You don’t know that.” His voice rang loudly, laced with an anger she’d never witnessed before.“He’s my father, dammit.”“And you’ve just sentenced him to death.”Emma inhaled sharply. “How could you say that? The minute you brought that little speck of evidence to my attention, I’ve moved Heaven and Earth to discover the truth.”“Why’re you suddenly giving up? I don’t understand this.”“I’m not giving up. I’m being realistic. My father’s dead and nothing I can do will bring him back.”“He’s not dead, and if the roles were reversed he’d go to his grave searching for you.” Nate stepped forward and pointed a shaking finger in her face. “No matter how much money it took.”Emma blanched. Was he right? By doing as Stone asked and ending Clover’s overseas investigations, was she killing her father all over again. Nate pressed closer.“You can’t shut down Clover.”“I have to.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, and she stepped back, away from the angry accusation pouring from Nate’s eyes. It’s the right choice, she told herself silently. Stone’s flesh and blood. My father’s a ghost.The evidence Nate brought her five years ago never panned out. Every tie leading back to that cryptic message went nowhere. The last report received from Clover indicated they’d discovered Hugh Gallagher’s grave, and it apparently contained his remains.She shouldn’t be struggling with this decision.It’s time to move on.“It’s your conscience you’ll be dealing with, Emma. You’ll be the one responsible for burying your father down the line. How do you think that will feel? Knowing he’d been rotting in jail for years while you played mistress to my son?”Emma bit her lip, struggling against the tears. His words knifed her heart, spurting forth guilt and anger all mixed together in a whirlpool of hurt. “That comment was uncalled for,” she said in a soft voice. “Don’t come here anymore until you’ve calmed down. You’ve no right to speak to me that way.”“I owe him my life, Emma.”“He’s gone, Nate. Accept it.” She softened her voice reached for the man who’d raised her. “You don’t owe him anymore. You’ve taken care of me and helped me be the person I am today.”Nate backed away, his gaze burning fiercely. “All I’ve done is hide you and look at the damage that’s created.”His words stinging, she turned and headed up the drive, her heart ripped and bleeding. *** Stone stepped from the shadows and held an arm out to prevent his father from following Emma.“Stone…” Nate said quietly, turning his attention from Emma’s retreating form.“It’s time to leave.”“You don’t understand…”Stone shook his head. “If that isn’t a line I know well. I’m not a little boy anymore, and I damn well do understand. Get off my property.”“You can’t let her do this.”“Do what?”“Shut down Clover.”“What’s Clover to you?” Stone knew about Nate’s interest. It’d bothered him that Emma’s relationship with his father extended beyond River Run, beyond the fact that he’d been a surrogate father. An emotional tie of a phone call every now and then to check on one another seemed far less invasive to Stone than the fact they were in business together. He knew she’d never force Nate out of her life the same way he knew he’d never allow him in to his.“It’s my chance for redemption.”Stone laughed bitterly.“Fine,” Nate said. “I don’t expect you to understand. Do this for Emma then. It’s everything to her. Damn it, Stone, don’t you see? Emma’s doing what she always does. She puts everyone else’s lives and loves before her own.”“I’m not following you and, honestly, I don’t think I care. Now, leave.”“She loves you.”Stone glared at his father. “It’s no concern of yours.”“It is when she’s sacrificing her life…her needs.”“Maybe,” Stone spoke slowly, opening the gate and shoving his father through. “You’d better explain what you mean by that.”“By protecting you and River Run, she’s committing her father to death.”Stone frowned. “Nice try at attempting to invoke more self-doubt, Nate. Her father’s already dead.”“No. He’s not. Ask Emma. She’ll explain all about Clover’s investigations. Then tell her you don’t care and let her find her father. Let her put her own needs above yours.”“I’ve heard enough lies from you old man. You’re more delusional than I thought. Get off my land.”Stone slammed the gate shut, locking it tightly. He didn’t glance at his father again, but jogged up the drive. Afternoon loomed ahead and pumpkins called. A few hours of innocent chatting with little kids and mindless carving of a holiday tradition sounded damn fine to him. He squashed the uncomfortable doubt that tugged at him.Certainly Emma wouldn’t put the best interests of River Run over her father? Would she? *** After calming her inner turmoil and washing away the remnants of tears, Emma headed to the picnic table out back. She paused and watched in amazement.Stone sat between little Sally Haven and her older brother, Matthew. The two children chattered away, digging their small hands into the depths of the opened pumpkins. Piles of seeds and mush scattered the table, the children, and Stone.She inhaled sharply as he turned his head to laugh at something Sally said. He appeared happy. Emma wanted him to act like that with her, unreserved, carefree…alive. The mixed signals drove her nuts. One second, he flirted and tossed her burning gazes full of want and desire…the next, his eyes iced over, pushing her away and declaring his distance.It’s time, she thought. Time for honesty.Emma smiled as she headed for the picnic table. She’d seen the results of Stone’s handiwork for the afternoon. The youngest children were finished with their pumpkins and now lay napping within their parent’s room. River Run’s guests lounged before crackling fires, shooting pool and thoroughly enjoying the respite granted them by the impromptu pumpkin carving project.Stooping for a quick pat and quiet word with Pocahontas, she shivered as a chill breeze swooped across the pasture. Stone rose from the table, making room for her to sit between the last remaining children.“Here,” he said, stripping off his jean jacket and wrapping it around her shoulders. “Who dressed you this morning?”The children giggled, and she rolled her eyes in an exaggerated display of disdain. “Certainly not you.”Stone’s eyes darkened and the brief flare of passion sent her breath racing after the brisk breeze. “I’m contemplating changing that.”“My Mommy dresses my Daddy every morning,” Sally piped in. “She says he’s blinded by color.”Emma laughed and settled comfortably between the children. “Sally, what kind of face are you making?”“I want a happy face,” the little girl said.“She’s such a baby,” Matthew interrupted. “I told Mr. Connor I want a scary pumpkin. One with fangs and horns.”“Horns? My, aren’t we creative. I think I’m going to help Sally and carve her a happy face.”The light banter and distraction created by the children aided in calming the tingles of awareness coursing the length of her body. Stone sat across from her, their knees touching beneath the narrow wooden table, each movement a friction sparking flashes of desire. They worked in silence, answering the children but not one another.She couldn’t look up. Every glance into his wanting eyes pushed her closer to blurting out her demands. And that definitely wouldn’t be proper in front of the Haven kids. Emma stopped all movement. Stone’s foot tickled her shin then moved slowly upward. Her eyes flew up to meet his bemused expression and a treacherous grin tugged at his mouth.“Hi,” he said softly.“What?” She couldn’t think. His touch ignited all sorts of inappropriate responses from her body.“Hi.”“Hi yourself.” Emma frowned and bent her head to hide the crimson flush she knew crept at an alarming rate from her neck to the roots of her hair.“I figured I’d better remind you that I’m over here.”Damn him. His foot continued massaging her leg. “Trust me, I know you’re there.”“I don’t think so.”Emma added the final touch to Sally’s pumpkin and turned the carving around for the little girl’s approval. Sally squealed in delight“Can I go show my Mommy?”“Sure,” Emma answered. “But be careful not to drop it.” Helping Sally lift the fat ball, she made sure the little girl could carry it easily. Matthew traipsed behind his sister, proudly displaying his own creation.Suddenly they were alone. No children to buffer the uncomfortable silence.Stone reached over and grabbed her hands pulling her across the narrow table so her face was barely an inch from his.“I’m tired of dancing.”“Excuse me?”“You heard me. I’m done shuffling awkwardly around this house, snuggling close then hopping backward every time the phone rings. I want you beside me as a partner and in my bed as a lover.” He released her hand and cupped her cheek. “Don’t turn away. I know you feel the same. I see it in your eyes.”Emma inhaled and plunged forward certain her accusations were about to put an end to this ridiculous discussion.“What about your girlfriend?”“My what?” He honestly appeared shocked. He must think her an idiot.“You know, deep, sexy voice on the other end of the phone. Are you willing to give her up? Because I don’t share well.”“Me neither, but I’m willing to try.”“What’s that supposed to mean?”“I have to accept your attachment to my father, and you’ll have to accept my need for a therapist every now and then. Trust me, I don’t give a bat’s flip about myself, but I need to make sure I don’t hurt you or anyone else for that matter. It’s a weakness, I know.” Stone released her and stood up from the table. He glanced at the sky then shot his steel blue gaze down straight into her soul. “But I don’t care. I’m going to fight for us. I’m going to make you understand that we’ve something special here.Emma wasn’t certain how to respond. “Your therapist?”Stone paused his nervous movements and stared at her. “I can’t promise I won’t hurt you. I’m not good at caring. But I can guarantee you there’s no one else in my bed...or in my heart. You’re it. I’ve crossed the finish line. I’m done running.”Picking up a handful of seeds that dripped with stringy pulp, she turned and ignored the don’t-you-dare look that crossed Stone’s eyes. Emma stood, cast one last glance at a face she loved dearly, and smeared the soggy mess from his forehead to his chin. He choked, sputtered and grabbed her waist. “Oh no, you don’t,” Emma said, muffling her giggles and snatching another handful of gunk. This time she dropped it down his shirt and watched his face turn deep red as her palm smashed and crushed the wet slop against his skin. “I have weeks of misery to hand you. I can’t believe how stupid I’ve been. I should have just asked.”“Yep, you shoulda.” Stone stood abruptly, swooped her up in his arms and held her tightly against his sodden chest. He grinned, her stomach fluttered with a million feather swipes of hope and desire. Bits of pumpkin clumped in his hair, and he reeked like day old garbage.“You stink.”His chest rumbled, and she couldn’t prevent her answering laughter. “I’m sorry,” he finally said, placing a sticky kiss on her cheek and nuzzling her neck. She didn’t care. It felt wonderful and delicious.“You need a shower.”Stone paused, the smile slipping from his face. He held her gaze, his eyes burning with emotion. “Not without you.” His words challenged, taunting her to turn her back…retreat into indifference. Replay all their past dances.“Then I’m glad you’re staying in your suite.” She watched the cloud of doubt snake across his eyes, and smiled a sly grin. “My bathroom is way too small for us.”His arms relaxed, and she slid slowly to the ground feeling every inch of his tight body. Stone wrapped his hands within her hair, pulling her face roughly to his. A harsh whisper caressed her ears. “You try my patience.” His lips locked on her mouth, and the world disappeared, tumbling into a vacuum of white clouds and hot breath.When he released her, Emma grabbed his arm to steady herself. Her knees trembled. But she didn’t care. This man knocked her world upside down and that’s all that mattered. “Time for that shower?” she said, walking backward and raising her eyebrows.“You betcha.” He lunged for her, and she ran laughing across the yard, making a bee-line for his suite. With a quick mental tally, Emma knew that Sunday meant pizza night for the resort guests. Her responsibilities were done for the day. *** Emma slipped through the French doors and stopped. Inhaling the pure masculine scent of Stone’s suite, she realized with a start it belonged to him. She’d always held out for the time when she’d be able to reclaim these rooms. Now, all she wanted involved the man standing behind her.“What?” he said. His voice hitched, as if he were afraid she’d change her mind.“I…” Emma turned then frowned. The look on his face silenced the rest of her words. “What’s the matter?”His eyes glistened brightly in the late afternoon light and a muscle twitched above his left cheek. “You’re so beautiful.” Stone’s voice remained soft, but his intentions were clear.“Wow, you had me scared for moment.” She swore if she weren’t attempting to control her legs, her knees would knock together.“Scared?” He walked past her and flipped on the bathroom light. “Yes, I think you should be scared.” Stopping beyond the door, he turned and held his hand out to her. “There’s no turning back now O’Malley…you’re mine.” Everything inside her melted then curled into a tight ball of desire. Her mind couldn’t keep up with her heart. Emotions hot and fast poured through her nerves, sparking and flaring a passionate storm that blanketed all doubts, all reserve.Her lips curved, and she tilted her head. Slipping the jean jacket off her shoulders, Emma allowed it to fall to her feet. With quick precise moves, she removed her shoes and socks then allowed her fingers to lazily unbutton the flannel shirt she wore. Stone’s hand dropped to his side, and he gazed intently into her face.Discarding the shirt, Emma slipped out of her jeans. Stone’s nostrils flared and he leaned against the doorjamb, crossing his arms. The heat lighting his eyes spurred her pulse into rapid fire.She rested her right hand between her breasts and slowly released her bra clasp. He inhaled sharply as satin lace glided to the floor. Emma walked forward, stepping into his arms with the grace of an eagle returning home. His hands grazed her skin, hot, insistent, possessive. Her arms snaked up, twining around his neck. “I’m not scared anymore.”“I am.” Stone dropped his head and laced a trail of fiery kisses from her neck to her shoulder. His hands burned paths of liquid fire as he raked his fingers across her back. He lightly traced the fading bruises that scattered her left shoulder, placing a circle of tender kisses over the yellowed patches.The piercing sound of a ringing phone stilled them both.“If you dare answer that,” he threatened. “I’ll toss you back in the lake.”She shook her head, standing on tiptoes and whispered in his ear. “Promise you won’t regret this.”“Woman, that’s a promise easy to keep.” Yanking her through the door, he slammed it shut, closing out the incessant trill.Emma laughed as he tossed his shirt on the floor, leaving him bare-chested and clad only in jeans. Her eyes followed the cluster of tight curls that surrounded his nipples then drew together in a thin line, dipping down beyond his waistband. She reached out and snapped open his top button.Her hand shook, and she swore if she inhaled her chest would explode. She’d never wanted a man like the one that stood before her. Steel blue eyes burned bright and hot, expecting…demanding. He cocked his head and winked.Stone padded to the shower and turned it on. He glanced at her sheepishly. “You’re gonna have to wait one more second before I perform the duties you so eloquently demanded. I’m a bit sticky.”She slipped out of her panties and stepped beneath the steaming water. “I’ll scrub.”“Emma, you’re killin’ me.” He discarded his jeans and this time she inhaled sharply.“I think I’m scared again.”He leaned forward, snaking his hand behind her head and bringing his lips down onto hers for a tender kiss. “Too late, sugar.” He said softly, running his tongue gently against her teeth. “You and I are about to take a long walk down discovery lane.” *** She smelled like jasmine and honey. He couldn’t catch his breath, it hitched and tightened in his chest. Stone figured his heart might break through his skin at any second. Its rapid pounding mirrored the desire slamming around his gut in waves of exquisite pain, wreaking havoc with his attempts at maintaining an even keel.All his fantasies didn’t come close to the beauty of Emma standing beneath streaming water. His finger followed a trickle of water as it snaked from her shoulder, between her breasts and past her belly button. She gasped as he touched and searched, feeling her heat, amazed at her response to him.She rubbed her hands lightly across his chest, soaping off the last remnants of pumpkin mash. Each touch sent bolts of desire pounding into his gut. Trying to slow his need, he chuckled at the memory of her anger and its consequences. If all his stupidity met with such pleasurable punishment, then he figured he must be in heaven.“Why are you laughing?”He nibbled her ear. She gasped, her nostrils flaring. “You covered me with pumpkin mash,” he said, his tone rough with want. Stone fought against dragging her up and burying himself mindlessly in her. This experience needed to be special. He touched her lips gently and slipped into the passion without fear or doubt, only love. *** They lay nestled beneath the warmth of his covers. Emma’s head rested upon his shoulder and the peace her closeness afforded twisted Stone’s heart. He didn’t know what to do with this love.“Hungry?” he asked.She snuggled closer, then snaked a slender leg over his, crawling on top. She smelled like him, musky and earthy. He’d stamped every corner of her body with his scent, asserting his ownership. “Yep.” Her lips caressed his skin as she scattered gentle kisses up his neck and nibbled his ear.“I meant for food.” He laughed and seized her mouth, inhaling her passion and answering ten-fold. “If we’re to do this another half dozen times then I need to be energized.”Her stomach rumbled loudly and Emma broke the kiss, smiling wickedly. “I suppose we could take a break for nourishment.”“I’ll be right back.” He slipped from the warmth of his bed and tucked the covers around her. Pulling on his jeans, he padded out of the bedroom and into his living room.An antique roll top desk sat beside the door. A pile of documents caught his eye, and he stopped before leaving the room.He prayed when the time came Emma would choose what her heart demanded and not what she thought she should do. That she would, as his father put it, not seek to fill other people’s needs, ignoring her own.Taking the stack of papers and sliding them into the desk drawer, his fingers outlined the embossed lettering. Slamming the drawer shut, he tried to ignore the fear that seared his skin. He turned his thoughts back to Emma and away from the future. Away from the Contract of Sale.",

      "content": "Chapter Ten “No.” That single word ripped from Stone’s lips with the savagery of a jagged knife. Emma snuggled closer and murmured comforting words. His head tossed, she soothed, he slept.It’d been like this for the past eight weeks. Each night spent together pulled them closer yet created an ache deep within her soul which grew stronger every moment his nightmares escalated their intensity. And this week’s midnight trips to hell ranked high on Emma’s top ten list of places she’d never want to visit.How do I fix this? Running her palm down his back, she smoothed tense muscles and traced her finger along the multiple scars that decorated his skin in a macabre crossword puzzle. How egotistical of her to believe her love could heal his wounds. It wasn’t that simple. These rivers of black ran with a current she didn’t understand, and it frightened her.A vicious gust of wind slammed into the French doors, rattling the pane and signaling another winter storm. Emma slipped from beneath the covers and tugged Stone’s sweatshirt over her naked body. It dropped just above her knees, and she rubbed her arms in an attempt to draw faded heat from the aged fabric. Shoving her feet into his penguin sized sneakers, she shuffled across the floor.Emma reached the fireplace and stacked a fresh round of kindling and seasoned oak on the grate. No guests, a winter storm, and Stone. She smiled at the thought of a lazy morning tucked tightly within his embrace. Tossing a match onto the kindling, she watched as flames burst into life.“The dress code at River Run this morning is exceedingly provocative.”Emma turned and gazed openly at him. He rested on one elbow, the sheets dropping past his hips, barely covering the promise his eyes held.“Really?”“Can’t say I have no inclination to discover exactly what that ratty sweatshirt’s covering.”“Same thing you’ve been discovering the past two months.”Stone grinned then shook his head slowly. “Every time there’s something new, something wonderful.”Emma’s heart caught. She knew exactly how he felt and wondered, if by a miracle, he might love her even half as much as she loved him. It’d be enough.“Well then, Marco Polo, let’s see what treasures you can find this morning.” Tossing off his shirt and shoes in one quick movement, she dove for the bed.Stone caught her as she landed beneath the covers, pulling her hard against him and devouring her mouth in a hungry kiss. Her mind blurred beneath his passion. A thought flickered then dimmed as his hands touched and caressed, burning against her skin. Is this love or a need to banish the nightmares? *** “No.”This time, Stone’s voice hinged on exasperation. Emma moved swiftly around the kitchen, the rich aroma of fresh brewed coffee wafted from the steaming cup she held between her hands.“People expect it,” she said for the umpteenth time that morning.“Why are you pressing me?” Stone sat behind the counter, an angry flush creeping up his neck. They’d been arguing about the annual holiday party for the past week. He refused to allow Emma to continue a tradition Margaret began more than fifty years ago.“Because, without Margaret, this holiday’s gonna be tough on a lot of people. They need the party to remember her and honor her.”“That’s a bunch of crap and you know it.” Stone pushed off the barstool and strode around the counter. He put her mug on the table, pulling her into a light embrace. “Stop trying to please everyone else and look to your own needs instead.”“I am, Stone.”“No. You’ve decided this is some twisted sense of duty. I won’t allow it. Emma, you need to start taking what you want and send the rest of the world packing.”“I want this.” She knew this battle was lost but tried one more time. “I really want this.”“Well,” he whispered against her ear. “I don’t.”Resigned to the fact that the annual holiday gala had met its destroyer, she slipped from Stone’s arms. “Fine. I’ve some things to do in the office. I’ll see you later.”Emma didn’t bother to look over her shoulder. She knew he’d be angry. But her inner voice wouldn’t be quiet, and if it demanded release, fireworks would begin within the comforting walls of River Run. And she didn’t want to fight. Actually, she suddenly realized, the past eight weeks she’d done everything in her power to avoid confrontations with Stone.Instead of entering the office, Emma went to her bedroom. Opening the closet, she pulled a hanger from the back recesses. A thick plastic cover hid what hung beneath. Margaret had bought this for Emma in the post-season sales that flooded the boutiques in early January. She’d hoped to wear it at the party this year.Peeling off the plastic, she touched the shimmering gown. Her fingers caressed the rich, velvet green then traced the pearl rimmed bodice and flared sleeves. She remembered Margaret’s face when she’d tried on the dress. She’d called her a fairy princess. An endearment her mother started the day Emma was born, words she remembered with love.Sighing deeply, she hung the dress back in the closet. The deep rumble of the Jeep’s engine signaled Stone’s departure. Emma gave in to impetuousness and grabbed the dress back. Taking off her jeans and sweater, she slipped the heavy fabric over her head adjusting the shoulders so they barely skimmed her skin.She twirled to face the mirror and froze.Stone stood in the doorway. Her heart hammered. She couldn’t contain the embarrassment at being found trying on clothes. Emma silently chastised herself for feeling like a kid being caught with all the cookies.“I’m just seeing if it still fits. I need to clean this closet and give all my old stuff to Goodwill.” Wincing, she knew she rambled.“The tag’s still on the dress.”“Oh? That…silly, it’s just a bargain piece I never should’ve picked up.”He stared at her for a long moment. His face unreadable, making her squirm beneath his icy gaze. Finally, he shrugged and backed out the door. “Whatever. I’m on my way into town to pick up thick stationary.”“What for?”“We can’t have a party without invitations, can we?” *** Stone sped down the gravel drive. He should never have left the Jeep. The vision of Emma dressed in that gown completely unraveled his resolve. He’d gone to her room to demand she cease all topics regarding the holiday bash and instead ended up agreeing to host the stupid event.It wasn’t until that instant when she’d turned, her auburn hair spinning in a soft halo that he realized exactly how deep his feelings ran. She’d quickly become his life, and he found it hard to deny her anything, including the opportunity of wearing a gown that transformed a beautiful woman into a radiant treasure more alluring and breathtaking than King Solomon’s mines. *** Emma sat before the roaring fire, snuggling beneath a thick wool blanket. The tantalizing scent of garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and olives wafted from the kitchen. Her brain whirled in a frantic circle, checking and rechecking all the preparations for tomorrow night’s party.Stone was wonderful. After balking only once at the guest list, he’d buckled down and run every errand she requested. The only oil stain on the event poured from his refusal to permit Nate to attend. He’d made her promise, several times over, that his father wouldn’t be allowed to step foot on River Run. She’d agreed, but not without guilt tugging at the frayed edges of her heart.A frigid blast of air preceded the slamming of the front door. Emma twisted around and smiled as Stone stomped his snowy boots on the large, woven door matt then dumped an armful of packages on the kitchen table. He muttered and cursed beneath his breath, causing her to rise from the couch and explore the situation.“What’s the matter?”“It’s damn cold out there.” He stripped off his fleece lined denim jacket and rubbed his hands together.“Here, let me do that.” Emma gathered his hands and slipped them beneath her shirt. She shivered as their coldness tickled her skin but ignored the sensation and wrapped her arms around his neck. He grinned and pulled her close, seizing her mouth in one of his famous mind-sweeping kisses.A grunt and snuffle around her ankles pulled Emma’s attention away from the path her ever-present, over-heated hormones were taking her. Glancing down, she smiled at Pocahontas.“What’s she doing in here?”“It’s too cold in the barn. I’ve shut all the doors and battened the stall windows, but it’s still too cold for her. I found her shivering in her pen.”That frightened Emma. Normally, Pokey weathered the winter fine. She knelt and stroked the pig’s head and neck. Everything seemed okay-clear eyes, perky ears, same disgusting slobber decorating her nose.“I’ll make a bed for her in the laundry room.” Emma stood and kissed Stone passionately. “Thank you.”His face suddenly flushed bright pink. “You’re welcome.”He stepped over the pig and went directly to the bar. “I think I’ll have a glass of wine. Care for one?”“Need you ask? Dinner’s almost done. I’ll tuck in Pokey then we can review the final checklist for the party.”“I’d rather not.” Stone’s tone sounded strained, and she turned to look at him carefully. There were tight lines around his mouth detailing a strong running emotion floating beneath his carefully masked reserve. “What’s up?”“We need to talk.”“That sounds ominous.”His lips curved up in a half smile. “Not nearly as ominous as Porkahontas’s mean streak.”“Don’t joke. What’s wrong?”“Nothing that can’t be dealt with.” He turned away, preventing her from reading what flashed in his eyes. “Go put Porkie to bed.”“Okay,” she said softly, her insides shredding into tiny shards of hot fire. This was it. He couldn’t handle her or her demands any longer. The party must’ve tipped the scales, forced him back into the hole he loved to bury himself within.He’s going to leave.Thoughts of River Run without Stone dominated her mind. She absently laid a comforter on the floor of the laundry room for Pocahontas then tossed an old pillow and blanket next to it. The pig grunted, snuggled into the downy pile and closed her eyes with a soft sigh of appreciation. Emma knelt next to her, covering her up and rubbing a hand along her side.“What am I to do?”Pokey didn’t answer. Emma stood and decided she’d better face the beast or else a serious bout of brooding threatened to erupt. Leaving the solace of her old friend, she stopped in the kitchen to check the status of dinner. The roast steamed and she pulled it out of the oven to allow it to finish the final stages of cooking.She could feel Stone hovering behind her.“Here’s your wine.”“Thanks,” she said, turning to accept the glass.Their eyes connected and a shiver ran through her entire system. He reached a hand across the slick granite surface separating them, and she reached back. Their fingers twined. He tugged her toward him, their bodies bent over the countertop placing their faces less than an inch apart.“I need you,” he said hoarsely.Her breath hitched. She suddenly understood the heart-in-throat analogy because words wouldn’t come. Emma felt tears burn the back of her eyes and blinked them away. “Are…are you leaving?” she finally managed to blurt out. His intense eyes floated with all sorts of emotions that were impossible to label.“Someday.” Stone leaned closer, kissing her gently. “But not today.” He kissed her once more. “And when I go,” his tongue flicked out, teasing her mouth open. She inhaled his scent, welcoming the sweet invasion. “I hope I won’t be alone.”Emma swallowed then broke the kiss, banking the desire curled deep within her core. “What are you saying Stone?”She slipped her hand from his and walked around the counter to stand before him. He gazed down into her face, stroking her cheek with his knuckle.“I don’t know what I’m saying. But I know what I’m feeling.”“What’s that?” her heart paused, waiting, praying for three little words that would release the killing grip on her soul.“Like someone crawling out of the devil’s hole and grasping the wing of an angel. And you’re that angel, Emma. You’re my ticket back to life.”She didn’t try to stop the tears that welled then fell in a hot stream down her cheek. It wasn’t a declaration of love, but it rang true enough for her.“I love you, Stone.” Her heart stopped, and she couldn’t meet his eyes. Glancing beyond him, she focused on the milky-white moon cresting the jagged peaks of the Tetons. It cast a soft blue glow on the snow-capped ridge, sending waving fingers of shadowed light down toward the valley. She kept waiting for the cold touch of that ethereal hand to enter River Run and squeeze her soul into nothingness, to kill her hope.She felt his touch instead.A tentative stroke on her cheek, then a stronger pressure forcing her to look into his eyes. The light in the room shrank beneath the darkened evening, and she cursed her thoughtlessness at not switching on any lamps. She couldn’t read his face. “We’ve a lot to work through, Emma. That’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.”This is his response to my soul bearing declaration? She was stunned. “Such as?” Disappointment caused a harsh edge to her words. Emma retreated from Stone’s touch and slipped around him. She flipped on low wattage lamps and lit a myriad of candles scattered around the kitchen and living room.A fire crackled warmly in the hearth. Stone sighed in exasperation and strode over to stoke the burning logs, coaxing the flames higher before he added more seasoned wood. “This isn’t easy for me,” he said.“What isn’t? Obviously, you hold the upper hand because I’ve no clue what’s eating at you.” He stepped away from the hearth and turned a cold gaze in her direction.“No clue?”“No.” She swallowed past the lump in her throat and stood her ground.“I feel your touch on my skin every night. Calming, soothing, attempting to erase my nightmares. Until I’m able to forget the past, Emma, I don’t see how I can have a future.”The pieces of the puzzle were beginning to come together. She stepped toward him. He wasn’t rejecting her, he was rejecting himself. “You’ll never be able to forget, Stone. It’s not possible. What you have to do is remember…not just the pain, but the happiness as well. In time, the bad does fade and the days become greater between sadness. Each year,” she touched his arm and forced his attention. “I welcome January 1st not because it’s a new year but because it marks more time between the day my heart died and the present.” She shrugged. “It helps. Maybe, if you tell me about it and release some of that guilt…that might help, too.”“I can’t. It’s classified.” He turned away from her and stared into the flickering flames. “I can tell you I killed my men. I led them into an ambush, and they were massacred. Every last one of them…except for me.”He ran his hand over his chin as if looking for the beard he’d shaved away in summer. He’d used it as cover, Emma thought. Hiding from a face he didn’t want to see. “Stone?”He turned, his eyes tortured with memories she could only guess at.“Tell me about the men that died that day. I want to know their names, where they came from, who they were.”“Who they were?” He shook his head in disgust. “They were damn fine soldiers.”She smiled. “The best of the best?”“You betcha. Our team incorporated the highest trained, most lethal squad of Rangers.”She nodded and walked to his side. Placing her hand in his, she stroked his fingers gently. He responded by pulling her close and kissing the top of her head.“It seems to me that a team as deadly as your Ranger squad should certainly have all the right qualifications to think independently under adverse conditions.”“Of course,” he said, his muscles tightening in defense.“Then would you please explain to me why you feel that you’re the only one responsible for the death of this highly trained, elite squad of soldiers?”“I…”“Did you have all the pertinent facts for this mission?” Emma persisted; not giving him a chance to retreat from what she prayed was an attack in the right direction.“I can’t answer that.”“Did you knowingly waltz into enemy territory with the prime objective of obliterating your squad?” Harsh words, harsh reality.“Of course not.”“Did you fire a bullet into the heads of your men?”“Damn, Emma…you know I’d never do something like that.” He hissed the words, narrowing his eyes in defense.“Yes,” she said softly. “I know. Just like I know you’d never willingly endanger anyone. Mistakes, bad judgment of superior officers, poor information, whatever it was, I know in my heart and in my mind, that it wasn’t you. You didn’t kill your men. Circumstances did.” She scrutinized his face. The muscle above his right cheekbone twitched, and his eyes glistened with unshed tears. “Circumstances beyond your control.”He gathered her tightly against his chest. She inhaled his scent, wrapped her arms around his neck and ran her fingers through his hair. Stone held on, she could feel the heat of his tears against her hair and knew her own stream of sorrow dampened his neck.Emma didn’t know how to bridge his hurt, how to heal his wounds. If he couldn’t move forward, beyond this well of grief, then she agreed with him. They didn’t have a future. She wouldn’t accept anything less than love from Stone Connor. And if he didn’t love himself, he’d never learn to love her. Because she loved him with a greater passion than the majestic sweep of the Grand Tetons, and she knew that over time, he’d resent that. His back would turn and he’d leave…away from her, away from love.He released her, cleared his throat and moved quickly past her into the dark recesses of his suite. Emma let him go. Sinking into the sofa, she buried her face in her hands and wept. *** The house closed in around Stone. He tugged on his boots and thick woolen sweater, exiting through the French doors. Pausing on his deck, he stared into the night allowing the bitter cold to numb his face and freeze his turbulent emotions.The full moon cast a ghostly sheen on the meadow. Quaking aspens shivered and rubbed their branches together in an eerie symphony. A pack of coyotes howled, and he watched their shadows race across a distant field. His breath caught when he realized the beauty of the surroundings were seeping into his soul, soothing, calming, warming.She’d done this.Emma brought light into his darkness, laughter into his sorrow.I love you.Her whispered words caressed his tortured mind. Did she? Or in some twisted sense of need, were her emotions clinging to him for safety and security?Seamus Adams. They’d been unsuccessful at cramping his campaign and the last conversation with Lazarus, his government inside man, confirmed the Irishman’s frontal assault against all remaining factions of Hugh Gallagher’s organization. Unsettling reports of deadly elimination tactics troubled Stone.He knew what needed to be done.A trip back to hell needed to be made, a quest of freedom…for Emma, for himself.His resolve reaffirmed, he entered the suite. Tossing his sweater on the edge of the bed, he strode to the phone and dialed a number burned into his memory decades ago.A computer voice requested his identification. He gave it and waited while internal security granted access and connected him with Lazarus.“Stone, my man, I’ve been waiting for your call.” A deep gruff voice rumbled through the phone line. If he’d never met Lazarus, Stone could imagine a large, bear of a man sitting behind a desk. But, he’d be wrong. Lazarus more than likely paced the room in short ferret strides, indigenous to his slight physique. His slender form, however, carried an intelligence trusted by men as high as the President.“What’cha got?”“This is tricky. You sure you want in?”“Yeah.”“You know it comes with a price.”“Whatever.”“Stone, you’ll have to go in one more time. Do you understand?”“Yes, dammit. I understand.”A deep sigh reached his ears, and he could almost imagine Lazarus tapping a pencil against his desk. “Can you handle another trip into those jungles?”“I’ll do what I have to do.”“Okay. I’ll arrange it. But Stone…” Lazarus paused, and for a second Stone thought a denial was eminent. “She’d better be worth it.”“She is,” he said and hung up the phone.The pieces were on the board. It was time to start playing the game.",

      "content": "Chapter Ten “No.” That single word ripped from Stone’s lips with the savagery of a jagged knife. Emma snuggled closer and murmured comforting words. His head tossed, she soothed, he slept.It’d been like this for the past eight weeks. Each night spent together pulled them closer yet created an ache deep within her soul which grew stronger every moment his nightmares escalated their intensity. And this week’s midnight trips to hell ranked high on Emma’s top ten list of places she’d never want to visit.How do I fix this? Running her palm down his back, she smoothed tense muscles and traced her finger along the multiple scars that decorated his skin in a macabre crossword puzzle. How egotistical of her to believe her love could heal his wounds. It wasn’t that simple. These rivers of black ran with a current she didn’t understand, and it frightened her.A vicious gust of wind slammed into the French doors, rattling the pane and signaling another winter storm. Emma slipped from beneath the covers and tugged Stone’s sweatshirt over her naked body. It dropped just above her knees, and she rubbed her arms in an attempt to draw faded heat from the aged fabric. Shoving her feet into his penguin sized sneakers, she shuffled across the floor.Emma reached the fireplace and stacked a fresh round of kindling and seasoned oak on the grate. No guests, a winter storm, and Stone. She smiled at the thought of a lazy morning tucked tightly within his embrace. Tossing a match onto the kindling, she watched as flames burst into life.“The dress code at River Run this morning is exceedingly provocative.”Emma turned and gazed openly at him. He rested on one elbow, the sheets dropping past his hips, barely covering the promise his eyes held.“Really?”“Can’t say I have no inclination to discover exactly what that ratty sweatshirt’s covering.”“Same thing you’ve been discovering the past two months.”Stone grinned then shook his head slowly. “Every time there’s something new, something wonderful.”Emma’s heart caught. She knew exactly how he felt and wondered, if by a miracle, he might love her even half as much as she loved him. It’d be enough.“Well then, Marco Polo, let’s see what treasures you can find this morning.” Tossing off his shirt and shoes in one quick movement, she dove for the bed.Stone caught her as she landed beneath the covers, pulling her hard against him and devouring her mouth in a hungry kiss. Her mind blurred beneath his passion. A thought flickered then dimmed as his hands touched and caressed, burning against her skin. Is this love or a need to banish the nightmares? *** “No.”This time, Stone’s voice hinged on exasperation. Emma moved swiftly around the kitchen, the rich aroma of fresh brewed coffee wafted from the steaming cup she held between her hands.“People expect it,” she said for the umpteenth time that morning.“Why are you pressing me?” Stone sat behind the counter, an angry flush creeping up his neck. They’d been arguing about the annual holiday party for the past week. He refused to allow Emma to continue a tradition Margaret began more than fifty years ago.“Because, without Margaret, this holiday’s gonna be tough on a lot of people. They need the party to remember her and honor her.”“That’s a bunch of crap and you know it.” Stone pushed off the barstool and strode around the counter. He put her mug on the table, pulling her into a light embrace. “Stop trying to please everyone else and look to your own needs instead.”“I am, Stone.”“No. You’ve decided this is some twisted sense of duty. I won’t allow it. Emma, you need to start taking what you want and send the rest of the world packing.”“I want this.” She knew this battle was lost but tried one more time. “I really want this.”“Well,” he whispered against her ear. “I don’t.”Resigned to the fact that the annual holiday gala had met its destroyer, she slipped from Stone’s arms. “Fine. I’ve some things to do in the office. I’ll see you later.”Emma didn’t bother to look over her shoulder. She knew he’d be angry. But her inner voice wouldn’t be quiet, and if it demanded release, fireworks would begin within the comforting walls of River Run. And she didn’t want to fight. Actually, she suddenly realized, the past eight weeks she’d done everything in her power to avoid confrontations with Stone.Instead of entering the office, Emma went to her bedroom. Opening the closet, she pulled a hanger from the back recesses. A thick plastic cover hid what hung beneath. Margaret had bought this for Emma in the post-season sales that flooded the boutiques in early January. She’d hoped to wear it at the party this year.Peeling off the plastic, she touched the shimmering gown. Her fingers caressed the rich, velvet green then traced the pearl rimmed bodice and flared sleeves. She remembered Margaret’s face when she’d tried on the dress. She’d called her a fairy princess. An endearment her mother started the day Emma was born, words she remembered with love.Sighing deeply, she hung the dress back in the closet. The deep rumble of the Jeep’s engine signaled Stone’s departure. Emma gave in to impetuousness and grabbed the dress back. Taking off her jeans and sweater, she slipped the heavy fabric over her head adjusting the shoulders so they barely skimmed her skin.She twirled to face the mirror and froze.Stone stood in the doorway. Her heart hammered. She couldn’t contain the embarrassment at being found trying on clothes. Emma silently chastised herself for feeling like a kid being caught with all the cookies.“I’m just seeing if it still fits. I need to clean this closet and give all my old stuff to Goodwill.” Wincing, she knew she rambled.“The tag’s still on the dress.”“Oh? That…silly, it’s just a bargain piece I never should’ve picked up.”He stared at her for a long moment. His face unreadable, making her squirm beneath his icy gaze. Finally, he shrugged and backed out the door. “Whatever. I’m on my way into town to pick up thick stationary.”“What for?”“We can’t have a party without invitations, can we?” *** Stone sped down the gravel drive. He should never have left the Jeep. The vision of Emma dressed in that gown completely unraveled his resolve. He’d gone to her room to demand she cease all topics regarding the holiday bash and instead ended up agreeing to host the stupid event.It wasn’t until that instant when she’d turned, her auburn hair spinning in a soft halo that he realized exactly how deep his feelings ran. She’d quickly become his life, and he found it hard to deny her anything, including the opportunity of wearing a gown that transformed a beautiful woman into a radiant treasure more alluring and breathtaking than King Solomon’s mines. *** Emma sat before the roaring fire, snuggling beneath a thick wool blanket. The tantalizing scent of garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and olives wafted from the kitchen. Her brain whirled in a frantic circle, checking and rechecking all the preparations for tomorrow night’s party.Stone was wonderful. After balking only once at the guest list, he’d buckled down and run every errand she requested. The only oil stain on the event poured from his refusal to permit Nate to attend. He’d made her promise, several times over, that his father wouldn’t be allowed to step foot on River Run. She’d agreed, but not without guilt tugging at the frayed edges of her heart.A frigid blast of air preceded the slamming of the front door. Emma twisted around and smiled as Stone stomped his snowy boots on the large, woven door matt then dumped an armful of packages on the kitchen table. He muttered and cursed beneath his breath, causing her to rise from the couch and explore the situation.“What’s the matter?”“It’s damn cold out there.” He stripped off his fleece lined denim jacket and rubbed his hands together.“Here, let me do that.” Emma gathered his hands and slipped them beneath her shirt. She shivered as their coldness tickled her skin but ignored the sensation and wrapped her arms around his neck. He grinned and pulled her close, seizing her mouth in one of his famous mind-sweeping kisses.A grunt and snuffle around her ankles pulled Emma’s attention away from the path her ever-present, over-heated hormones were taking her. Glancing down, she smiled at Pocahontas.“What’s she doing in here?”“It’s too cold in the barn. I’ve shut all the doors and battened the stall windows, but it’s still too cold for her. I found her shivering in her pen.”That frightened Emma. Normally, Pokey weathered the winter fine. She knelt and stroked the pig’s head and neck. Everything seemed okay-clear eyes, perky ears, same disgusting slobber decorating her nose.“I’ll make a bed for her in the laundry room.” Emma stood and kissed Stone passionately. “Thank you.”His face suddenly flushed bright pink. “You’re welcome.”He stepped over the pig and went directly to the bar. “I think I’ll have a glass of wine. Care for one?”“Need you ask? Dinner’s almost done. I’ll tuck in Pokey then we can review the final checklist for the party.”“I’d rather not.” Stone’s tone sounded strained, and she turned to look at him carefully. There were tight lines around his mouth detailing a strong running emotion floating beneath his carefully masked reserve. “What’s up?”“We need to talk.”“That sounds ominous.”His lips curved up in a half smile. “Not nearly as ominous as Porkahontas’s mean streak.”“Don’t joke. What’s wrong?”“Nothing that can’t be dealt with.” He turned away, preventing her from reading what flashed in his eyes. “Go put Porkie to bed.”“Okay,” she said softly, her insides shredding into tiny shards of hot fire. This was it. He couldn’t handle her or her demands any longer. The party must’ve tipped the scales, forced him back into the hole he loved to bury himself within.He’s going to leave.Thoughts of River Run without Stone dominated her mind. She absently laid a comforter on the floor of the laundry room for Pocahontas then tossed an old pillow and blanket next to it. The pig grunted, snuggled into the downy pile and closed her eyes with a soft sigh of appreciation. Emma knelt next to her, covering her up and rubbing a hand along her side.“What am I to do?”Pokey didn’t answer. Emma stood and decided she’d better face the beast or else a serious bout of brooding threatened to erupt. Leaving the solace of her old friend, she stopped in the kitchen to check the status of dinner. The roast steamed and she pulled it out of the oven to allow it to finish the final stages of cooking.She could feel Stone hovering behind her.“Here’s your wine.”“Thanks,” she said, turning to accept the glass.Their eyes connected and a shiver ran through her entire system. He reached a hand across the slick granite surface separating them, and she reached back. Their fingers twined. He tugged her toward him, their bodies bent over the countertop placing their faces less than an inch apart.“I need you,” he said hoarsely.Her breath hitched.

Emma felt tears burn the back of her eyes and blinked them away. “Are…are you leaving?” she finally managed to blurt out.

It wasn’t a declaration of love, but it rang true enough for her.“I love you, Stone.” Her heart stopped, and she couldn’t meet his eyes. Glancing beyond him, she focused on the milky-white moon cresting the jagged peaks of the Tetons.

      "content": "Chapter Eleven “Where were you last night?”Emma looked up from the computer. Stone appeared rumpled and haggard, the bags beneath his eyes a deep purple.“I thought we needed some space.” Her heart hurt. Maybe it’d be better to end things now, before either of them became more emotionally involved.“I don’t need space.” He leaned his hip on the edge of the desk and bent to peer intently into her face. “I need you.”“I need space.”“It’s like that is it?”“Yes, it’s like that.” Her voice dropped to a mere whisper, and she battled against her blurring vision. Turning her attention back to the final checklist that brightened her computer screen, she ignored Stone and the tears that wanted to spill.“Look who’s running now.” He stood, shook his head and left the office, his words hanging in the air. Emma wanted to run. She wanted to race into his arms, have him tell her everything would be fine, have him tell her he loved her. Have him tell her anything but the self-damning pain he’d shared last night.She’d been through this before. Guilt over surviving that tarred a soul until it remained encased in a walking coffin. Breathing, talking but not living. Nate Connor did that. She’d witnessed his hatred, listened to him spew about the unjust, watched as he escaped into the depths of whiskey hell.Too drunk to care, not drunk enough to forget.Well, she wasn’t drunk. She wasn’t willing to waste her life being dragged into a pit full of self-loathing. Emma inhaled sharply. Her thoughts were taking her away from Stone, away from his love. She closed her eyes and rested the back of her head on the chair.Stone and Nate were closer in personality than either one of them wanted to admit. Maybe they needed to face each other, face their demons together.This refusal by Stone to admit his father to River Run itched at her more irritatingly than an angry rash.With a resolve she wasn’t at all comfortable with Emma picked up the phone and called Nate. *** The doorbell rang and both Emma and Stone raced to answer it.“Expecting someone?” she challenged.“This is my home,” he retaliated.“Your home?” Emma bit down on her next words, knowing they’d only exasperate the situation.He tilted his head and challenged her with a raised brow. “I own it.”“For how long?”Stone stepped back as if her words were a physical slap. “For as long as I deem necessary.”Deciding to end this line of discussion, Emma switched the subject. “You’ve never answered the door before.”“I guess I always figured you’d be here. Now, well, now I’m not so certain.”She glared at him, once more drowning the words she really wanted to say. “It’s probably only a delivery for the party tonight. Don’t waste your valuable self-hatred time on worrying about River Run.”He stared at her a moment then shook his head. “You win.” Stone backed off and allowed her to open the front door. She hated this bickering.“What’s he doing here?” Stone pushed her out of the way and ripped the door wide open to reveal an astonished Nate.“I was invited,” the elder Connor insisted.“By who?”“Emma.”Stone’s shocked expression lanced her heart. She knew immediately the grave mistake she’d made. “I thought maybe you two could talk.” Why did she call Nate? Everything about this screamed meddling and lack of support. She desperately wanted this rift to mend, but the look in Stone’s eyes told her this wasn’t the way to accomplish it.Stone covered his hurt with the steely gaze he’d worn the first few weeks at River Run. “When and if I ever choose to talk to my father, it’ll be done on my terms and my decision. You’ve no right.”“I know,” she admitted. “I’m sorry, I made a mistake.” Emma turned and faced another Connor with the same blue eyes and same hurt expression. She’d managed to pour a gallon of salt into this family’s open wound. “Please go Nate. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have called.”He nodded and retreated down the stairs. Emma bit back her tears. She loved him, the broken man who’d nursed her childish wounds and helped her face life with a stiff upper lip.But the man standing angrily behind her consumed her heart, owned her soul. She’d never be free of him, never.“What games are you playing, Emma?”She sighed. “I don’t know.” She turned and walked past Stone, heading back to her little corner of the estate. She didn’t want to fight. “It was poor judgment.”“Don’t walk away from me.” His tone stopped her, the anger clearly audible.“I’m sorry. In my own way, I was trying to help.”He reached her side in two strides, taking hold of her shoulders and spinning her around. She didn’t want to look, didn’t want to see the hurt her actions created.“What’re you sorry for? Dammit, look at me. What’re you sorry for?”She glanced up; the pain in his face forced the tears burning her eyes to fall and snake a hot path down her cheek. “I shouldn’t have called Nate. It’s just you’re both in a bad place, such a bad place, I thought that maybe you’d be able to help one another.”“My father belongs in hell and nothing you will ever do or say will change my feelings regarding that matter.”“That’s harsh. He’s not an evil man.”Stone shook his head. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. And right now I don’t particularly feel like sharing. Remember this and remember it well, that man isn’t to step foot on my property. Ever.”She swallowed and nodded. It didn’t take a degree in psychology to realize she couldn’t fix this problem, for either of them.“He’s not to have any part of what’s mine.”“Okay, I understand.”“That means you.”She felt sick. “Please don’t ask me to choose.”“Would I lose?” Stone stared at her, his words brittle and harsh in the silence of their surroundings. The pale rim around his mouth signaling the amount of emotion he held in check. Emma resisted the urge to lean forward, to brush away the stray lock of hair that highlighted his furious gaze.“Yes.” Her voice caught, tears strangling her ability to speak. Every inch of her body hurt as pieces of her heart crumpled and fell away.Emma pulled away from Stone and walked to her room. She stood in the doorway, attempting to process all the convoluted feelings tying her insides into knots. She felt rather than heard Stone’s presence behind her. His arms reached around her waist, pulling her back against his chest.Closing her eyes, her heart pounded loud enough to be heard on the other side of the Rockies. She turned within his embrace and rested her cheek against his chest.“I’m so sorry.” Her words were muffled as she buried her face in his shirt. He smelled wonderful and she wanted to stay here, within his arms, forever.“Hush, I know you are. Don’t cry.” He ran his hands up and down her back and whispered sweetly in her ear.“I can’t fix you.”“I don’t want you to.”“You can’t love me.”His hands paused, and he pulled back. Knuckling her chin, he forced her to look into his eyes. “Why do you say that?”“Because if you don’t love yourself, how can you love someone else? You’ll end up hating me, hating my love.”He grinned and shook his head. Bending down, his lips touched hers lightly. “I couldn’t ever hate you.” He deepened the kiss, running his tongue along her teeth then searching deeper. She melted into him, taking all he offered. Stone pulled her tightly against him, devouring her mouth, sparking an inferno of desire.“I’m so confused,” she said, when he allowed her a chance for air.“No more talk.” He pulled her shirt up and tugged it over her head. She gasped as cool air tickled her skin, causing goosebumps to sprinkle up her arms. Grinning, he snapped open the button to her jeans and slowly slid the zipper down. Emma closed her eyes and languished within the feel of his touch. His palm caressed her as he pushed her jeans down. In an instant she was naked, standing before him, ready and wanting. He stepped forward and laid her gently on the bed, wiping away her doubts as his head bent to kiss her tenderly. *** Emma listened to the commotion taking place in the kitchen. She snuggled closer to Stone, hesitant to break the tentative bond they’d put back in place.“Don’t you need to go direct or something?”“Probably,” she said. “But I’d much prefer to stay here and play with you.”His chest rumbled with laughter, and he pulled her closer. “I told you this party was a bad idea.”“Right now, I’d have to agree with you.”“Wow, I must’ve been extra good this time around.” He stroked her back and kissed the top of her head. She glanced up and smiled at the light in his eyes. She never wanted to see that steely look again.A knock on the door signaled an end to their privacy. “Stone?” Tilly’s muffled voice could be heard over the raucous activity of the kitchen.“We’ve been caught,” he said to Emma, making her giggle. He sighed and yelled back. “Yeah?”“Um, there’s a man here to see you. I think he said his name was Lazarus or something like that.”Emma felt every muscle in his body tense. His expression darkened and he pulled away both emotionally and physically. “Show him to the dining room. I’ll be right there.”“Okay, boss.”“Who’s Lazarus?” Emma asked, wanting to know the person responsible for his personality reversal.“He’s helping me with that little investigation we started in July.”“Adams?”“That’d be the scumbag.”Emma scrambled out of bed, tugging on her jeans and looking frantically for her bra. “Hold on, I want to come with you.”Stone paused at the door and shook his head. “He won’t meet with you, honey. I need to see him alone.”“But this is all about me. Why wouldn’t he want to meet with me?” Emma frowned.“Trust me, okay?” Stone strode back and planted a kiss on her lips. “Go boss Tilly around.”“But…”He silenced her with another kiss. “Please?”“Okay,” she agreed. “But I want a full report when you’re done.”Stone waved at her, and tossed her a crumpled piece of satin he’d retrieved from his pocket. She caught the object and blinked when she opened her palm to find her missing bra. “I’m not even gonna ask…”“I’d planned on using it to make sure you changed in my rooms this evening.”“I have other bras.”“I know. They’re all in my suite. This was your last one in here.”She smiled and shook her head. “All you have to do is ask.”He leaned against the jamb and stared hard into her eyes. “I’m asking.”“I’ll warm your bed tonight, Stone Connor.”“What about after tonight?”Emma smiled, knowing her heart shone brightly from her eyes. “For as long as you want me.”He nodded. “That’d be forever then,” he said softly, his words barely audible. With a wink and grin, he left her standing alone, his promise wrapping around her heart. *** Stone strode into the dining room, closing the sliding glass partition behind him. Lazarus paced in front of the floor to ceiling windows, ignoring the scenic vistas stretched beyond the paned glass.“Hey, Rex. I’m honored by this personal visit.”Rex Lazarus paused his incessant movement and glanced at Stone, shaking his head. “Don’t be. You’re not going to like anything I have to tell you.”“No how are you? I’ve missed you?”The sly grin that crept upon his best friend’s face warmed another area of Stone’s heart he’d doubted still existed.“You look good, buddy.”“Yeah, well I’m feeling better every day.” A sudden pang of regret pricked his chest. He never should’ve blamed Rex for the last mission or cut him out of his life. This man was like a brother to him. And he’d just proved it. One call and Rex Lazarus delivered.Laughing softly, Stone signaled for Rex to take a seat. He hadn’t changed a bit in the year since Stone left the military, still immaculately dressed, salt and pepper hair shaved short, and a piercing gaze that allowed no mistake as to his seriousness.“I’m glad you called, for my sake at least.” Rex said a little sheepish smile playing around his lips.“Me too.” Stone admitted. That’s enough of that junk, he decided and pulled a chair away from the table and sat down.Rex also sat and tossed a file and package of documents across the table.Time for business.Stone opened them and read the contents, glancing up only once when a name caught his attention.“He’s still alive?”“As far as we can tell.”Stone nodded. “Is it Kabila’s faction?”“Yes,” Rex said. He leaned forward and spread out several papers that when connected displayed a map of the Congo-Uganda border. “Adams contacted the ALiR five years ago when the US-UK alliance began supporting the Rwanda government. He sent funding to the Laurent Kibala regime in the Congo for training, arms, and supplies of ALiR. In return, ALiR provided jails for the bodies Seamus Adams no longer wanted around.”“ALiR,” Stone allowed the name to roll around his mind for a moment. “Army for the Liberation of Rwanda. My favorite jungle jerks. Why would Adams expose himself like this? Why not just dispose of the men permanently.”“Who understands the inner workings of a mad man? My guess would be that they were still politically powerful and might become useful in the future.”“Hugh Gallagher?”“He’s there. Kuffuor’s got him.”Stone felt a cold wash of hatred run through his veins. Asense Kuffuor ran the group of Rwandan terrorists responsible for the massacre of his men. “I see.” He pinched the bridge of his brow in an attempt to hold off the impending headache. “This all seems a bit contrived to me.”Rex lifted his brows and grinned. “That’s because it is. Hugh Gallagher arrived in Kuffuor’s camp two weeks ago. Me thinks Mr. Adams has done his homework.”Stone nodded. “He’s picked the wrong man to bait.”“Honestly, I don’t think he expects you to go after Kuffuor. Apparently, when Laurent Kabila died in 2001, Kuffuor stepped into his place. He’s more powerful now than on your last little visit to the jungle. I believe Adams moved Gallagher there to keep him away from you.”“How long will it take for you set this operation up?”“About eight weeks. Are you sure about this?”“Positive.” The burning sensation in his gut screamed loudly against returning to the Congo. The screams of dying men intertwined with high-pitched squeals of monkeys disturbed by gunfire sang to him every night in an orchestra of horror. “But there’s a condition.”“Other than rescuing Gallagher?”“Adams needs to go down.”Rex stared long and hard at Stone. “We’ll find a way of publicizing his connection with the IRA and ALiR. That’ll be enough to damage his political career.”Stone shook his head. “No. He needs to be taken out.”Rex sucked in a deep breath. “He’s a huge political figure in Northern Ireland. How do you propose we accomplish that?”“I don’t care.” Stone stared hard at his old friend. “You know he won’t stop until he’s exacted his revenge…on Emily, on River Run. Whatever he chooses. This will all be gone.” He inhaled a deep breath. “Besides, I’m owed.”Stone knew that the political miscommunication of his mission into the Congo two years ago resulted in the blood bath. It didn’t stave off the guilt, but it allowed him to direct his anger somewhere. If he finally delivered Kuffuor’s head, it’d certainly help heal some old wounds.Rex nodded. Rising from the table, the government front man frowned as snow poured from the sky. “I guess flying out tonight is out of the question.”“Stay,” Stone said. “We’re having a party.”Rex laughed. “A party? Man, I can’t wait to meet the woman who’s finally whipped you into a human being.”Stone smiled then held up a hand in warning. “She’s not to know anything about this.”“Is that wise?”“It’s top secret isn’t it?”“You know what I mean. She should know her father’s still alive.”“No.” Stone stood and moved next to Rex. He towered above him by more than several inches. “What if I fail?”“You won’t,” Rex answered quietly. “Not this time.” *** Stone stood within a quiet alcove, silently watching people arrive and converse with one another. Emma moved among the crowd with the grace of a feline, soothing egos, creating conversation, catching every man’s eye with her dress. He wanted to hide her from everyone.She’d be furious to discover how deeply he’d meddled in her affairs. It hadn’t taken long to trace Clover’s investigations in Ireland. His father had been right, Hugh Gallagher lived. Damn his old man. He hated thinking he’d almost ruined Emma’s life. It made him wonder what other decisions she was making in order to appease him.“You’ve got it bad.” Rex Lazarus said, sidling up to stand beside him.Stone snorted. “What’s that supposed to mean?”“The way you’re staring at the man talking to Emma, it looks like he’s at the top of your hit list.”“He’s my cousin.” Stone bristled as Seth Connor placed a large beefy paw on Emma’s arm. “If you’ll excuse me.” *** Emma watched Stone cross the main living room. Death in his eyes. She smiled nervously, wondering what could make him so angry.“Stone, I’ve been looking for you,” she said, her stomach tightening at the heat in his gaze.He eyed her then turned to the man on her right.“Seth.”“Stone.”Emma’s eyes widened as Stone glared fiercely at the hand Seth had resting on her arm. She’d grown up with Stone’s cousin and loved him like a brother. Seth tossed his head back and laughed loudly, then clapped a glowering Stone on the shoulder.“I didn’t know, man. I’m sorry.” He walked away and began a lively conversation with Tilly.“What on earth…”Stone grabbed her around the waist and held her tightly against his chest. She didn’t know what to say. He dipped his head and assaulted her mouth, demanding surrender, sparking a fiery passion that flushed her face and left her knees trembling. “Stone,” she said, trying to control her breathing. “What’re you doing?”“Marking my territory.” Releasing her, he stepped back, flourished a bow to the gaping guests and exited onto the back deck.A round of light applause began followed by howls of laughter and wolf whistles. Emma couldn’t prevent the mortified blush marring her face. “He doesn’t like parties,” she explained. “I think he’s a bit uptight.” Alexa Connor, Seth’s sister, stood beside her shaking her head.“You’ve done it.”“Done what?” Emma straightened her dress, her hands still shaking from Stone’s assault.“Wrangled the best looking Connor in Jackson Hole. He’s a tough one, our Stone, but when he loves…it’s with all his heart.”“And when he hates,” Emma said softly.Alexa nodded. “He’ll never forgive Nate.”“Why? What happened the year before I arrived?”“No one really knows. All I can say is whatever Stone’s feeling, he’s probably got the right. Nate was a mean SOB, and that’s putting it lightly.”Alexa’s words pulled a few more threads from Emma’s already unraveling heart. Nate needed her, she couldn’t forsake him, but she feared that if things continued the way they were, someday she’d be forced into a choice.Laughter rang from every corner of River Run. Despite her troubled thoughts she smiled, and focused back on the progression of the party. She made certain the buffet was being met be hungry partiers then stepped outside in search of Stone.He leaned against the side of the house, encased in shadows. Emma stepped close, and he opened his arms for her.“I’m sorry,” he said softly, stroking her curls and tracing them down her back.“No need. It’s not every day a woman can claim to be ravished before a houseful of guests.”“I’m no good at socializing.”She laughed. “Now that’s an understatement if ever I heard one.”“Are you mad?”“No. Are you?”“Maybe at the world, but not at you. Never at you.” He tilted her chin up and kissed her lips gently. She leaned into his warmth, deepening the kiss and twining her arms tightly around his neck.Stone pulled her closer, teasing her lips with his tongue. She wished everyone would go home. He’d been right, the party was a bad idea.“I’ve a present for you,” Stone said.“It’s not even Christmas yet.”“Close enough.” He pushed her away a little, then reached into his pocket and handed her a small brown envelope. She frowned and looked at him. “Open it.”Stepping into the light glowing through the French doors, she split the lip of the envelope. A passport fell into her hands, along with a social security card and birth certificate. Emma couldn’t prevent the slight trembling of her fingers as she cracked open the stiff blue booklet to see her name and picture scrawled across the inside.“What’s all this?”“Your freedom.”Tears welled, and she struggled against allowing them to flow. He’d handed her something she never knew she coveted until this very second. Always accepting her fate of being unknown, in hiding, beyond the simple privilege of ever attaining a driver’s license, finding a job, and buying her own home.Somewhere deep inside, Emma must’ve dreamed about this day because a rainbow of happiness flooded her soul, making her lightheaded. “I don’t know what to say.”“Don’t say anything. The look on your face will carry me for a long time.”“How did you know?”“That you didn’t have any of this? It wasn’t too hard to figure out.”“No.” She shook her head, trying to put all her emotions into the right category. “How’d you know to do this? How’d you know I needed these?” She grinned and moved her shoulders suggestively then slipped the treasure into the bodice of her dress. “Safe.”He gathered her close, crushing her treasures between their bodies. “I wanted to show you that you’re a separate entity from River Run, that you’re Emma O’Malley…period. And that this is only a job.”Something about the way he said that sunk a hook of doubt into her heart. What exactly did he mean?Before she could question him, the decking shook and a deep rumble reverberated from the bottom of River Run. A loud explosion filled the air, followed by a blast of searing heat. She felt herself sliding, away from Stone and into a fiery blaze.",

She caught the object and blinked when she opened her palm to find her missing bra. “I’m not even gonna ask…”“I’d planned on using it to make sure you changed in my rooms this evening.”“I have other bras.”“I know. They’re all in my suite. This was your last one in here.”She smiled and shook her head. “All you have to do is ask.”He leaned against the jamb and stared hard into her eyes. “I’m asking.”“I’ll warm your bed tonight, Stone Connor.”“What about after tonight?”Emma smiled, knowing her heart shone brightly from her eyes. “For as long as you want me.”He nodded. “That’d be forever then,” he said softly, his words barely audible. With a wink and grin, he left her standing alone, his promise wrapping around her heart. *** Stone strode into the dining room, closing the sliding glass partition behind him. Lazarus paced in front of the floor to ceiling windows, ignoring the scenic vistas stretched beyond the paned glass.“Hey, Rex. I’m honored by this personal visit.”Rex Lazarus paused his incessant movement and glanced at Stone, shaking his head. “Don’t be. You’re not going to like anything I have to tell you.”“No how are you? I’ve missed you?”The sly grin that crept upon his best friend’s face warmed another area of Stone’s heart he’d doubted still existed.“You look good, buddy.”“Yeah, well I’m feeling better every day.” A sudden pang of regret pricked his chest. He never should’ve blamed Rex for the last mission or cut him out of his life. This man was like a brother to him. And he’d just proved it. One call and Rex Lazarus delivered.Laughing softly, Stone signaled for Rex to take a seat. He hadn’t changed a bit in the year since Stone left the military, still immaculately dressed, salt and pepper hair shaved short, and a piercing gaze that allowed no mistake as to his seriousness.“I’m glad you called, for my sake at least.” Rex said a little sheepish smile playing around his lips.“Me too.” Stone admitted. That’s enough of that junk, he decided and pulled a chair away from the table and sat down.Rex also sat and tossed a file and package of documents across the table.Time for business.Stone opened them and read the contents, glancing up only once when a name caught his attention.“He’s still alive?”“As far as we can tell.”Stone nodded. “Is it Kabila’s faction?”“Yes,” Rex said. He leaned forward and spread out several papers that when connected displayed a map of the Congo-Uganda border. “Adams contacted the ALiR five years ago when the US-UK alliance began supporting the Rwanda government. He sent funding to the Laurent Kibala regime in the Congo for training, arms, and supplies of ALiR. In return, ALiR provided jails for the bodies Seamus Adams no longer wanted around.”“ALiR,” Stone allowed the name to roll around his mind for a moment. “Army for the Liberation of Rwanda. My favorite jungle jerks. Why would Adams expose himself like this? Why not just dispose of the men permanently.”“Who understands the inner workings of a mad man? My guess would be that they were still politically powerful and might become useful in the future.”“Hugh Gallagher?”“He’s there. Kuffuor’s got him.”Stone felt a cold wash of hatred run through his veins. Asense Kuffuor ran the group of Rwandan terrorists responsible for the massacre of his men. “I see.” He pinched the bridge of his brow in an attempt to hold off the impending headache. “This all seems a bit contrived to me.”Rex lifted his brows and grinned. “That’s because it is. Hugh Gallagher arrived in Kuffuor’s camp two weeks ago. Me thinks Mr. Adams has done his homework.”Stone nodded. “He’s picked the wrong man to bait.”“Honestly, I don’t think he expects you to go after Kuffuor. Apparently, when Laurent Kabila died in 2001, Kuffuor stepped into his place. He’s more powerful now than on your last little visit to the jungle. I believe Adams moved Gallagher there to keep him away from you.”“How long will it take for you set this operation up?”“About eight weeks. Are you sure about this?”“Positive.” The burning sensation in his gut screamed loudly against returning to the Congo. The screams of dying men intertwined with high-pitched squeals of monkeys disturbed by gunfire sang to him every night in an orchestra of horror. “But there’s a condition.”“Other than rescuing Gallagher?”“Adams needs to go down.”Rex stared long and hard at Stone. “We’ll find a way of publicizing his connection with the IRA and ALiR. That’ll be enough to damage his political career.”Stone shook his head. “No. He needs to be taken out.”Rex sucked in a deep breath. “He’s a huge political figure in Northern Ireland. How do you propose we accomplish that?”“I don’t care.” Stone stared hard at his old friend. “You know he won’t stop until he’s exacted his revenge…on Emily, on River Run. Whatever he chooses. This will all be gone.” He inhaled a deep breath. “Besides, I’m owed.”Stone knew that the political miscommunication of his mission into the Congo two years ago resulted in the blood bath. It didn’t stave off the guilt, but it allowed him to direct his anger somewhere. If he finally delivered Kuffuor’s head, it’d certainly help heal some old wounds.Rex nodded. Rising from the table, the government front man frowned as snow poured from the sky. “I guess flying out tonight is out of the question.”“Stay,” Stone said. “We’re having a party.”Rex laughed. “A party? Man, I can’t wait to meet the woman who’s finally whipped you into a human being.”Stone smiled then held up a hand in warning. “She’s not to know anything about this.”“Is that wise?”“It’s top secret isn’t it?”“You know what I mean. She should know her father’s still alive.”“No.” Stone stood and moved next to Rex. He towered above him by more than several inches. “What if I fail?”“You won’t,” Rex answered quietly. “Not this time.” *** Stone stood within a quiet alcove, silently watching people arrive and converse with one another. Emma moved among the crowd with the grace of a feline, soothing egos, creating conversation, catching every man’s eye with her dress. He wanted to hide her from everyone.She’d be furious to discover how deeply he’d meddled in her affairs. It hadn’t taken long to trace Clover’s investigations in Ireland. His father had been right, Hugh Gallagher lived. Damn his old man. He hated thinking he’d almost ruined Emma’s life. It made him wonder what other decisions she was making in order to appease him.“You’ve got it bad.” Rex Lazarus said, sidling up to stand beside him.Stone snorted. “What’s that supposed to mean?”“The way you’re staring at the man talking to Emma, it looks like he’s at the top of your hit list.”“He’s my cousin.” Stone bristled as Seth Connor placed a large beefy paw on Emma’s arm. “If you’ll excuse me.” *** Emma watched Stone cross the main living room. Death in his eyes. She smiled nervously, wondering what could make him so angry.“Stone, I’ve been looking for you,” she said, her stomach tightening at the heat in his gaze.He eyed her then turned to the man on her right.“Seth.”“Stone.”Emma’s eyes widened as Stone glared fiercely at the hand Seth had resting on her arm. She’d grown up with Stone’s cousin and loved him like a brother. Seth tossed his head back and laughed loudly, then clapped a glowering Stone on the shoulder.“I didn’t know, man. I’m sorry.” He walked away and began a lively conversation with Tilly.“What on earth…”Stone grabbed her around the waist and held her tightly against his chest. She didn’t know what to say. He dipped his head and assaulted her mouth, demanding surrender, sparking a fiery passion that flushed her face and left her knees trembling. “Stone,” she said, trying to control her breathing. “What’re you doing?”“Marking my territory.” Releasing her, he stepped back, flourished a bow to the gaping guests and exited onto the back deck.A round of light applause began followed by howls of laughter and wolf whistles. Emma couldn’t prevent the mortified blush marring her face. “He doesn’t like parties,” she explained. “I think he’s a bit uptight.” Alexa Connor, Seth’s sister, stood beside her shaking her head.“You’ve done it.”“Done what?” Emma straightened her dress, her hands still shaking from Stone’s assault.“Wrangled the best looking Connor in Jackson Hole. He’s a tough one, our Stone, but when he loves…it’s with all his heart.”“And when he hates,” Emma said softly.Alexa nodded. “He’ll never forgive Nate.”“Why? What happened the year before I arrived?”“No one really knows. All I can say is whatever Stone’s feeling, he’s probably got the right. Nate was a mean SOB, and that’s putting it lightly.”Alexa’s words pulled a few more threads from Emma’s already unraveling heart. Nate needed her, she couldn’t forsake him, but she feared that if things continued the way they were, someday she’d be forced into a choice.Laughter rang from every corner of River Run. Despite her troubled thoughts she smiled, and focused back on the progression of the party. She made certain the buffet was being met be hungry partiers then stepped outside in search of Stone.He leaned against the side of the house, encased in shadows. Emma stepped close, and he opened his arms for her.“I’m sorry,” he said softly, stroking her curls and tracing them down her back.“No need. It’s not every day a woman can claim to be ravished before a houseful of guests.”“I’m no good at socializing.”She laughed. “Now that’s an understatement if ever I heard one.”“Are you mad?”“No. Are you?”“Maybe at the world, but not at you. Never at you.” He tilted her chin up and kissed her lips gently. She leaned into his warmth, deepening the kiss and twining her arms tightly around his neck.Stone pulled her closer, teasing her lips with his tongue. She wished everyone would go home. He’d been right, the party was a bad idea.“I’ve a present for you,” Stone said.“It’s not even Christmas yet.”“Close enough.” He pushed her away a little, then reached into his pocket and handed her a small brown envelope. She frowned and looked at him. “Open it.”Stepping into the light glowing through the French doors, she split the lip of the envelope. A passport fell into her hands, along with a social security card and birth certificate. Emma couldn’t prevent the slight trembling of her fingers as she cracked open the stiff blue booklet to see her name and picture scrawled across the inside.“What’s all this?”“Your freedom.”Tears welled, and she struggled against allowing them to flow. He’d handed her something she never knew she coveted until this very second. Always accepting her fate of being unknown, in hiding, beyond the simple privilege of ever attaining a driver’s license, finding a job, and buying her own home.Somewhere deep inside, Emma must’ve dreamed about this day because a rainbow of happiness flooded her soul, making her lightheaded. “I don’t know what to say.”“Don’t say anything. The look on your face will carry me for a long time.”“How did you know?”“That you didn’t have any of this? It wasn’t too hard to figure out.”“No.” She shook her head, trying to put all her emotions into the right category. “How’d you know to do this? How’d you know I needed these?” She grinned and moved her shoulders suggestively then slipped the treasure into the bodice of her dress. “Safe.”He gathered her close, crushing her treasures between their bodies. “I wanted to show you that you’re a separate entity from River Run, that you’re Emma O’Malley…period. And that this is only a job.”Something about the way he said that sunk a hook of doubt into her heart. What exactly did he mean?Before she could question him, the decking shook and a deep rumble reverberated from the bottom of River Run. A loud explosion filled the air, followed by a blast of searing heat. She felt herself sliding, away from Stone and into a fiery blaze.",

      "content": "Chapter Twelve Stone watched in horror as Emma’s dress caught on the collapsing deck, pulling her away and down into the burning hell below. Gripping the edge of the house, he leaned forward, reaching for her outstretched hand. His feet balancing precariously on the skirting board that wrapped the edge of the house he stretched as far as possible, grabbing her wrist before the planks beneath her feet shattered to the earth in a loud clap of thunder.Eyes wide with fear, she grasped his hand and held tight. He heard Lazarus yelling from the open French doors. Sweat poured from his face and he yanked with all his might, swinging Emma to the right where Rex grabbed at the folds of her tattered dress, reeling her in.“Take Rex’s hand.” He yelled over the din of screaming guests and burning house. Emma nodded, twisted her body toward the French doors and released her grip on his hand. Rex gathered her close and pulled her into the house. Stone gripped the edge of the window frame and inched his way toward the door. Once inside, he wrapped an arm around a disheveled and frightened Emma.He’d almost lost her.His heart thudded against his chest, and for the first time he could remember, his hands trembled uncontrollably. Pulling her tight against his chest, Stone kissed the top of her head.The center of the house sounded like bedlam. With a shaky sigh, he maneuvered them between the confused crowd. With shouted commands, he quickly began orchestrating everyone’s exit from the resort.“I’ll take her,” Seth said, appearing at his side.Reluctantly, he relinquished his hold and allowed his cousin to escort the only person that mattered to him outside. The resort remained in an uproar.He pushed everyone out through the front door, trying to take some sort of head count. Smoke quickly filled the main level, pluming in gray clouds of sinister waves from the basement.Sirens could be heard in the distance, and Stone silently thanked whoever used their sense and called 911. The floor shook beneath his feet and after one last glance around, he hurried from the burning building.Emma sat huddled against a tree. Seth soothed her but it appeared she wouldn’t listen and continued curling tighter into a ball.Stone strode over, yanked her to her feet and stared into her eyes. Fear swam in the emerald depths, and he shook her gently.“Snap out of it, Emma. We’ve a flock of guests who’re cold and scared.” He couldn’t take her desperation, it tore at his soul like nothing he’d ever experienced.“I ca…ca…ca…can’t.”“You’re stronger than this, better than this.”“You do…do…do…don’t understand,” she said, her voice thin and pathetic.“Then explain it to me, baby.”She clutched at his shoulders and pulled him close to her. The fierceness behind her fear burned his face with its intensity. “You could’ve died.”“I…?”“It was Adams, I know it. And I could’ve killed you.”“Hush, sweetheart. You’re not making any sense. I was safe, remember? You were the one about to plummet ten feet onto hard concrete.” She shook her head, and he pulled her tight to his chest. He didn’t have time for this. The fire trucks were pulling up the drive, and he needed to investigate the source of the explosion.“Can’t think. Go help the others,” she said.“I’d rather stay here, but I have to go.”“I know.” Her hand snaked up to caress his cheek. He bent and placed a tender kiss on her forehead. She stood on her tiptoes, twined her arms around his neck and whispered in his ear. “I love you.”He swallowed his throat thick with emotion. With a nod, Stone left her warm embrace and headed into the disorganized fray of human fear and burning house. *** Emma battled back her tears. She watched as Stone moved with panther like grace through the crowd of people, comforting, directing and solving their problems.Only one fire truck had arrived, and the men were busy around the back of the house fighting the fire. In such a remote area of town, it would take time for all the engines to arrive. Until then, she watched Stone organize.It wasn’t long before he’d spread open the barn doors and directed everyone into its interior. She couldn’t move.A high pitched squeal hit the already noisy evening and to her horror Stone raced from the milling crowd and through the front door of the burning house, his head bent against the angry smoke pouring from inside. She ran after him, screaming his name.“Stone,” Emma clutched the edge of the front door, choking on the heavy air. “Stone!”She listened and above the crackling flames that licked up from the basement a muffled grunt and loud curse reached her ears. She ran toward them and smacked hard into a body of unmoving rock.An arm reached out and wrapped around her neck, strangling the air from her throat. She kicked and pulled forward in an attempt to knock the stranger off balance. Gasping, her lungs burning from the smoke, she hoarsely shouted for Stone.“No one to save you now, ducky.” A voice thick with Irish brogue hissed against her ear.“Stone.” She closed her eyes and struggled fiercely. Her vision dimmed, and she fought against the pin pricks of light that preceded oblivion. A loud grunt and sudden release of pressure on her neck forced her forward, staggering toward the front door.Emma’s head connected painfully with the brass door knob. A brutal shove pushed her down, to her knees. She felt a body pass by her. Her eyes stung from the smoke, watering in rivers of frustration. She couldn’t see the perpetrator, but she could feel hands…loving hands, wrap around her and pull her outside where the cool temperatures eased her burning face.“Stone.” She inhaled and exhaled, attempting to figure everything out. “What happened?”“I went inside for Porkie, heard you scream and came running.” Her eyes focused and she looked into his concerned face.“A man attacked me.”“I know. The police are chasing him. He won’t get far.”“Pocahontas?”“Right here.” Stone moved to the side so she could see the pig nervously stomping around. Reaching out, she tickled the snotty snout and sighed when Pocahontas nuzzled her hand.Emma took a moment to think about the past thirty minutes and the fear and panic returned, knotting into a ball that lodged beneath her heart. She’d done this. She’d endangered Stone. His life could’ve been lost today because of her.She sniffed and stood up, ignoring Stone’s protests. Biting her lip, Emma turned and gazed at the man who encompassed her world, held her heart, owned her soul. “You have to go,” she said. Pain struck in ravaging splinters of broken dreams and dead happily-ever-afters. This man, this gorgeous beautiful soul, couldn’t be here. She’d not damage him anymore. He’d faced a lifetime of hurt and pain and deserved a future full of happiness and love.“What’re you talking about?”“Now, Stone, right now. You have to go.” Emma gripped his arms and stared into his face, burning every wonderful inch into her memory.“I’m not going anywhere.”“Yes you are. You can’t stay here. It’s too dangerous.” She dropped her head and leaned against his chest, whispering softly. “I’m too dangerous.”Stone gently tipped her chin up and forced her to meet his gaze. “Yes,” he said with a grin. “You are dangerous.” He bent and placed a tender kiss on her lips. “But I can’t leave, it’s against the rules.” Her smile froze and the warmth his kiss ignited chilled suddenly as her mind absorbed his words.“River Run?”“Yes. But you can leave,” he said, lifting his hand and signaling for Seth. “I want you to go back to Seth’s ranch.”She supposed the fact that Stone’s focus revolved around his property and not her should ease her mind, but it didn’t. It hurt.Emma stumbled after Seth, refusing to look back, fighting against the urge to cling to Stone and never let go. How simple it’d been to forget that River Run wasn’t hers.It was his.As the first floor shot flames and coughed forth piles of smoke, its destruction and potential danger to Stone tugged at her, striking deep wounds. But it shouldn’t have.Climbing into Seth’s truck, Emma stared blankly out the window, ignoring the excited and concerned chatter of Alexa and her brother. As the soft glow of River Run faded into the horizon, a part of her heart, the one that’d only recently come alive, dimmed and sank beneath a crust of anger. *** Stone watched the last of the rescue brigade drive slowly down the gravel road. His shoulders slumped beneath a mountain of concerns and thoughts, he trudged to the front porch. Sitting down next to Lazarus, he gratefully accepted the proffered brandy snifter.“Rescued these from the rubble,” Rex said.“Good thing.” He took a swift gulp of the heady liquor, luxuriating in the slight burn that trailed down his throat and warmed his chest.“What did the fire chief say?”“Most of the damage is to the lower level. It looks structurally sound but an engineer will need to verify it. The sauna was the source of the explosion…some kind of rigged bomb.” He shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I can’t remember all the details but the guy the police rounded up has a lot to own up for.”“Adam’s lacky?”“Probably, but it’ll be hard to prove.” Stone swigged the rest of his brandy and looked at Rex. “We need to move up the operation. Obviously, Seamus Adams wants Emma gone. I’d really hoped to avoid this. I can’t believe he’s willing to risk exposure in order to silence her. There’s got to be more to this than what we’re seeing,” Stone said.Lazarus refilled Stone’s glass, topping his own off as well. “Emma is the only witness left who saw the true Seamus Adams. The murderer and gangster before the polished politician surfaced. If she went to Ireland and testified, his entire career would be finished, he’d be destroyed.”Stone shook his head slowly. “There’s more, I just know it. Something doesn’t feel right. Why now? Why find her now?”“She slipped up.”“How? Emma’s been hiding here, she rarely goes to town. Before our intervention, the woman had no form of identification whatsoever.”“Clover?” Rex said, with a shrug of his shoulders.“No way.” Stone shook his head and frowned. “I went through all the paper work, and they’d done a damn good job of covering their tracks.”Stone didn’t like the way Rex stared at him. The man appeared to be waiting for something to click, something to make sense.“How do you think Clover knew how to cover its tracks?” Rex asked.“Easy, any two-bit lawyer could…” He stopped when Rex shook his head. Stone thought back to the corporate documents and Clover’s overseas operations. It’d taken him hours of investigation and a good dozen favors to link the company with Ireland. “What aren’t you saying here, Lazarus?”“It ties back to Emma. All reports indicate Adams clearly thought she’d been killed when trying to escape the country after her father was pronounced dead.”“And?”“Nate Connor executed a clean set-up and retrieval.”Stone quirked a brow and glanced sideways at Rex. “My father smuggled her out of the country?”“Yes.”“Why?”“Don’t you know the relationship?”Stone sat back, uncertain whether he wanted to hear this or not. It wouldn’t change his opinion of his father, but it might assist in the rescue of Hugh Gallagher. “No, I’m blind here, so why not flick on the flashlight and enlighten me?”Rex stared at him for a moment, scratched his chin and shrugged. “Hugh Gallagher contracted your father, via Central Intelligence, to assist in unearthing an illegal arms purchase between a rogue US group and the IRA.”“What? Nate’s nothing more than a used up, ex-alcoholic gambler.”Rex shook his head and the steely gaze in the man’s eyes caused an uncomfortable knot in the pit of Stone’s stomach. “What am I missing?”“Your father’s CIA.”A derisive snort escaped Stone’s nose, and he shook his head in denial. “You’re way off base. CIA? Nate Connor can’t even hold a job at the local lumber yard let alone work for the government.”“You think you’re the only Connor with excellent instincts, impeccable firearm ability and the need to protect our country? No way.” Rex shook his head. “You are your father’s son.”Stone stilled. Questions flew through his mind. If this were true, that his father worked for the CIA, then it certainly explained Clover’s ability to remain cloaked. Another thought struck him, which sent a cold chill of fear crackling through his system. If Seamus Adams’ discovered Clover, followed its trail here, came to River Run to investigate, continued to hold Hugh Gallagher hostage, then there’d be no stopping his conviction to eliminate Emma.“Okay, say I believe you. What happened with this arms deal?”“Nate and Hugh went deep undercover. They formed a tight friendship that extended beyond their current assignment. When the mission was finished, Nate visited Hugh in Ireland, helped eliminate several deadly factions of a growing IRA. He’s known Emma since the day she was born.”“How could I miss all this? It’s too much to understand. You’re telling me that my father was some kind of saint to this Irish family then returned home and beat the crap out of me and broke my mother’s heart. Not to mention….” Stone stood up and held his hand out to block Rex’s response. “No. I’m not even going to think of that.” He glared at Rex and pointed an angry finger in his direction. “Why wait until now to tell me all this?”“You weren’t ready.”“Not ready?” Stone ran his fingers through the tangled mess of hair that topped his head. “I’m still not ready. I’ll never be ready. My father was no hero. He’s a drunk, a gambler, and a murderer.”“True on all accounts except the last one.”Stone dismissed Rex’s comment with a shake of his head and a smirk. “This is crazy.”“Yeah, it really is. Hard to believe that one little debt could culminate in such a huge coincidental mess.”“What debt?”“Hugh Gallagher saved your life. Nate owed him.”Stone stood, frozen in place. He barely felt the icy sting of the snow that whipped around his head, nor the bitter breeze that drove it in perpendicular fashion straight into his eyes.“You’ve got your facts wrong. Again. I don’t know any Hugh Gallagher, and I know for certain my father wouldn’t care whether or not I lived or died.”“No? Well how do you explain the long arm of Seamus Adams? How do you explain Emma’s presence here?”He thought about his father. Nate Connor wasn’t a man to take on trouble, in any form. Something must’ve forced his hand, pushed him to raise a parentless teenage girl, but it certainly wasn’t any debt regarding Stone. The memory of facing down a steel barrel convinced him of this.“I can’t explain anything.”“Stone, listen to me. It’s really all black and white. Adams isn’t thinking clearly. He’s shipped off Gallagher because you came too close in your investigation of Clover’s activities. He thinks he’s one up. Feeling cocky, he gives the command to eliminate Emma. And here we stand, in front of a smoky ruined resort. What do you propose to do?”Stone looked straight into the challenging gaze of Rex Lazarus. “Move up the operation.”A tight smile played across Rex’s face and Stone answered it with one of his own. “I’ll see what I can do,” the smaller man said.“Let’s go inside.”“What? In there? Is it safe?”Stone chuckled. “Yeah. We can sleep in Emma’s quarters. They don’t seem to have been affected by the fire.”Rex eyed the resort nervously but followed Stone anyway. “If you say so.”The two men walked through the smoke ravaged rooms. Water stained the walls, floor, and most of the furniture. One glance into his room confirmed that although it was relatively free of damage, the acrid scent permeated the suite, choking the lungs. He closed the door and continued back through the house.Sliding the partition away that separated Emma’s quarters from the main house, he inhaled the fresh air and quickly hustled Rex through before the stagnating smoke filtered into these small rooms.“This is where Emma lives?” Rex asked, obviously amazed at the postage sized rooms.“Yeah, when she’s not in my rooms. But that only happens when I’m a jerk.”“Which would be always then?”Stone glared at Rex, causing the other man to bellow with laughter.“We’re doing okay, considering,” Stone responded.“I never thought I’d see the day the great Stone Connor crumbled beneath the power of a woman.”“For that comment,” Stone opened the office door. “You get to sleep in here.”Rex eyed the room and shook his head. “Where’s the bed?”Grinning from ear to ear, Stone shut the door and entered Emma’s bedroom. He called back over his shoulder, loud enough for Rex to hear. “There isn’t one.” Laughter bubbled up at the muted curses answering him.Sitting on the edge of her bed, he ran a tired hand over his face. It felt as if he’d been tossing all the losing dice, not making any advancement in this cruel game he and Seamus Adams were playing. Inhaling sharply, a sweet jasmine scent tickled his nose, making him ache for Emma.He couldn’t sort out how he felt about his father being CIA. He knew it didn’t change his hatred or his burning desire for revenge. Stone managed to avoid that rather successfully. Revenge didn’t solve any problems. A sudden vision of his men’s faces crossed his mind. This time, they weren’t writhing on the ground in pain, but were laughing as he solidly beat each and every one of them in their ritual one-on-one pre-mission basketball game.He smiled at the memory and suddenly flashes of better times struck his mind in rapid fire. Stone reached back, caressing Emma’s pillow, feeling her presence in every corner of the room. Even without her touch, she healed.Lying down, he rested his head upon her bed and closed his eyes against the tears that burned. He pushed a fist against his heart, pressing hard on the pain.He missed his men. *** Stone stretched then rubbed his face trying to come to a level of consciousness that allowed thought process. Sun streamed through the window, wiping away the remnants of last night’s storm. He sat up and squinted against the bright glare of light on pristine snow. Muted banging could be heard in the background.Realizing he still wore his smoke streaked pants and shirt, Stone stripped, grabbed Emma’s robe from the closet and wrapped it around his waist. He stepped into the hall and stopped short as a startled Rex exited the office.Glaring at the shorter man, Stone silently challenged him to comment on the pink silk fabric. Rex successfully suppressed his grin, at least enough so that Stone didn’t feel the need to send a fist into his gut.“Um, when you’re done doing whatever it is you were about to do, can I have a few moments of your time?” Lazarus asked, his shoulders shaking slightly.“If you laugh, it will be the last thing that comes out of your mouth today. While I take a shower, why not make yourself useful and scrounge up some coffee?”Rex nodded and hurried out the door into the resort’s kitchen. Stone ignored the snort and muffled laughter that filtered back through the partition. Before entering the bathroom, he veered off into the adjacent laundry area and rescued a pair of jeans and flannel shirt from the dryer.Ten minutes later, refreshed and ready to sit down with Rex, Stone emerged into the kitchen. He stopped in surprise as a dozen men traipsed through the upstairs carrying tool boxes, buckets of chemicals and cleaning supplies, and bags of other paraphernalia he didn’t recognize.“What’s going on?”“Apparently, Emma called in the troops. A structural engineer is currently poking and prodding the foundation and these people are from a specialized fire damage control unit.” Rex handed him a cup of coffee and signaled that he should take a seat at one of the kitchen tables.“Where’s Emma?”Rex shrugged. He handed Stone a stack of papers and pointed to their contents. “You need to sign these.”“What are they?”“They’re acknowledgment of your mission and approval to ship a new unit here for training.”“Here?” Stone gulped down several swigs of the black liquid steaming in his mug. “No way. That’ll never do.”“What do you suggest?”“I’ll meet up with everyone at the normal training center.”“You can’t.”“Why not?”“You’ll lose River Run.”Stone sat back in his chair. He didn’t really care about the estate, but he’d already imparted his feelings to Rex regarding the title transfer to Nate. Unacceptable.“What’d the lawyer say?”“If you remain here through the first week of March, he’ll allow you a two week absence to take care of business, but you must return before the first day of Spring.”“Two weeks?”Rex nodded. “Apparently, he’s able to bend the rules enough for that trip as long as you spend the majority of this season here at the resort.”Stone sighed. How was he ever going to explain this to Emma?“When will my unit arrive?”“After the first of the year.”“Mission date?”“March 7.”“No sooner?”“Do you want this resort?” Rex narrowed a look at him, causing Stone to think every aspect through.“No,” he said. “But I’m not giving it to Nate.”“Hugh will survive another two months but will you?”“What’s that supposed to mean?”Rex leaned close. “It means you’re too emotionally involved. Can you train here with the distraction of pretty Miss O’Malley?”“Yes.” Stone pushed away from the table, paused then bent and scribbled his name on the documents scattered across the polished wood. “Bring it on.”The front door flung open and Seth Connor stepped through. Stomping snow from his boots, he pulled off his sheepskin gloves and shrugged out of a heavy denim jacket.“Mornin’ folks. I see everyone’s here just as Emma indicated.”“Where is she?” Stone asked, looking behind his cousin’s back and expecting to find a face his heart ached to see.“Didn’t she call?”“Call? No. I thought she was with you.”Seth looked at his feet and shuffled uncomfortably from foot to foot.“Where is she Seth? Didn’t you take her home last night?”Worry and concern stabbed at Stone’s gut.“Not exactly.”“Tell me where Emma is?”Seth looked up then cast his eyes quickly down. “She wouldn’t come back to the ranch.”“Where’d you take her?” Stone became increasingly angry when Seth wouldn’t look at him. He grabbed the man’s shoulder and shook it.“Tell me.”Seth tossed a desperate glance in his direction, broke free and headed into the living room. He paused, ran a hand through his hair and sighed like the entire world hung on his shoulders.“She’s at your father’s.”",

      "content": "Chapter Twelve Stone watched in horror as Emma’s dress caught on the collapsing deck, pulling her away and down into the burning hell below. Gripping the edge of the house, he leaned forward, reaching for her outstretched hand. His feet balancing precariously on the skirting board that wrapped the edge of the house he stretched as far as possible, grabbing her wrist before the planks beneath her feet shattered to the earth in a loud clap of thunder.Eyes wide with fear, she grasped his hand and held tight. He heard Lazarus yelling from the open French doors. Sweat poured from his face and he yanked with all his might, swinging Emma to the right where Rex grabbed at the folds of her tattered dress, reeling her in.“Take Rex’s hand.” He yelled over the din of screaming guests and burning house. Emma nodded, twisted her body toward the French doors and released her grip on his hand. Rex gathered her close and pulled her into the house. Stone gripped the edge of the window frame and inched his way toward the door. Once inside, he wrapped an arm around a disheveled and frightened Emma.He’d almost lost her.His heart thudded against his chest, and for the first time he could remember, his hands trembled uncontrollably. Pulling her tight against his chest, Stone kissed the top of her head.The center of the house sounded like bedlam. With a shaky sigh, he maneuvered them between the confused crowd. With shouted commands, he quickly began orchestrating everyone’s exit from the resort.“I’ll take her,” Seth said, appearing at his side.Reluctantly, he relinquished his hold and allowed his cousin to escort the only person that mattered to him outside. The resort remained in an uproar.He pushed everyone out through the front door, trying to take some sort of head count. Smoke quickly filled the main level, pluming in gray clouds of sinister waves from the basement.Sirens could be heard in the distance, and Stone silently thanked whoever used their sense and called 911. The floor shook beneath his feet and after one last glance around, he hurried from the burning building.Emma sat huddled against a tree. Seth soothed her but it appeared she wouldn’t listen and continued curling tighter into a ball.Stone strode over, yanked her to her feet and stared into her eyes. Fear swam in the emerald depths, and he shook her gently.“Snap out of it, Emma. We’ve a flock of guests who’re cold and scared.” He couldn’t take her desperation, it tore at his soul like nothing he’d ever experienced.“I ca…ca…ca…can’t.”“You’re stronger than this, better than this.”“You do…do…do…don’t understand,” she said, her voice thin and pathetic.“Then explain it to me, baby.”She clutched at his shoulders and pulled him close to her. The fierceness behind her fear burned his face with its intensity. “You could’ve died.”“I…?”“It was Adams, I know it. And I could’ve killed you.”“Hush, sweetheart. You’re not making any sense. I was safe, remember? You were the one about to plummet ten feet onto hard concrete.” She shook her head, and he pulled her tight to his chest. He didn’t have time for this. The fire trucks were pulling up the drive, and he needed to investigate the source of the explosion.“Can’t think. Go help the others,” she said.“I’d rather stay here, but I have to go.”“I know.” Her hand snaked up to caress his cheek. He bent and placed a tender kiss on her forehead. She stood on her tiptoes, twined her arms around his neck and whispered in his ear. “I love you.”He swallowed his throat thick with emotion. With a nod, Stone left her warm embrace and headed into the disorganized fray of human fear and burning house. *** Emma battled back her tears. She watched as Stone moved with panther like grace through the crowd of people, comforting, directing and solving their problems.Only one fire truck had arrived, and the men were busy around the back of the house fighting the fire. In such a remote area of town, it would take time for all the engines to arrive. Until then, she watched Stone organize.It wasn’t long before he’d spread open the barn doors and directed everyone into its interior. She couldn’t move.A high pitched squeal hit the already noisy evening and to her horror Stone raced from the milling crowd and through the front door of the burning house, his head bent against the angry smoke pouring from inside. She ran after him, screaming his name.“Stone,” Emma clutched the edge of the front door, choking on the heavy air. “Stone!”She listened and above the crackling flames that licked up from the basement a muffled grunt and loud curse reached her ears. She ran toward them and smacked hard into a body of unmoving rock.An arm reached out and wrapped around her neck, strangling the air from her throat. She kicked and pulled forward in an attempt to knock the stranger off balance. Gasping, her lungs burning from the smoke, she hoarsely shouted for Stone.“No one to save you now, ducky.” A voice thick with Irish brogue hissed against her ear.“Stone.” She closed her eyes and struggled fiercely. Her vision dimmed, and she fought against the pin pricks of light that preceded oblivion. A loud grunt and sudden release of pressure on her neck forced her forward, staggering toward the front door.Emma’s head connected painfully with the brass door knob. A brutal shove pushed her down, to her knees. She felt a body pass by her. Her eyes stung from the smoke, watering in rivers of frustration. She couldn’t see the perpetrator, but she could feel hands…loving hands, wrap around her and pull her outside where the cool temperatures eased her burning face.“Stone.” She inhaled and exhaled, attempting to figure everything out. “What happened?”“I went inside for Porkie, heard you scream and came running.” Her eyes focused and she looked into his concerned face.“A man attacked me.”“I know. The police are chasing him. He won’t get far.”“Pocahontas?”“Right here.” Stone moved to the side so she could see the pig nervously stomping around. Reaching out, she tickled the snotty snout and sighed when Pocahontas nuzzled her hand.Emma took a moment to think about the past thirty minutes and the fear and panic returned, knotting into a ball that lodged beneath her heart. She’d done this. She’d endangered Stone. His life could’ve been lost today because of her.She sniffed and stood up, ignoring Stone’s protests. Biting her lip, Emma turned and gazed at the man who encompassed her world, held her heart, owned her soul. “You have to go,” she said. Pain struck in ravaging splinters of broken dreams and dead happily-ever-afters. This man, this gorgeous beautiful soul, couldn’t be here. She’d not damage him anymore. He’d faced a lifetime of hurt and pain and deserved a future full of happiness and love.“What’re you talking about?”“Now, Stone, right now. You have to go.” Emma gripped his arms and stared into his face, burning every wonderful inch into her memory.“I’m not going anywhere.”“Yes you are. You can’t stay here. It’s too dangerous.” She dropped her head and leaned against his chest, whispering softly. “I’m too dangerous.”Stone gently tipped her chin up and forced her to meet his gaze. “Yes,” he said with a grin. “You are dangerous.” He bent and placed a tender kiss on her lips. “But I can’t leave, it’s against the rules.” Her smile froze and the warmth his kiss ignited chilled suddenly as her mind absorbed his words.“River Run?”“Yes. But you can leave,” he said, lifting his hand and signaling for Seth. “I want you to go back to Seth’s ranch.”She supposed the fact that Stone’s focus revolved around his property and not her should ease her mind, but it didn’t. It hurt.Emma stumbled after Seth, refusing to look back, fighting against the urge to cling to Stone and never let go. How simple it’d been to forget that River Run wasn’t hers.It was his.As the first floor shot flames and coughed forth piles of smoke, its destruction and potential danger to Stone tugged at her, striking deep wounds. But it shouldn’t have.Climbing into Seth’s truck, Emma stared blankly out the window, ignoring the excited and concerned chatter of Alexa and her brother. As the soft glow of River Run faded into the horizon, a part of her heart, the one that’d only recently come alive, dimmed and sank beneath a crust of anger. *** Stone watched the last of the rescue brigade drive slowly down the gravel road. His shoulders slumped beneath a mountain of concerns and thoughts, he trudged to the front porch. Sitting down next to Lazarus, he gratefully accepted the proffered brandy snifter.“Rescued these from the rubble,” Rex said.“Good thing.” He took a swift gulp of the heady liquor, luxuriating in the slight burn that trailed down his throat and warmed his chest.“What did the fire chief say?”“Most of the damage is to the lower level. It looks structurally sound but an engineer will need to verify it. The sauna was the source of the explosion…some kind of rigged bomb.” He shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I can’t remember all the details but the guy the police rounded up has a lot to own up for.”“Adam’s lacky?”“Probably, but it’ll be hard to prove.” Stone swigged the rest of his brandy and looked at Rex. “We need to move up the operation. Obviously, Seamus Adams wants Emma gone. I’d really hoped to avoid this. I can’t believe he’s willing to risk exposure in order to silence her. There’s got to be more to this than what we’re seeing,” Stone said.Lazarus refilled Stone’s glass, topping his own off as well. “Emma is the only witness left who saw the true Seamus Adams. The murderer and gangster before the polished politician surfaced. If she went to Ireland and testified, his entire career would be finished, he’d be destroyed.”Stone shook his head slowly. “There’s more, I just know it. Something doesn’t feel right. Why now? Why find her now?”“She slipped up.”“How? Emma’s been hiding here, she rarely goes to town. Before our intervention, the woman had no form of identification whatsoever.”“Clover?” Rex said, with a shrug of his shoulders.“No way.” Stone shook his head and frowned. “I went through all the paper work, and they’d done a damn good job of covering their tracks.”Stone didn’t like the way Rex stared at him. The man appeared to be waiting for something to click, something to make sense.“How do you think Clover knew how to cover its tracks?” Rex asked.“Easy, any two-bit lawyer could…” He stopped when Rex shook his head. Stone thought back to the corporate documents and Clover’s overseas operations. It’d taken him hours of investigation and a good dozen favors to link the company with Ireland. “What aren’t you saying here, Lazarus?”“It ties back to Emma. All reports indicate Adams clearly thought she’d been killed when trying to escape the country after her father was pronounced dead.”“And?”“Nate Connor executed a clean set-up and retrieval.”Stone quirked a brow and glanced sideways at Rex. “My father smuggled her out of the country?”“Yes.”“Why?”“Don’t you know the relationship?”Stone sat back, uncertain whether he wanted to hear this or not. It wouldn’t change his opinion of his father, but it might assist in the rescue of Hugh Gallagher. “No, I’m blind here, so why not flick on the flashlight and enlighten me?”Rex stared at him for a moment, scratched his chin and shrugged. “Hugh Gallagher contracted your father, via Central Intelligence, to assist in unearthing an illegal arms purchase between a rogue US group and the IRA.”“What? Nate’s nothing more than a used up, ex-alcoholic gambler.”Rex shook his head and the steely gaze in the man’s eyes caused an uncomfortable knot in the pit of Stone’s stomach. “What am I missing?”“Your father’s CIA.”A derisive snort escaped Stone’s nose, and he shook his head in denial. “You’re way off base. CIA? Nate Connor can’t even hold a job at the local lumber yard let alone work for the government.”“You think you’re the only Connor with excellent instincts, impeccable firearm ability and the need to protect our country? No way.” Rex shook his head. “You are your father’s son.”Stone stilled. Questions flew through his mind. If this were true, that his father worked for the CIA, then it certainly explained Clover’s ability to remain cloaked. Another thought struck him, which sent a cold chill of fear crackling through his system. If Seamus Adams’ discovered Clover, followed its trail here, came to River Run to investigate, continued to hold Hugh Gallagher hostage, then there’d be no stopping his conviction to eliminate Emma.“Okay, say I believe you. What happened with this arms deal?”“Nate and Hugh went deep undercover. They formed a tight friendship that extended beyond their current assignment. When the mission was finished, Nate visited Hugh in Ireland, helped eliminate several deadly factions of a growing IRA. He’s known Emma since the day she was born.”“How could I miss all this? It’s too much to understand. You’re telling me that my father was some kind of saint to this Irish family then returned home and beat the crap out of me and broke my mother’s heart. Not to mention….” Stone stood up and held his hand out to block Rex’s response. “No. I’m not even going to think of that.” He glared at Rex and pointed an angry finger in his direction. “Why wait until now to tell me all this?”“You weren’t ready.”“Not ready?” Stone ran his fingers through the tangled mess of hair that topped his head. “I’m still not ready. I’ll never be ready. My father was no hero. He’s a drunk, a gambler, and a murderer.”“True on all accounts except the last one.”Stone dismissed Rex’s comment with a shake of his head and a smirk. “This is crazy.”“Yeah, it really is. Hard to believe that one little debt could culminate in such a huge coincidental mess.”“What debt?”“Hugh Gallagher saved your life. Nate owed him.”Stone stood, frozen in place. He barely felt the icy sting of the snow that whipped around his head, nor the bitter breeze that drove it in perpendicular fashion straight into his eyes.“You’ve got your facts wrong. Again. I don’t know any Hugh Gallagher, and I know for certain my father wouldn’t care whether or not I lived or died.”“No? Well how do you explain the long arm of Seamus Adams? How do you explain Emma’s presence here?”He thought about his father. Nate Connor wasn’t a man to take on trouble, in any form. Something must’ve forced his hand, pushed him to raise a parentless teenage girl, but it certainly wasn’t any debt regarding Stone. The memory of facing down a steel barrel convinced him of this.“I can’t explain anything.”“Stone, listen to me. It’s really all black and white. Adams isn’t thinking clearly. He’s shipped off Gallagher because you came too close in your investigation of Clover’s activities. He thinks he’s one up. Feeling cocky, he gives the command to eliminate Emma. And here we stand, in front of a smoky ruined resort. What do you propose to do?”Stone looked straight into the challenging gaze of Rex Lazarus. “Move up the operation.”A tight smile played across Rex’s face and Stone answered it with one of his own. “I’ll see what I can do,” the smaller man said.“Let’s go inside.”“What? In there? Is it safe?”Stone chuckled. “Yeah. We can sleep in Emma’s quarters. They don’t seem to have been affected by the fire.”Rex eyed the resort nervously but followed Stone anyway. “If you say so.”The two men walked through the smoke ravaged rooms. Water stained the walls, floor, and most of the furniture. One glance into his room confirmed that although it was relatively free of damage, the acrid scent permeated the suite, choking the lungs. He closed the door and continued back through the house.Sliding the partition away that separated Emma’s quarters from the main house, he inhaled the fresh air and quickly hustled Rex through before the stagnating smoke filtered into these small rooms.“This is where Emma lives?” Rex asked, obviously amazed at the postage sized rooms.“Yeah, when she’s not in my rooms. But that only happens when I’m a jerk.”“Which would be always then?”Stone glared at Rex, causing the other man to bellow with laughter.“We’re doing okay, considering,” Stone responded.“I never thought I’d see the day the great Stone Connor crumbled beneath the power of a woman.”“For that comment,” Stone opened the office door. “You get to sleep in here.”Rex eyed the room and shook his head. “Where’s the bed?”Grinning from ear to ear, Stone shut the door and entered Emma’s bedroom. He called back over his shoulder, loud enough for Rex to hear. “There isn’t one.” Laughter bubbled up at the muted curses answering him.Sitting on the edge of her bed, he ran a tired hand over his face. It felt as if he’d been tossing all the losing dice, not making any advancement in this cruel game he and Seamus Adams were playing. Inhaling sharply, a sweet jasmine scent tickled his nose, making him ache for Emma.He couldn’t sort out how he felt about his father being CIA. He knew it didn’t change his hatred or his burning desire for revenge. Stone managed to avoid that rather successfully. Revenge didn’t solve any problems. A sudden vision of his men’s faces crossed his mind. This time, they weren’t writhing on the ground in pain, but were laughing as he solidly beat each and every one of them in their ritual one-on-one pre-mission basketball game.He smiled at the memory and suddenly flashes of better times struck his mind in rapid fire. Stone reached back, caressing Emma’s pillow, feeling her presence in every corner of the room. Even without her touch, she healed.Lying down, he rested his head upon her bed and closed his eyes against the tears that burned. He pushed a fist against his heart, pressing hard on the pain.He missed his men. *** Stone stretched then rubbed his face trying to come to a level of consciousness that allowed thought process. Sun streamed through the window, wiping away the remnants of last night’s storm. He sat up and squinted against the bright glare of light on pristine snow. Muted banging could be heard in the background.Realizing he still wore his smoke streaked pants and shirt, Stone stripped, grabbed Emma’s robe from the closet and wrapped it around his waist. He stepped into the hall and stopped short as a startled Rex exited the office.Glaring at the shorter man, Stone silently challenged him to comment on the pink silk fabric. Rex successfully suppressed his grin, at least enough so that Stone didn’t feel the need to send a fist into his gut.“Um, when you’re done doing whatever it is you were about to do, can I have a few moments of your time?” Lazarus asked, his shoulders shaking slightly.“If you laugh, it will be the last thing that comes out of your mouth today. While I take a shower, why not make yourself useful and scrounge up some coffee?”Rex nodded and hurried out the door into the resort’s kitchen. Stone ignored the snort and muffled laughter that filtered back through the partition. Before entering the bathroom, he veered off into the adjacent laundry area and rescued a pair of jeans and flannel shirt from the dryer.Ten minutes later, refreshed and ready to sit down with Rex, Stone emerged into the kitchen. He stopped in surprise as a dozen men traipsed through the upstairs carrying tool boxes, buckets of chemicals and cleaning supplies, and bags of other paraphernalia he didn’t recognize.“What’s going on?”“Apparently, Emma called in the troops. A structural engineer is currently poking and prodding the foundation and these people are from a specialized fire damage control unit.” Rex handed him a cup of coffee and signaled that he should take a seat at one of the kitchen tables.“Where’s Emma?”Rex shrugged. He handed Stone a stack of papers and pointed to their contents. “You need to sign these.”“What are they?”“They’re acknowledgment of your mission and approval to ship a new unit here for training.”“Here?” Stone gulped down several swigs of the black liquid steaming in his mug. “No way. That’ll never do.”“What do you suggest?”“I’ll meet up with everyone at the normal training center.”“You can’t.”“Why not?”“You’ll lose River Run.”Stone sat back in his chair. He didn’t really care about the estate, but he’d already imparted his feelings to Rex regarding the title transfer to Nate. Unacceptable.“What’d the lawyer say?”“If you remain here through the first week of March, he’ll allow you a two week absence to take care of business, but you must return before the first day of Spring.”“Two weeks?”Rex nodded. “Apparently, he’s able to bend the rules enough for that trip as long as you spend the majority of this season here at the resort.”Stone sighed. How was he ever going to explain this to Emma?“When will my unit arrive?”“After the first of the year.”“Mission date?”“March 7.”“No sooner?”“Do you want this resort?” Rex narrowed a look at him, causing Stone to think every aspect through.“No,” he said. “But I’m not giving it to Nate.”“Hugh will survive another two months but will you?”“What’s that supposed to mean?”Rex leaned close. “It means you’re too emotionally involved. Can you train here with the distraction of pretty Miss O’Malley?”“Yes.” Stone pushed away from the table, paused then bent and scribbled his name on the documents scattered across the polished wood. “Bring it on.”The front door flung open and Seth Connor stepped through. Stomping snow from his boots, he pulled off his sheepskin gloves and shrugged out of a heavy denim jacket.“Mornin’ folks. I see everyone’s here just as Emma indicated.”“Where is she?” Stone asked, looking behind his cousin’s back and expecting to find a face his heart ached to see.“Didn’t she call?”“Call? No. I thought she was with you.”Seth looked at his feet and shuffled uncomfortably from foot to foot.“Where is she Seth? Didn’t you take her home last night?”Worry and concern stabbed at Stone’s gut.“Not exactly.”“Tell me where Emma is?”Seth looked up then cast his eyes quickly down. “She wouldn’t come back to the ranch.”“Where’d you take her?” Stone became increasingly angry when Seth wouldn’t look at him. He grabbed the man’s shoulder and shook it.“Tell me.”Seth tossed a desperate glance in his direction, broke free and headed into the living room. He paused, ran a hand through his hair and sighed like the entire world hung on his shoulders.“She’s at your father’s.”",

      "content": "Chapter Thirteen Emma watched the approach of the black Jeep. Her heart hammered in tempo to the vehicle’s headlong push along the bumpy, dirt road.“What’re you doin’?”She turned and looked at Nate, a soft smile creeping upon her face. He’d made breakfast and now busily scrubbed the burnt remnants of scrambled eggs and hash browns from his cast-iron skillet. He looked up at her with brows raised.“Stone’s driving up.”“How close?”“He’s almost here.” She turned back to the window. The Jeep maneuvered around a particularly slick turn and plowed forward, refusing to give an ounce of speed to the deep snowy trenches.“You’d better get your stuff together.”Emma moved away from the paned glass and shook her head. “I’m not going anywhere.”“Yes you are.” He slammed the skillet on the countertop and walked around the kitchen island. “I don’t want trouble with my son. Get your stuff together.”“I…” She couldn’t finish her sentence. Nate’s words stung. She felt lost. Narrowing her eyes, Emma nodded. “Fine. I’m sorry to have caused you any discomfort.” She spun around and gathered the smoky ruins of her evening gown. “I’ll change and leave these sweats in the bathroom.”“Emma…” Nate’s voice trailed after her, but she slammed the door shut, silencing his protests. She couldn’t believe Nate was kicking her out. If anything, she thought he’d be happy to shelter her from Stone.Hearing the Jeep door close with a bang, Emma folded Nate’s sweats in a neat pile and straightened the tattered velvet that hung haphazardly off her shoulders. She stalked out of the bathroom, slipped on her high heels, cast one last glance at Nate and walked out the door into the bitterly cold morning.Stone stood in front of the vehicle, his arms crossed over his chest and thunderbolts of anger crashing from his eyes.“Are you ready to go home?” His voice was calm, but Emma didn’t miss the tightly controlled fury that laced his words.“Yes.” She walked past him and jumped into the passenger seat of the Jeep. Shutting the door securely behind her, he walked behind the vehicle, climbing in next to her. His eyes never once strayed to the figure on the front porch of the cabin.Emma refused to allow her heart to melt at the sight of Nate. His hands were shoved deep into his pockets as he watched them pull away, a weary expression deepening the wrinkles along his brow.He stood alone. A solitary figure framed by an empty house.As the vehicle jostled her, she resisted reaching for Stone’s arm to steady herself, to confirm her existence.She didn’t want to end up like Nate Connor.“What were you thinking?” Stone yanked the wheel to the left and down shifted around a slick ice patch.“You told me to go.”With a violent toss of some extremely creative swear words, he slammed on the brakes and shut the engine off. “So you ran to my father?”“Yes.”“You tell me you love me, and then I discover you went to a place you knew would turn my guts inside out. I don’t understand.”Emma’s anger burned her throat. He’d twisted everything around. “You made it quite clear last night that River Run was your priority. I left to let you to deal with your precious property.”“My precious property?” Stone spit the words at her. “I don’t care about River Run. I wanted you somewhere safe. You looked exhausted.”Emotions rolled in her chest, tangling and tying into snags and snarls of confusion. She’d overreacted. Again. Why did she let him do this to her? Her vulnerability suddenly seemed to loom higher than any obstacle she’d ever had to climb. The thought that he’d come for her. That he’d driven upon land that probably burned his feet like acid to collect her sorry ass meant she was clearly an idiot.She turned from staring at the piles of snow heaped around scarred birch tree trunks and gazed into a face that demanded answers. “Your tone dismissed me.”Stone continued to glare at her, and she noted the slight flush that crept up his neck. “It did not. If I remember correctly, I kissed you right before sending you off with Seth.”“It felt like you dismissed me.” Emma tried to hang tight to her convictions.Replaying last evening in her mind, she couldn’t believe she’d actually asked him to leave. What possessed her? It didn’t matter if a nuclear missile locked on to River Run, Emma craved Stone. He encompassed her soul.He dropped his gaze and banged his head upon his hands wrapped tightly around the steering wheel. “You’re making me crazy, woman.”“Do you want me to leave?”He slanted her a look that almost forced laughter from her chest. She tried not to smile.“No.” Sitting back, he reached over and pulled her roughly into his arms. “What I want is you in my bed.” Without waiting for a response, Stone bent his head and plundered her mouth. His kiss cauterized her hurt, pumped blood into her veins and had her head spinning in wild circles.His hands were hot on her skin. The silence of the Jeep echoed with their gasps of delight and groans of hunger. Emma pulled back. Stone’s blue eyes were dark with passion, and she smiled knowing exactly how to deepen them even further.“I think it’s time to go home.”“Home? To a house full of construction workers?” He pulled her closer, nibbling the sensitive lobe of her ear. It caused shivers of desire to ripple down her neck and pool between her legs. It took a moment for his words to penetrate her lust filled brain.“Construction? Oh dear God, you haven’t left the resort unattended?”Stone shrugged, concentrating on kissing every inch of bare skin from her shoulder to the small hollow of her neck. “Rex is there.”“Stone, stop that. We need to be there. It’s our…” She stopped, shaking her head. “It’s your investment.”“Don’t care.” He grazed his mouth across hers, teasing her lips with his tongue, pouring fire on over sensitive nerves.Emma sighed but pushed away. Her mind filled with visions of hot breath, steamy windows and a Jeep rocking madly on the powdered snow. “This,” she said, “isn’t going to happen.” Pulling her dress back up her shoulders and straightening her hair, she sat primly back in her seat. “I want to go home.”“I was about to take you there.”She tried not to grin at his euphemism but failed. Stone’s eyes twinkled as he turned the key and revved the engine. He drove down the rest of the drive, the softness in his face slowly fading. Emma watched him swallow hard when he swung onto the main road, refusing to look at the dented old mailbox with a hastily scrawled Connor on the side.“I’m sorry.”“For what?”“Making you come here.”He tossed her a look that tugged her heart. “Jose, my second in command, used to have a saying. You create the environment you live in. I never understood it until now.”Emma bit her lip. He’d never spoken about his unit or any of the men that died on his last mission. She didn’t interrupt but nodded for him to continue.“Every damn time,” he said, “I yelled at him for doing something wrong or not being where I expected him to be, he’d shake his head sadly and say those words to me. It used to make me crazy.” He laughed and shook his head. “Jose never took any of my anger seriously.” He frowned and barked out another round of laughter. “In fact, I think he was on some sort of mission to reform me.”“Why? Were you as incorrigible then as you are now?”He smiled and winked at her. “Nah, just an irascible old coot. Jose insisted there was life outside of our little unit, and I told him not for me there wasn’t. But,” Stone shifted gears, and the Jeep sped forward. “I guess he was right after all.”“He’d be proud.” Emma reached over and squeezed his knee.“Yeah,” he said softly. “He’d be damn proud.”She turned her face to the heat of the morning sun. Neither one spoke again. Emma basked in the silence, it sang loudly of their comfort and their closeness. *** Walking amidst the charred ruins of the basement level, she bit back the swell of sadness. After several days of clean up, the upstairs was habitable but this area would take months to put in order. Men dragged water-damaged antique furniture up the stairs and out of the house, hopefully to be saved by the restoration company she’d hired. The burnt feather beds stank like rotten eggs. Puddles pooled in little circles all over the uneven hardwood floor, shimmering with soot.“It’s not too bad,” Stone said from behind her.She turned and tried to hide her grief. “It could’ve been worse.”He traced his finger gently down her cheek. “This will be back to normal before you know it.”“I know. It’s just…” Emma shrugged.“I’ve an idea,” he interrupted. “Why don’t we make a few changes, improve on the old?”“Like what?”“What about a larger weight room, an indoor Jacuzzi, or I know…” He stepped over a pile of burnt rubble and pointed to a partially damaged wall. “Let’s knock down this wall and make a media room. That way when kids are staying here they can use this space as their movie and entertainment area. It’ll save a lot on the wear and tear of the living room.”Emma bit her lip. He had a point. “But we’ll lose a guest suite.”“No we won’t. We’ll expand out, create another suite beneath the new deck.”She smiled, her heart a bit lighter. “Yes, that would work. I’ll begin immediately on a mocked up floor print. When did you say the remodeling company was arriving?”“Day after tomorrow.”“Okay. I can have a rough draft done by then.” Emma’s mind suddenly whirled with ideas. A media room. What a wonderful addition. She turned and hugged Stone fiercely. Standing on her tiptoes, she pulled his head down and whispered in his ear. “I reward for sparks of brilliance.”His chest rumbled, and she nipped his ear. She felt him tense and pull her tighter against his chest. “Let’s kick all these people out. I want to collect.”“Tonight…” Emma kissed him quickly and escaped. She’d tons to do and very little time.Passing Rex in the narrow staircase, she smiled brightly and greeted him. “Good morning. Did you sleep well?”“Merry Christmas.”“What?”“It’s Christmas today, right?” Rex frowned.“Is it?”“December 25th normally means Christmas.”Emma stood with her mouth hanging open. She counted out the days since the party, and Rex was absolutely correct.“Why are all these people working on Christmas?” Oh, this wasn’t right. Not at all.“Maybe they’re Jewish?” Rex offered. She could tell he was trying not to laugh at her and glared at him.“Make them go home.”Turning back around, she led the way into the basement. Stone assisted several men in dismantling one of the four poster beds.“Stone,” she said, tugging on his arm. “It’s Christmas.”“I know, honey.”“Am I the only clueless one here? Tell these men to go home and enjoy the holiday with their family.”“They’re getting double-time. I think for some that means a lot more than Christmas.”Emma shook her head. “No. I won’t have it. Pay them double-time for an entire day but send them home now.”Stone frowned then shrugged. “Okay, you’re the boss.” He turned to the men and began explaining Emma’s instructions. She didn’t wait for their reaction but smiled as cheers reached her ears. Almost to the top of the stairs, another thought crossed her mind.“Rex,” she called back down.“Yes, ma’am.”“Why’re you here?”“Waiting on a shipment.”“Don’t you have family?”He looked up at her and shook his head. “Stone’s about it.”“Well then, make sure you’re properly attired this evening for a full blown Christmas celebration. Once these guys leave, I want you and Stone to hit the woods and bring me back the best Christmas tree you can find.”“Yes, ma’am.” Rex shouted, saluting her.Emma shook her head, swearing to herself. She couldn’t believe she’d not realized it was Christmas. Obviously, the fire had consumed more than the elaborate tree she’d decorated the day after Thanksgiving. It’d fried her brain as well.Turning into the front foyer, Emma heard soft singing coming from the kitchen. Curious, she headed in that direction.She stopped, stunned by the action taking place. Tilly pulled item after item out of about a zillion grocery bags covering the counters. Her normally perfectly coiffed blonde hair was pulled through a scrunchy and piled on top of her head. She had no makeup on, making her look very young and innocent.“What’s going on?”“Well,” Tilly said, wiping her hands on a paper towel after dumping a very large turkey in the sink. “I think I’m preparing Christmas dinner.”“I didn’t ask.”“You didn’t have to.” She held up her hand before Emma could interrupt. “I know I’m not a stellar employee, attitude and all that. But I do love this place, and I suppose that includes you.”“I’m speechless.” Emma couldn’t connect this woman with the nail-sharpening, stiletto-heeled cat who normally appeared for work.“Well Speechless, do you think you could manage a few menial tasks in the way of cooking?”“I believe I could do that, but first how about some music to put us in the mood?”“Oh no,” Tilly raced for the stereo. “You’re not putting on your childhood record of Rudolph.”“Oh yes, I am. Get out of my way, I know Gene Autry’s in here somewhere.”Tilly allowed herself to be pushed aside and went back to the kitchen, muttering beneath her breath. Emma giggled as she popped the album from its cover and placed it on the turn table. She played this every year, and the moment the deep crooning of Gene Autry’s voice hit her ears, she knew…Christmas had arrived. *** Placing the last pie in the oven, Emma surveyed the mess she and Tilly created. It’d been one hurried preparation of turkey and all the trimmings.“Look at what we’ve done,” she said.“Yeah, quite the cooks aren’t we?”“Why don’t you go take a shower and I’ll clean?”“No, it’s okay. I’ll clean this up.”Emma frowned. This flipside to Tilly niggled at her trust cavity. “Really, go use my room and shower up for dinner. I’ll tidy up then find the boys. We should be eating by nine, right?”“Yeah. I’ll change then lay out hors d’oeuvres and cool the champagne.”“Sounds good.” Emma turned and made quick work of the dirty dishes and messy counters.A pair of strong arms circled her waist and she leaned back against Stone’s chest.“Smells yummy in here.” He kissed her head then nuzzled her neck sending shivers of delight down her spine.She turned in his arms and linked her hands behind his neck. “Whatcha up to?”“About to wrangle you a tree. Want to come?”She grinned and nodded. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”They quickly donned heavy jackets and boots. Making their way outside, Stone snagged a saw and tugged at her hand.“Where’re we going?”“Over the back ridge. There’s a great stretch of pines and…” His voice trailed off when he bent his head, but Emma saw a twinkle in his eye and the grin tugging at his mouth made her wonder what was up.The sky mimicked the ground. Heavy white clouds hung low and a light dusting of snow fell gracefully around them. Silence muffled Mother Nature. The snow crunching loudly beneath their footsteps sounded like an invasion. Stone held her hand, and she was content to follow his lead.Crossing the ridge she spotted a trail of smoke rising lazily into the sky. Inhaling the thick pine scent, she broke free of Stone, stretching her arms to the sky and twirling in a circle.“This is wonderful. Do you think those people would mind if we kicked them out of their cabin and stole a few hours of solitude?”Stone raised a brow as she stared into his wind-burnt face. “I don’t think they’ll mind at all. Let’s go.” He grabbed her hand and began running toward the tiny log cabin.“I was kidding,” she said, her breath coming out in thick white plumes.“I’m not.”She pulled back and dug her heels in. “Stone we can’t just barge into someone’s home.”“Yes, we can.”Emma laughed at his craziness. “You’re certifiable. No we can’t.”He pulled her against his chest and bent his head. “Yes, we can,” he said softly against her ear, causing shivers of excitement to stream down her back. His cheeks were cold but she captured the heat of his mouth with her own. The instant fire that burst deep within her soul snatched her breath, leaving her gasping and wanting.“I wish we could.”The passion that sparkled within the deep blue depths of Stone’s gaze hinted at his thoughts. “It’s my cabin.” He swept her up, cradling her within his arms like a baby. “Let’s go christen it.”“Yours?” Emma paused, taking in the surroundings briefly. “Oh right, I’d gotten turned around. This is the old tackle lodge.”“That’s right.”“But I thought we were hunting shrubbery.”Stone shook his head and winked. “I lied.”“Remember what happened the last time you did that?”“Oh yeah,” he said and quickened his pace.Emma laughed, holding on tightly. The lightness in her heart contradicted the weight of her emotions. Love surrounded her, absorbing every inch of her being. It felt wonderful.Kicking the cabin door open, he let her slip from his arms. She stared in wonder. There was a thick blanket in front of the roaring fire laden with wine, fruit, cheese and chocolate. A small gold wrapped box with a red velvet ribbon lay in the center.“Merry Christmas,” Stone said.She turned, tears burning her eyes. “I have nothing…”“Shush,” he reached over and placed a finger over her mouth. “You’re all I need.”“I…” her voice cracked, unable to carry beyond the tightness in her throat.“Love me,” he finished for her. “I know.”All their differences, all their problems disappeared beneath the warmth of his gaze. A future together flared into reality. They’d stay here together forever, raise a family at River Run.Emma smiled and wrapped her arms around his neck. Kissing him tenderly, she allowed the promise of a life bright in love filter from her soul to his.“This is the best Christmas present ever.”“You haven’t even opened it yet.” Stone unhooked her arms and helped her out of her jacket. She shucked her boots and raced to the blanket.Stone followed and sprawled next to her, gathering her around the waist and pulling her snug against his chest. She held the little box tightly, afraid to open it. He flashed her a grin and raised his brows.“Want me to do the honors?”“No,” she said, struggling to a sitting position. “I’ve got it under control.”“I think I’ll have to change that.” He tugged at her shirt and ran warm hands along her skin. She sighed in delight, hastily unwrapping the present.Discarding the bow and paper, she held a small velvet box in her hand. Stone stilled. Emma flipped the lid and gasped as brilliant flashes of green fire glistened in the firelight. A small eagle lay nestled against red satin. Its graceful curves of gold were skimmed with a dazzling line of emeralds. Stone reached around and pulled the pendent from the box, snaking the chain around her neck and fastening it at her nape.“It reminded me of you.”She turned and threw her arms around his neck, knocking him back onto the blanket. “It’s beautiful. I love it.”He captured her kiss and held her tight, the feel of his heart beating wildly against her chest. “When did you say dinner starts?”“Nine.” Emma slipped her shirt off, straddled his hips and slowly unbuttoned Stone’s top. Fire light flickered, casting dancing shadows upon his chest.“Plenty of time.” Stone inhaled sharply as she bent and rolled her tongue around his nipple.He unbuttoned her jeans, easing the zipper down and running his hands across her hips. Smiling into his eyes, she settled her lips against his and whispered into his mouth. “I love you.”She felt Stone’s lips curve upward. He pulled her closer, deepening the kiss.“I see many more years of sneaking out to this cabin,” Emma continued, nibbling at the corner of his mouth.“That, I promise.” Stone answered tugging her jeans the rest of the way down. She helped him discard his clothes and before a lucid thought crossed her mind, his passion painted all the words he didn’t speak out loud. *** Stone clasped her hand beneath the cherry red linen tablecloth. Her stomach stuffed, her heart full.“The resort on St. Thomas was a hoot,” Tilly said. She’d been regaling Rex with tales of her vacation adventures for the better part of the meal.“Tell me more about the hot tub,” Rex encouraged, leaning forward in interest.Hiding a grin, Emma figured that Rex’s Christmas present would be unwrapping Tilly.This new-and-improved-attitude River Run’s chef adopted still bothered her. Tilly never did anything without expecting a huge return. It didn’t make sense. However, in the Christmas spirit, she refused to analyze it too deeply.“I’ve got to write down that resort,” Rex said. “Emma do you have any paper?”At the mention of her name, she refocused on the conversation. “Huh? Paper? Yes, of course I do. I’ll be right back.” Kissing Stone on the forehead, she scooted behind him and decided to grab a pad and pen from his suite. It was closer than the kitchen.She shut the door, closing off Tilly’s squeals of laughter. Okay, the woman was becoming annoying. Flicking on the light switch, she headed for the desk. The drawer wouldn’t open. It must have swelled with all the humidity caused by the water from downstairs. Tugging on the knob, it finally slid out and she stumbled back, spilling the contents on the floor.Emma tucked a pad of paper and pen to the side and began restacking the drawer. She picked up a pile of papers and placed them on the bottom before adding smaller stuff on top. As she rested the calculator on the ivory pages a name caught her attention. Peering closer, she confirmed it was the title of her attorney’s office.Curious, she pulled the papers back out to look at them more closely.Dear Mr. Connor,It is with great pleasure that I enclose a fully executed Contract of Sale for River Run. The closing is scheduled for August 15th, which more than adequately falls within the terms of your Aunt’s Last Will and Testament…The rest of the letter blurred. Emma’s heart stopped beating and her hands shook as she set it aside to peer at the contract. Glancing at the front page, a sum of seven million dollars burned her eyes with the devil’s own fury.“Emma?” Stone called from the dining room. She could hear his chair scrape against the floor and with numb hands, she hastily shoved the documents in the drawer, piled all the other stuff on top and shoved it back into place.“Hey,” Stone opened the bedroom door. “What’s taking so long?”“Nothing,” she said, praying her voice sounded normal. “I just needed to use the bathroom first. Here’s the pad and pen Rex wanted.” She handed everything to Stone and turned to head into his bathroom.“I thought you said you already did that?”“Oh,” she paused and clenched her hands together to stop their trembling. “I forgot to wash my hands.”Frowning, he shrugged. “Okay, but make it snappy. I miss you.” He shut the door, and she heard Rex yell some kind of lewd comment at him which he laughed at and then all sound faded to a harsh buzz as Emma’s world slowly shattered.",

      "content": "Chapter Thirteen Emma watched the approach of the black Jeep. Her heart hammered in tempo to the vehicle’s headlong push along the bumpy, dirt road.“What’re you doin’?”She turned and looked at Nate, a soft smile creeping upon her face. He’d made breakfast and now busily scrubbed the burnt remnants of scrambled eggs and hash browns from his cast-iron skillet. He looked up at her with brows raised.“Stone’s driving up.”“How close?”“He’s almost here.” She turned back to the window. The Jeep maneuvered around a particularly slick turn and plowed forward, refusing to give an ounce of speed to the deep snowy trenches.“You’d better get your stuff together.”Emma moved away from the paned glass and shook her head. “I’m not going anywhere.”“Yes you are.” He slammed the skillet on the countertop and walked around the kitchen island. “I don’t want trouble with my son. Get your stuff together.”“I…” She couldn’t finish her sentence. Nate’s words stung. She felt lost. Narrowing her eyes, Emma nodded. “Fine. I’m sorry to have caused you any discomfort.” She spun around and gathered the smoky ruins of her evening gown. “I’ll change and leave these sweats in the bathroom.”“Emma…” Nate’s voice trailed after her, but she slammed the door shut, silencing his protests. She couldn’t believe Nate was kicking her out. If anything, she thought he’d be happy to shelter her from Stone.Hearing the Jeep door close with a bang, Emma folded Nate’s sweats in a neat pile and straightened the tattered velvet that hung haphazardly off her shoulders. She stalked out of the bathroom, slipped on her high heels, cast one last glance at Nate and walked out the door into the bitterly cold morning.Stone stood in front of the vehicle, his arms crossed over his chest and thunderbolts of anger crashing from his eyes.“Are you ready to go home?” His voice was calm, but Emma didn’t miss the tightly controlled fury that laced his words.“Yes.” She walked past him and jumped into the passenger seat of the Jeep. Shutting the door securely behind her, he walked behind the vehicle, climbing in next to her. His eyes never once strayed to the figure on the front porch of the cabin.Emma refused to allow her heart to melt at the sight of Nate. His hands were shoved deep into his pockets as he watched them pull away, a weary expression deepening the wrinkles along his brow.He stood alone. A solitary figure framed by an empty house.As the vehicle jostled her, she resisted reaching for Stone’s arm to steady herself, to confirm her existence.She didn’t want to end up like Nate Connor.“What were you thinking?” Stone yanked the wheel to the left and down shifted around a slick ice patch.“You told me to go.”With a violent toss of some extremely creative swear words, he slammed on the brakes and shut the engine off. “So you ran to my father?”“Yes.”“You tell me you love me, and then I discover you went to a place you knew would turn my guts inside out. I don’t understand.”Emma’s anger burned her throat. He’d twisted everything around. “You made it quite clear last night that River Run was your priority. I left to let you to deal with your precious property.”“My precious property?” Stone spit the words at her. “I don’t care about River Run. I wanted you somewhere safe. You looked exhausted.”Emotions rolled in her chest, tangling and tying into snags and snarls of confusion. She’d overreacted. Again. Why did she let him do this to her? Her vulnerability suddenly seemed to loom higher than any obstacle she’d ever had to climb. The thought that he’d come for her. That he’d driven upon land that probably burned his feet like acid to collect her sorry ass meant she was clearly an idiot.She turned from staring at the piles of snow heaped around scarred birch tree trunks and gazed into a face that demanded answers. “Your tone dismissed me.”Stone continued to glare at her, and she noted the slight flush that crept up his neck. “It did not. If I remember correctly, I kissed you right before sending you off with Seth.”“It felt like you dismissed me.” Emma tried to hang tight to her convictions.Replaying last evening in her mind, she couldn’t believe she’d actually asked him to leave. What possessed her? It didn’t matter if a nuclear missile locked on to River Run, Emma craved Stone. He encompassed her soul.He dropped his gaze and banged his head upon his hands wrapped tightly around the steering wheel. “You’re making me crazy, woman.”“Do you want me to leave?”He slanted her a look that almost forced laughter from her chest. She tried not to smile.“No.” Sitting back, he reached over and pulled her roughly into his arms. “What I want is you in my bed.” Without waiting for a response, Stone bent his head and plundered her mouth. His kiss cauterized her hurt, pumped blood into her veins and had her head spinning in wild circles.His hands were hot on her skin. The silence of the Jeep echoed with their gasps of delight and groans of hunger. Emma pulled back. Stone’s blue eyes were dark with passion, and she smiled knowing exactly how to deepen them even further.“I think it’s time to go home.”“Home? To a house full of construction workers?” He pulled her closer, nibbling the sensitive lobe of her ear. It caused shivers of desire to ripple down her neck and pool between her legs. It took a moment for his words to penetrate her lust filled brain.“Construction? Oh dear God, you haven’t left the resort unattended?”Stone shrugged, concentrating on kissing every inch of bare skin from her shoulder to the small hollow of her neck. “Rex is there.”“Stone, stop that. We need to be there. It’s our…” She stopped, shaking her head. “It’s your investment.”“Don’t care.” He grazed his mouth across hers, teasing her lips with his tongue, pouring fire on over sensitive nerves.Emma sighed but pushed away. Her mind filled with visions of hot breath, steamy windows and a Jeep rocking madly on the powdered snow. “This,” she said, “isn’t going to happen.” Pulling her dress back up her shoulders and straightening her hair, she sat primly back in her seat. “I want to go home.”“I was about to take you there.”She tried not to grin at his euphemism but failed. Stone’s eyes twinkled as he turned the key and revved the engine. He drove down the rest of the drive, the softness in his face slowly fading. Emma watched him swallow hard when he swung onto the main road, refusing to look at the dented old mailbox with a hastily scrawled Connor on the side.“I’m sorry.”“For what?”“Making you come here.”He tossed her a look that tugged her heart. “Jose, my second in command, used to have a saying. You create the environment you live in. I never understood it until now.”Emma bit her lip. He’d never spoken about his unit or any of the men that died on his last mission. She didn’t interrupt but nodded for him to continue.“Every damn time,” he said, “I yelled at him for doing something wrong or not being where I expected him to be, he’d shake his head sadly and say those words to me. It used to make me crazy.” He laughed and shook his head. “Jose never took any of my anger seriously.” He frowned and barked out another round of laughter. “In fact, I think he was on some sort of mission to reform me.”“Why? Were you as incorrigible then as you are now?”He smiled and winked at her. “Nah, just an irascible old coot. Jose insisted there was life outside of our little unit, and I told him not for me there wasn’t. But,” Stone shifted gears, and the Jeep sped forward. “I guess he was right after all.”“He’d be proud.” Emma reached over and squeezed his knee.“Yeah,” he said softly. “He’d be damn proud.”She turned her face to the heat of the morning sun.

The lightness in her heart contradicted the weight of her emotions. Love surrounded her, absorbing every inch of her being. It felt wonderful.Kicking the cabin door open, he let her slip from his arms. She stared in wonder. There was a thick blanket in front of the roaring fire laden with wine, fruit, cheese and chocolate. A small gold wrapped box with a red velvet ribbon lay in the center.“Merry Christmas,” Stone said.She turned, tears burning her eyes. “I have nothing…”“Shush,” he reached over and placed a finger over her mouth. “You’re all I need.”“I…” her voice cracked, unable to carry beyond the tightness in her throat.“Love me,” he finished for her. “I know.”All their differences, all their problems disappeared beneath the warmth of his gaze. A future together flared into reality. They’d stay here together forever, raise a family at River Run.Emma smiled and wrapped her arms around his neck. Kissing him tenderly, she allowed the promise of a life bright in love filter from her soul to his.“This is the best Christmas present ever.”“You haven’t even opened it yet.” Stone unhooked her arms and helped her out of her jacket. She shucked her boots and raced to the blanket.Stone followed and sprawled next to her, gathering her around the waist and pulling her snug against his chest. She held the little box tightly, afraid to open it. He flashed her a grin and raised his brows.“Want me to do the honors?”“No,” she said, struggling to a sitting position. “I’ve got it under control.”“I think I’ll have to change that.” He tugged at her shirt and ran warm hands along her skin. She sighed in delight, hastily unwrapping the present.Discarding the bow and paper, she held a small velvet box in her hand. Stone stilled. Emma flipped the lid and gasped as brilliant flashes of green fire glistened in the firelight. A small eagle lay nestled against red satin. Its graceful curves of gold were skimmed with a dazzling line of emeralds. Stone reached around and pulled the pendent from the box, snaking the chain around her neck and fastening it at her nape.“It reminded me of you.”She turned and threw her arms around his neck, knocking him back onto the blanket. “It’s beautiful. I love it.”He captured her kiss and held her tight, the feel of his heart beating wildly against her chest. “When did you say dinner starts?”“Nine.” Emma slipped her shirt off, straddled his hips and slowly unbuttoned Stone’s top. Fire light flickered, casting dancing shadows upon his chest.“Plenty of time.” Stone inhaled sharply as she bent and rolled her tongue around his nipple.He unbuttoned her jeans, easing the zipper down and running his hands across her hips. Smiling into his eyes, she settled her lips against his and whispered into his mouth. “I love you.”She felt Stone’s lips curve upward. He pulled her closer, deepening the kiss.“I see many more years of sneaking out to this cabin,” Emma continued, nibbling at the corner of his mouth.“That, I promise.” Stone answered tugging her jeans the rest of the way down. She helped him discard his clothes and before a lucid thought crossed her mind, his passion painted all the words he didn’t speak out loud. *** Stone clasped her hand beneath the cherry red linen tablecloth. Her stomach stuffed, her heart full.“The resort on St. Thomas was a hoot,” Tilly said. She’d been regaling Rex with tales of her vacation adventures for the better part of the meal.“Tell me more about the hot tub,” Rex encouraged, leaning forward in interest.Hiding a grin, Emma figured that Rex’s Christmas present would be unwrapping Tilly.This new-and-improved-attitude River Run’s chef adopted still bothered her. Tilly never did anything without expecting a huge return. It didn’t make sense. However, in the Christmas spirit, she refused to analyze it too deeply.“I’ve got to write down that resort,” Rex said. “Emma do you have any paper?”At the mention of her name, she refocused on the conversation. “Huh? Paper? Yes, of course I do. I’ll be right back.” Kissing Stone on the forehead, she scooted behind him and decided to grab a pad and pen from his suite. It was closer than the kitchen.She shut the door, closing off Tilly’s squeals of laughter. Okay, the woman was becoming annoying. Flicking on the light switch, she headed for the desk. The drawer wouldn’t open. It must have swelled with all the humidity caused by the water from downstairs. Tugging on the knob, it finally slid out and she stumbled back, spilling the contents on the floor.Emma tucked a pad of paper and pen to the side and began restacking the drawer. She picked up a pile of papers and placed them on the bottom before adding smaller stuff on top. As she rested the calculator on the ivory pages a name caught her attention. Peering closer, she confirmed it was the title of her attorney’s office.Curious, she pulled the papers back out to look at them more closely.Dear Mr. Connor,It is with great pleasure that I enclose a fully executed Contract of Sale for River Run. The closing is scheduled for August 15th, which more than adequately falls within the terms of your Aunt’s Last Will and Testament…The rest of the letter blurred. Emma’s heart stopped beating and her hands shook as she set it aside to peer at the contract. Glancing at the front page, a sum of seven million dollars burned her eyes with the devil’s own fury.“Emma?” Stone called from the dining room. She could hear his chair scrape against the floor and with numb hands, she hastily shoved the documents in the drawer, piled all the other stuff on top and shoved it back into place.“Hey,” Stone opened the bedroom door. “What’s taking so long?”“Nothing,” she said, praying her voice sounded normal. “I just needed to use the bathroom first. Here’s the pad and pen Rex wanted.” She handed everything to Stone and turned to head into his bathroom.“I thought you said you already did that?”“Oh,” she paused and clenched her hands together to stop their trembling. “I forgot to wash my hands.”Frowning, he shrugged. “Okay, but make it snappy. I miss you.” He shut the door, and she heard Rex yell some kind of lewd comment at him which he laughed at and then all sound faded to a harsh buzz as Emma’s world slowly shattered.",

      "content": "Chapter Fourteen Stone eyed the massive peaks of the Grand Tetons. Ever since Christmas, it felt as if Emma had built a wall around her heart rivaling the majestic rocky mountain. She slept in his bed, loved his body, but her heart remained distant.The pendant he’d given her lay nestled within its box. Its legacy never recognized. When he’d visited one of the local Jackson Hole artists and explained the dynamics of his idea, the craftsman accepted the challenge with excitement. For Stone, the eagle represented Emma’s freedom. He’d hoped she would witness within the graceful bird her own beauty and perfection.He wanted her to fly. He prayed she’d no longer fear. Instead, the piece of jewelry remained captive, denied the light and life her warmth would create.He needed to do more.Furrowing his brow and digging deep inside, he knew he’d find the answer. She deserved more from him, more than his rescue of her father, more than River Run.A thought crossed his mind, and he shuddered at the task it demanded.“Stone?” He turned at the sound of Rex’s voice. The sun faded against the snowy backdrop, dropping the living room into a dusky rose and quickly chilling the air.“Yeah?”“I thought you might want to know that your unit will arrive on Monday.”He nodded. “I’ve cleared enough space downstairs for them.”“Are we doing anything tomorrow for New Year’s Eve?”Stone shrugged then walked to the fireplace in disgust. Stacking logs on top of kindling, he flicked a match and watched as it burst into flame. “I haven’t asked Emma. She’s been too busy canceling next year’s reservations.”“How long is River Run out of commission?” Rex came to stand next to him. Stone poked at the fire.“I think she’s cancelled everything up until May.”“Is that why she seems depressed?”Stone glared at his friend. “Don’t you need to be back in Washington?”Rex laughed and shook his head. “I’m here until your men arrive.”“Great.” Stone stepped back from the fire, absently wondering where Emma might be.“You gonna make a life here?” Rex said.He thought carefully before answering. “I thought I might, but I’m not so sure now.”“Why?”“Too much pain. The past, my father…” he paused, running his hands through his hair. “It’s too much.”“What’s too much?” Emma said from the kitchen. He glanced up and smiled. Her hair was windblown, and her cheeks red from being outside. She slipped out of her barn coat and rubbed her hands together.“This weather,” Stone replied. “Does it ever stop snowing?”“Yeah, in July.” She smiled but backed away when he approached. “Chili all right for dinner?”“Fine.” Stone hated her retreat, both physical and emotional. He decided it was another reason to avoid that head long dive into permanent commitment. He was thankful he’d never told her how he felt. If she couldn’t accept a simple pendant, she’d never agree to wear his ring.“Emma?” Rex walked over, interrupting Stone’s thoughts.“Chili not good with you, Rex?”“Oh no, it’s fine. But I’m afraid I’ve something to tell you, and you’re probably not going to like it.”Stone panicked. He attempted to catch Rex’s eye and prevent him from speaking, but the man ignored him.“What?” Emma scooted up on a barstool and waited patiently.Stone closed his eyes. He didn’t want to witness the hurt that he knew would hit her eyes the second Rex opened his mouth.“I’m having a Ranger unit flown in on Monday. They’ll be staying in the basement and training with Stone.”“I see,” she said softly. Stone turned and left the kitchen. He couldn’t face her, didn’t want to know what she might think. Wasn’t it obvious she couldn’t love him? And now, seeing this side of his life, she’d never relinquish control of her heart…no matter how hard he tried.Stone convinced himself it was for the best. It’d never work. At some point she’d want him to make peace with his father. Never, he swore silently. That would never happen. *** Emma moved around the kitchen. A chuck roast steamed on the stove, waiting to be chopped and added to the chili. The aroma of the garlic-seasoned meat drifted in the air. It’d been a shock to learn that Stone reenlisted in the military, but it told her many things.He needed to sell River Run.He was leaving.Tears wanted to flow, but she bit them back. No more crying. She sickened herself with her weakness. Emma O’Malley needed to take control of her life. If it meant living without the man she loved, then that’s what it meant. Stone had given her a gift, and she planned on using it.Pausing, she glanced out the kitchen window. It seemed impossible. The mere thought of walking beyond the gates of River Run with an identity brought nervous flutters to her stomach.She’d do it, though.She sliced the onion, chopping frantically. Straightening her back, Emma vowed to herself that it was her time…her chance at a life. A real life. No running, no hiding, no fear. *** She’d slipped back into her own rooms. The men arrived last night, and Stone didn’t even notice her absence. Morning sun poured through her window, filling her with courage and a hope she barely felt. Emma smiled when she saw the nose of Seth’s truck pull through the gates. She finished gathering everything needed and rushed out of the house.Masculine voices resonated from the basement. Shouts and drills echoed against the sheetrock with an eery chant. Ignoring the shiver up her spine as Stone barked his commands, Emma escaped into the chill embrace of the outside.“Ready?” Alexa said, rolling down her window.“Yeah, I guess so.” Climbing into the truck, she clasped her bag to her chest. The sudden confining space sucked all her courage. “I don’t think I can do this.” Reaching for the handle of the truck, she halted when Alexa grabbed her arm.“Yes you can. You’ve been driving for years around the ranch, this is no different.”“Are you sure?” The thought of having a license frightened and thrilled her at the same time.“Positive. And after the test, we’re going to celebrate.” Alexa paused and made sure Emma was looking at her. “Connor style.”A bubble of laughter reached her lips, and she allowed it to spill over and calm her fried nerves. Margaret always used that term whenever they went on a shopping spree. Yes, she needed to do that. She wanted to celebrate.They drove into town, chattering about local gossip and the stores they intended on visiting. Entering the motor vehicle department, Emma hesitated. A quick shove from Alexa sent her stumbling forward and laying all the required documents out for the clerk.In a whirlwind of computer technology, she’d completed the written exam in less than thirty minutes.After another hour long wait, Emma faced down a stern, don’t-mess-with-me driving instructor. Although her nerves jumped each time he demanded an action, she bit her lip and maneuvered appropriately.Standing once more in line, she pressed her thumb to the finger print pad, smiled for the camera, and walked away clasping a still warm little plastic card in her hand.“You did it,” Alexa said.“Wow.” Emma slumped onto a wooden bench outside motor vehicles and stared at her driver’s license. She looked up at Alexa and grinned. “I want to go to the bank next and open a checking account. Give me your cell phone.” Alexa handed her the tiny silver phone. Emma dialed a number that connected with the investment firm handling her inheritance. They confirmed that a wire transfer of funds could take place immediately. “Let’s go. I think the art of celebrating in the Connor fashion is about to take an entirely new twist.”Alexa grinned. “What’re we waiting for? Let’s go!” *** Emma ran her hand across the hood of her brand new jet-black Ford F250.“I can’t believe you bought a truck,” Alexa said in disgust.“It’s practical, not to mention beautiful. And listen to the purr of that Triton V8 engine.”“You should’ve bought the convertible.”Emma gaped at Alexa. “Like that would get me to the grocery store in winter.”“Woooooweeeeee, look at this pretty baby.” Emma spun around and smiled as one of the young Rangers came loping down the front stoop. She didn’t know his name. Stone hadn’t introduced her to any of the squad.“Hello, I’m Emma O’Malley.”“Yes ma’am, I know. I’ll probably be giving Colonel Connor a hundred push-ups for speakin’ to ya, but I’ve just gotta look at this truck. She’s a beaut.”Emma nodded enthusiastically. Colonel? She thought Stone’s rank was Captain. Shaking away her thoughts, she concentrated on the young soldier. “Want to check out the engine?”“Yes, ma’am.”Running around to the driver’s side, she popped the hood. Alexa stood in the background shaking her head. Emma just tossed her a grin and ignored her irritation. Nate taught her years ago all about working on trucks, and she could swap out brake pads, change the oil, and perform tune-ups with the best of Jackson Hole’s mechanics. It’d been their time together when she was growing up.To own a truck…well, her heart skipped a beat. It was a dream come true. One more step to independence. She’d never considered this day, not until Stone handed over the packet of identification.“Tucker.”Emma cringed at the tone of Stone’s voice and turned slowly to stare into the face of a stranger.“Yes, sir.” The young soldier snapped to attention.“Return to your quarters.”“Yes, sir.” He saluted, nodded at Emma, and jogged past the man on the front porch.“Um, I’m going to go,” Alexa said and Emma barely acknowledged her leaving. She was focused entirely on the man approaching her.He’d shaved. Not only his face but all the glorious thick locks of black hair were gone. This man, this soldier who stepped onto the driveway and stared into her face wasn’t anyone she wanted to know. His attire was strictly military. The fatigues drained away the man, leaving behind a stern faced Ranger and an unfamiliar person.“Emma? What’s wrong?”“Your hair.”Stone reached up and ran his hand over the small stubble that remained. He shrugged, and she watched his face soften. Her heart skipped, and she battled to stay put…stay distant. “It’ll grow back.”“When are you leaving?”“You want me gone that bad?”“Why did you re-enlist?”He chuckled and walked toward her. She backed up but the truck held her captive, and she couldn’t go any farther. A spark of interest caught in Stone’s eye. He advanced on her, causing her breath to hitch. Placing an arm on either side, his body pressed against hers.“So many questions…”Emma reached up and framed his face with her hands. She missed his hair, missed the man she fell in love with. “I don’t know you.”His gaze hardened. He kept her pinned for a few more seconds, swore violently, and pushed back off of the hood of the truck and away from her.“Did you ever?” Stone demanded.“I thought I did. I thought…” She paused and inhaled sharply, reining in her emotions. “I don’t know what I thought.”“If I ask you to trust me, will you? If I tell you that in a few months all of this won’t matter, will you believe me? If I remind you of the cabin, will you love me again?” Stone stood still as the rocky cliffs behind him. She didn’t know what he wanted from her, what promises he was making.“I never stopped loving you.” The relief that washed across his face made her almost believe he loved her as well.“I’ll be leaving the second week in March.”“And River Run?”“It’s fine. It won’t revert to my father, the lawyer worked out the details.”Emma’s heart dropped. That wasn’t what she’d meant. If he loved her, he’d tell her about the sale. “And after you return, what will happen then?”“I don’t know.” He stepped closer and cupped her face in his hand. “I guess I’ll leave that up to you.”“And River Run?”“What?” Stone shook his head and frowned. “What about it? It’s only a building, Emma. It’ll survive.”Emma swallowed. She laughed and it rang harshly with her anger. Sidestepping Stone, she strode onto the front porch. “I’ll be dining with Nate tonight.”“I see,” Stone answered.“Yes, I bet you do.” Emma stepped into the house, praying she’d make it to her rooms before losing her hold on the heartbreak that racked her body. *** He didn’t know how long he stood outside. Emma’s independence waving a huge F250 fuck-you behind him. Her stiff retreat screaming heartbreak and pain before him. What had he done?Clueless. I’m absolutely clueless.What about the renovations of River Run concerned her? Didn’t she believe he’d be back? That he’d complete all this work he’d started? He felt the weight of wasted time pressing upon his shoulders and mentally began ticking off the list that haunted him 24/7.The letters.His last task crept closer and closer as the days slipped by. He’d complete it, he knew. But he needed Emma, needed her support and strength.A soft glow of light beamed from her bedroom window. He glanced at it and saw her face framed within the paned glass. Pointing at her, he made a decision.“Stay right there.” He didn’t know if she heard him, so he moved swiftly up the stairs and into the house. Rounding the bend into her quarters, he strode through the door separating her bedroom from the hall.“You didn’t knock,” she said, apparently not surprised to find him there.“I’m not knocking anymore. As a matter of fact, I’m no longer giving you the power to retreat and hide. I don’t understand your focus on River Run, but I’m here to tell you it has nothing to do with your feelings for me.”“Oh, really?” She sat on her bed and stared at him through luminous green eyes. They deepened with anger and another emotion he didn’t want to acknowledge. Betrayal.“What have I done?”“Done? Nothing, absolutely nothing.”“What changed after that day in the cabin? Did you suddenly find in me a man you no longer cared to love?”“If I didn’t love you, do you think I would have allowed you to…let you…” Emma inhaled and her voice wavered.“Allowed me to what?”“Oh never mind, this is ridiculous. We’re never going to work, Stone. Stop fighting for what won’t ever be.”“Why won’t we work?” He knelt down before her and lowered his voice, trying to ease her panic. “Tell me, Emma. Why can’t we be together?”“You’ve gone back to your former life, for one.”“Only this mission.” He gazed into her eyes, wanting her to see how deeply he cared, afraid to speak the words.“Why go at all?”“I have to.”“Tell me.”He shook his head, wishing he could. But he didn’t want to raise her hopes or worry about where he was going. “It’s classified. If I told you,” he said, frowning and leaning in her direction. “I’d have to kill you.”“You’re doing that already.”“Oh God, Emma, don’t say that.” He stood and pulled her into his arms.“You are,” she said. “Every second we’re apart, ever bitter word we speak, a part of my heart dies. I don’t want to care. I don’t want to love you.”“But you do, don’t you?” Stone held her tightly, running his hands up and down her back.“Where can we go from here?”“Anywhere,” he whispered against her hear. “Anywhere at all.”She pulled back and gazed into his eyes.“Are you selling River Run?”“No.” He answered honestly, thankful he’d had the foresight to cancel the contract of sale before the holidays. He loved Emma, and she loved River Run. He’d never take that away from her.Her eyes narrowed slightly. “What about your father?”Stone tensed. His heart beat wildly, and he swallowed past the lump in his throat. “You’ll have to choose.”She sagged against him, and her eyes brightened with tears. He swore silently. The pain and anger that burned his soul whenever she spoke his father’s name, let alone threatened to visit, had made him realize an important factor. In this, there was no compromise.“And your mission? Can you tell me where you’re going?”“No. But when I return, the healing can begin.”Emma chewed the bottom left corner of her lip. He wanted to bend and replace her teeth with his tongue, remind her of their connection. He didn’t. She needed to make decisions.“This…” she patted his chest then her own. “Is tearing me apart.” She reached up and traced a gentle finger across his brow. He closed his eyes, the touch telling him all he needed to know.“Me too.” He heard the hoarseness of his voice and cringed against his weakness. Opening his lids, he silently challenged her to fight against their obstacles.“Your words and demands aren’t making this easy.”“I won’t apologize.”A grin brightened her face and spark of mischief sizzled within the depths of her eyes. “No, I didn’t think you would.”“What’s happening here, Emma?”“A relationship,” she said. “And not a very healthy one at that.” Her laughter lightened the solemn words, giving him a spark of hope.“Will you stand by my side until I return home?”She stared into his eyes for a long time. He didn’t move, didn’t breathe. He’d never been this scared in his entire life.“Yes, Stone Connor. I’ll stand by your side.” Her words slammed into him with the concussion of an explosion. Stunned and elated, he fought the desire to pick her up and whoop for joy. He couldn’t release his love, not yet. There still remained one job to complete. *** Emma sat in the middle of Stone’s massive bed, listening to the drone of male voices. She’d nothing to do. With a frown, she climbed off the bed and watched another winter storm throw more white layers on the already snow-crusted pasture.She knew the men were here because Stone couldn’t go to them. She knew he’d lied to her about the sale of River Run. He’d been honest regarding his father and straight forward on the lack of comment about his mission. It all totaled together for a heartrending emotional catastrophe. Maybe some of Margaret’s insightfulness rubbed into Emma’s soul. Because she believed her decision to stand by this man rang of a wisdom beyond her understanding. It felt right.“Hey gorgeous,” Stone said from the doorway. “Whatcha doing?”“I’m bored. Want to come play?”He grinned. “Wish I could. Why not join us for a hike?”“Really?” The surprise she felt echoed in her words.“Yeah. The men need to get out of the house. Crankiness has set in.”She sighed and moved into the walk-in closet to change. “I can relate. Where’re we going?”“Let’s head down to the river and see where that leads us.”“Fine by me.” She paused and frowned. “Do we have enough snow shoes?”“I believe so. And if not, they can wade through the stuff. It’ll do ‘em good. Some of these boys seem a bit too soft for my liking.”Walking out of the closet, Emma looked closely at Stone. The strain of the past few weeks of intense physical activity showed in black smudged bags beneath his eyes and excess muscles bulging against his shirt sleeve.“They’ll never replace what you lost.”“I know that.” He opened his arms, and she walked into his embrace. It might only be temporary, but their truce felt wonderful.“Rex called today.”“Yeah?”“Our departure date’s been confirmed.”“I understand.” She nodded against his chest, glad he couldn’t see her lying face.“I’m going to miss you.”“How long will you be gone?”“Hopefully, only about a week. At the max, it’ll be two.”Emma’s throat tightened. Two weeks. Where the heck were they sending him? More importantly, why were they sending him? Instead of voicing her concerns, she pushed everything to the back of her mind and showed the face Stone needed.The strong partner. The confident partner.She held tight, stood her ground. The last thing he needed was someone to question his judgment or interfere with this mission.“I’ve something to do tomorrow that I need your help with.”“Oh yeah? What’s that?”“I need to write some letters.”“Letters? What kind?”“The ones that say I’m sorry.”",

Emma smiled when she saw the nose of Seth’s truck pull through the gates. She finished gathering everything needed and rushed out of the house.Masculine voices resonated from the basement. Shouts and drills echoed against the sheetrock with an eery chant. Ignoring the shiver up her spine as Stone barked his commands, Emma escaped into the chill embrace of the outside.“Ready?” Alexa said, rolling down her window.“Yeah, I guess so.” Climbing into the truck, she clasped her bag to her chest. The sudden confining space sucked all her courage. “I don’t think I can do this.” Reaching for the handle of the truck, she halted when Alexa grabbed her arm.“Yes you can. You’ve been driving for years around the ranch, this is no different.”“Are you sure?” The thought of having a license frightened and thrilled her at the same time.“Positive. And after the test, we’re going to celebrate.” Alexa paused and made sure Emma was looking at her. “Connor style.”A bubble of laughter reached her lips, and she allowed it to spill over and calm her fried nerves. Margaret always used that term whenever they went on a shopping spree. Yes, she needed to do that. She wanted to celebrate.They drove into town, chattering about local gossip and the stores they intended on visiting. Entering the motor vehicle department, Emma hesitated. A quick shove from Alexa sent her stumbling forward and laying all the required documents out for the clerk.In a whirlwind of computer technology, she’d completed the written exam in less than thirty minutes.After another hour long wait, Emma faced down a stern, don’t-mess-with-me driving instructor. Although her nerves jumped each time he demanded an action, she bit her lip and maneuvered appropriately.Standing once more in line, she pressed her thumb to the finger print pad, smiled for the camera, and walked away clasping a still warm little plastic card in her hand.“You did it,” Alexa said.“Wow.” Emma slumped onto a wooden bench outside motor vehicles and stared at her driver’s license. She looked up at Alexa and grinned. “I want to go to the bank next and open a checking account. Give me your cell phone.” Alexa handed her the tiny silver phone. Emma dialed a number that connected with the investment firm handling her inheritance. They confirmed that a wire transfer of funds could take place immediately. “Let’s go. I think the art of celebrating in the Connor fashion is about to take an entirely new twist.”Alexa grinned. “What’re we waiting for? Let’s go!” *** Emma ran her hand across the hood of her brand new jet-black Ford F250.“I can’t believe you bought a truck,” Alexa said in disgust.“It’s practical, not to mention beautiful. And listen to the purr of that Triton V8 engine.”“You should’ve bought the convertible.”Emma gaped at Alexa. “Like that would get me to the grocery store in winter.”“Woooooweeeeee, look at this pretty baby.” Emma spun around and smiled as one of the young Rangers came loping down the front stoop. She didn’t know his name. Stone hadn’t introduced her to any of the squad.“Hello, I’m Emma O’Malley.”“Yes ma’am, I know. I’ll probably be giving Colonel Connor a hundred push-ups for speakin’ to ya, but I’ve just gotta look at this truck. She’s a beaut.”Emma nodded enthusiastically. Colonel? She thought Stone’s rank was Captain. Shaking away her thoughts, she concentrated on the young soldier. “Want to check out the engine?”“Yes, ma’am.”Running around to the driver’s side, she popped the hood. Alexa stood in the background shaking her head. Emma just tossed her a grin and ignored her irritation. Nate taught her years ago all about working on trucks, and she could swap out brake pads, change the oil, and perform tune-ups with the best of Jackson Hole’s mechanics. It’d been their time together when she was growing up.To own a truck…well, her heart skipped a beat. It was a dream come true. One more step to independence. She’d never considered this day, not until Stone handed over the packet of identification.“Tucker.”Emma cringed at the tone of Stone’s voice and turned slowly to stare into the face of a stranger.“Yes, sir.” The young soldier snapped to attention.“Return to your quarters.”“Yes, sir.” He saluted, nodded at Emma, and jogged past the man on the front porch.“Um, I’m going to go,” Alexa said and Emma barely acknowledged her leaving. She was focused entirely on the man approaching her.He’d shaved. Not only his face but all the glorious thick locks of black hair were gone. This man, this soldier who stepped onto the driveway and stared into her face wasn’t anyone she wanted to know. His attire was strictly military. The fatigues drained away the man, leaving behind a stern faced Ranger and an unfamiliar person.“Emma? What’s wrong?”“Your hair.”Stone reached up and ran his hand over the small stubble that remained. He shrugged, and she watched his face soften. Her heart skipped, and she battled to stay put…stay distant. “It’ll grow back.”“When are you leaving?”“You want me gone that bad?”“Why did you re-enlist?”He chuckled and walked toward her. She backed up but the truck held her captive, and she couldn’t go any farther. A spark of interest caught in Stone’s eye. He advanced on her, causing her breath to hitch. Placing an arm on either side, his body pressed against hers.“So many questions…”Emma reached up and framed his face with her hands. She missed his hair, missed the man she fell in love with. “I don’t know you.”His gaze hardened. He kept her pinned for a few more seconds, swore violently, and pushed back off of the hood of the truck and away from her.“Did you ever?” Stone demanded.“I thought I did. I thought…” She paused and inhaled sharply, reining in her emotions. “I don’t know what I thought.”“If I ask you to trust me, will you? If I tell you that in a few months all of this won’t matter, will you believe me? If I remind you of the cabin, will you love me again?” Stone stood still as the rocky cliffs behind him. She didn’t know what he wanted from her, what promises he was making.“I never stopped loving you.” The relief that washed across his face made her almost believe he loved her as well.“I’ll be leaving the second week in March.”“And River Run?”“It’s fine. It won’t revert to my father, the lawyer worked out the details.”Emma’s heart dropped. That wasn’t what she’d meant. If he loved her, he’d tell her about the sale. “And after you return, what will happen then?”“I don’t know.” He stepped closer and cupped her face in his hand. “I guess I’ll leave that up to you.”“And River Run?”“What?” Stone shook his head and frowned. “What about it? It’s only a building, Emma. It’ll survive.”Emma swallowed. She laughed and it rang harshly with her anger. Sidestepping Stone, she strode onto the front porch. “I’ll be dining with Nate tonight.”“I see,” Stone answered.“Yes, I bet you do.” Emma stepped into the house, praying she’d make it to her rooms before losing her hold on the heartbreak that racked her body. *** He didn’t know how long he stood outside. Emma’s independence waving a huge F250 fuck-you behind him. Her stiff retreat screaming heartbreak and pain before him. What had he done?Clueless. I’m absolutely clueless.What about the renovations of River Run concerned her? Didn’t she believe he’d be back? That he’d complete all this work he’d started? He felt the weight of wasted time pressing upon his shoulders and mentally began ticking off the list that haunted him 24/7.The letters.His last task crept closer and closer as the days slipped by. He’d complete it, he knew. But he needed Emma, needed her support and strength.A soft glow of light beamed from her bedroom window. He glanced at it and saw her face framed within the paned glass. Pointing at her, he made a decision.“Stay right there.” He didn’t know if she heard him, so he moved swiftly up the stairs and into the house. Rounding the bend into her quarters, he strode through the door separating her bedroom from the hall.“You didn’t knock,” she said, apparently not surprised to find him there.“I’m not knocking anymore. As a matter of fact, I’m no longer giving you the power to retreat and hide. I don’t understand your focus on River Run, but I’m here to tell you it has nothing to do with your feelings for me.”“Oh, really?” She sat on her bed and stared at him through luminous green eyes. They deepened with anger and another emotion he didn’t want to acknowledge. Betrayal.“What have I done?”“Done? Nothing, absolutely nothing.”“What changed after that day in the cabin? Did you suddenly find in me a man you no longer cared to love?”“If I didn’t love you, do you think I would have allowed you to…let you…” Emma inhaled and her voice wavered.“Allowed me to what?”“Oh never mind, this is ridiculous. We’re never going to work, Stone. Stop fighting for what won’t ever be.”“Why won’t we work?” He knelt down before her and lowered his voice, trying to ease her panic. “Tell me, Emma. Why can’t we be together?”“You’ve gone back to your former life, for one.”“Only this mission.” He gazed into her eyes, wanting her to see how deeply he cared, afraid to speak the words.“Why go at all?”“I have to.”“Tell me.”He shook his head, wishing he could. But he didn’t want to raise her hopes or worry about where he was going. “It’s classified. If I told you,” he said, frowning and leaning in her direction. “I’d have to kill you.”“You’re doing that already.”“Oh God, Emma, don’t say that.” He stood and pulled her into his arms.“You are,” she said. “Every second we’re apart, ever bitter word we speak, a part of my heart dies. I don’t want to care. I don’t want to love you.”“But you do, don’t you?” Stone held her tightly, running his hands up and down her back.“Where can we go from here?”“Anywhere,” he whispered against her hear. “Anywhere at all.”She pulled back and gazed into his eyes.“Are you selling River Run?”“No.” He answered honestly, thankful he’d had the foresight to cancel the contract of sale before the holidays. He loved Emma, and she loved River Run. He’d never take that away from her.Her eyes narrowed slightly. “What about your father?”Stone tensed. His heart beat wildly, and he swallowed past the lump in his throat. “You’ll have to choose.”She sagged against him, and her eyes brightened with tears. He swore silently. The pain and anger that burned his soul whenever she spoke his father’s name, let alone threatened to visit, had made him realize an important factor. In this, there was no compromise.“And your mission? Can you tell me where you’re going?”“No. But when I return, the healing can begin.”Emma chewed the bottom left corner of her lip. He wanted to bend and replace her teeth with his tongue, remind her of their connection. He didn’t. She needed to make decisions.“This…” she patted his chest then her own. “Is tearing me apart.” She reached up and traced a gentle finger across his brow. He closed his eyes, the touch telling him all he needed to know.“Me too.” He heard the hoarseness of his voice and cringed against his weakness. Opening his lids, he silently challenged her to fight against their obstacles.“Your words and demands aren’t making this easy.”“I won’t apologize.”A grin brightened her face and spark of mischief sizzled within the depths of her eyes. “No, I didn’t think you would.”“What’s happening here, Emma?”“A relationship,” she said. “And not a very healthy one at that.” Her laughter lightened the solemn words, giving him a spark of hope.“Will you stand by my side until I return home?”She stared into his eyes for a long time. He didn’t move, didn’t breathe. He’d never been this scared in his entire life.“Yes, Stone Connor. I’ll stand by your side.” Her words slammed into him with the concussion of an explosion. Stunned and elated, he fought the desire to pick her up and whoop for joy. He couldn’t release his love, not yet. There still remained one job to complete. *** Emma sat in the middle of Stone’s massive bed, listening to the drone of male voices. She’d nothing to do. With a frown, she climbed off the bed and watched another winter storm throw more white layers on the already snow-crusted pasture.She knew the men were here because Stone couldn’t go to them. She knew he’d lied to her about the sale of River Run. He’d been honest regarding his father and straight forward on the lack of comment about his mission. It all totaled together for a heartrending emotional catastrophe. Maybe some of Margaret’s insightfulness rubbed into Emma’s soul. Because she believed her decision to stand by this man rang of a wisdom beyond her understanding. It felt right.“Hey gorgeous,” Stone said from the doorway. “Whatcha doing?”“I’m bored. Want to come play?”He grinned. “Wish I could. Why not join us for a hike?”“Really?” The surprise she felt echoed in her words.“Yeah. The men need to get out of the house. Crankiness has set in.”She sighed and moved into the walk-in closet to change. “I can relate. Where’re we going?”“Let’s head down to the river and see where that leads us.”“Fine by me.” She paused and frowned. “Do we have enough snow shoes?”“I believe so. And if not, they can wade through the stuff. It’ll do ‘em good. Some of these boys seem a bit too soft for my liking.”Walking out of the closet, Emma looked closely at Stone. The strain of the past few weeks of intense physical activity showed in black smudged bags beneath his eyes and excess muscles bulging against his shirt sleeve.“They’ll never replace what you lost.”“I know that.” He opened his arms, and she walked into his embrace. It might only be temporary, but their truce felt wonderful.“Rex called today.”“Yeah?”“Our departure date’s been confirmed.”“I understand.” She nodded against his chest, glad he couldn’t see her lying face.“I’m going to miss you.”“How long will you be gone?”“Hopefully, only about a week. At the max, it’ll be two.”Emma’s throat tightened. Two weeks. Where the heck were they sending him? More importantly, why were they sending him? Instead of voicing her concerns, she pushed everything to the back of her mind and showed the face Stone needed.The strong partner. The confident partner.She held tight, stood her ground. The last thing he needed was someone to question his judgment or interfere with this mission.“I’ve something to do tomorrow that I need your help with.”“Oh yeah? What’s that?”“I need to write some letters.”“Letters? What kind?”“The ones that say I’m sorry.”",

      "content": "Chapter Fifteen Stone stood at the top of the stairs listening to the whir of the treadmill. Emma was taking full advantage of the gym since his men shipped back to base last week. His exit date demanded he leave within the week.Padding silently down the stairs, he stopped in the doorway of the room they’d expanded from a small exercise room to a full-fledged gym. Weight equipment and mats stretched from mirrored wall to mirrored wall. Emma occupied a treadmill before the floor to ceiling windows, jogging steadily, ear phones jammed on her head.She wore tight shorts and a cropped sports bra. A trickle of sweat ran down her back, soaking into the black spandex material of her shorts. He smiled, admiring the view.Auburn curls fell down her back, clasped loosely with a clip. His heart swelled with love. Did he believe in love at first sight?Yes.He realized the moment she’d opened her mouth and welcomed him to River Run, he’d been consumed by her magic.He hated sharing her affection. Stone wanted it all, but he knew until she overcame her fears and took responsibility for her life and the decisions that encompassed, he’d have to be okay with the portion of her heart she chose to share with him.Nate Connor.His father loomed between them with the savageness of the Snake cutting through the mountains. Would she cross to his side or remain out of reach?He walked up behind her and straddled the outside edges of the treadmill. Her heat, her nearness was enough to drive him mad with desire. Closing his eyes, he held tightly to the bars of the treadmill unable to comprehend life without this woman.She felt his weight and slowed the machine down until it stopped then slowly slid backward, connecting with his chest. Wrapping an arm around her waist, he hugged her close, knowing she could feel his need for her through her thin excuse for clothes.“Stone.” Her voice was breathless, and he felt her instant awareness of him. She sighed and leaned her head back against his shoulder.He rubbed his chin against her forehead, inhaling the slight jasmine scent that always surrounded her. Kissing a small bead of sweat from the corner of her eye, he fought against the heartrending day looming on the horizon.Swallowing against sudden panic, Stone trailed a line of kisses down her neck. He heard her gasp and whisper his name.One hand gripped the silver bar of the treadmill while the other lazily explored her breasts, rubbing her hardened nipples through the thin cotton. She felt like heaven and tasted of honey.He kissed the nape of her neck. Emma’s head dropped forward as she wiggled tighter against him making him groan.Did she know how deeply he cared? How strong his love was?He smiled to himself at the thought of her happiness. When Emma saw her father, she’d understand. His heart, his soul-they belonged to her.“Why’re you smiling?” Emma spoke softly, closing her eyes and enjoying his touch.“I’ve never considered making love on a treadmill before.”She twisted around and grinned at him. “I couldn’t think of a better form of exercise.”The glare of sun on white pasture streamed through the windows heating an already electrifying corner of the gym. Her sighs and soft words wrapped around him, exciting and enthralling.“I love you,” she whispered.All thought stopped, only the need to be one with Emma carried him forward. “I don’t have a condom,” he said, swearing silently.“Too late. I want you…now.”Her closeness, her vulnerability edged tighter around his heart.He couldn’t breathe.Emma moved against him, and he was lost.Stone demanded. She gave.He held her trembling body, seeking to regain control of himself. Inhaling in deep, ragged breaths, he wanted to tell her how he felt.He sighed as she pulled away. She twisted around and hugged him tightly. He returned her embrace, holding her fiercely against his chest.“Every time you’re near, I want you,” she said, her voice husky and slightly hoarse.He couldn’t speak. Swearing silently at his inner fear, he kissed her forehead. Finally, the iron grip on his chest released and sanity returned.Stone chuckled. “Obviously I’ve just proved that I agree.” *** Emma lay curled in a corner of the living room couch. Her head hurt, her stomach reeled, and her heart…well, her heart made demands she couldn’t answer.Surrender to Stone, the stupid little organ screamed. If only it were that easy. His plane was scheduled to leave tomorrow and with it a part of herself would disappear. She hated it. Detested the predicament she’d allowed herself to fall into.“Hey,” he said softly from the kitchen doorway.“Hey, yourself.”“Do you have a minute?”“Sure.” She twisted around and noticed he held a folder in his left hand.“I’ve written these letters.” He held up the folder. “I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind reading them. I don’t know if they’re good enough to mail.”She bit down on her lower lip trying to hide her curiosity. “Sure. I’ll do it right now.”“Okay. Thanks. I’ll be downstairs working on the shelves for the media room.”“10-4.”He rolled his eyes at her attempt at military jargon and left the room. The minute she heard the nail compressor turn on, Emma bolted from the sofa and snatched the folder off the table. Holding her head against the sudden pounding, she sat back down and pulled out the first letter.Dear Maria,I realize you’ve probably been waiting for this letter for almost two years, your heart breaking, and your mind searching for an explanation as to how I could’ve allowed your husband to die. Believe me, I’ve asked myself that question every morning and every night.Jose wormed himself into my group right after the two of you were married. I wish he hadn’t. I don’t regret the privilege of knowing him or his wisdom that came from loving you. But I hate myself for denying him the right to watch your daughter grow, to see his grandchildren and rock his days away beside you. For that, I am eternally sorry.A special person has helped me realize that healing doesn’t come from forgetting but from remembering. I’d like to share some memories with you and hope they ease your pain and help you move on.Emma flipped the page, reading paragraph after paragraph of exploits Stone’s unit had undertaken. She laughed at his fine touch of humor, the warmth and love he conveyed in every sentence, every word. Turning to the last page, she realized her barriers against this man were weakening.As you can see, Jose not only touched your life with his passion and love but also mine. I will forever miss him. I will never forget.With deepest regards,Colonel Stone ConnorTears streamed down Emma’s face. Damn, but she was tired of crying and lately it seemed like a daily, almost hourly occurrence.The front door slammed, and she quickly brushed the tears from her face. Glancing through the folder she realized it contained letters to every wife, mother or father that belonged to his deceased unit. The knowledge of the pain Stone bore crushed her chest making it hard to breathe.“Any one home?”Emma smiled, recognizing Alexa’s voice. “In here,” she called, dashing away the tears that kept insisting on flowing down her cheeks.“Hey,” Alexa said, walking into the living room and plopping on the couch next to her. “What’s up?” She frowned and shook her head. “You look like crap. Why are you crying?”A flood of emotions toppled over, and Emma couldn’t control the sobs that broke forth. Alexa scooted over and wrapped her arms around her, hugging her tightly. “I can’t seem to stop.”“It’s okay, let it out. Do you want to talk about it?”“Stone’s leaving tomorrow.” She let out a shaky breath, sat back and inhaled deeply attempting to control herself.“I know. That’s why I’m here. But he’ll be back, you have to know that.”“I do. But…” She paused and exhaled a rush of words. “He’s selling River Run, and I don’t know what that means. He wants me to choose between himself and Nate, and it’s tearing me apart. And he’s gone and written all these wonderful letters, and just the thought of how hard this must have been is making me feel like I don’t deserve to be in the same room with him.” Her eyes watered again, and the damn tears spilled over. She dashed them away, sniffing loudly.“Oh, baby,” Alexa said. “It’ll be okay. You’re just scared. I can’t believe Stone’s selling River Run. He knows how much it means to you.”“He is. I saw the contract.”“I’m sure there’s an explanation. When he comes home, there’ll be plenty of time to discuss River Run and Nate and all these other emotions running through your system.”“No there won’t be. Stone and I…” Did she want to explain? Yes, she needed to tell someone. “We’re all out of time. I’m pregnant.”Alexa stared at her, eyes wide, mouth hanging open. “Pregnant?” She narrowed her gaze and tilted her head. “Does Stone know?”Emma shook her head and pointed a finger at her friend’s chest. “Don’t you dare tell him.”“Emma…”“No,” she interrupted before listening to any of the arguments Alexa was about to say. They probably only mirrored the silent ones she’d been having with herself. “He can’t know. Not yet, at least. I want him to go on this mission with a clear head, clear conscience and absolutely no conflicting emotions.”Alexa shook her head.“No,” Emma repeated. “You have to swear you won’t say a word.”“I won’t say a thing. But I think you’re doing yourself and Stone a great injustice.”“Maybe, but it’s the right thing to do. He needs to be fully focused on this mission.”“He needs?” Alexa rose from the couch and paced in a tight circle. “What about you? How far along are you?”“Ten, maybe eleven weeks.”“You’re almost through your first trimester. Oh Emma, you’re so wrong about all of this. You should be sharing this with Stone.”“No. Don’t make me sorry I told you. He’d worry, and…” Emma leaned her head back and closed her eyes.“And?”“What if he doesn’t want the baby?” There, she’d done it. She’d voiced her greatest fear.“No.” Alexa sat back on the couch and grabbed Emma’s hands. “No, he’d never feel that way.”Looking into her friends eyes, she saw the worry and a flicker of doubt. “Yes he might and you know it.”“I don’t know a thing. Stone’s a difficult man, but he’ll do what’s right. He’ll stand by you.”“I don’t want that.” Emma stood and stared down at Alexa. “I won’t accept anything less than his full love for me and my child. I don’t even know how I’m supposed to choose between him and Nate. How do you just stop loving someone?”Alexa shook her head, and they both dropped into silence. *** “Hey, who died?” Stone stood in the doorway looking from one woman to the next. The emotions in the air were thick enough for him to draw a knife through. “Alexa, what a pleasant surprise.” Neither one answered, they simply stood staring at one another. Alexa’s face was pale, and he thought he noted a tinge of anger building in her posture. Emma seemed frozen, her eyes a watery green and cheeks tear stained.“Ladies, you’re scaring me.”Emma jerked, and turned to face him. She smiled, but it didn’t hide the hurt shining bright within the emerald depths of her gaze. “Sorry, we were just debating the advantages and disadvantages of shopping online.”Stone frowned. “You don’t lie well. What gives?”“Nothing,” Alexa said, rising from the couch. “Emma’s right. We weren’t agreeing with one another, and I’m so tired I gave her a hard time.” She turned and hugged Emma. “I’m sorry, sistah. I love you.”Emma returned the hug, her shoulders more relaxed than when he first entered the room. “I love you, too.” Both women teared up, and Stone backed away hastily.“I think I’ll come back later.”“It’s okay, cuz. I really just stopped by to give you a hug and tell you not to be gone for too long.”He sighed in relief as Emma and Alexa laughed softly. Okay, out of the danger zone. Man, tears scared him more than the thought of returning to the Congo. “Don’t worry. In ten days, you’ll be wishing I’d stayed away.”“I’ll hold you to that.” Alexa hugged him and waved a hand at Emma. “I’ll call you tomorrow, Emmie.”“See ya, Lex. Drive safely.”After Alexa shut the front door, Stone turned on Emma. Something wasn’t right.“What gives?”“Nothing Stone. Drop it, okay?”“Is this about me leaving or about those letters? Because I have to go, but I don’t have to mail the letters if you think they’re not appropriate.”Her face softened and the love that shone from her eyes touched his heart. “The letters are wonderful. You’re an amazing man.”“No, I’m not. I couldn’t have done any of this without you.”He walked over and wrapped his arms around her. Holding her close, the pain of leaving suddenly slammed into his chest with a vengeance. The sharp burn made him wince, and he held tighter.“I can’t believe you’re leaving tomorrow.”“It’s going to be the longest two weeks of my life.”“I know.”“About earlier…I didn’t use any protection, are you okay?”She sighed heavily and nestled closer. “I’m fine.”“You said it was too late, what does that mean? I wanted to ask you then but my attention was elsewhere.” He felt her shoulders shake with laughter, and suddenly she broke away, laughing even harder. Actually, he frowned, she seemed quite hysterical. “Am I missing something here?”“No,” Emma inhaled and swallowed. “I’m on the pill now. Don’t worry.”“Oh,” he said, still perplexed by her behavior. “Why didn’t you say so?” She waved her hand at him and burst into another round of giggles.“I dunno. I guess it slipped my mind. Oh please, stop looking at me like that.” Tears were streaming down her face, and her smile suddenly faltered. A hand squeezed his heart when happy tears melted into sad.“I’m sorry,” he said.“What for?” She bit her lip and sniffled.“Making you cry.” He pulled her back into his arms and held tight. Stone wanted to tell her how he felt, tell her he loved her, but it didn’t feel right. Somehow his words seemed empty. He needed to show her, and to do that…he had a mission to accomplish. *** Stone swung around in the office chair to glance out the window. He waited for Rex’s final call. His duffel bag sat by the front door, an ominous symbol of his departure. He didn’t know where Emma was. The scent of jasmine wafted lightly around the office, signaling her recent occupancy.The second the phone rang, he snatched it off the base unit.“Yeah, I’m ready.” He said, his heart pounding. Scared. That feeling didn’t sit well with him.“Did you call Nate like I asked?”“No, Rex. I’ve arranged for Seth to stay with Emma.”“Stone, Nate knows how Adams reacts. He’d be an incredible asset.”“No. That man isn’t allowed on this property.”“But Emma…”Stone interrupted him, not wanting to hear any more. “She’s chosen me, and that’s all I need.”“You’re a fool.”“Dammit Rex, give me my coordinates and stop acting like a mother hen.”Stone quickly scribbled down his instructions. A trickle of fear skimmed his skin when Kuffuor’s name was spoken, but he tamped it down and focused on the goal. He’d not allow one life to be lost on this mission, Stone silently vowed. Not one life.“And the plan for Seamus?” he asked.He heard Rex take a deep breath. “It’s been approved. Both missions should take place simultaneously.”Stone smiled in satisfaction. “Then Emma shouldn’t be in any danger.”“I’m just covering all bases, Stone. I still think you should involve your father.”“No. End of discussion.” Stone glance at his watch and realized he only had two hours before he needed to be at the airport. “I’ve gotta go. There’s a certain lady I want to find.”“Good luck, buddy.”“No luck needed.” Stone hung up the phone and wrestled with his thoughts.He could do this.He would do this.He had no choice. *** Emma stood in her own room, preparing it for Seth’s occupancy. She could hear the low murmur of Stone’s voice from the office, knowing he’d be discussing his mission with Rex. Indifference. She prayed for the indifference he’d once accused her of possessing.“There you are,” Stone said.She plastered a smile to her face and turned toward him. “Yep, just getting ready for Seth.”“I know you don’t want him here.”“No, I don’t. It’s going to be like spending two weeks with a two hundred pound puppy. The man’s a nuisance.”He grinned at her. “Yes, he is.”She couldn’t help but laugh. “He means well.”“And he’ll make a fine watchdog.”Sobering, Emma thought about Seth’s reason for staying at River Run. “Do you really think Seamus Adams will make a move against me?”“Honestly? I don’t think so. We’ll hit him before he has a chance to retaliate.”Success, Emma thought. One piece of the puzzle confirmed. “So this mission does involve him.”The shock that flared in Stone’s eyes almost made her laugh. Did he think she was an idiot? Then his gaze flitted to amusement. “Caught me red handed.”She shrugged. “I stopped hiding a long time ago. I’m facing a few things I wish I didn’t have to.”Stone stepped into the room and gently traced the gold eagle nesting against her throat. “Thank you for wearing this.”She placed a hand over his, locking his fingers against her skin. “Are you doing this for me?”“It’s complicated, and I can’t discuss the details.”“Revenge never solves anything, Stone. Don’t do it.” He tensed, pulling his hand away from hers.“What’s that suppose to mean?” he said.She touched his shoulder, imploring him silently to listen to her. “Some things aren’t worth your life.”He visibly relaxed. “You’re right.” Stone traced a finger down her cheek. “But you are.”Emma felt the tears prick her eyes. No crying, she screamed silently. “I’m sorry I didn’t wear the necklace right away. I was angry.”“About what?”“It’s in the past.”“No, I want to know.”“It doesn’t matter.” She reached up and twined her arms around his neck. “All that I care about now is your safe return.”“Don’t worry, I’ll be back before Seth has a chance to ruin all the good work I’ve done here.” He kissed her forehead. Emma tilted her head and found his mouth with her own. Hungry, her lips insisted, and Stone responded by plundering and setting fire to her soul. *** They stood within the frame of the front door. He held her tightly against his chest, afraid to let go. If she stepped back, his heart would be firmly in her hand and then how would he ever leave?“Are we okay?” he said. His voice cracked, and he stomped his sadness down.“Yes, we’re okay.”“You’re not planning on leaving while I’m gone?” Stone pulled back and searched her face. An emotion lingered there he didn’t understand, and it worried the heck out of him.“No, I’ll be here.”“Promise?”“Yes,” she said with a soft sigh, touching his face gently.“Good.” He stepped out the door and grabbed his bag. Before he reached his Jeep, he turned and looked at her one last time. He allowed his eyes to absorb her beauty, memorize it and lock it away within his heart.“Tell Porkie I love her.”Emma nodded and waved. The tears streaming down her face burned a path straight to his soul. He spun on his heels and ran the rest of the way to his vehicle, revving the engine, and slamming it into gear. Pulling out of River Run, he refused to look back. *** Emma held one hand to her heart, the other pressed against her abdomen. She watched the Jeep fade into the distance, swallowed by the bend in the road.“Oh baby, pray your daddy comes home. Pray he’ll be there to watch you grow and see his grandchildren. Pray he’ll rock beside me until the end of our days.”",

      "content": "Chapter Fifteen Stone stood at the top of the stairs listening to the whir of the treadmill. Emma was taking full advantage of the gym since his men shipped back to base last week. His exit date demanded he leave within the week.Padding silently down the stairs, he stopped in the doorway of the room they’d expanded from a small exercise room to a full-fledged gym. Weight equipment and mats stretched from mirrored wall to mirrored wall. Emma occupied a treadmill before the floor to ceiling windows, jogging steadily, ear phones jammed on her head.She wore tight shorts and a cropped sports bra. A trickle of sweat ran down her back, soaking into the black spandex material of her shorts. He smiled, admiring the view.Auburn curls fell down her back, clasped loosely with a clip. His heart swelled with love. Did he believe in love at first sight?Yes.He realized the moment she’d opened her mouth and welcomed him to River Run, he’d been consumed by her magic.He hated sharing her affection. Stone wanted it all, but he knew until she overcame her fears and took responsibility for her life and the decisions that encompassed, he’d have to be okay with the portion of her heart she chose to share with him.Nate Connor.His father loomed between them with the savageness of the Snake cutting through the mountains. Would she cross to his side or remain out of reach?He walked up behind her and straddled the outside edges of the treadmill. Her heat, her nearness was enough to drive him mad with desire. Closing his eyes, he held tightly to the bars of the treadmill unable to comprehend life without this woman.She felt his weight and slowed the machine down until it stopped then slowly slid backward, connecting with his chest. Wrapping an arm around her waist, he hugged her close, knowing she could feel his need for her through her thin excuse for clothes.“Stone.” Her voice was breathless, and he felt her instant awareness of him. She sighed and leaned her head back against his shoulder.He rubbed his chin against her forehead, inhaling the slight jasmine scent that always surrounded her. Kissing a small bead of sweat from the corner of her eye, he fought against the heartrending day looming on the horizon.Swallowing against sudden panic, Stone trailed a line of kisses down her neck. He heard her gasp and whisper his name.One hand gripped the silver bar of the treadmill while the other lazily explored her breasts, rubbing her hardened nipples through the thin cotton. She felt like heaven and tasted of honey.He kissed the nape of her neck. Emma’s head dropped forward as she wiggled tighter against him making him groan.Did she know how deeply he cared? How strong his love was?He smiled to himself at the thought of her happiness. When Emma saw her father, she’d understand. His heart, his soul-they belonged to her.“Why’re you smiling?” Emma spoke softly, closing her eyes and enjoying his touch.“I’ve never considered making love on a treadmill before.”She twisted around and grinned at him. “I couldn’t think of a better form of exercise.”The glare of sun on white pasture streamed through the windows heating an already electrifying corner of the gym. Her sighs and soft words wrapped around him, exciting and enthralling.“I love you,” she whispered.All thought stopped, only the need to be one with Emma carried him forward. “I don’t have a condom,” he said, swearing silently.“Too late. I want you…now.”Her closeness, her vulnerability edged tighter around his heart.He couldn’t breathe.Emma moved against him, and he was lost.Stone demanded. She gave.He held her trembling body, seeking to regain control of himself. Inhaling in deep, ragged breaths, he wanted to tell her how he felt.He sighed as she pulled away. She twisted around and hugged him tightly. He returned her embrace, holding her fiercely against his chest.“Every time you’re near, I want you,” she said, her voice husky and slightly hoarse.He couldn’t speak. Swearing silently at his inner fear, he kissed her forehead. Finally, the iron grip on his chest released and sanity returned.Stone chuckled. “Obviously I’ve just proved that I agree.” *** Emma lay curled in a corner of the living room couch. Her head hurt, her stomach reeled, and her heart…well, her heart made demands she couldn’t answer.Surrender to Stone, the stupid little organ screamed. If only it were that easy. His plane was scheduled to leave tomorrow and with it a part of herself would disappear. She hated it. Detested the predicament she’d allowed herself to fall into.“Hey,” he said softly from the kitchen doorway.“Hey, yourself.”“Do you have a minute?”“Sure.” She twisted around and noticed he held a folder in his left hand.“I’ve written these letters.” He held up the folder. “I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind reading them. I don’t know if they’re good enough to mail.”She bit down on her lower lip trying to hide her curiosity. “Sure. I’ll do it right now.”“Okay. Thanks. I’ll be downstairs working on the shelves for the media room.”“10-4.”He rolled his eyes at her attempt at military jargon and left the room. The minute she heard the nail compressor turn on, Emma bolted from the sofa and snatched the folder off the table. Holding her head against the sudden pounding, she sat back down and pulled out the first letter.Dear Maria,I realize you’ve probably been waiting for this letter for almost two years, your heart breaking, and your mind searching for an explanation as to how I could’ve allowed your husband to die. Believe me, I’ve asked myself that question every morning and every night.Jose wormed himself into my group right after the two of you were married. I wish he hadn’t. I don’t regret the privilege of knowing him or his wisdom that came from loving you. But I hate myself for denying him the right to watch your daughter grow, to see his grandchildren and rock his days away beside you. For that, I am eternally sorry.A special person has helped me realize that healing doesn’t come from forgetting but from remembering. I’d like to share some memories with you and hope they ease your pain and help you move on.Emma flipped the page, reading paragraph after paragraph of exploits Stone’s unit had undertaken. She laughed at his fine touch of humor, the warmth and love he conveyed in every sentence, every word. Turning to the last page, she realized her barriers against this man were weakening.As you can see, Jose not only touched your life with his passion and love but also mine. I will forever miss him. I will never forget.With deepest regards,Colonel Stone ConnorTears streamed down Emma’s face. Damn, but she was tired of crying and lately it seemed like a daily, almost hourly occurrence.The front door slammed, and she quickly brushed the tears from her face. Glancing through the folder she realized it contained letters to every wife, mother or father that belonged to his deceased unit. The knowledge of the pain Stone bore crushed her chest making it hard to breathe.“Any one home?”Emma smiled, recognizing Alexa’s voice. “In here,” she called, dashing away the tears that kept insisting on flowing down her cheeks.“Hey,” Alexa said, walking into the living room and plopping on the couch next to her. “What’s up?” She frowned and shook her head. “You look like crap. Why are you crying?”A flood of emotions toppled over, and Emma couldn’t control the sobs that broke forth. Alexa scooted over and wrapped her arms around her, hugging her tightly. “I can’t seem to stop.”“It’s okay, let it out. Do you want to talk about it?”“Stone’s leaving tomorrow.” She let out a shaky breath, sat back and inhaled deeply attempting to control herself.“I know. That’s why I’m here. But he’ll be back, you have to know that.”“I do. But…” She paused and exhaled a rush of words. “He’s selling River Run, and I don’t know what that means. He wants me to choose between himself and Nate, and it’s tearing me apart. And he’s gone and written all these wonderful letters, and just the thought of how hard this must have been is making me feel like I don’t deserve to be in the same room with him.” Her eyes watered again, and the damn tears spilled over. She dashed them away, sniffing loudly.“Oh, baby,” Alexa said. “It’ll be okay. You’re just scared. I can’t believe Stone’s selling River Run. He knows how much it means to you.”“He is. I saw the contract.”“I’m sure there’s an explanation. When he comes home, there’ll be plenty of time to discuss River Run and Nate and all these other emotions running through your system.”“No there won’t be. Stone and I…” Did she want to explain? Yes, she needed to tell someone. “We’re all out of time. I’m pregnant.”Alexa stared at her, eyes wide, mouth hanging open. “Pregnant?” She narrowed her gaze and tilted her head. “Does Stone know?”Emma shook her head and pointed a finger at her friend’s chest. “Don’t you dare tell him.”“Emma…”“No,” she interrupted before listening to any of the arguments Alexa was about to say. They probably only mirrored the silent ones she’d been having with herself. “He can’t know. Not yet, at least. I want him to go on this mission with a clear head, clear conscience and absolutely no conflicting emotions.”Alexa shook her head.“No,” Emma repeated. “You have to swear you won’t say a word.”“I won’t say a thing. But I think you’re doing yourself and Stone a great injustice.”“Maybe, but it’s the right thing to do. He needs to be fully focused on this mission.”“He needs?” Alexa rose from the couch and paced in a tight circle. “What about you? How far along are you?”“Ten, maybe eleven weeks.”“You’re almost through your first trimester. Oh Emma, you’re so wrong about all of this. You should be sharing this with Stone.”“No. Don’t make me sorry I told you. He’d worry, and…” Emma leaned her head back and closed her eyes.“And?”“What if he doesn’t want the baby?” There, she’d done it. She’d voiced her greatest fear.“No.” Alexa sat back on the couch and grabbed Emma’s hands. “No, he’d never feel that way.”Looking into her friends eyes, she saw the worry and a flicker of doubt. “Yes he might and you know it.”“I don’t know a thing. Stone’s a difficult man, but he’ll do what’s right. He’ll stand by you.”“I don’t want that.” Emma stood and stared down at Alexa. “I won’t accept anything less than his full love for me and my child. I don’t even know how I’m supposed to choose between him and Nate. How do you just stop loving someone?”Alexa shook her head, and they both dropped into silence. *** “Hey, who died?” Stone stood in the doorway looking from one woman to the next. The emotions in the air were thick enough for him to draw a knife through. “Alexa, what a pleasant surprise.” Neither one answered, they simply stood staring at one another. Alexa’s face was pale, and he thought he noted a tinge of anger building in her posture. Emma seemed frozen, her eyes a watery green and cheeks tear stained.“Ladies, you’re scaring me.”Emma jerked, and turned to face him. She smiled, but it didn’t hide the hurt shining bright within the emerald depths of her gaze. “Sorry, we were just debating the advantages and disadvantages of shopping online.”Stone frowned. “You don’t lie well. What gives?”“Nothing,” Alexa said, rising from the couch. “Emma’s right. We weren’t agreeing with one another, and I’m so tired I gave her a hard time.” She turned and hugged Emma. “I’m sorry, sistah. I love you.”Emma returned the hug, her shoulders more relaxed than when he first entered the room. “I love you, too.” Both women teared up, and Stone backed away hastily.“I think I’ll come back later.”“It’s okay, cuz. I really just stopped by to give you a hug and tell you not to be gone for too long.”He sighed in relief as Emma and Alexa laughed softly. Okay, out of the danger zone. Man, tears scared him more than the thought of returning to the Congo. “Don’t worry. In ten days, you’ll be wishing I’d stayed away.”“I’ll hold you to that.” Alexa hugged him and waved a hand at Emma. “I’ll call you tomorrow, Emmie.”“See ya, Lex. Drive safely.”After Alexa shut the front door, Stone turned on Emma. Something wasn’t right.“What gives?”“Nothing Stone. Drop it, okay?”“Is this about me leaving or about those letters? Because I have to go, but I don’t have to mail the letters if you think they’re not appropriate.”Her face softened and the love that shone from her eyes touched his heart. “The letters are wonderful. You’re an amazing man.”“No, I’m not. I couldn’t have done any of this without you.”He walked over and wrapped his arms around her. Holding her close, the pain of leaving suddenly slammed into his chest with a vengeance. The sharp burn made him wince, and he held tighter.“I can’t believe you’re leaving tomorrow.”“It’s going to be the longest two weeks of my life.”“I know.”“About earlier…I didn’t use any protection, are you okay?”She sighed heavily and nestled closer. “I’m fine.”“You said it was too late, what does that mean? I wanted to ask you then but my attention was elsewhere.” He felt her shoulders shake with laughter, and suddenly she broke away, laughing even harder. Actually, he frowned, she seemed quite hysterical. “Am I missing something here?”“No,” Emma inhaled and swallowed. “I’m on the pill now. Don’t worry.”“Oh,” he said, still perplexed by her behavior. “Why didn’t you say so?” She waved her hand at him and burst into another round of giggles.“I dunno. I guess it slipped my mind. Oh please, stop looking at me like that.” Tears were streaming down her face, and her smile suddenly faltered. A hand squeezed his heart when happy tears melted into sad.“I’m sorry,” he said.“What for?” She bit her lip and sniffled.“Making you cry.” He pulled her back into his arms and held tight. Stone wanted to tell her how he felt, tell her he loved her, but it didn’t feel right. Somehow his words seemed empty. He needed to show her, and to do that…he had a mission to accomplish. *** Stone swung around in the office chair to glance out the window. He waited for Rex’s final call. His duffel bag sat by the front door, an ominous symbol of his departure. He didn’t know where Emma was. The scent of jasmine wafted lightly around the office, signaling her recent occupancy.The second the phone rang, he snatched it off the base unit.“Yeah, I’m ready.” He said, his heart pounding. Scared. That feeling didn’t sit well with him.“Did you call Nate like I asked?”“No, Rex. I’ve arranged for Seth to stay with Emma.”“Stone, Nate knows how Adams reacts. He’d be an incredible asset.”“No. That man isn’t allowed on this property.”“But Emma…”Stone interrupted him, not wanting to hear any more. “She’s chosen me, and that’s all I need.”“You’re a fool.”“Dammit Rex, give me my coordinates and stop acting like a mother hen.”Stone quickly scribbled down his instructions. A trickle of fear skimmed his skin when Kuffuor’s name was spoken, but he tamped it down and focused on the goal. He’d not allow one life to be lost on this mission, Stone silently vowed. Not one life.“And the plan for Seamus?” he asked.He heard Rex take a deep breath. “It’s been approved. Both missions should take place simultaneously.”Stone smiled in satisfaction. “Then Emma shouldn’t be in any danger.”“I’m just covering all bases, Stone. I still think you should involve your father.”“No. End of discussion.” Stone glance at his watch and realized he only had two hours before he needed to be at the airport. “I’ve gotta go. There’s a certain lady I want to find.”“Good luck, buddy.”“No luck needed.” Stone hung up the phone and wrestled with his thoughts.He could do this.He would do this.He had no choice. *** Emma stood in her own room, preparing it for Seth’s occupancy. She could hear the low murmur of Stone’s voice from the office, knowing he’d be discussing his mission with Rex. Indifference. She prayed for the indifference he’d once accused her of possessing.“There you are,” Stone said.She plastered a smile to her face and turned toward him. “Yep, just getting ready for Seth.”“I know you don’t want him here.”“No, I don’t. It’s going to be like spending two weeks with a two hundred pound puppy. The man’s a nuisance.”He grinned at her. “Yes, he is.”She couldn’t help but laugh. “He means well.”“And he’ll make a fine watchdog.”Sobering, Emma thought about Seth’s reason for staying at River Run. “Do you really think Seamus Adams will make a move against me?”“Honestly? I don’t think so. We’ll hit him before he has a chance to retaliate.”Success, Emma thought. One piece of the puzzle confirmed. “So this mission does involve him.”The shock that flared in Stone’s eyes almost made her laugh. Did he think she was an idiot? Then his gaze flitted to amusement. “Caught me red handed.”She shrugged. “I stopped hiding a long time ago. I’m facing a few things I wish I didn’t have to.”Stone stepped into the room and gently traced the gold eagle nesting against her throat. “Thank you for wearing this.”She placed a hand over his, locking his fingers against her skin. “Are you doing this for me?”“It’s complicated, and I can’t discuss the details.”“Revenge never solves anything, Stone.

      "content": "Chapter Sixteen Days passed in quiet solitude. Seth tried too hard, and Emma cried too much.Hormones.If she’d known pregnancy revolved around emotional insanity, she’d have opted to commit herself into a padded room for nine months.Staring out the kitchen window, she watched the sun burn holes into the snow covered pasture. The dripping of melting icicles splashed against the window panes, and she allowed herself a few dreamy moments in contemplation of Stone’s return.She missed him with an intensity never expected. Emma knew her life would forever revolve around him, whether he loved her or not.She’d called the doctor earlier that morning.After explaining her concern, the ob-gyn had reassured her that a small amount of bleeding could be entirely normal and not to worry.It was now early afternoon, and the spotting hadn’t stopped.Fearing the worst, Emma decided she’d better try and reach Seth or Alexa. *** Emma lay on the living room couch. Her head hurt, her body ached. She was a mess.Nate hovered over her, and she tried to sit up.“Stay still. I want to know exactly what the doctor said.”“Nate, you shouldn’t be here.”“Yeah? Then why’d you call me from the hospital?”“I didn’t know who else to phone. Seth’s out on the range and Alexa’s in New York. I’m better now, so you can leave.”He sat on the arm of the sofa and shook his head. “Why didn’t you tell me about the baby?”“Stone doesn’t even know.”At that, the older man quirked a brow. “I’ll make you some soup then be on my way. But first, what did the doctor say?”“She said I needed to stay off my feet and in bed. They’re afraid of placenta privia.”“Uh huh. Now, convert that to English.”“From what I gather, my placenta is attached to my uterus which is what triggered the bleeding.” Emma sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose, exhausted after the hours spent in the emergency room. “They’ll know more in another month or so when the ultrasound will show exactly what’s going on.”“I’m not going anywhere until Seth returns. You need to be in bed and not move.”“I’ll be fine. I’m sorry I worried you.”“Honey, you were bleeding and that’s not good. Even an old codger like me knows that. You’re pale and look like you’ve run the New York marathon. Let me take care of you.”Emma sank back into the cushions of the couch knowing he was right. The past ten days had been a battle to breathe. She missed Stone with every inch of her body and soul and couldn’t wait for him to return.Four more days.Four more very long days.This little complication with the pregnancy, would definitely make telling him easy. He wouldn’t miss the fact she couldn’t walk around not to mention greet him in the manner her body burned for.The front door slammed.“Emma?”She’d expected to hear Seth’s voice. Instead, the deep baritone of the very man she longed for echoed through the house. Her heart slammed to her chest and before she could grab his attention things whirled out of control. *** “What the hell are you doing here?” Stone couldn’t believe his father stood in the kitchen, stirring a pan of something that smelled suspiciously like chicken soup.“Don’t go jumping to conclusions, son.”“Don’t…son? I can’t process that.”“Stone…”He spun around at the sound of Emma’s voice. He couldn’t see her and then her head popped up over the couch. Was she hiding? Didn’t she even have the decency to tell him face to face that his father owned her heart and not him?“Don’t…” he stepped back, betrayal slamming into every weary muscle of his body. The wound on his shoulder felt like a bug bite compared to the knife in his heart. How could he have been so foolish? Asense Kuffuor’s lifeless face laughed at him, and Stone thought bitterly that his enemy had won after all.“No.” Emma sat up all the way. Her face looked rather pale, but he figured it was due to being caught. “I needed your father…”“Obviously much more than you needed me.”“Stone listen to me, I was in…”“I’m not hearing another lie from your lips.” He stepped into the living room and glared at her. “That man in the kitchen,” he pointed behind him. “The one you hold so dearly to your heart, hated me…abused me and almost killed me.”“No. I won’t believe that. It was a horrible time for him. What about forgiveness? You’re not God, you can’t judge and convict.”“Forgive? Did you forgive the man who murdered your mother?”“That’s different. Your father hasn’t killed anyone.”Stone didn’t even bother to hold back. “Well, love of my life, that’s where you’re wrong. He killed my mother. Flat out shot her dead then turned the gun on his own son. Would’ve shot me too if the police hadn’t arrived.”He watched as she turned shocked eyes to his father. “No,” was all she said.“Oh, yes. But I shouldn’t need to tell you. You promised to stand by my side. I thought you’d chosen me, but I guess I was wrong.”“You weren’t wrong.” Her emerald eyes pleaded for understanding, but he wrapped his heart with concrete and refused to give in.“I’d go to the ends of the earth for you. Actually, I did. The only thing that kept me sane these past two weeks is the thought of you. I’d die if that’s what it took for you to know.”“Know?”“How much I love you. How much I want you to love me.”“Stone…”He held his hand up and shook his head. “I’m not doing this. You’ve made your choice. I wish you only the best.” Before he changed his mind, Stone turned and left the room. He passed Hugh Gallagher in the hall and nodded for him to go in.Striding out of the house, he breathed deeply and jumped behind the wheel of his Jeep. Without another thought or moment to allow the pain in his chest to settle, he left River Run forever. *** Emma sank back into the couch. The betrayal written across Stone’s face burned her eyes, tearing at her soul.“Emma?”She knew that voice.A memory…worn and tattered, surfaced. Chest tight with emotion, she raised her head above the couch. Gasping, she covered her face as tears spilled uncontrollably. Her father, thin and aged, stood less than a foot away.“Papa…” He closed the distance and gathered her in his embrace. All she could think, all she could feel didn’t come close to the splintering and shattering of her heart, the echo of the front door slamming destroying her world. *** “I’m sorry,” Nate said as he tucked the sheets around her.“It’s not your fault.” Emma felt numb. If she hadn’t been incapacitated, she’d run after Stone and pummel sense into him. Instead, she lay in bed her sheets swathing her in heartbreak and endless what ifs.“Is my father settled?”“Yes. He’ll be by after he’s had a nap and shower.”She nodded. Would she ever be able to look at her father without blaming him for the loss of her love? What irony. If only she’d attempted to understand Stone’s feeling toward his own father, she might have avoided the same herself.Damn him. Damn Stone for risking his life to return her father. She didn’t want her father, she wanted him. And that thought alone shot a few more holes through her heart.“I want the truth.”“About my wife?”“About everything. Your wife, your son, the reason you were such a SOB. Lay it on the line, Nate, or get out of my home.”“It was an accident.”“Go on.” Emma leaned back, resting her eyes. She listened to Nate’s story, her heart bleeding for the boy that was Stone.“Katie was a good woman, a loving wife and terrific mother. I wasn’t so great.” Emma ignored the tears that brightened Nate’s eyes. No, he hadn’t been great. “Years before Seamus Adams turned his sight on Hugh, he focused on me. He didn’t kill me. No, first he destroyed everything I held dear. Luring me into the depths of gambling darkness, plying me with booze, turning me into a nightmare.”“You must have helped somehow.” She said softly. “You can’t blame your actions on one man.”Nate nodded. “I loved the booze, as well you know. I’d pretty much reached the bottom when that Irish madman’s fist struck. Stone had been hiking around Jenny Lake one afternoon. He didn’t come home. Katie called the local rangers. That evening they found him at the bottom of a cliff, broken and bloodied. It wasn’t until Hugh showed up at our back door that I realized Adams was behind it.”“Seamus came here?”“Yeah, he saved Stone then disappeared, fearful for his own family. But he didn’t leave before jamming his boot up my butt and making me realize what a heel I’d been.”“Heel? Is that what you’d call it?” Emma felt herself pulling away, shutting doors on Nate’s corner of her heart.“How old was Stone?”“Fifteen.”“Go on…what happened next?”“They came into my home. I was too drunk to understand what was happening. Katie, my dear Katie.” He paused, his voice cracking with emotion. “She fought for her life, but they shot her. I guess that was my punishment. Seamus never planned on physically killing me.”“And Stone? Why does he believe you killed his mother?”“He heard the gunshots and came racing down the stairs. I was inconsolable, out of my mind. I grabbed the gun the men had left and aimed at him. I wanted to kill him. I wanted to kill myself.”“And?”“I pulled the trigger.”Emma couldn’t believe what she heard. Her stomach twisted, a deep pain welled in her chest.Tears streamed down Nate’s face as his memories came tumbling out. “The barrel was empty. Stone never spoke to me after that. I guess I didn’t care. I drank and gambled and beat him every time he turned accusing eyes in my direction. Even though I didn’t pull the trigger that day, I killed my wife. He knew it and so did I.”He looked at her and despair crossed his face. “Don’t say anything, Emma. I see it in your eyes. When Hugh called three years later wanting to collect on the debt I owed, I dried out. For Stone, it was too late. He’d already joined the military and left Jackson. But I thought if I could somehow help my old friend, repay him for saving my son when I couldn’t, then maybe some sense was to be had of my life.”“That’s when you came to Ireland.”“Yes. But I was too late. Your mother was gone and your father presumed dead. You were the only one left.”“I see.” Emma bent her head and listened to her heart. Truly listened, and her path became clear. Running her fingers across the pendant that burned her skin, she understood Stone’s request. It’d taken awhile, but it was time for her to fly. *** “Are you sure about this?” Alexa questioned for the tenth time that morning.“Yes,” Emma answered, trying not to let the exasperation show.“Okay. I found him.”Her heart leapt and the smile that tugged at her mouth felt wonderful. It’d been two months since her world crumbled and now she’d begun to piece it back together. “You’re a doll,” Emma said, hugging Alexa.“I can’t believe you’ve sold River Run.”“After Nate signed the papers over, it was mine to do whatever I wanted with.”“But why?”Emma shook her head and grimaced at how horrible the past weeks had been. “I don’t want River Run. The only thing that matters is Stone. Give me his address.”“Okay.” Alexa handed over the piece of paper.“How’d you track him down?”“He called.”Emma refused to allow any anger or hurt to penetrate this moment. She didn’t expect him to call her, no – she needed to tell him so many things first, prove to him that he was the one she chose. “I see. You didn’t say anything about me, did you?”“No, I didn’t.” Alexa wagged a finger under Emma’s nose. “Even though every little nerve demanded I spill.”“Thanks for being a good friend.”“I don’t understand you.”“Well, I guess that makes two of us.”“Have you spoken to Nate?”“No ma’am, and I don’t intend to either. He doesn’t deserve any part of River Run or any part of my life.”“That’s rather harsh.”Emma shook her head. “He should’ve told me the truth, given me the advantage I needed to help Stone. I’ll take responsibility for my inability to trust completely, but I’ll be damned if that man gets off scot-free.”“You don’t really mean that, do you?”“Yes and no. Time heals everything, Alexa. It’ll heal me too. But right now Nate Connor has no claim on my life or my affection.” Now, if she could convince Stone of her love, maybe everything would work.“How’s the baby?”“Better. I still need to be off my feet most of the day. But the doctor says everything looks just fine.”“So what’re you going to do with this?” Alexa tapped the piece of paper she’d handed to Emma.“Letters. I’m going to write lots of letters. I had my first ultrasound yesterday and the picture is going to be winging its way to…” She looked at the address in her hand. “Utah? What the heck’s he doing in Utah?”“I haven’t a clue, but by the address it looks like he’s ranching.”“A hidden talent I didn’t know about?”“Honey, all the Connors are born to ranch. It’s a genetic thing.”Emma laughed and felt the sunshine kiss her skin. Spring bloomed across the range and life blossomed within. “I can do this,” she said.“I know you can.” Alexa agreed.“Ready to go look at my new home?”“Only if I drive. I’m not going anywhere in that pickup truck of yours.”“Actually,” Emma laughed, “I was hoping you’d offer. I’m not very graceful these days.” *** Emma enjoyed the freedom of the convertible. Alexa maneuvered along the back roads with ease born from familiarity. The wind nipped at their noses, but they both refused to put the top up.“This is closer to our ranch than to River Run.” Alexa said.“Yeah, I know. I did that on purpose. Besides it has a huge barn for the animals.”“Oh, aren’t they staying at the resort?”“Nope. They weren’t for sale.”“I’m going to be nosy and ask what the final sales price was.” Alexa had to shout above the wind. Emma grabbed her ponytail, trying to control the wisps from catching her eyes.“Nine million.”Alexa slammed on the brakes. “Holy bat-guano, Emma. I can’t believe that.”Emma smiled. “Yeah, it’s wonderful isn’t it? What do you think Stone’ll do with all that er…” she frowned then smiled again. “Bat-guano?”“Send it back.” Alexa pushed down on the accelerator again and the car sped around a sharp corner.“That’s what I’m hoping for, with him attached to the other end.”“Oooh boy, lot’s of challenges heading in that boy’s direction.”“He can handle it. Here it is.” Emma pointed to the left and Alexa pulled the convertible onto a gravel drive. They drove in silence as the car hummed quietly along a serpentine path. Topping the ridge, Alexa gasped in surprise.“Oh Emma,” she said. “This is beautiful.”“Yeah, I think so.” The two of them climbed out of the car and walked toward the sprawling cabin. Emma pulled a key out of her purse and they entered the glass and timber home.She’d not bought any furniture yet, but one of the local galleries already delivered and installed her new light fixtures. She’d chosen a rustic décor, native to the area. Chandeliers made of antlers hung in the foyer and the dining room. Emma clapped her hands in delight when she saw them.“Aren’t they cool?”Alexa laughed and nodded in agreement. “What’s really cool is this view.”The house was nestled high upon a hill top. The entire back wall made of glass. It looked over the valley of Jackson Hole with the Grand Tetons framing the vista to the left and the ski slopes dominating the right. Gently flowing pastures rolled down hill until they were divided by one of the many tributaries from the Snake.“I hope this all works.” A sudden sense of dread, invading her good spirits.“You’ll make it work.”“Yes,” she agreed. “I will. I don’t care what anyone else needs, I’m going for what I need.”“Which is?”“Stone Connor. I need Stone.”“Good girl.” Alexa walked back outside and headed to the car. “Come on kiddo, it’s time to get you back to bed.”Emma smiled and as much as she hated leaving, she knew Alexa was right. Besides, in a few more weeks she’d be here permanently. *** Curled in a tight ball, Emma pulled the covers up over her head, muffling her sobs. It didn’t help. She felt the weight of the bed give way and knew her father sat on the edge waiting for her to gain control.“Is there anything I can do, child?” The lilt of his brogue soothed, but her heart still wouldn’t cease its endless ache.“No, Papa. Thanks though.” She held tight to the sheets he tugged away from her.“You need to be strong. If not for yourself, then do it for the wee bairn who has yet to see the light of day.”“She’ll only be coming into a life of misery. No father and a mother too heartbroken to live.”Her father’s soft chuckle didn’t endear him one bit. “Stone’ll come around.”“I’ve been mailing letters every week since May. It’s the end of August and not a word. I thought he’d at least come home to check on his baby, but no. Nothing.”“He has a lot to work through. The Congo hasn’t been kind to him and facing down the man who held me captive must’ve taken a toll. His emotions were so raw.”Emma nodded. “I know. If I could do that day all over again, I’d have gone after him.”“You might’ve lost the baby.”A dark thought crossed her mind, but her heart caught it and banished it. She hadn’t risked the baby, and that had been the right decision.“I’ve moved my stuff into the guest room downstairs.” Hugh said.Emma sat up and dried her eyes. “Why? Is Nate giving you a hard time?”“No. But we both decided that seeing you’re coming up on your due date, it’d be best if someone stayed here.”“You both decided?” Emma allowed a brief burst of bitterness to escape. “Haven’t I made it clear that I’m in charge of my own life? I don’t want to be responsible for anyone else.”“Whoa, child. I’ll be fine just by myself and so will Nate. We don’t want you to care for us. Let us care for you.” Hugh scooted closer and wiped a hand across her face.She reached up and held on. “I’ll be okay. It’s just all these hormones.”“I know you miss him.”“I do. I never realized how much I loved him until he left.”“You only have a few weeks left before your daughter is born. Why not try and carve a little happiness out of those days?”Emma nodded. She knew her father was right. But every time a flash of the future, empty of Stone, crossed her mind, it rendered her senseless. She’d done everything but pound on his door. She’d do that too, if the damn doctors would let her out of bed. The placenta privia hadn’t corrected itself in her second trimester like they’d hoped, leaving her confined to limited activity and no stress.“I’ll try, Papa. Please don’t worry.”“I can worry, it’s my right. I might have missed a great part of your life but I’m here now. My little granddaughter will be raised like a good Irish lass.”“But she’s American.” Emma laughed at her father’s expression.“Bite your tongue.” He stood and patted her cheek. She noted the healthy glow to his skin and how his figure had filled out. It hadn’t taken long for her to overcome the mixed feelings of resentment and love. Love won out. It wasn’t her father’s fault she’d made a bed of nails to sleep in.“Is Tilly here yet?”“Not yet. Isn’t this her morning off?”“Yes, that’s right.” She was still amazed at how Tilly had stepped up and taken over. The woman refused to work for the new owners of River Run, and in a weak moment, Emma offered her a position of personal assistant. She helped around the house and basically performed all the duties Emma’s current incapacitation wouldn’t allow. She’d never regretted the decision.“Would you mind fixing me a cup of tea?” In reality, Emma craved solitude, not tea.“Of course. I think I remember how to boil water.”“Papa…” He made her smile and for that she was grateful.“I’ll be back.” Hugh left her room, and she sank into the comfort of her pillows. Closing her eyes, she fought against the next wave of despair.Why hadn’t he answered?Where was he?Rolling over, she gasped as a sharp pain knifed through her lower belly. Emma sat up and took several deep breaths. The pain receded, and she lay back down. She didn’t think it was labor pains, because she’d been suffering from Braxton Hicks for the past month. This felt more like a slice. Probably gas, she decided trying to remember what she’d eaten yesterday.After a few moments of rest, Emma figured that’s exactly what it’d been and sat up carefully. Her hair lay plastered to her head from the sudden hot flashes she experienced in the middle of the night.The phone rang and Emma answered, a slight flutter to her pulse. Maybe it was him.“Hello?”“Emma sweetie, I’ll be over shortly. Do you need anything?”“No, Tilly, but thanks.”“What’re you doing?”“I’m about to take a shower. I feel yucky after last night.”“Oh those hot flashes again? You know you really need to read that chapter again in the book I gave you. It’s very informative.”“Why bother?” Emma said under her breath. Tilly’d become a virtual Einstein on pregnancy.“What was that?”“I said,” she spoke louder, “I gather.”“Okey dokey, I’ll be there soon.”“Tilly?” Emma suddenly regretted her snotty thoughts.“Yes?”“Thank you. You’re an angel.”“Don’t you blubber at me I’m doing my best with this new leaf, but blubbering and hugging and heart to heart talks won’t make it any easier.”Emma laughed for the second time that morning. Maybe things were becoming easier. Maybe.Stepping from the comfort of her bed, she waddled to the bathroom. Ugh, she couldn’t wait to see her feet again. Ignoring the huge hippo reflected in the mirror, Emma made her way to the shower.She turned the knob and went to pull her nightgown over her head.Another pain stabbed across her belly, but this time it drove her to her knees. The sound of the showerhead spurting water pounded against her brain, mimicking the throbbing fire attacking her insides.Placing a hand upon the tiled wall, Emma inhaled and exhaled trying to use the Lamaze method of pain control. Her vision dimmed, and she fought to remain conscious against the pain.Calling for her father, she swore when her voice came out a pathetic whimper. Another flash of pain and then a warm river of moisture trickled down her legs.Reaching down, she lifted her night gown. Thick ribbons of red pooled on the white tile. Emma’s heart seized and the next stab of pain had her screaming at the top of her lungs. She heard her father’s footsteps bounding up the stairs as she slid down to the floor, no longer able to battle against the treachery of her body.",

      "content": "Chapter Sixteen Days passed in quiet solitude. Seth tried too hard, and Emma cried too much.Hormones.If she’d known pregnancy revolved around emotional insanity, she’d have opted to commit herself into a padded room for nine months.Staring out the kitchen window, she watched the sun burn holes into the snow covered pasture. The dripping of melting icicles splashed against the window panes, and she allowed herself a few dreamy moments in contemplation of Stone’s return.She missed him with an intensity never expected. Emma knew her life would forever revolve around him, whether he loved her or not.She’d called the doctor earlier that morning.After explaining her concern, the ob-gyn had reassured her that a small amount of bleeding could be entirely normal and not to worry.It was now early afternoon, and the spotting hadn’t stopped.Fearing the worst, Emma decided she’d better try and reach Seth or Alexa. *** Emma lay on the living room couch. Her head hurt, her body ached. She was a mess.Nate hovered over her, and she tried to sit up.“Stay still. I want to know exactly what the doctor said.”“Nate, you shouldn’t be here.”“Yeah? Then why’d you call me from the hospital?”“I didn’t know who else to phone. Seth’s out on the range and Alexa’s in New York. I’m better now, so you can leave.”He sat on the arm of the sofa and shook his head. “Why didn’t you tell me about the baby?”“Stone doesn’t even know.”At that, the older man quirked a brow. “I’ll make you some soup then be on my way. But first, what did the doctor say?”“She said I needed to stay off my feet and in bed. They’re afraid of placenta privia.”“Uh huh. Now, convert that to English.”“From what I gather, my placenta is attached to my uterus which is what triggered the bleeding.” Emma sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose, exhausted after the hours spent in the emergency room. “They’ll know more in another month or so when the ultrasound will show exactly what’s going on.”“I’m not going anywhere until Seth returns. You need to be in bed and not move.”“I’ll be fine. I’m sorry I worried you.”“Honey, you were bleeding and that’s not good. Even an old codger like me knows that. You’re pale and look like you’ve run the New York marathon. Let me take care of you.”Emma sank back into the cushions of the couch knowing he was right. The past ten days had been a battle to breathe. She missed Stone with every inch of her body and soul and couldn’t wait for him to return.Four more days.Four more very long days.This little complication with the pregnancy, would definitely make telling him easy. He wouldn’t miss the fact she couldn’t walk around not to mention greet him in the manner her body burned for.The front door slammed.“Emma?”She’d expected to hear Seth’s voice. Instead, the deep baritone of the very man she longed for echoed through the house. Her heart slammed to her chest and before she could grab his attention things whirled out of control. *** “What the hell are you doing here?” Stone couldn’t believe his father stood in the kitchen, stirring a pan of something that smelled suspiciously like chicken soup.“Don’t go jumping to conclusions, son.”“Don’t…son? I can’t process that.”“Stone…”He spun around at the sound of Emma’s voice. He couldn’t see her and then her head popped up over the couch. Was she hiding? Didn’t she even have the decency to tell him face to face that his father owned her heart and not him?“Don’t…” he stepped back, betrayal slamming into every weary muscle of his body. The wound on his shoulder felt like a bug bite compared to the knife in his heart. How could he have been so foolish? Asense Kuffuor’s lifeless face laughed at him, and Stone thought bitterly that his enemy had won after all.“No.” Emma sat up all the way. Her face looked rather pale, but he figured it was due to being caught. “I needed your father…”“Obviously much more than you needed me.”“Stone listen to me, I was in…”“I’m not hearing another lie from your lips.” He stepped into the living room and glared at her. “That man in the kitchen,” he pointed behind him. “The one you hold so dearly to your heart, hated me…abused me and almost killed me.”“No. I won’t believe that. It was a horrible time for him. What about forgiveness? You’re not God, you can’t judge and convict.”“Forgive? Did you forgive the man who murdered your mother?”“That’s different. Your father hasn’t killed anyone.”Stone didn’t even bother to hold back. “Well, love of my life, that’s where you’re wrong. He killed my mother. Flat out shot her dead then turned the gun on his own son. Would’ve shot me too if the police hadn’t arrived.”He watched as she turned shocked eyes to his father. “No,” was all she said.“Oh, yes. But I shouldn’t need to tell you. You promised to stand by my side. I thought you’d chosen me, but I guess I was wrong.”“You weren’t wrong.” Her emerald eyes pleaded for understanding, but he wrapped his heart with concrete and refused to give in.“I’d go to the ends of the earth for you. Actually, I did. The only thing that kept me sane these past two weeks is the thought of you. I’d die if that’s what it took for you to know.”“Know?”“How much I love you. How much I want you to love me.”“Stone…”He held his hand up and shook his head. “I’m not doing this. You’ve made your choice. I wish you only the best.” Before he changed his mind, Stone turned and left the room. He passed Hugh Gallagher in the hall and nodded for him to go in.Striding out of the house, he breathed deeply and jumped behind the wheel of his Jeep. Without another thought or moment to allow the pain in his chest to settle, he left River Run forever. *** Emma sank back into the couch. The betrayal written across Stone’s face burned her eyes, tearing at her soul.“Emma?”She knew that voice.A memory…worn and tattered, surfaced. Chest tight with emotion, she raised her head above the couch. Gasping, she covered her face as tears spilled uncontrollably. Her father, thin and aged, stood less than a foot away.“Papa…” He closed the distance and gathered her in his embrace. All she could think, all she could feel didn’t come close to the splintering and shattering of her heart, the echo of the front door slamming destroying her world. *** “I’m sorry,” Nate said as he tucked the sheets around her.“It’s not your fault.” Emma felt numb. If she hadn’t been incapacitated, she’d run after Stone and pummel sense into him. Instead, she lay in bed her sheets swathing her in heartbreak and endless what ifs.“Is my father settled?”“Yes. He’ll be by after he’s had a nap and shower.”She nodded. Would she ever be able to look at her father without blaming him for the loss of her love? What irony. If only she’d attempted to understand Stone’s feeling toward his own father, she might have avoided the same herself.Damn him. Damn Stone for risking his life to return her father. She didn’t want her father, she wanted him. And that thought alone shot a few more holes through her heart.“I want the truth.”“About my wife?”“About everything. Your wife, your son, the reason you were such a SOB. Lay it on the line, Nate, or get out of my home.”“It was an accident.”“Go on.” Emma leaned back, resting her eyes. She listened to Nate’s story, her heart bleeding for the boy that was Stone.“Katie was a good woman, a loving wife and terrific mother. I wasn’t so great.” Emma ignored the tears that brightened Nate’s eyes. No, he hadn’t been great. “Years before Seamus Adams turned his sight on Hugh, he focused on me. He didn’t kill me. No, first he destroyed everything I held dear. Luring me into the depths of gambling darkness, plying me with booze, turning me into a nightmare.”“You must have helped somehow.” She said softly. “You can’t blame your actions on one man.”Nate nodded. “I loved the booze, as well you know. I’d pretty much reached the bottom when that Irish madman’s fist struck. Stone had been hiking around Jenny Lake one afternoon. He didn’t come home. Katie called the local rangers. That evening they found him at the bottom of a cliff, broken and bloodied. It wasn’t until Hugh showed up at our back door that I realized Adams was behind it.”“Seamus came here?”“Yeah, he saved Stone then disappeared, fearful for his own family. But he didn’t leave before jamming his boot up my butt and making me realize what a heel I’d been.”“Heel? Is that what you’d call it?” Emma felt herself pulling away, shutting doors on Nate’s corner of her heart.“How old was Stone?”“Fifteen.”“Go on…what happened next?”“They came into my home. I was too drunk to understand what was happening. Katie, my dear Katie.” He paused, his voice cracking with emotion. “She fought for her life, but they shot her. I guess that was my punishment. Seamus never planned on physically killing me.”“And Stone? Why does he believe you killed his mother?”“He heard the gunshots and came racing down the stairs. I was inconsolable, out of my mind. I grabbed the gun the men had left and aimed at him. I wanted to kill him. I wanted to kill myself.”“And?”“I pulled the trigger.”Emma couldn’t believe what she heard. Her stomach twisted, a deep pain welled in her chest.Tears streamed down Nate’s face as his memories came tumbling out. “The barrel was empty. Stone never spoke to me after that. I guess I didn’t care. I drank and gambled and beat him every time he turned accusing eyes in my direction. Even though I didn’t pull the trigger that day, I killed my wife. He knew it and so did I.”He looked at her and despair crossed his face. “Don’t say anything, Emma. I see it in your eyes.

He doesn’t deserve any part of River Run or any part of my life.”“That’s rather harsh.”Emma shook her head. “He should’ve told me the truth, given me the advantage I needed to help Stone.

She hadn’t risked the baby, and that had been the right decision.“I’ve moved my stuff into the guest room downstairs.” Hugh said.Emma sat up and dried her eyes. “Why? Is Nate giving you a hard time?”“No. But we both decided that seeing you’re coming up on your due date, it’d be best if someone stayed here.”“You both decided?” Emma allowed a brief burst of bitterness to escape. “Haven’t I made it clear that I’m in charge of my own life? I don’t want to be responsible for anyone else.”“Whoa, child. I’ll be fine just by myself and so will Nate. We don’t want you to care for us. Let us care for you.” Hugh scooted closer and wiped a hand across her face.She reached up and held on. “I’ll be okay. It’s just all these hormones.”“I know you miss him.”“I do. I never realized how much I loved him until he left.”“You only have a few weeks left before your daughter is born. Why not try and carve a little happiness out of those days?”Emma nodded. She knew her father was right. But every time a flash of the future, empty of Stone, crossed her mind, it rendered her senseless. She’d done everything but pound on his door. She’d do that too, if the damn doctors would let her out of bed. The placenta privia hadn’t corrected itself in her second trimester like they’d hoped, leaving her confined to limited activity and no stress.“I’ll try, Papa. Please don’t worry.”“I can worry, it’s my right. I might have missed a great part of your life but I’m here now. My little granddaughter will be raised like a good Irish lass.”“But she’s American.” Emma laughed at her father’s expression.“Bite your tongue.” He stood and patted her cheek. She noted the healthy glow to his skin and how his figure had filled out. It hadn’t taken long for her to overcome the mixed feelings of resentment and love. Love won out. It wasn’t her father’s fault she’d made a bed of nails to sleep in.“Is Tilly here yet?”“Not yet. Isn’t this her morning off?”“Yes, that’s right.” She was still amazed at how Tilly had stepped up and taken over. The woman refused to work for the new owners of River Run, and in a weak moment, Emma offered her a position of personal assistant. She helped around the house and basically performed all the duties Emma’s current incapacitation wouldn’t allow. She’d never regretted the decision.“Would you mind fixing me a cup of tea?” In reality, Emma craved solitude, not tea.“Of course. I think I remember how to boil water.”“Papa…” He made her smile and for that she was grateful.“I’ll be back.” Hugh left her room, and she sank into the comfort of her pillows. Closing her eyes, she fought against the next wave of despair.Why hadn’t he answered?Where was he?Rolling over, she gasped as a sharp pain knifed through her lower belly. Emma sat up and took several deep breaths. The pain receded, and she lay back down. She didn’t think it was labor pains, because she’d been suffering from Braxton Hicks for the past month. This felt more like a slice. Probably gas, she decided trying to remember what she’d eaten yesterday.After a few moments of rest, Emma figured that’s exactly what it’d been and sat up carefully. Her hair lay plastered to her head from the sudden hot flashes she experienced in the middle of the night.The phone rang and Emma answered, a slight flutter to her pulse. Maybe it was him.“Hello?”“Emma sweetie, I’ll be over shortly. Do you need anything?”“No, Tilly, but thanks.”“What’re you doing?”“I’m about to take a shower. I feel yucky after last night.”“Oh those hot flashes again? You know you really need to read that chapter again in the book I gave you. It’s very informative.”“Why bother?” Emma said under her breath. Tilly’d become a virtual Einstein on pregnancy.“What was that?”“I said,” she spoke louder, “I gather.”“Okey dokey, I’ll be there soon.”“Tilly?” Emma suddenly regretted her snotty thoughts.“Yes?”“Thank you. You’re an angel.”“Don’t you blubber at me I’m doing my best with this new leaf, but blubbering and hugging and heart to heart talks won’t make it any easier.”Emma laughed for the second time that morning. Maybe things were becoming easier. Maybe.Stepping from the comfort of her bed, she waddled to the bathroom. Ugh, she couldn’t wait to see her feet again. Ignoring the huge hippo reflected in the mirror, Emma made her way to the shower.She turned the knob and went to pull her nightgown over her head.Another pain stabbed across her belly, but this time it drove her to her knees. The sound of the showerhead spurting water pounded against her brain, mimicking the throbbing fire attacking her insides.Placing a hand upon the tiled wall, Emma inhaled and exhaled trying to use the Lamaze method of pain control. Her vision dimmed, and she fought to remain conscious against the pain.Calling for her father, she swore when her voice came out a pathetic whimper. Another flash of pain and then a warm river of moisture trickled down her legs.Reaching down, she lifted her night gown. Thick ribbons of red pooled on the white tile. Emma’s heart seized and the next stab of pain had her screaming at the top of her lungs. She heard her father’s footsteps bounding up the stairs as she slid down to the floor, no longer able to battle against the treachery of her body.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen Stone stared at the television. With half his mind numbed by beer, he didn’t care what the newscaster discussed. Twisting his head, he counted the empty bottles that lined the coffee table. Almost finished the twelve pack. Another night drowned and finished.A fist struck his door. He ignored the hammering and popped the top off another icy bottle.“Stone,” a familiar voice called from outside.His gut twisted. The past slammed into him, and he bit down on his hatred. Closing his eyes, he swallowed the emotion away and stared at the television.“Go away.”“Open this door or I’ll kick it down.”“Go away.” Didn’t anyone know how to leave a man alone?The sound of a heavy kick and splintering wood echoed through the dilapidated shack. He leapt off the old, moth-eaten recliner and bowed back to shoot a fist straight into his father’s nose.“Hold up, son. I’m not here to make peace with you so don’t go getting all defensive.”Stone narrowed his gaze, fist still in the air and growled. “Whaddya want?”“Look at you.” His father shook his head in disgust. Stone felt a sharp pang of shame then blasted it away with an angry bolt of betrayal.“Don’t like what you see? Go away.”“No,” Nate shook his head. “Unfortunately it looks damn familiar to me, seems I used to look into that face a lot about twenty years ago.”Stone glanced at the lopsided, cracked mirror hung on one wall. His hair was long and unkempt, greasy after several days of work in the field. He hadn’t bothered to shower. His full beard and mustache cloaked his face in black whiskers. He glared at his father.“Get out of here, old man.”“Emma needs you.”Taking a swig of beer, he choked, spewing the carbonated liquid through his nose. “Yeah, right.”“She’s…”“Why would she want me? You’re all she needs.”“I’ve not seen her since the day you left.”Stone eyed his father. “I don’t believe you.”Nate walked further into the room, looking around with obvious distaste. “Haven’t you gotten any of her letters?”“Letters? Yeah, I’ve gotten them.”“Emma’s….”“Bunch a crap if you ask me.” Stone didn’t want to look at his father. He resented the man’s clean clothes and healthy complexion. His father’s heart hadn’t been crushed and shattered, he’d won the war. “If she needs me, you tell her to come here and tell me to my face. I’ve been waiting. Damn.” His voice lowered, and he fought against the rush of emotion. “I’ve been waiting.”“Haven’t you read the letters?”“Why should I?” Stone walked to an end table, shuffled aside some old magazines and threw a stack of unopened envelopes on the floor. “If she wants to hide behind a piece of paper, let her.”“I hate to point a fact out to you, son. But you’ve gone and done the worst possible thing in your book.”“What the hell does that mean?” He glared at his father. “What makes you think I give a damn?”Stone swayed slightly and dashed his half-empty bottle of beer into the garbage, oblivious when beer splashed the sides of the kitchen cabinets and trickled over the edge of the can. He mentally shook himself and looked at his father. What did he want?“You’ve become me.”“I’ve become…” Stone faltered. He was drunk, meaner than a trapped possum, and split so far apart inside his heart bled rivers of blood every waking second.“Yeah, you’ve turned into me. There’s a woman in Jackson who’s dying of a broken heart, and you’re letting her slip away because of some stupid stubborn pride.”Stone swallowed. “She’ll be fine. Emma’s better off without me.”Nate shook his head. “You don’t get it, Stone. Emma’s in the hospital, and she’s dying.”The room tilted and Stone reached to steady himself. His entire body went numb. Fear, self-loathing, anger, love, every emotion possible pushed against his chest. “What happened?” He finally asked.“She hemorrhaged. The baby’s fine, but Emma lost too much blood. It doesn’t look good.”“Baby?”“Read the letters, Stone. I always thought you were the better man. Now prove it.”Stone watched his father leave the room then bent and collected the strewn envelopes from the floor. He sorted them by date and with shaking fingers opened the first one.My love,I wish I could be there to tell you all I feel. But, I can’t. The doctors say I must remain in bed at all times.Oh God, what had he done? A small black square fell from the envelope, and he scooped it up. It looked like a negative. Peering closer, Stone wasn’t sure what it was supposed to be.I’ve enclosed the very first picture of our baby. Take care of it as it’s the only one we have. Isn’t it a miracle?Frowning, Stone peered at the ultrasound picture. He didn’t see anything. But if it was part of Emma then he certainly loved whatever lay within the grainy shadows.You asked me to choose, and I have. I CHOOSE YOU! Please come home, I love you. EmmaHe ripped open a few more envelopes and they all said the same thing. “I choose you. Please come home. I love you.”Opening a letter dated in June, he snatched a slip of paper that floated to the ground. He held a bank check in the amount of nine million dollars. Eyes widened, he read her words.I’m sure you realize you forfeited River Run under the terms of Margaret’s Will. Nate didn’t want the resort and signed it over to me. Without you, it meant nothing. I contacted the buyer you’d signed the contracts with and believe it or not, he thought you’d cancelled because the asking price was too low.She’d seen the contracts?I knew you’d sold River Run. I discovered everything on Christmas, the night we conceived our child. But I didn’t know you’d voided the deal. I should’ve trusted in you, believed in you. I’m sorry.Here’s the money from River Run. I don’t want it. I’m going to keep writing, even though you haven’t responded. I love you, Stone Connor. I choose you. Please come home.He didn’t know what to stay. Tears burned the back of his eyes as he opened another envelope. This held a picture of Emma and her pig. On the picture she’d taped two little scraps of paper. Above the pig it said, “Pokie.” He smiled at the name taped above a picture of herself. “Porkie.”No.Beautiful described her better. Her face was full, her body round, and he wished he’d been there.Ripping open the last letter, his hand trembled, and he needed to place it on the table in order to read it. The writing was shaky and the paper looked water marked.I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to raise a child without you. My heart breaks each day the mail comes and there’s nothing from you. I have no desire to go on. Weak as it may sound…I need you, Stone Connor. Where are you?His tears dropped onto the page, landing next to her dried ones. He dropped his head and swallowed hard.I love you more than life itself. I choose YOU, Stone. Do you hear? I wish I could yell it in your face and beat you senseless with these words. I CHOOSE YOU!“I hear you, Emma. I hear you.” He gathered all the letters and stuffed them in the duffle bag he hadn’t bothered unpacking yet. The bag was full of rancid clothes from his week long fence mending journey. He didn’t care. Getting ready to leave the old cabin, he paused at the door.He couldn’t go like this.Running into the bathroom, he turned the shower on and grabbed his razor. He’d been a fool. The man in the mask of hair was nothing more than a stubborn fool. *** As the small commuter plane glided between the steep peaks of the Grand Tetons, Stone didn’t notice the turbulence or the beauty of the setting sun. He held tight to the stack of paper between his hands.Exiting the plane, he realized he didn’t know exactly where Emma was. He’d assumed St. Johns Medical Center but wasn’t certain. Walking out of the terminal, he pushed the hair out of his eyes as an icy wind bit through his jacket. He looked for a taxi and pulling his cell phone out he began to call Alexa. His eye caught a worn and battered pick-up truck with an equally worn and battered man sleeping behind the wheel.He strode over and yanked open the passenger door. His father jerked awake and eyed him in surprise.“Took you long enough,” Nate said.“Just drive.”They drove in silence for several miles then Nate cleared his throat. “I know you don’t want to hear anything, but I’ve a few things to say.”“I’m listening.”Nate raised his brow and nodded. “She didn’t have anyone to call that day things started to turn bad with the pregnancy.”“I know. She explained it in the letters.”“After you left, I tucked her in bed. Poor bird, her heart was broken.”Stone swallowed, fighting back his emotions.“She demanded the truth.”Surprised, Stone slanted his father a look.“About what?”“Me.” Nate stared straight ahead, his shoulders sagged and he appeared to age before Stone’s eyes. “I told her everything. And she asked me to leave.”“I see.”“No,” Nate shook his head. “You don’t see anything. She hated what I’d done to you, but even if she didn’t, she still would’ve asked me to leave. I haven’t seen her since that day.”“You haven’t been to the hospital?”“No,” Nate shook his head. “Hugh keeps me posted via the phone. It was his idea I come get you.”Stone thought hard. He figured before he could fully help Emma he needed to deal with his father.“I know you didn’t shoot Mom.”Nate shook his head. “Until you blew up at Emma, I’d never even realized my actions had appeared that way to you. But let’s not go there, son. You need to focus on what’s best for the woman we both love.”“How bad is she?”Nate stopped at a red light and looked over. Stone’s heart hitched at the grief on his father’s face. “She’s in a coma.”“What happened?”“Complications. I’m not certain. Placenta privia, hemorrhaging, all sorts of things.”Nate pulled the truck into visitors parking and stepped on the brake. “Here you go. Tell Hugh to call me if anything changes.”Stone reached for the door handle and paused. He looked at his father and saw him for the first time in forever. “Why don’t you park this heap of metal and come in?”“No, I don’t…”“Well, I do. I think that sometimes it’s good to forget. It’s not going to be easy, but I’ll try. Okay?”Nate nodded. “Okay.”“Now let’s go see about waking my sleeping beauty.”They entered the hospital, the scent of ammonia and sterile surroundings assaulted Stone’s nose. He shivered in revulsion and maintained his pace down the white hall.Nate checked at the first nurse station, and they were directed to the delivery ward.“Hold on a minute,” Stone said, ducking into the gift shop.“What are you doing?”“Buying something for the baby.”“Stone, we need to get to Emma’s room.”Stone grabbed a stuffed animal off the shelf and slammed it on the check out counter. “What if she’s awake?”“We’ll celebrate?” Nate gave him a perplexed look.“I can’t walk in empty handed. After all these months of torturing her, I can’t walk into the room empty handed.”They strode out of the gift shop and to the bank of elevators. Nate glanced down at the floppy lump of fur clutched in a death grip between Stone’s fingers.“Don’t say anything, Dad.”“I think a teddy bear would’ve been more appropriate.”“I just grabbed the first thing on the shelf.” Stone stared straight ahead, not looking down.“But it’s a giraffe.”Stone glanced at the silly toy and burst out laughing. Nate’s answering laughter helped ease some of the tightness in his chest. He could do this. Dammit. He could make his woman come home. *** He inhaled sharply as they walked down the long corridor of Labor and Delivery. Spotting Alexa, Ethan and Seth leaning against one wall, he headed in their direction. A crowd of nurses and technicians entered a room opposite them. One glance into Alexa’s eyes and Stone knew it was where Emma lay.He ran headlong into the maze of white jackets and green scrubs. Pushing aside a little cart being taken from the room, Stone tried to reach the bed.“Excuse me, sir, you’ll have to leave.” A nurse yelled, tugging at his arm.“Let go of me. That’s my wife.”The nurse looked confused for a moment, checked the chart in her hand, then shook her head. “Miss Gallagher isn’t married.”“Well she damn well will be the second she wakes her sorry butt up. Let me by.”“Sir, please.” This time the nurse’s tone was softer. “Let them finish their exam.”“Exam? There’s nothing wrong?”“Other than a coma? No. She’s stable.”Stone searched her eyes. He couldn’t ease the panic. “You don’t understand. She’s my life.”She smiled and patted his arm. Looking back at the chart in her hand, she pulled him out the door. “Mr. Connor, you just pushed aside another part of your life that you should go say hello to.”Stone looked at the doctor and nurses running down a checklist of God only knew what then back at the nurse. He nodded and followed her down the hall. The entered a small alcove and he realized it was the nursery.They caught up with the little cart being wheeled down the hall. The nurse gathered a tiny bundle of blankets and handed it to him.“Mr. Connor, meet Katie.”“Oh,” he said softly, accepting his daughter. Tears streamed down his face. “Damn,” he swore. “I didn’t know I could cry this much in one day.”The nurse chuckled and patted his back. “Just wait. You’ve years to watch this one grow and to cry at the most inopportune times.”He smiled and stared in wonder at the tiny pink nose peeking from the blanket. The nurse left him alone, whispering instructions to the young woman attending the baby’s bed. Katie squirmed and opened her eyes. They connected with him, widened, and blinked. He felt the immediate tug on his heart. “Hello, baby girl. I’m your daddy.”In answer, the most precious of all jewels opened her mouth and screamed with the gusto worthy of any Connor offspring. “What?” Stone turned a panicked face toward Alexa who came rushing down the hall. She was laughing and shaking her head. “What did I do?” He said as his cousin entered the nursery.“Nothing, Stone. Nothing at all. She just wants her mommy. The room’s clear now. Why don’t you go see Emma? I’ll take care of your little princess.”Considering the fact that Katie continued to cry, Stone handed her over without hesitation. Before leaving, he bent and placed a tender kiss on her forehead. She smelled sweet. “I’m going to wake your mommy up so she can see what a beautiful little girl you are.”Alexa squeezed his shoulder and nodded for him to leave. He turned and walked the longest ten yards of his life.Pushing the door open, he glanced at the nurse who’d directed him to his daughter. She nodded and motioned for him to come in. Emma lay in a bed next to the window.She looked so small.The hospital bed dwarfed her slender figure, making her appear childlike and vulnerable.He walked over, biting down his fear.Smiling, he stepped to the head of her bed and placed his forehead against hers. “Wake up, Emma. Please wake up.”The nurse pushed a chair over to him and signaled that he sit.“You need to talk to her. Hold her hand, tell a story. Anything. She can hear you, Mr. Connor. You must believe that she can hear you.”“Okay.”He took her hand in his, careful of how frail it appeared. Stroking his fingers along her arm he tried hard not to let the tears fall. “You’re making me cry Emma, and it’s not at all manly. How am I supposed to be the strong silent type when the sight of you in this bed is ripping my heart in half? I’m sorry I didn’t come home. I was too stubborn to read your letters. But I’m here now, and under no circumstances am I leaving without you. Do you hear me? Wake up, Emma. Dammit, wake up.” He rested his head on her hand and continued speaking softly about what he’d been doing for the past six months.Allowing his eyes to close, he breathed in the scent of her skin and whispered to her. He must have drifted off to sleep because he jerked up suddenly when a hand gently shook his shoulder.“I’ll take over for awhile, Stone.”He turned and stared into the troubled eyes of Hugh Gallagher.“I’ll stay.” Stone said.“You need to stretch your legs. You’ve been at it for more than twelve hours.”“I have?” Stone glanced out the window and saw the sun at about mid-morning. Hadn’t it been setting when he’d arrived? “Wow,” he took a deep breath and stretched. “I guess I have. I’ll go grab a cup of coffee.”“And something to eat.”Stone smiled. “And something to eat.”He bent and kissed Emma’s forehead, whispering his love against her skin. Then he found his daughter and repeated the same action. She didn’t cry this time but gurgled and fell back to sleep. Stone didn’t think his heart could handle any more love, but it swelled larger and made room for little Katie.“How is she?” Nate asked as Stone passed the waiting area.“Still the same.” He shook his head. “I don’t know what to do.”“There must be something to let Emma know you’re here. If she knew, she’d wake up.”“I don’t know.” He swore in frustration. An idea began to form. “I need some things from River Run.”“River Run isn’t yours anymore,” Nate reminded him softly.“Where are my things?”“At Emma’s house.”“Right, she sent me pictures. Okay, how do I get there?”“Call Tilly, she’ll get you whatever you need.”Stone looked at his father as if he’d just grown another head. “Tilly’s still around?”“So I hear. She’s been taking care of Emma.”“Really?”“Yeah, pretty amazing isn’t it?”Stone nodded. He exited to an area cell phones were allowed and punched in Alexa’s number. He scribbled down how to reach Tilly and placed his next call. After explaining what he needed, the young woman laughed and told him it was a terrific idea. She promised to be at the hospital within an hour.“Okay,” he said. “Plan B is under way. I need caffeine.”Nate laughed and pointed him in the direction of the cafeteria. *** Stone stood in front of the narrow window, watching the sun sink slowly into the horizon. He tried to imagine what the outside sounded like, but its music appeared beyond his grasp. Glancing over his shoulder, Emma continued to sleep soundly. The doctors told him it was a defense mechanism. Her body was healing.Yes, he understood that. But did they know her heart needed healing too?They’d laughed at him then sobered when they saw he was serious. He’d outlined his plan and although they thought it rather unorthodox, they hadn’t seen any danger.“Mr. Connor?”He turned and recognized the face of the nurse he’d met yesterday evening.“Yes?”“I’m here to help you with the bed sheets.”“Thanks, but I can handle it.”“I don’t think…”Stone shook his head. “I don’t care what you think. I’m doing this for my wife.”“She’s not…”He held up his hand and stopped her from continuing. “If you’re going to tell me one more time she’s not my wife then I might just have to hurt you.”Stone bent over Emma.“I, Stone, take you, Emma, as my lawfully wedded wife. Do you, Emma, take me, Stone, as your lawfully wedded husband?” He gently moved her head up and down and kissed her lips. “See? We’re married.”The nurse chuckled and shook her head. “Let me help you with the sheets. You can do all the rest.”“Okay,” he relented and unpacked a set of soft, high thread count sheets reminiscent of River Run from the bag Tilly delivered earlier.They changed the bed, moving Emma from side to side. Stone smoothed her hair against her favorite down pillow and tucked the feather comforter under her arms.“I’ll take it from here, if you don’t mind.”“Just one more thing…” Stone frowned as the nurse stepped out of the room. She re-entered wheeling the little metal crib where Katie slept. “I think you left someone out of your plan.”He smiled and nodded. “Yes, I certainly did.”“There’s a bottle all prepared on that little metal shelf. Just mark on the sheet what time you feed her and how much she takes. There’s also fresh diapers beneath the cart.”“Bottle? Sheet? Diapers?” Stone swallowed past the sudden panic.“You can do it, Mr. Connor.” She reassured him. “I’ll write up a Do Not Disturb sign for the door.”“Thanks.” Stone stared at the sleeping baby, then turned and dug around the bag some more. He pulled out several vanilla scented candles and lit them and dabbed Emma’s favorite perfume on her neck and wrists. Stripping off her hospital gown, he replaced it with a soft sleep shirt.All that was left was him and little Katie. Undressing slowly, Stone prayed this would work. He slipped into flannel pajama bottoms and splashed his normal cologne lightly on his skin. Gathering Katie from her tightly swathed blankets, he climbed into Emma’s hospital bed. He propped his back up, moved Emma against him and placed Katie between them. He discarded the baby blankets and nestled his daughter within the arms of her mother.Touch, scent, sound. Stone began to talk.“We’re home now, Emma. Smell the scent of your favorite candles I’ve just lit. You’d better wake up soon, because little Miss Katie will be terribly hungry, and she misses her mommy. She’s perfect Emma. She’s in your arms. Can you feel her? Her skin is just like yours, soft and sweet. I think she has my temper, which might not be a good thing, but she’s so beautiful.”Nothing.“Do you remember last Christmas? The cabin that was our hideaway? We made love, created this little life, then we let it all slip away. I’m sorry for everything. I’m sorry I didn’t understand.”No response.Stone stroked her hair, her arm, traced his finger lovingly along her chin.“I went back to the jungle,” he said softly, his lips touching her hair. “Seamus Adams was one smart SOB. He’d given your father to the one man he knew I feared. The same rebels that killed my unit. I won this time. No casualties and a successful extraction.”He felt her sigh. His heart skipped a beat, and he continued to talk. Stone spoke until his voice grew hoarse.“Seamus Adams is gone. Apparently, he suffered a terrible auto accident and didn’t survive.”Katie squirmed and mewed softly. Stone frowned. He hated to leave the bed, but if his daughter needed feeding, he supposed he’d better try and take care of her.“Dammit Emma, you’ve held my heart for four seasons. I’ll not walk into the fifth season without you by my side.”Her hand moved. Katie screamed.He didn’t care about his tears this time. He pulled her close and let them fall. “I love you, Emma.”His daughter fisted her little hands and screamed again. As Emma slowly fluttered open her lids, he smiled and kissed her fully on the lips. “Be right back,” he whispered against her mouth.Juggling Katie in his arms, he snatched the buzzer from the side of the bed, pressed the red button and called for the nurse. Stone shuffled to the crib, one eye on Emma and another searching for Katie’s bottle.The nurse from earlier ran into the room. Her eyes widened slightly at his choice of clothing, but she quickly smiled at the look on his face.“She’s awake?”He nodded and stepped back to allow the doctor through. Stone fed Katie. The apprehension curling in the pit of his stomach made him antsy.Emma’s eyes flicked open then closed again.“Mr. Connor, would you come over and continue talking to her?”Stone moved next to her head. Katie slurped loudly on her bottle, and he shuffled her to his shoulder, patting her gently on the back.“Emma, your daughter just burped.” The nurse smiled, and Emma opened her eyes once more. He could see her attempt to focus then her lashes fluttered down.“It’s all right, Mr. Connor. This is perfectly normal. Despite what the movies show you, coma patients don’t just open their eyes and sit up in bed ready to tackle the world. It takes time.”Stone stroked Emma’s head and continued murmuring nonsense. *** Cold. A sudden chill beside her took the warmth away, the warmth that had pulled her from a dark place. At the first pang of heartache, she fluttered her eyes closed and began slipping back to comfort of oblivion.“Stay with me Emma,” a voice spoke above her.Stone.He was here. She hadn’t imagined it.Another warmth spread around her. This one started at her toes and crept up her body, urging her awake.Love.She slowly opened her eyes, again. It hurt. She’d been safe in the black recesses of her mind. The room was dark, lit only by soft flickering flames. Turning her head to the side, she saw Stone peering at her in concern.A little bundle was clutched to his chest. He juggled it gently while holding something against its face. A bottle?Their baby.“Hey,” she said, sounding like a frog, her throat tight and hoarse. She licked her lips and tried to sit up.“Shush, it’s okay. Just rest.”“How long?”“You’ve been in and out of consciousness for the past few hours.”She felt another set of hands checking her pulse. A pair of warm brown eyes peered at her. She smiled at the nurse.“You’ve got a fine man here, Mrs. Connor.”“Mrs…” Emma frowned finding it difficult to focus.“Hush, sweetheart. I’ll explain everything later.” Stone was chuckling as he pressed a kiss to her forehead.“I’m sorry.”“No more apologies.”“I love you.”He nodded and kissed her once more. A warm little body was pressed into her arms, and she bent to stare into the face of her daughter. “I love you more.”His words wrapped around her heart, and she gazed from Stone to her daughter. “She’s beautiful.”“Will you marry me?”Emma smiled, feeling as if she’d just stepped into the sunshine. Unable to speak past the tears clogging her throat, she nodded, wrapping an arm around his neck and pulling him close. Touching her lips to his, she sighed. She was home.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen Stone stared at the television. With half his mind numbed by beer, he didn’t care what the newscaster discussed. Twisting his head, he counted the empty bottles that lined the coffee table. Almost finished the twelve pack. Another night drowned and finished.A fist struck his door. He ignored the hammering and popped the top off another icy bottle.“Stone,” a familiar voice called from outside.His gut twisted. The past slammed into him, and he bit down on his hatred. Closing his eyes, he swallowed the emotion away and stared at the television.“Go away.”“Open this door or I’ll kick it down.”“Go away.” Didn’t anyone know how to leave a man alone?The sound of a heavy kick and splintering wood echoed through the dilapidated shack. He leapt off the old, moth-eaten recliner and bowed back to shoot a fist straight into his father’s nose.“Hold up, son. I’m not here to make peace with you so don’t go getting all defensive.”Stone narrowed his gaze, fist still in the air and growled. “Whaddya want?”“Look at you.” His father shook his head in disgust. Stone felt a sharp pang of shame then blasted it away with an angry bolt of betrayal.“Don’t like what you see? Go away.”“No,” Nate shook his head. “Unfortunately it looks damn familiar to me, seems I used to look into that face a lot about twenty years ago.”Stone glanced at the lopsided, cracked mirror hung on one wall. His hair was long and unkempt, greasy after several days of work in the field. He hadn’t bothered to shower. His full beard and mustache cloaked his face in black whiskers. He glared at his father.“Get out of here, old man.”“Emma needs you.”Taking a swig of beer, he choked, spewing the carbonated liquid through his nose. “Yeah, right.”“She’s…”“Why would she want me? You’re all she needs.”“I’ve not seen her since the day you left.”Stone eyed his father. “I don’t believe you.”Nate walked further into the room, looking around with obvious distaste. “Haven’t you gotten any of her letters?”“Letters? Yeah, I’ve gotten them.”“Emma’s….”“Bunch a crap if you ask me.” Stone didn’t want to look at his father. He resented the man’s clean clothes and healthy complexion. His father’s heart hadn’t been crushed and shattered, he’d won the war. “If she needs me, you tell her to come here and tell me to my face. I’ve been waiting. Damn.” His voice lowered, and he fought against the rush of emotion. “I’ve been waiting.”“Haven’t you read the letters?”“Why should I?” Stone walked to an end table, shuffled aside some old magazines and threw a stack of unopened envelopes on the floor. “If she wants to hide behind a piece of paper, let her.”“I hate to point a fact out to you, son. But you’ve gone and done the worst possible thing in your book.”“What the hell does that mean?” He glared at his father. “What makes you think I give a damn?”Stone swayed slightly and dashed his half-empty bottle of beer into the garbage, oblivious when beer splashed the sides of the kitchen cabinets and trickled over the edge of the can. He mentally shook himself and looked at his father. What did he want?“You’ve become me.”“I’ve become…” Stone faltered. He was drunk, meaner than a trapped possum, and split so far apart inside his heart bled rivers of blood every waking second.“Yeah, you’ve turned into me. There’s a woman in Jackson who’s dying of a broken heart, and you’re letting her slip away because of some stupid stubborn pride.”Stone swallowed. “She’ll be fine. Emma’s better off without me.”Nate shook his head. “You don’t get it, Stone. Emma’s in the hospital, and she’s dying.”The room tilted and Stone reached to steady himself. His entire body went numb. Fear, self-loathing, anger, love, every emotion possible pushed against his chest. “What happened?” He finally asked.“She hemorrhaged. The baby’s fine, but Emma lost too much blood. It doesn’t look good.”“Baby?”“Read the letters, Stone. I always thought you were the better man. Now prove it.”Stone watched his father leave the room then bent and collected the strewn envelopes from the floor. He sorted them by date and with shaking fingers opened the first one.My love,I wish I could be there to tell you all I feel. But, I can’t. The doctors say I must remain in bed at all times.Oh God, what had he done? A small black square fell from the envelope, and he scooped it up. It looked like a negative. Peering closer, Stone wasn’t sure what it was supposed to be.I’ve enclosed the very first picture of our baby. Take care of it as it’s the only one we have. Isn’t it a miracle?Frowning, Stone peered at the ultrasound picture. He didn’t see anything. But if it was part of Emma then he certainly loved whatever lay within the grainy shadows.You asked me to choose, and I have. I CHOOSE YOU! Please come home, I love you. EmmaHe ripped open a few more envelopes and they all said the same thing. “I choose you. Please come home. I love you.”Opening a letter dated in June, he snatched a slip of paper that floated to the ground. He held a bank check in the amount of nine million dollars. Eyes widened, he read her words.I’m sure you realize you forfeited River Run under the terms of Margaret’s Will. Nate didn’t want the resort and signed it over to me. Without you, it meant nothing. I contacted the buyer you’d signed the contracts with and believe it or not, he thought you’d cancelled because the asking price was too low.She’d seen the contracts?I knew you’d sold River Run. I discovered everything on Christmas, the night we conceived our child. But I didn’t know you’d voided the deal. I should’ve trusted in you, believed in you. I’m sorry.Here’s the money from River Run. I don’t want it. I’m going to keep writing, even though you haven’t responded. I love you, Stone Connor. I choose you. Please come home.He didn’t know what to stay. Tears burned the back of his eyes as he opened another envelope. This held a picture of Emma and her pig. On the picture she’d taped two little scraps of paper. Above the pig it said, “Pokie.” He smiled at the name taped above a picture of herself. “Porkie.”No.Beautiful described her better. Her face was full, her body round, and he wished he’d been there.Ripping open the last letter, his hand trembled, and he needed to place it on the table in order to read it. The writing was shaky and the paper looked water marked.I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to raise a child without you. My heart breaks each day the mail comes and there’s nothing from you. I have no desire to go on. Weak as it may sound…I need you, Stone Connor. Where are you?His tears dropped onto the page, landing next to her dried ones. He dropped his head and swallowed hard.I love you more than life itself. I choose YOU, Stone. Do you hear? I wish I could yell it in your face and beat you senseless with these words. I CHOOSE YOU!“I hear you, Emma. I hear you.” He gathered all the letters and stuffed them in the duffle bag he hadn’t bothered unpacking yet. The bag was full of rancid clothes from his week long fence mending journey. He didn’t care. Getting ready to leave the old cabin, he paused at the door.He couldn’t go like this.Running into the bathroom, he turned the shower on and grabbed his razor. He’d been a fool. The man in the mask of hair was nothing more than a stubborn fool. *** As the small commuter plane glided between the steep peaks of the Grand Tetons, Stone didn’t notice the turbulence or the beauty of the setting sun. He held tight to the stack of paper between his hands.Exiting the plane, he realized he didn’t know exactly where Emma was. He’d assumed St. Johns Medical Center but wasn’t certain. Walking out of the terminal, he pushed the hair out of his eyes as an icy wind bit through his jacket. He looked for a taxi and pulling his cell phone out he began to call Alexa. His eye caught a worn and battered pick-up truck with an equally worn and battered man sleeping behind the wheel.He strode over and yanked open the passenger door. His father jerked awake and eyed him in surprise.“Took you long enough,” Nate said.“Just drive.”They drove in silence for several miles then Nate cleared his throat. “I know you don’t want to hear anything, but I’ve a few things to say.”“I’m listening.”Nate raised his brow and nodded. “She didn’t have anyone to call that day things started to turn bad with the pregnancy.”“I know. She explained it in the letters.”“After you left, I tucked her in bed. Poor bird, her heart was broken.”Stone swallowed, fighting back his emotions.“She demanded the truth.”Surprised, Stone slanted his father a look.“About what?”“Me.” Nate stared straight ahead, his shoulders sagged and he appeared to age before Stone’s eyes. “I told her everything. And she asked me to leave.”“I see.”“No,” Nate shook his head. “You don’t see anything. She hated what I’d done to you, but even if she didn’t, she still would’ve asked me to leave. I haven’t seen her since that day.”“You haven’t been to the hospital?”“No,” Nate shook his head. “Hugh keeps me posted via the phone. It was his idea I come get you.”Stone thought hard. He figured before he could fully help Emma he needed to deal with his father.“I know you didn’t shoot Mom.”Nate shook his head. “Until you blew up at Emma, I’d never even realized my actions had appeared that way to you. But let’s not go there, son. You need to focus on what’s best for the woman we both love.”“How bad is she?”Nate stopped at a red light and looked over. Stone’s heart hitched at the grief on his father’s face. “She’s in a coma.”“What happened?”“Complications. I’m not certain. Placenta privia, hemorrhaging, all sorts of things.”Nate pulled the truck into visitors parking and stepped on the brake. “Here you go. Tell Hugh to call me if anything changes.”Stone reached for the door handle and paused. He looked at his father and saw him for the first time in forever. “Why don’t you park this heap of metal and come in?”“No, I don’t…”“Well, I do. I think that sometimes it’s good to forget. It’s not going to be easy, but I’ll try. Okay?”Nate nodded. “Okay.”“Now let’s go see about waking my sleeping beauty.”They entered the hospital, the scent of ammonia and sterile surroundings assaulted Stone’s nose. He shivered in revulsion and maintained his pace down the white hall.Nate checked at the first nurse station, and they were directed to the delivery ward.“Hold on a minute,” Stone said, ducking into the gift shop.“What are you doing?”“Buying something for the baby.”“Stone, we need to get to Emma’s room.”Stone grabbed a stuffed animal off the shelf and slammed it on the check out counter. “What if she’s awake?”“We’ll celebrate?” Nate gave him a perplexed look.“I can’t walk in empty handed. After all these months of torturing her, I can’t walk into the room empty handed.”They strode out of the gift shop and to the bank of elevators. Nate glanced down at the floppy lump of fur clutched in a death grip between Stone’s fingers.“Don’t say anything, Dad.”“I think a teddy bear would’ve been more appropriate.”“I just grabbed the first thing on the shelf.” Stone stared straight ahead, not looking down.“But it’s a giraffe.”Stone glanced at the silly toy and burst out laughing. Nate’s answering laughter helped ease some of the tightness in his chest. He could do this. Dammit. He could make his woman come home. *** He inhaled sharply as they walked down the long corridor of Labor and Delivery. Spotting Alexa, Ethan and Seth leaning against one wall, he headed in their direction. A crowd of nurses and technicians entered a room opposite them. One glance into Alexa’s eyes and Stone knew it was where Emma lay.He ran headlong into the maze of white jackets and green scrubs. Pushing aside a little cart being taken from the room, Stone tried to reach the bed.“Excuse me, sir, you’ll have to leave.” A nurse yelled, tugging at his arm.“Let go of me. That’s my wife.”The nurse looked confused for a moment, checked the chart in her hand, then shook her head. “Miss Gallagher isn’t married.”“Well she damn well will be the second she wakes her sorry butt up. Let me by.”“Sir, please.” This time the nurse’s tone was softer. “Let them finish their exam.”“Exam? There’s nothing wrong?”“Other than a coma? No. She’s stable.”Stone searched her eyes. He couldn’t ease the panic. “You don’t understand. She’s my life.”She smiled and patted his arm. Looking back at the chart in her hand, she pulled him out the door. “Mr. Connor, you just pushed aside another part of your life that you should go say hello to.”Stone looked at the doctor and nurses running down a checklist of God only knew what then back at the nurse. He nodded and followed her down the hall. The entered a small alcove and he realized it was the nursery.They caught up with the little cart being wheeled down the hall. The nurse gathered a tiny bundle of blankets and handed it to him.“Mr. Connor, meet Katie.”“Oh,” he said softly, accepting his daughter. Tears streamed down his face. “Damn,” he swore. “I didn’t know I could cry this much in one day.”The nurse chuckled and patted his back. “Just wait. You’ve years to watch this one grow and to cry at the most inopportune times.”He smiled and stared in wonder at the tiny pink nose peeking from the blanket. The nurse left him alone, whispering instructions to the young woman attending the baby’s bed. Katie squirmed and opened her eyes. They connected with him, widened, and blinked. He felt the immediate tug on his heart. “Hello, baby girl. I’m your daddy.”In answer, the most precious of all jewels opened her mouth and screamed with the gusto worthy of any Connor offspring. “What?” Stone turned a panicked face toward Alexa who came rushing down the hall. She was laughing and shaking her head. “What did I do?” He said as his cousin entered the nursery.“Nothing, Stone. Nothing at all. She just wants her mommy. The room’s clear now. Why don’t you go see Emma? I’ll take care of your little princess.”Considering the fact that Katie continued to cry, Stone handed her over without hesitation. Before leaving, he bent and placed a tender kiss on her forehead. She smelled sweet. “I’m going to wake your mommy up so she can see what a beautiful little girl you are.”Alexa squeezed his shoulder and nodded for him to leave. He turned and walked the longest ten yards of his life.Pushing the door open, he glanced at the nurse who’d directed him to his daughter. She nodded and motioned for him to come in. Emma lay in a bed next to the window.She looked so small.The hospital bed dwarfed her slender figure, making her appear childlike and vulnerable.He walked over, biting down his fear.Smiling, he stepped to the head of her bed and placed his forehead against hers. “Wake up, Emma. Please wake up.”The nurse pushed a chair over to him and signaled that he sit.“You need to talk to her. Hold her hand, tell a story. Anything. She can hear you, Mr. Connor. You must believe that she can hear you.”“Okay.”He took her hand in his, careful of how frail it appeared. Stroking his fingers along her arm he tried hard not to let the tears fall. “You’re making me cry Emma, and it’s not at all manly. How am I supposed to be the strong silent type when the sight of you in this bed is ripping my heart in half? I’m sorry I didn’t come home. I was too stubborn to read your letters. But I’m here now, and under no circumstances am I leaving without you. Do you hear me? Wake up, Emma. Dammit, wake up.” He rested his head on her hand and continued speaking softly about what he’d been doing for the past six months.Allowing his eyes to close, he breathed in the scent of her skin and whispered to her. He must have drifted off to sleep because he jerked up suddenly when a hand gently shook his shoulder.“I’ll take over for awhile, Stone.”He turned and stared into the troubled eyes of Hugh Gallagher.“I’ll stay.” Stone said.“You need to stretch your legs. You’ve been at it for more than twelve hours.”“I have?” Stone glanced out the window and saw the sun at about mid-morning. Hadn’t it been setting when he’d arrived? “Wow,” he took a deep breath and stretched. “I guess I have. I’ll go grab a cup of coffee.”“And something to eat.”Stone smiled. “And something to eat.”He bent and kissed Emma’s forehead, whispering his love against her skin. Then he found his daughter and repeated the same action. She didn’t cry this time but gurgled and fell back to sleep. Stone didn’t think his heart could handle any more love, but it swelled larger and made room for little Katie.“How is she?” Nate asked as Stone passed the waiting area.“Still the same.” He shook his head. “I don’t know what to do.”“There must be something to let Emma know you’re here. If she knew, she’d wake up.”“I don’t know.” He swore in frustration. An idea began to form. “I need some things from River Run.”“River Run isn’t yours anymore,” Nate reminded him softly.“Where are my things?”“At Emma’s house.”“Right, she sent me pictures. Okay, how do I get there?”“Call Tilly, she’ll get you whatever you need.”Stone looked at his father as if he’d just grown another head. “Tilly’s still around?”“So I hear. She’s been taking care of Emma.”“Really?”“Yeah, pretty amazing isn’t it?”Stone nodded. He exited to an area cell phones were allowed and punched in Alexa’s number. He scribbled down how to reach Tilly and placed his next call. After explaining what he needed, the young woman laughed and told him it was a terrific idea. She promised to be at the hospital within an hour.“Okay,” he said. “Plan B is under way. I need caffeine.”Nate laughed and pointed him in the direction of the cafeteria. *** Stone stood in front of the narrow window, watching the sun sink slowly into the horizon. He tried to imagine what the outside sounded like, but its music appeared beyond his grasp. Glancing over his shoulder, Emma continued to sleep soundly. The doctors told him it was a defense mechanism. Her body was healing.Yes, he understood that. But did they know her heart needed healing too?They’d laughed at him then sobered when they saw he was serious. He’d outlined his plan and although they thought it rather unorthodox, they hadn’t seen any danger.“Mr. Connor?”He turned and recognized the face of the nurse he’d met yesterday evening.“Yes?”“I’m here to help you with the bed sheets.”“Thanks, but I can handle it.”“I don’t think…”Stone shook his head. “I don’t care what you think. I’m doing this for my wife.”“She’s not…”He held up his hand and stopped her from continuing. “If you’re going to tell me one more time she’s not my wife then I might just have to hurt you.”Stone bent over Emma.“I, Stone, take you, Emma, as my lawfully wedded wife. Do you, Emma, take me, Stone, as your lawfully wedded husband?” He gently moved her head up and down and kissed her lips. “See? We’re married.”The nurse chuckled and shook her head. “Let me help you with the sheets. You can do all the rest.”“Okay,” he relented and unpacked a set of soft, high thread count sheets reminiscent of River Run from the bag Tilly delivered earlier.They changed the bed, moving Emma from side to side. Stone smoothed her hair against her favorite down pillow and tucked the feather comforter under her arms.“I’ll take it from here, if you don’t mind.”“Just one more thing…” Stone frowned as the nurse stepped out of the room. She re-entered wheeling the little metal crib where Katie slept. “I think you left someone out of your plan.”He smiled and nodded. “Yes, I certainly did.”“There’s a bottle all prepared on that little metal shelf. Just mark on the sheet what time you feed her and how much she takes. There’s also fresh diapers beneath the cart.”“Bottle? Sheet? Diapers?” Stone swallowed past the sudden panic.“You can do it, Mr. Connor.” She reassured him. “I’ll write up a Do Not Disturb sign for the door.”“Thanks.” Stone stared at the sleeping baby, then turned and dug around the bag some more. He pulled out several vanilla scented candles and lit them and dabbed Emma’s favorite perfume on her neck and wrists. Stripping off her hospital gown, he replaced it with a soft sleep shirt.All that was left was him and little Katie. Undressing slowly, Stone prayed this would work. He slipped into flannel pajama bottoms and splashed his normal cologne lightly on his skin. Gathering Katie from her tightly swathed blankets, he climbed into Emma’s hospital bed. He propped his back up, moved Emma against him and placed Katie between them. He discarded the baby blankets and nestled his daughter within the arms of her mother.Touch, scent, sound. Stone began to talk.“We’re home now, Emma. Smell the scent of your favorite candles I’ve just lit. You’d better wake up soon, because little Miss Katie will be terribly hungry, and she misses her mommy. She’s perfect Emma. She’s in your arms. Can you feel her? Her skin is just like yours, soft and sweet. I think she has my temper, which might not be a good thing, but she’s so beautiful.”Nothing.“Do you remember last Christmas? The cabin that was our hideaway? We made love, created this little life, then we let it all slip away. I’m sorry for everything. I’m sorry I didn’t understand.”No response.Stone stroked her hair, her arm, traced his finger lovingly along her chin.“I went back to the jungle,” he said softly, his lips touching her hair. “Seamus Adams was one smart SOB. He’d given your father to the one man he knew I feared. The same rebels that killed my unit. I won this time. No casualties and a successful extraction.”He felt her sigh. His heart skipped a beat, and he continued to talk. Stone spoke until his voice grew hoarse.“Seamus Adams is gone. Apparently, he suffered a terrible auto accident and didn’t survive.”Katie squirmed and mewed softly. Stone frowned. He hated to leave the bed, but if his daughter needed feeding, he supposed he’d better try and take care of her.“Dammit Emma, you’ve held my heart for four seasons. I’ll not walk into the fifth season without you by my side.”Her hand moved. Katie screamed.He didn’t care about his tears this time. He pulled her close and let them fall. “I love you, Emma.”His daughter fisted her little hands and screamed again. As Emma slowly fluttered open her lids, he smiled and kissed her fully on the lips. “Be right back,” he whispered against her mouth.Juggling Katie in his arms, he snatched the buzzer from the side of the bed, pressed the red button and called for the nurse. Stone shuffled to the crib, one eye on Emma and another searching for Katie’s bottle.The nurse from earlier ran into the room. Her eyes widened slightly at his choice of clothing, but she quickly smiled at the look on his face.“She’s awake?”He nodded and stepped back to allow the doctor through. Stone fed Katie. The apprehension curling in the pit of his stomach made him antsy.Emma’s eyes flicked open then closed again.“Mr. Connor, would you come over and continue talking to her?”Stone moved next to her head. Katie slurped loudly on her bottle, and he shuffled her to his shoulder, patting her gently on the back.“Emma, your daughter just burped.” The nurse smiled, and Emma opened her eyes once more. He could see her attempt to focus then her lashes fluttered down.“It’s all right, Mr. Connor. This is perfectly normal. Despite what the movies show you, coma patients don’t just open their eyes and sit up in bed ready to tackle the world. It takes time.”Stone stroked Emma’s head and continued murmuring nonsense. *** Cold. A sudden chill beside her took the warmth away, the warmth that had pulled her from a dark place. At the first pang of heartache, she fluttered her eyes closed and began slipping back to comfort of oblivion.“Stay with me Emma,” a voice spoke above her.Stone.He was here. She hadn’t imagined it.Another warmth spread around her. This one started at her toes and crept up her body, urging her awake.Love.She slowly opened her eyes, again. It hurt. She’d been safe in the black recesses of her mind. The room was dark, lit only by soft flickering flames. Turning her head to the side, she saw Stone peering at her in concern.A little bundle was clutched to his chest. He juggled it gently while holding something against its face. A bottle?Their baby.“Hey,” she said, sounding like a frog, her throat tight and hoarse. She licked her lips and tried to sit up.“Shush, it’s okay. Just rest.”“How long?”“You’ve been in and out of consciousness for the past few hours.”She felt another set of hands checking her pulse. A pair of warm brown eyes peered at her. She smiled at the nurse.“You’ve got a fine man here, Mrs. Connor.”“Mrs…” Emma frowned finding it difficult to focus.“Hush, sweetheart. I’ll explain everything later.” Stone was chuckling as he pressed a kiss to her forehead.“I’m sorry.”“No more apologies.”“I love you.”He nodded and kissed her once more. A warm little body was pressed into her arms, and she bent to stare into the face of her daughter. “I love you more.”His words wrapped around her heart, and she gazed from Stone to her daughter. “She’s beautiful.”“Will you marry me?”Emma smiled, feeling as if she’d just stepped into the sunshine. Unable to speak past the tears clogging her throat, she nodded, wrapping an arm around his neck and pulling him close. Touching her lips to his, she sighed. She was home.",

      "content": "Chapter Eighteen Emma stretched in bed. Glancing out the window, she exhaled in excitement. The first flakes of winter trickled lazily from a low blanket of white clouds. It wasn’t quite Halloween, and the ground lay covered in fluffy white waves.“Stone,” she called.“Down here.”She smiled as she heard him talking to Katie. He must’ve taken the early morning feeding, allowing her to sleep in. Happiness ballooned in her chest, and she laughed out loud.Leaping from beneath the covers, she pulled on her jeans, yanked one of his sweatshirts over her head and padded into the bathroom.A few minutes later she walked down the stairs. The breathtaking view of sparkling paddocks and mountains glittering with snow was easily outshone by the vision of her husband and daughter snuggled together before a roaring fire.“Good morning.”He turned and faced her. Smiling, Stone held a finger to his mouth. “She’s almost asleep.”Emma nodded and went to pour them both a cup of coffee. He rose and settled Katie in her downstairs bassinette, tucking little blankets around her. Walking over, Emma peered in at the beautiful sight of her little baby, snuggled beneath her blankets, eyes closed, safe and secure. “Thanks for getting up.”Stone wrapped an arm around her and held her close. “We’ve a big day today.”“Oh yeah? What’s planned?”“Nate and Hugh are coming over to take Katie,” a wicked grin lighting his face.“And why is that?”He nibbled her ear and a shiver of desire ran down her spine. “I thought we’d carve our pumpkins, and then I’d make you mad so you could smash the insides all over my chest.”Emma grinned. “And I suppose we’d have to take a shower to clean up?”“My thoughts exactly.”“Love you Mr. Connor.” She snuggled against his chest, thinking his idea sounded wonderful.“I love you too, Mrs. Connor. *** Emma watched Stone greet Nate and her father. The tension still swam beneath the surface, but father and son were making great strides at mending their damaged relationship.Time healed.“Okay, kids.” Nate called from his truck. Katie lay nestled in her car seat, securely fastened and ready to spend the day with her grandfathers. “We’ll bring her back in the morning.”“Tomorrow?” Emma went to dash off the front porch and retrieve her daughter, but Stone stopped her.“Easy does it, love. We have a belated honeymoon night coming to us.”“I can’t be apart from Katie.”Stone studied her face and smiled. “Okay, I’m sorry.” He walked over to the truck, and she followed.“Dad, please bring Katie home around eight.”The devastation written across Nate and Hugh’s faces made her laugh. She peered in the window at her daughter and decided that one night would be okay. She grabbed Stone’s hand, inhaled her courage and nodded.“If either one of you old coots teach her any bad habits, I’ll hunt you down and shoot you.”Hugh grinned. “She’s only a wee bairn, Emma. What could we possibly teach her?”“I know,” Emma agreed. “It’s just…”Stone interrupted her and signaled to Nate. “Bring her home. We’ll be back at the house around seven.”“Okay, son.” Nate answered.Emma stumbled after Stone as he pulled her toward the front porch. “Back at the house?”“You need to go change into grungier jeans and hiking boots.”“I thought we were carving pumpkins?”“Oh, we will, but first I have a belated wedding present for you.”“Really?” Emma grinned, her curiosity peaked. “What is it?”“I’m not telling.”“Stone!”“Go get ready.”Emma laughed then raced up the stairs. As soon as she’d been released from the hospital, they’d had a simple wedding. Only immediate family attended. Neither one had been willing to leave Katie, so they’d skipped a formal honeymoon and settled into their new home.She couldn’t begin to guess what this surprise entailed, but as long as Stone was beside her, she’d be happy. *** Stone’s heart raced. He wondered if she’d receive this gift with as much joy as he felt in giving it. The arrangement of everything hadn’t been easy, but Ethan and Seth called an hour ago to confirm that all was in place.Emma walked down the stairs and the sight of her still stole his breath. He figured he was the luckiest man in the world.A beautiful wife.A gorgeous daughter.A perfect life.He held his hand out and she wrapped her fingers around his. “Ready?”“Absolutely, Colonel Connor, lead the way.”“That’d be retired-Colonel Connor.” He chuckled at her exasperation and guided her out the back door. She frowned at him, but he just grinned.“Rex called yesterday, didn’t he?”“Uh-huh.”She tugged on his hand, and he tried not to laugh. “What did he want?”They walked through the first pasture, and he climbed a steep slope leading into the woods. When he turned to help her up the path, she stuck her tongue out at him.“He wants me to consult.”“Oh.”Her audible sigh shocked him. He stopped and gathered her in his arms. “You didn’t think I’d agree to return to active duty, did you?”“I…” Emma dropped her gaze and shrugged. “I wasn’t sure what to think. You sounded so serious on the phone I knew it wasn’t a social call.”Stone closed his eyes, feeling horrible that he’d caused her one second of doubt. “My life is here with you. I’ll never leave, but I need to work – to do something.”She reached up and kissed him. “I understand. I’m sorry I doubted you.”Stone pulled her close, kissing her, allowing her to feel the intensity of his love. “No apologies. Now close your eyes, sweetheart. I’ve something to show you.”He carefully guided her around the bend and positioned her for the best view.“Open your eyes.”After a brief second, she squealed in delight and bounded toward the cabin. “Is it ours? The same one?”Stone nodded and grinned at her excitement. “I promised you.”She stopped and turned slowly. “Yes, you did. Every Christmas…”“Yeah,” he said. “And I figured every Halloween, too.”“Why stop there?” Emma said, launching herself into his arms and kissing him madly. “How about Thanksgiving and Valentines’ Day and Easter and…”“I love you, Emma.” He returned her kiss until they were both breathless with need. Swinging her off her feet, he walked into the cabin and laid her on a familiar blanket, before a familiar fire and made love to his wife with the same tenderness as the night they’d conceived their daughter.

      "content": "Chapter Eighteen Emma stretched in bed. Glancing out the window, she exhaled in excitement. The first flakes of winter trickled lazily from a low blanket of white clouds. It wasn’t quite Halloween, and the ground lay covered in fluffy white waves.“Stone,” she called.“Down here.”She smiled as she heard him talking to Katie. He must’ve taken the early morning feeding, allowing her to sleep in. Happiness ballooned in her chest, and she laughed out loud.Leaping from beneath the covers, she pulled on her jeans, yanked one of his sweatshirts over her head and padded into the bathroom.A few minutes later she walked down the stairs. The breathtaking view of sparkling paddocks and mountains glittering with snow was easily outshone by the vision of her husband and daughter snuggled together before a roaring fire.“Good morning.”He turned and faced her. Smiling, Stone held a finger to his mouth. “She’s almost asleep.”Emma nodded and went to pour them both a cup of coffee. He rose and settled Katie in her downstairs bassinette, tucking little blankets around her. Walking over, Emma peered in at the beautiful sight of her little baby, snuggled beneath her blankets, eyes closed, safe and secure. “Thanks for getting up.”Stone wrapped an arm around her and held her close. “We’ve a big day today.”“Oh yeah? What’s planned?”“Nate and Hugh are coming over to take Katie,” a wicked grin lighting his face.“And why is that?”He nibbled her ear and a shiver of desire ran down her spine. “I thought we’d carve our pumpkins, and then I’d make you mad so you could smash the insides all over my chest.”Emma grinned. “And I suppose we’d have to take a shower to clean up?”“My thoughts exactly.”“Love you Mr. Connor.” She snuggled against his chest, thinking his idea sounded wonderful.“I love you too, Mrs. Connor. *** Emma watched Stone greet Nate and her father. The tension still swam beneath the surface, but father and son were making great strides at mending their damaged relationship.Time healed.“Okay, kids.” Nate called from his truck. Katie lay nestled in her car seat, securely fastened and ready to spend the day with her grandfathers. “We’ll bring her back in the morning.”“Tomorrow?” Emma went to dash off the front porch and retrieve her daughter, but Stone stopped her.“Easy does it, love. We have a belated honeymoon night coming to us.”“I can’t be apart from Katie.”Stone studied her face and smiled. “Okay, I’m sorry.” He walked over to the truck, and she followed.“Dad, please bring Katie home around eight.”The devastation written across Nate and Hugh’s faces made her laugh. She peered in the window at her daughter and decided that one night would be okay. She grabbed Stone’s hand, inhaled her courage and nodded.“If either one of you old coots teach her any bad habits, I’ll hunt you down and shoot you.”Hugh grinned. “She’s only a wee bairn, Emma. What could we possibly teach her?”“I know,” Emma agreed. “It’s just…”Stone interrupted her and signaled to Nate. “Bring her home. We’ll be back at the house around seven.”“Okay, son.” Nate answered.Emma stumbled after Stone as he pulled her toward the front porch. “Back at the house?”“You need to go change into grungier jeans and hiking boots.”“I thought we were carving pumpkins?”“Oh, we will, but first I have a belated wedding present for you.”“Really?” Emma grinned, her curiosity peaked. “What is it?”“I’m not telling.”“Stone!”“Go get ready.”Emma laughed then raced up the stairs. As soon as she’d been released from the hospital, they’d had a simple wedding. Only immediate family attended. Neither one had been willing to leave Katie, so they’d skipped a formal honeymoon and settled into their new home.She couldn’t begin to guess what this surprise entailed, but as long as Stone was beside her, she’d be happy. *** Stone’s heart raced. He wondered if she’d receive this gift with as much joy as he felt in giving it. The arrangement of everything hadn’t been easy, but Ethan and Seth called an hour ago to confirm that all was in place.Emma walked down the stairs and the sight of her still stole his breath. He figured he was the luckiest man in the world.A beautiful wife.A gorgeous daughter.A perfect life.He held his hand out and she wrapped her fingers around his. “Ready?”“Absolutely, Colonel Connor, lead the way.”“That’d be retired-Colonel Connor.” He chuckled at her exasperation and guided her out the back door. She frowned at him, but he just grinned.“Rex called yesterday, didn’t he?”“Uh-huh.”She tugged on his hand, and he tried not to laugh. “What did he want?”They walked through the first pasture, and he climbed a steep slope leading into the woods. When he turned to help her up the path, she stuck her tongue out at him.“He wants me to consult.”“Oh.”Her audible sigh shocked him. He stopped and gathered her in his arms. “You didn’t think I’d agree to return to active duty, did you?”“I…” Emma dropped her gaze and shrugged. “I wasn’t sure what to think. You sounded so serious on the phone I knew it wasn’t a social call.”Stone closed his eyes, feeling horrible that he’d caused her one second of doubt. “My life is here with you. I’ll never leave, but I need to work – to do something.”She reached up and kissed him. “I understand. I’m sorry I doubted you.”Stone pulled her close, kissing her, allowing her to feel the intensity of his love. “No apologies. Now close your eyes, sweetheart. I’ve something to show you.”He carefully guided her around the bend and positioned her for the best view.“Open your eyes.”After a brief second, she squealed in delight and bounded toward the cabin. “Is it ours? The same one?”Stone nodded and grinned at her excitement. “I promised you.”She stopped and turned slowly. “Yes, you did. Every Christmas…”“Yeah,” he said. “And I figured every Halloween, too.”“Why stop there?” Emma said, launching herself into his arms and kissing him madly. “How about Thanksgiving and Valentines’ Day and Easter and…”“I love you, Emma.” He returned her kiss until they were both breathless with need.

      "content": "ANGEL FALLSCOMING: FEBRUARY 2013 PREVIEW Brazil, South of the Venezuelan Border Dr. Cassidy Lowell felt the whisper of a defining moment. It presented itself in the form of an obese, crooked-toothed Brazilian miner and the black cylindrical end of a rifle.Waves of perspiration and bad breath assaulted Cassidy, and she fought the urge to back away. A brief scrutiny of the area behind the man fired internal alarms at a level she’d failed to experience since the Niger Delta. Danger silenced the incessant chirping of hordes of insects littering the jungle.Silent rage spread from the edge of the tree line as morning filtered through the heavy canopy of leaves, highlighting men twisted by poisonous work conditions and elemental greed.Cassidy glanced over her shoulder to confirm that her assistant ushered women and children to the back of the rustic village and out of harms way. They’d been studying this small encampment of Yanomami for a little over a fortnight. Indigenous men sat crossed-legged upon the hard packed earth, pretending indifference. The Amazon had become a battlefield, and this once peaceful tribe, its warriors.She refocused on the latest threat. “Señor, can I help you?” Cassidy stepped forward, a gun held loosely against her palm. She handled the weapon as if it were nothing more than something to fiddle with, appearing to put no importance or threat in the Glock.“You the cat doctor?” His voice held the rough edge of too many cigarettes and an abundant amount of tequila.“I’m Dr. Cassidy Lowell a zoologist with the Zoological Environmental Bio Research Agency. I’m certain you’ve heard of ZEBRA, my organization?” Three months in this area and word spread. She knew this man wouldn’t be a fan of ZEBRA’s operation.His eyes roved her body, making her feel dirty and indecent. There was nothing sexy about her well-worn jeans and light weight cotton shirt, but Cassidy supposed based upon his attire she’d appear damn right clean and airy.He tilted his head and swung his rifle downward so that it no longer pointed at her navel. “The jaguar…you are familiar with this animal?”Cassidy smiled and nodded. “I’ve had the privilege of studying a few of them while helping to clear the area of poison.” She purposely challenged him with her eyes. The mercury and cyanide levels in the water were at an all time high caused by mines operated by men such as him. The native people of the Amazon basin were in trouble.He ignored her insinuation and moved closer, dropping his voice an octave lower. “Have you ever seen them hunt together?”Cassidy recoiled slightly at the man’s stench, shook her head and answered. “No. They’re solitary creatures.”“Gatos de fantasmas.” He ran stubby fingers through a head full of greasy hair. “They are here and killing my people.”Cassidy gazed beyond his shoulder at the line of men standing in the shadows. They were a surly bunch, dirty and disheveled. Sweat stained wife-beaters, muddied jeans and angry mouths had drawn her attention earlier but now she recognized the vast amount of bloodied bandages the men wore. “You’re telling me a cat did this?”“Not just one.” The man answered, signaling for the men to move forward.Cassidy had been traveling this region for several months, teaching the Yanomami about the danger of the polluted water and working closely with the Brazilian government to offer up a solution to the land crisis of the Amazon. This was ZEBRA’s official White Stripe mission. Although Cassidy did hold the Special Forces elite Black Stripe status, she hadn’t been briefed on any secret military operations for this assignment.She’d heard rumblings about ghost cats and recently sent a request to ZEBRA to issue approval for an investigation into the rumored albino jaguars.The lead man dropped into silence as Cassidy approached his men. Unpeeling a length of gauze from the closest man’s arm, she scrutinized the wound in the pale morning light. Her nostrils flared at the foul odor of sepsis. “Come with me,” she demanded. “All of you, follow me.”Cassidy strode through the camp waving at Malia, her biologist, to leave the women and children. When Malia reached her side, Cassidy lowered her voice. “We’re in no imminent danger. These men are hurt. Badly. What do we have in medical and where’s the closest doctor?”Malia pulled out her global satellite phone and punched in a few numbers. “I’ll radio for medics from São Gabriel. They can make it here by chopper pretty quick. The med kit should be in our main tent.”“Okay.” Cassidy gently slid one arm around the back of the wounded man and urged him forward. “I don’t know when Jake’s group will return. We need to set up temporary facilities for the wounded.” She urged the man to follow her but froze at a loud snap of gunfire. Caterwauls and screeches of startled animals created a din loud enough to muffle an ensuing attack, disorientating Cassidy.The miner collapsed at her feet, a pool of blood forming on the hard-packed dirt beneath his head.Cassidy’s ears rang with a tinny echo as gunshot filled the camp. Men fell. Their chests ripped apart by the onslaught of bullets, streams of red streaked the dry earth. Panic stricken, Cassidy searched for cover. She inhaled sharply when the lead miner’s head exploded, spattering her white shirt with crimson blood and brain matter.Chaos loomed as bullets rained deadly fire upon the camp. Cassidy dove at Malia, shoving her behind a generator. “Call Jake.” She scrambled forward on her belly, gun held in front and posed to shoot. Her fingers shook and Cassidy willed herself still. Glancing over her shoulder, she noted Malia rooted in fear. “Call Jake! Now!”Shrieks of pain wove between the staccato percussion of AK-47 rifles. Cassidy concentrated on the mundane, isolating the origin of the attack and scrutinizing her defense. She needed to step outside of her comfort zone and think like Jake. Fight like Jake. She gagged as blood wafted from every corner of the tiny village. Innocent lives were hers to protect. At the edge of the tree line, shadows moved. Cassidy saw sparks of muzzles.She’d been trained by the best of the best. Inhale. Exhale. Find the target.Aim.Fire.A body fell.Ignoring the horror that soaked through every essence of her being, Cassidy continued her attack on the invisible shadows in the jungle. Morning sun glinted dangerously, filtering through the leaves in beams of light and marking her targets as it kissed the edge of metal.Death angled in her direction, she rolled avoiding the fire of deadly metal and grabbed a weapon from the grasp of a still miner maintaining her defense against the marauders. Where the hell was Jake?“Kill or be killed,” Cassidy muttered to herself. She moved to the left, bumping into the body of one of the villagers. Her world froze as the face came into focus. Just this morning the man, a Yanomami elder, had shown her a hidden pocket of water and delighted in her discovery of a breathtaking waterfall.Horror slowed time and shock held her breath. A deep righteous anger flooded Cassidy’s soul, sparking revenge and a hatred she hadn’t felt in months. “Bastards,” she screamed and stood glaring at the leafy blockade that shadowed her enemy. *** Jake Anderson, captain of the elite Special Forces Black Stripe ZEBRA squad, heard the gunshot before the call reached his radio. “Duncan,” he yelled signaling to his second in command. “We’ve no time. Let’s go.” Duncan alerted the balance of the men and they snapped weapons into place, discarding all pretense of their scientific cover.They abandoned their attempts at uprooting the stubborn tire of their truck from a muck filled riverbed and fell into formation running at breakneck speed in the direction of the camp.Jake’s heart pounded, fear freezing the blood in his veins. Cassidy was trained, but he’d spent the past year fighting and negotiating with ZEBRA to keep her off Black Stripe assignments. She couldn’t kill a bug let alone a person which left her vulnerable and in extreme danger.Jake calculated the distance. Another few minutes would place them at the camp, but he needed to slow their motion and fan the men outward. There were only five operatives assigned to Cassidy’s pod. Well trained and battle hungry, the men executed their tasks with brilliant precision.They approached from the rear, the advantage theirs. His men began picking off the shooters as Jake edged past toward the heart of the village.In the center, a warrior stood.A blend of strength and steel that stole the breath from his lungs, igniting a heated attraction that flamed from the most visceral edge of his being.She was beautiful.Blond hair fell in loose wavy locks, swirling around slender shoulders as the fighter twisted and turned railing bullets at her enemy. She dropped an emptied rifle and dove forward, gracefully snatching a weapon from a body that no longer had the need of defense. Rising on one knee, shirt torn and tattered, blood streaming from a wound on her upper arm, Cassidy aimed and fired. A movement to her left had Jake seizing his weapon, but she pulled a knife from her belt and tossed it effortlessly into the chest of a man racing toward her.As her bullets were met with silence, Cassidy ceased her attack, rose and turned slowly to meet Jake’s shocked gaze.He fell to his knees, the overwhelming truth of what he’d done to the woman he loved too much to bear. Jake heard his men calling to one another, checking status. He heard the whomp of helicopter blades. He heard the voice of his second in command, yelling for order. But loudest of all, he heard Cassidy whisper his name as she stood, bloodied and victorious, her hands shaking so badly they prevented a clean grip on the weapon dangling from her fingers and an expression of self-loathing on her face that shattered his heart.",
