      "content": "Introduction My father taught me chess when I was eight years old. I got more interested in primary school when I played against my teacher during breaks. A few years later, when I was 14, my neighbor and friend Gino asked me, “I’m going to my uncle’s to play chess; do you want to join?” His uncle Gerard, who I still see every now and then at the chess café De Laurierboom in Amsterdam, had a nice chess set and, even more fascinating to my teenage mind, lots of books about chess. He started telling us about his hero Bobby Fischer, and I couldn’t stop listening. Soon, Gino and I were playing regularly, even copying “world championship matches” that we had heard about: we would play one game a day, alternating colors, thus easily filling a two-week school holiday playing for the title of champion of our street. In September 1990 we joined the local club De Eenhoorn (the Unicorn), where I met some of my best friends. We still play for the same club today. The very first chess book I read from cover to cover was Theo Schuster’s Het Grote Schaakspel (The Big Game of Chess) from 1987, a general overview of the game’s history, its rules, its great players from the past and their best games. It included what is still my favorite chess anecdote of all time, about the notion that the threat is stronger than the execution, one of the most well-known theorems in chess. Aron Nimzowitsch, a world-class player in the 1920s, supposedly detested tobacco smoke at a time when it was allowed and customary to smoke during tournaments. Before starting one of his games, Nimzowitsch’s opponent had agreed with him not to smoke, but shortly after the start, he pulled out a cigar from his pocket, followed by a box of matches. Nimzowitsch furiously headed to the arbiter to complain, who pointed out that his opponent hadn’t actually started smoking. “But he threatens to smoke,” said Nimzowitsch, “and any chess player knows that the threat is stronger than the execution.” Schuster’s book revealed that a bigger world was hiding behind the “simple” board game. It had such a fascinating cultural legacy that I wanted to know more about. I discovered that chess is much like the game played in Hermann Hesse’s 1943 novel The Glass Bead Game: an intellectual encounter incorporating elements from mathematics, psychology, art, sports, and even music. Throughout history it has functioned as a metaphor for war, the cerebral battle, the strategic fight, and even for describing our entire society. In its symbolic variety, chess is the richest game of all. Chess has a history of over 1,500 years, and it has always been “popular” in the old Latin sense of the word: prevalent among the general public. But it has been more than that, and this is the part that is hard to describe. It seems that, like no other game, chess has always been an activity with a certain magic, something to enjoy but also something that inspires esteem or awe and should be treated with respect. It is no coincidence that the biggest personalities of their times often connected with the game: from Napoleon playing the Mechanical Turk in 1809 to Elon Musk getting involved with the Carlsen–Niemann scandal in 2022. In February 2006, I started my first chess blog, and by December of the following year I had quit my full-time job, which had provided me with a good and stable income. I wanted to see if I could turn my website ChessVibes into a successful company. I gave myself a year to see where it would go, and felt I could always return to the job market if things didn’t work out. In the eighteen years since, I haven’t looked back. Chess has taken me to beautiful and far-flung corners of the world. I’ve met fascinating people and avid fans, yet I always felt chess had the potential to become bigger, in the same way poker did. In modern times, chess has had different peaks in popularity. The first time was around the Fischer–Spassky match in 1972 in Reykjavík amid the Cold War. As the battle was covered daily in newspapers worldwide, Fischer became a celebrity, hundreds of thousands got hooked on the game, and chess sets ran out of stock everywhere. It is no coincidence that Iceland, where the match took place, now has the highest number of grandmasters per capita: 13 GMs among a population of 375,000. After the thrilling battles between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov in the 1980s, the general public also loved the success story of Judit Polgár and her sisters. A true new peak, however, was the 1997 Kasparov–Deep Blue match, still seen as the turning point in the history of chess, when computers became too strong for humans. (It actually took a bit longer before computers became truly invincible.) In the following decades, Magnus Carlsen drew the most attention, mixing his remarkable dominance on the chessboard with being an avid sports fan, a fashion model, and even a character in The Simpsons and Norway’s Donald Duck comics magazine. It was, however, another young lady who created the third big peak in global chess popularity. This was Beth Harmon, the main character of the Netflix series The Queen’s Gambit, first aired in October 2020, based on the novel by Walter Tevis from 1983. As I write, Chess.com has experienced growth twice as fast as during the period of The Queen’s Gambit—suggesting that chess has never been more popular than it is in 2024. Today there doesn’t seem to be one clear reason for the rise in popularity, but multiple to point at. Maybe it wasn’t hype this time, and chess has finally become a mainstream activity. I want to believe so. Chess has seen a remarkable transformation in the past few decades, mostly influenced by the computer and the internet. Today, chess amateurs and grandmasters alike can’t imagine a world without the computer to analyze their decisions, prepare for their games, or play online. At the same time, the internet has attracted more new fans to the game than ever, and chess has become a popular esport. Chess.com’s channel was the most-watched English-language Twitch channel in 2023 (and fifth channel overall) with over 11 million hours watched. It adds a whole new dimension to the ancient board game and is nothing less than a digital revolution—a story that deserves to be told. It is said that no sport has more books written about it than chess. However, the vast majority are intended for a chess-savvy audience that already knows what 1.d4 f5 is called (the Dutch, an opening I’ve never played myself!) or who Wilhelm Steinitz is (the first official world champion). What is missing is a book serving the contingent of new chess fans who’ve encountered the game as Netflix watchers or YouTube subscribers and are in desperate need of a good introduction to this sport and the world behind it. A book that incorporates many of the (in)famous stories and anecdotes, demonstrates chess’s inextricable links with Western culture, talks about its biggest heroes, and describes the incredible history of changes chess has gone through to arrive where it is today. I hope I have written that book. Insiders of the chess world might recognize many of the stories and anecdotes, but there’s still plenty for them to discover, too. And, since the last book that attempted to cover the full history of chess was published in 1985, perhaps this one can bridge the gap with the modern era, collating chess’s past, present, and future in one place, and charting its relationship with culture and technology. That chess is an art, a science, and a sport is a well-known saying. It is also something of a cliché and rather limited. Behind this seemingly simple board game with 64 squares and 32 pieces, there are direct connections to many more areas of life, as well as an incredible history full of fascinating stories and brilliant personalities. Readers who are new to chess and hold this book in their hands have a unique world to discover that is both fascinating and inspiring. You cannot imagine!",

      "content": "Chapter 11,500 Years of Magic: A History of Chess in Popular Culture “Chess was practically the only game known in which there was any real mental exercise possible. It was also recognized as symbolic of warfare, while the pieces could be made emblematic of the various elements of the society.” —H. J. R. Murray, A History of Chess, 1913 On November 19, 2022, a picture on Instagram quickly became one of the most-liked posts ever. It was the day before the opening of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and the leading fashion house Louis Vuitton shared a photo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess. Accompanied by the text “Victory is a State of Mind,” the photo was shot by the legendary celebrity portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz and posted on Messi’s, Ronaldo’s, and Louis Vuitton’s Instagram channels. The image, which gathered more than 84 million likes, showed the two soccer stars using a Louis Vuitton checkered suitcase as a chessboard. Two years after the release of The Queen’s Gambit, chess witnessed a new outing in popular culture that might have reached even more people than the incredibly successful Netflix series. Incidentally, the picture—which was shot at different moments in time, with Messi and Ronaldo not actually in the studio together—used an actual chess position taken from a real game. The coach of world number one Magnus Carlsen, the Dane Peter Heine Nielsen, tweeted that the position came from a game between Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the two biggest stars in chess, played in Norway in 2017 (see annotated game on pages 397–98). Carlsen retweeted Nielsen’s tweet with the witty line: “Second greatest rivalry of our time mimicking the greatest.” Messi and Ronaldo playing checkers or cards would have been far less likely. And it wouldn’t have worked. The visual possibilities, symbolism, tradition, and complexity of chess give it power. Chess has fascinated emperors, kings, maharajas, shahs, czars, generals, and presidents. It has inspired painters, poets, playwrights, novelists, directors, screenwriters, athletes, and politicians. The magic of chess has enthralled us for 1,500 years. The Origins of Chess Once upon a time, a bright queen in India named Jūshīr faced a rebellion. She sent one of her sons to fight back, but a rebel killed him, distressing the people of her kingdom. Fearing to tell her the news, they gathered before one of their wise men, Qaflān, and told him what had happened. He said, “Give me three days,” and went away to think. Then Qaflān told one of his pupils, “Bring me a carpenter and wood of two different colors, white and black.” The carpenter created chess pieces, instructed by Qaflān, who then said, “Bring me tanned leather.” A chessboard with 64 squares was made, and Qaflān started playing the game with one of his pupils until they understood it and became proficient in it. He told his pupil, “This is a war without loss of lives.” The kingdom’s people realized they were witnessing a piece of wisdom no one else could have arrived at. When Queen Jūshīr heard about the game, she summoned Qaflān to show it to her. He arrived at her palace with his pupil, and the two started playing chess. One defeated the other and said, “Checkmate!” Understanding what he meant, the queen asked Qaflān, “Has my son been killed?” “You have said it,” he replied. She told her chamberlain, “Let the people in, that they may offer me condolence.” She then turned to Qaflān and said to him, “Ask for whatever you need.” His reply will probably ring a bell for many readers. “Your Majesty, I do not seek great wealth or power. Instead, I ask for a simple reward: I request just one grain of wheat for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, eight grains for the fourth square, and so on.” The queen initially laughed off the request as a meager prize for his brilliant game, and readily agreed. However, her advisers soon pointed out the astonishing consequences of Qaflān’s request. The chessboard has 64 squares, and because the number of wheat grains doubles for each square, the total amount of wheat required would be 264-1, an amount not available in the entire world. (A recent calculation suggests it is over 1,600 times the global wheat production.) The legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, which still serves in mathematical education as a cautionary tale about the power of exponential growth, exists in several forms. One involves rice grains and the Indian god Krishna, while the most famous version of the story has the Brahmin mathematician Sissa inventing chess to teach his king a lesson in humility. Just like in the game, his fate is connected to the weakest of his subjects, and, as the king, he is the most powerful entity but still needs all the other pieces for his protection. The version I chose above is the oldest one, “dating back to pre-Muhammadan days,” according to H. J. R. Murray, a renowned and incredibly erudite chess historian who published his monumental A History of Chess in 1913. The legend was told by Ibn Wāḍiḥ al-Ya ‘qūbī, a Muslim imperial official and polymath of the ninth century whose works represent some of the earliest historical and geographical writings to survive in Arabic literature. Interestingly, al-Ya ֜qūbī refers to a queen (Jūshīr) instead of a king, and his story suggests that chess was already used as a metaphor the moment it was invented. From its infancy, chess was larger than chess. Whether it’s a true story is not a serious question. One thing most chess historians agree on is that the game originates in India. It originally sprung out of another board game called chaturanga, first appearing in the Gupta Empire around the sixth century CE. Xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), shogi (Japanese chess), sittuyin (Burmese chess) and makruk (Thai chess) are all believed to share chaturanga as a common ancestor. The Sanskrit word chaturanga means “having four limbs/parts”—from chatur, meaning “four,” and anga, meaning “parts”—and refers to the four divisions of an army: elephantry, chariotry, cavalry, and infantry. The game was played on an eight-by-eight board with 64 squares—note that these were all one color. The types of pieces were similar to chess: there was a king, a ferz (a counselor to the king), a chariot (rook), an elephant (an early form of a bishop), a horse (knight), and a foot soldier (pawn). We are clearly dealing with a board game that mimics the fight between two old-Indian armies. (Note that, a millennium later, some languages still use the same words for certain pieces. For example, a bishop in Russian is cлон, meaning “elephant.”) Chess spread to Asia and Persia (current-day Iran), likely in the sixth century, too. How that happened involves another legend pointing to India as the game’s birthplace. It was told in the Shahnama (Book of Kings), composed by the Persian poet Ferdowsi and completed around the year 1010. Bozorgmehr (bottom row, second from left), minister to sixth-century Persian king Khosrow I, plays chess with an Indian envoy, as depicted in a c. 1330–40 folio from Ferdowsi’s Shahnama (Book of Kings). One day, a richly equipped mission of envoys from the Raja of India arrived at the court of King Khosrow of Anushirvan, the Sāsānian king who ruled Persia from 531 to 579. Among the many treasures they brought was a beautiful, checkered board. A message written on silk described the board and the type of pieces that belonged to it, and noted that if anyone could detect how this game ought to be played, the Raja would happily pay the requested taxes. After a day and night of studying, Khosrow’s minister Bozorgmehr gave a complete description of the rules of chess, to the horror of the Indian envoys. To make matters worse, he went on to invent the game of nard (an early form of backgammon) and sent back a similar challenge to the Indian king—one his advisors failed to solve. 2–0 to the Persians. After the Muslim conquest of Persia in the middle of the seventh century, the Arabs got acquainted with chess, which the Persians had called chatrang and which they changed to shatranj. Chess grew in popularity and spread throughout the Arab-Islamic world. By the ninth or tenth century, chess was widely known in the Arab world, from India all the way to Spain. The first books about chess were written, containing more legends, poems, and expressions. One example described drunkenness: “He came following the path of a rook but left following the path of a knight.” The rich Arab chess literature further described links with mathematics, logical thinking, and even eroticism, while including chess instruction. Also, the manṣūbūt were introduced: chess puzzles from endgame positions with well-defined tasks, such as finding a forced checkmate in a few moves. A famous one is the Dilaram problem (given on page 381), supposedly coming from a chess game played by a nobleman named Murwardi. In financial dire straits, he had wagered his beautiful wife Dilaram on a game and ended up winning it thanks to her. When the position of the puzzle arose, she was the one who found the solution, saying to her husband, “Sacrifice your two rooks, and not me.” Chess in the Middle Ages Arab players brought chess to Europe through the Iberian Peninsula and the Byzantine Empire, probably during the tenth century. It also spread to Northern Europe, often following the routes of victorious armies. When the Normans conquered England, chess came with them. One of the earliest references to European chess is a famous letter from 1061 by Cardinal Bishop Petrus Damiani to the Pope-elect Alexander II and the Archdeacon Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII). In the letter, Damiani suggested that some clergy members had sinned by participating in certain leisure activities, including chess. The bishop of Florence defended himself by pointing out that, unlike other games which involved luck, chess was a game of skill. Until the mid-thirteenth century, the Church regularly prohibited playing chess (thus also demonstrating its popularity) as it did not clearly distinguish between chess and dice games. That is more understandable if you realize that, in those years, chess was often played with dice, with the numbers indicating which piece had to be played. But at some point, the Church’s stance changed. Murray wrote: “By 1250, the early prejudice of the Church against chess had begun to weaken in view of the royal and noble patronage of the game, and the monastic orders were freely accepting chess as a welcome alleviation of the monotony of convent life, while a knowledge of chess had spread downwards from the inmates of castle and monastery to the wealthier burgesses and merchants of the towns.” In other words, attempts to eradicate the game failed miserably, as chess simply could not be stopped. Chess became a regular feature of European nobility and courtly life in the course of just two centuries. Kings, priests, knights, and other members of the feudal nobility liked to play. In his influential work Disciplina Clericalis from the twelfth century, the Spanish physician, astronomer, and writer Peter Alfonsi listed it among the seven skills a good knight must acquire: riding, swimming, archery, boxing, hawking, verse writing, and chess. The game’s fame grew fast, as is shown by the hundreds of allusions to chess in literature from the thirteenth century onward. I quote Murray again: “During the latter part of the Middle Ages, and especially from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, chess attained to a popularity in Western Europe which has never been excelled, and probably never equalled, at any later date.” Well, the book you are reading has something to say about that last claim … A historically essential work is the Libro de los Juegos (Book of Games), commissioned by King Alfonso X of Castile and Léon in 1283. This stunningly beautiful manuscript, kept in the El Escorial monastery library close to Madrid, includes 97 leaves of parchment, many with beautiful color illustrations, and more than a hundred chess puzzles for the reader to solve, mostly taken from earlier Arabic sources (including the Dilaram problem). The puzzles are consistently shown on a chessboard in the middle of the illustration, with both male and female players to the left and right looking at the board. This important book deals with chess and notes, “Since chess is the noblest game, which requires the most skill compared to all the other games, we are going to talk about it first of all.” Chess quickly emerged as the most popular game due to its complexity and resemblance to medieval culture. Two men play chess in this illustration from the historic Spanish illuminated manuscript Libro de los juegos (Book of Games), or Libro de axedrez, dados, e tablas (Book of Chess, Dice, and Tables), 1283. A name change for some pieces helped chess become even more popular. Where chaturanga’s king had the Arabic ferz alongside him, Western chess replaced this piece with a queen. Other pieces were Westernized too: the horse became a knight, the chariot became a castle (or rook), and the elephant became a bishop. We now had pieces seemingly designed to match European social roles. The Birth of Modern Chess As chess spread from India toward Persia, the Arab empire, and into medieval Europe, the way it was played remained essentially the same. Some minor changes occurred, such as coloring the 64 squares to create a checkered board. Also, pawns were allowed to advance two squares instead of one on the first move, to speed up the game. Multiple versions of the game were played in different territories, even within Europe, with specific rules often varying from area to area. But then, around the end of the fifteenth century, chess underwent significant changes and reached a more or less unified form played all over the continent—the way we play it today. Two changes involved the movements of the bishop and the king. Instead of jumping diagonally exactly two squares only, the bishop could now move without jumping to any square on a diagonal. The king was allowed to run to safety by making a joint movement with one of the rooks, known as “castling.” A genuinely groundbreaking change, however, involved the queen. Like the Arabic ferz, hitherto the queen could only move one diagonal square at a time, making her the weakest piece on the board. Yet, by the turn of the fifteenth century, she could move as far as she wanted, following straight lines and diagonals. In what is generally called “modern chess,” she had become more potent than any other piece on the board. How this happened remains a bit of a mystery. One theory, now refuted, is that the newly empowered chess queen had been inspired by Joan of Arc, the peasant girl who claimed to have received divine visions while helping France defeat England at Orleans in 1429 during the Hundred Years’ War. Most chess historians, however, agree that the change for the chess queen was more than likely inspired by the new powers of an actual queen: Queen Isabella I, who reigned over Castile (part of present-day Spain) from 1474 until she died in 1504. Fittingly, she was considered more powerful than her husband, Ferdinand II, the King of Aragon. The first recorded tournament, probably played with the new rules, took place in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1467. Chess was played in many German cities in the late Middle Ages, and Heidelberg already had a chess club. Sponsored by Frederick I, Count Palatine of the Rhine, the conditions included accommodation and prizes for the winners. Chess had a sport element to it, like poetry and fencing had in those days. The new rules made the game faster, more complex, and rather tricky. Still, the popularity of chess hardly declined in the coming centuries, according to the historian Richard Eales in his 1985 book Chess: The History of a Game: “If the technical chess literature preserved in late medieval manuscripts and printed books compared with that in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscripts and printed books, or if the casual references to the game in wills, inventories, letters, and general literature are contrasted for the two periods, there is nothing to suggest a measurable decline in its popularity.” Part of this is explained by the fact that the social status of chess hardly changed either. It remained a respected pursuit among the upper classes (while also widely known among the lower classes), held in high esteem, not in the least due to its ancient history and many interpretations and analogies, which we’ll dive into somewhat deeper in the next chapter. An Increased Market Size By the eighteenth century, chess was in competition with various card games, especially the trendy game of whist. Still, the number of individuals playing chess kept growing. As Eales explained, there was a general increase in prosperity, giving more people the time and money to spend on leisure activities. In economic terms, the market size was increasing. Choosing to play chess became a matter of taste, which started a new phase for the game and how it was treated. Chess started to have a broader appeal than ever before and began to see more organized forms. For instance, it was increasingly becoming a pastime enjoyed at coffeehouses. In London, you had the Old Slaughter’s Coffee House in St. Martin’s Lane, which opened in 1692 and was visited by architects, painters, poets, and politicians. Even more famous was the Café de la Régence in Paris. Opened in 1681, the café welcomed a wide variety of intellectuals and many famous chess masters, including the best player of his time, François-André Danican Philidor (1726–95). In the Régence, Philidor met Voltaire and Robespierre and played chess with Rousseau. Coffeehouse chess soon led to the founding of the first “gentlemen’s” chess clubs in London and Paris in the late eighteenth century. They started to blossom in the early nineteenth century, and clubs soon opened in countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States. While chess was growing at this point, it also became a men’s game. Women rarely attended the coffeehouses and were often not allowed into the chess clubs. Additionally, chess was increasingly becoming a serious leisure activity (some even started considering it a sport), further stimulating the discrimination toward women in chess. Industrial society no doubt played a role here as well. While men shifted from doing paid work in the household to the factory, women remained in the private sphere. The two sexes lived more separate lives, and the women weren’t allowed much time for leisure activities at home. The first half of the nineteenth century also saw the organization of the first major chess events, adding to the game’s prestige. The biggest masters often played matches against each other (series of multiple games between two opponents), such as those between Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais of France and Alexander McDonnell of Ireland, or England’s Howard Staunton versus Frenchman Pierre de Saint-Amant—battles that were published widely and closely followed by chess fans all over Europe. Staunton was also the main organizer behind the first major international chess tournament in London in 1851. The increased interest in chess was reflected in the growing number of published chess-related books and the very first newspaper column (in the Liverpool Mercury in 1813) and magazine (Le Palamède, in 1836). Also, early attempts were made to systematically cover what was known about chess openings, in surveys such as Aaron Alexandre’s Encyclopedia of Chess from 1837. Chess tournaments started being held regularly in many countries, especially England and Germany. At the same time, the game generally became more organized and regulated as official federations were founded, in the same spirit as sports like soccer, track and field, and cricket. The first official World Chess Championship was held in various cities in the United States in 1886, when Wilhelm Steinitz beat Johannes Zukertort to earn the first World Chess Champion title. This particular championship started a long and wonderful tradition that continues today: a growing list of legendary world championship matches, two-player battles for the highest throne and eternal glory. The Fischer–Spassky match in 1972, with the Cold War as the backdrop, is the most famous. Every serious student of the game knows that the tradition goes back much further, and they can name all the world champions (and maybe even in the right order). I give them below followed by the years when they held the title: Wilhelm Steinitz (1886–94) Emanuel Lasker (1894–1921) José Raúl Capablanca (1921–27) Alexander Alekhine (1927–35, 1937–†1946) Max Euwe (1935–37) Mikhail Botvinnik (1948–57, 1958–60, 1961–63) Vasily Smyslov (1957–58) Mikhail Tal (1960–61) Tigran Petrosian (1963–69) Boris Spassky (1969–72) Bobby Fischer (1972–75) Anatoly Karpov (1975–85) Garry Kasparov (1985–2000) Vladimir Kramnik (2000–2007) Viswanathan Anand (2007–13) Magnus Carlsen (2013–23) Ding Liren (2023–) (Note that Alekhine died as world champion in 1946, after which Botvinnik took over the title in 1948 by winning a world championship tournament. Also note, this list doesn’t mention the FIDE world champions Alexander Khalifman, Ruslan Ponomariov, Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and Veselin Topalov, who won their titles between 1999 and 2005 during a messy situation in the chess world, described in Chapter 4.) Alongside the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, the French Chess Federation held an international team chess tournament, with 54 players from 18 countries. On July 20, the day of the last round, 15 participants founded the International Chess Federation under the French acronym Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE). It started to organize official Chess Olympiads modeled on the Olympic Games and, from 1948 onward, became the official body responsible for those world championships, with a separate category for women. The female champions are: Vera Menchik (1927–†1944) Lyudmila Rudenko (1950–53) Elisaveta Bykova (1953–56, 1958–62) Olga Rubtsova (1956–58) Nona Gaprindashvili (1962–78) Maia Chiburdanidze (1978–91) Xie Jun (1991–96, 1999–2001) Susan Polgar (1996–99) Zhu Chen (2001–4) Antoaneta Stefanova (2004–6) Xu Yuhua (2006–8) Alexandra Kosteniuk (2008–10) Hou Yifan (2010–12, 2013–15, 2016–17) Anna Ushenina (2012–13) Mariya Muzychuk (2015–16) Tan Zhongyi (2017–18) Ju Wenjun (2018–) (Note: Menchik died as world champion in 1944, after which Rudenko took over the title in 1950 by winning a world championship tournament.) All these players always brought a special aura whenever they entered a playing hall: a world champion has entered the building. They are the chess equivalent of the ancient residents of Mount Olympus, and it’s only natural that you’ll find many of their names throughout this book. Chess Is Everywhere Phoebe and Joey are playing a fast game of chess. As they move their pieces with one hand, they bang a chess clock with the other. It quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea what they’re doing. Joey says, “We should really learn how to play the real way.” Phoebe answers, “I like our way. Look!” She moves a piece, jumping over several of Joey’s as if they were playing checkers. She removes one of the enemy pieces and shouts triumphantly, “Chess!” Joey looks impressed and says, “Nice move!” Friends aired on NBC between 1994 and 2004 but, two decades later, the series is still watched worldwide via reruns and streaming services. In what is one of the most popular comedy shows of all time, chess made multiple appearances, most prominently in episode 20 of season eight, “The One With Rachel’s Big Kiss.” A deep analysis isn’t necessary to understand that chess was portrayed as a complicated game, while Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly known for their intellectual skills. Jerry Seinfeld, however, the titular character of that other enormously popular nineties sitcom, Seinfeld, was fairly smart. In episode nine of season three, titled “The Nose Job,” he describes a woman he started to date: “Isabel, she is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It’s like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game.” At the end of the episode, we see an actual chess game between two Jerry Seinfelds (through some special effects), one acting as his penis and one as his brain. The latter wins as the former laments a lack of energy. In the same series, Seinfeld’s friend George Costanza is, well, the less clever guy. At the start of “The Engagement,” the first episode of season seven, George plays chess with his current girlfriend, Alice. The opening scene focuses on the chessboard. George makes a move with the black pieces, sits back rather happy with himself, and says, “Well, you got no place to go. I’ll tell you what your problem is: you brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She’s one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? Nah, the queen is old-fashioned, likes to stay home, cook, take care of a man, makes sure he feels good.” With a stern look, Alice moves a piece and says, “Checkmate.” George studies the position closely and says, “I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” From The Big Bang Theory and Frasier to Cheers and The Simpsons, chess scenes appear in many popular shows—in fact, there’s a special cameo appearance in the latter’s season 28 by none other than Magnus Carlsen. It’s almost impossible to watch a TV series these days and not come across chess at some point. It happens so frequently that in my household, we have developed the habit of saying “No escape!” when we’re sitting on the couch and spot a reference to chess. My friend and Chess.com colleague Mike Klein told me a relatable experience: “Around 2008, I wanted to write an exhaustive story for the American magazine Chess Life about chess references in pop culture—movies, songs, advertisements, and the like. But I soon realized that there were far, far too many to write anything at magazine length. So I changed courses. I decided I would chronicle, for one year, all the pop-culture chess references that came to me organically. When watching TV and a chessboard appeared in a commercial, I would break out a pad and paper and jot it down. I gave up after about four weeks. Even when not seeking out the game, it found me far too often, and the many references inundated me.” One very binge-watchable Netflix show from 2020 was different because chess played a major role in every episode. It treated the game of kings most wonderfully and caused an incredible surge in the popularity of chess, this time also among girls and women. You probably already know what I am talking about. The Queen’s Gambit The Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit premiered on October 23, 2020. It helped that it was broadcast right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, but, just four weeks later, 62 million households had watched the show, which reached the top ten in 92 countries and occupied the number-one position in 63 of them. It took less than a month to become Netflix’s most-watched scripted limited series. Walter Tevis’s novel from 1983, on which the show was based, entered the New York Times bestseller list 37 years after its release. The Google search “how to play chess” hit a nine-year peak. Sales of chessboards and pieces rose by more than 1,000 percent and memberships on Chess.com went through the roof. The show created an incredible chess boom. In that sense, the series was the most influential use of chess in popular culture ever, at least in how it boosted the sport. Named after a popular chess opening, the miniseries follows the life of Beth Harmon (played as a young girl by Isla Johnston and as an adult by Anya Taylor-Joy), who discovers a prodigious talent for chess at a young age. Raised in an orphanage, she develops a tranquilizer addiction and hones her chess skills through dedicated practice. As she grows up, Beth enters the competitive world of chess, facing challenges and triumphs while battling her personal demons. That’s all very fascinating but, still, why the huge success? Anya Taylor-Joy as fictional chess prodigy Beth Harmon in a promotional still from the highly successful Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit, 2020. The answer might be that the show is not so much about chess, after all. When I interviewed the screenwriter Scott Frank for Chess.com in October 2020, he told me, “It’s about a child growing up, interrupted by this brilliant talent that she has. It’s very difficult to have a normal life if you have an extra-normal ability in almost any area, so this story is much more about her demons than it is about her obsession with chess. In fact, there’s nothing you need to know about chess.” Frank, who happens to be a Chess.com member and regularly plays on the site, made sure that the Beth Harmon character wouldn’t be another cliché of the troubled mind. He was helped by a famous chess player. “Garry Kasparov and I had many talks about this, and I didn’t wanna just hammer that. It’s mostly about genius in general and how it takes a cost on you. The thing about Beth Harmon is that she’s both the protagonist and antagonist in her own story.” Sir Tim Rice, the lyricist behind musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita and Disney productions Aladdin and The Lion King—and, with ABBA, Chess (see page 62)—told me about the series in a video call in May 2023: “It made clear that people who play chess are not all weirdos or automatons; they’re human beings.” Personally, I think The Queen’s Gambit is great because all the important individual aspects are great. The story is compelling: it combines a character-driven narrative with high-stakes chess games that create a sense of tension and intrigue. (Walter Tevis’s stories tended to do well on the big screen; he also wrote The Hustler, The Color of Money, and The Man Who Fell to Earth, all made into movies.) Apart from being a refreshing choice as a female star in a male-dominated subdomain, the main character is also a complex and relatable protagonist played wonderfully by Taylor-Joy. Furthermore, the excellent cinematic presentation of the actual chess games, the series’ detailed 1960s setting and the beautiful costumes (including lots of chess-themed clothes worn by the main character) contributed to the visual appeal. The Queen’s Gambit won many prizes, including a Golden Globe for limited series and a Golden Globe for Taylor-Joy, who beat Cate Blanchett (Mrs. America) and Nicole Kidman (The Undoing) in 2021. Among other prizes, she won Best Female Actor in the TV Movie or Limited Series category at the 27th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. Taylor-Joy even joined the chess boom herself. When asked, after winning her Golden Globe, if she had had enough chess for a lifetime, she replied, “Oh goodness, I could never say that. I love chess! I’ve had to pick up new skills for the movies that I’ve been doing, so I’m looking forward to having some time off so I can get back to chess.” Chess and Politics Alfonso X, Pope Leo XIII, Ivan the Terrible, King Edward I, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Napoleon, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Ernesto “Che” Guevara, Fidel Castro, Jimmy Carter—all of them enjoyed a game of chess. Yes, I am jumping to the world of politics, an area where the omnipresence of chess is strongly felt. Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was also one of the first politicians to write about chess. In his short essay from 1786 titled “The Morals of Chess,” he noted that chess is more than idle amusement: “Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions.” In one instance, Franklin used chess as an excuse for his political ploys. In December 1774—the period of rebellion by British colonial separatist leaders that would soon spark the American Revolution—he met several times with Caroline Howe, the sister of Admiral Richard Howe and General William Howe. The two brothers would later become commanders of the British naval and land forces during the American Revolutionary War, but they were both still somewhat sympathetic to the American cause at the time. Franklin played chess with Mrs. Howe, but these meetings were also an opportunity for him to meet with her brother Richard and discuss possible ways of reconciling the Continental Congress and the Thirteen Colonies. Franklin was a fanatic, but in politics Che Guevara was the biggest chess lover of them all. As a young boy, his father took him to the Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires in 1939, where Che saw the great José Raúl Capablanca, got interested in Cuba, and caught the chess fever. Later, he would call chess “mi segunda novia” (my second girlfriend). Che and Fidel Castro played chess to kill time while detained in Mexico, and, after the revolution, in his role as industry minister, Che began promoting chess. He ensured Cuba was represented at the 1960 Leipzig Chess Olympiad and launched a local team tournament. This 1853 engraving depicts Benjamin Franklin playing chess with Caroline Howe in December 1774. He had arranged several games as cover for peace talks with her brothers, Admiral Richard Howe (shown at center) and General William Howe. Che’s most significant chess legacy was establishing the annual Capablanca Memorial tournament in Havana, which still runs today. In the early years, many strong Soviet and European grandmasters participated as the prize fund was higher than at many tournaments elsewhere. I guess it helped that Che was both industry minister and director of the National Bank. He and Castro were daily visitors at the inaugural tournament in 1962 in the Habana Libre Hotel, and both participated in simultaneous exhibitions against visiting grandmasters, known as a simul. (In this old tradition, a strong player plays multiple amateur opponents simultaneously. As the expert walks around the boards, the opponent should make their move each time the expert arrives at their board.) Che had a lasting influence on chess in Cuba. For decades, it was the strongest Latin American country in chess, only recently surpassed by Brazil and Peru. When I visited Cuba in February 2016, the love for chess was still recognizable. I was surprised to see one of the leading chess clubs, the Academia de Ajedrez, located in the heart of Santiago de Cuba, in a building right next to the cathedral and Parque Céspedes. And, of course, I played against some of the many street players, facing stiff opposition. An old saying goes that every taxi driver in Russia is a strong player. I think in Cuba, every driver of a vintage classic car knows how to play chess. One of the 1965 Capablanca Memorial tournament participants was 22-year-old Bobby Fischer. The future world champion, however, played without traveling to Cuba. Due to the strained diplomatic relations with the United States, Fischer was not allowed to go there, but the organizers found a solution. Instead, he played from the Marshall Chess Club in New York, his moves transmitted to Havana by telex. Both Fischer and his opponents in Cuba were sitting across from empty chairs, receiving the countermoves from the arbiters. When Castro reportedly called the remarkable construction a “propaganda victory for Cuba,” Fischer sent a telegram demanding the Cuban leader stop using him for political purposes. In his reply, Castro denied he ever made the statement and questioned Fischer’s courage, after which Fischer decided to avoid further turmoil and just play the tournament. After Fischer qualified for the 1972 World Chess Champion-ship, President Richard Nixon wrote a letter saying the country was behind him. However, the match almost didn’t happen. A stubborn Fischer did not accept the initial conditions nor the location (Reykjavík, Iceland) and continued to protest, mainly about the financial arrangements. During the opening ceremony on Saturday, July 1, the front row had one empty seat as Fischer hadn’t arrived in Reykjavík yet. One thing that convinced Fischer to play was when James Slater, a successful British investment banker and chess lover, donated $125,000 to double the prize fund to $250,000. The other thing was an infamous phone call. Twenty-two-year-old Bobby Fischer playing in the Capablanca Memorial chess tournament in Cuba via telex at the Marshall Chess Club in New York, 1965. When Fischer picked up the phone on Monday, July 3, it was none other than Henry Kissinger on the line, Nixon’s national security advisor and future secretary of state. Kissinger’s opening sentence is usually cited as, “This is the worst chess player in the world calling the best chess player in the world.” Kissinger made the point that the match was necessary for the prestige of the United States, and that Fischer should go and play. That evening, Fischer finally boarded a plane to Reykjavík. In his 2011 book On China, Kissinger returned to the game of chess as he explained the differences between Western and Chinese political strategies by comparing them to chess and wéiqí (Go). Invented in China about 2,500 years ago, Go is older than chess and even more complex. Played on a 19×19 grid, players have 180 stones each and take turns to put them on one of the grid’s 361 intersections. After being so placed, stones do not move but can be captured when surrounded by the opponent’s stones. Kissinger noted: “If chess is about the decisive battle, wéiqí is about the protracted campaign. The chess player aims for total victory. The wéiqí player seeks relative advantage. In chess, the player always has the capability of the adversary in front of him; all the pieces are always fully deployed. The wéiqí player needs to assess not only the pieces on the board but the reinforcements the adversary is in a position to deploy.” The location of the Fischer–Spassky duel lay, not insignificantly, right between the US and the Soviet Union. It was the height of the Cold War, and the match could easily be seen as a symbolic fight between the capitalistic West and the Communist East, a point that wasn’t missed by the media. In hindsight, we should take all this with a grain of salt. Spassky wasn’t a strong Soviet patriot like some of his colleagues, while Fischer’s erratic and sometimes plain unpleasant behavior didn’t make him the perfect representative for his country either. Besides, at the highest diplomatic levels, the US and the USSR weren’t exactly rubbing hands for a military clash—perhaps for them, the match was a better, more peaceful way to fight it out, as the wise Qaflān had suggested in ancient India. Politics is the area that supplied several chess expressions to our language. The most common include: keeping an enemy “in check”; a minor entity being described as a mere “pawn” in a larger game; and a political “stalemate.” But there’s more. Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said before the first Republican presidential candidate debate in 2016: “The best politicians play chess, but most candidates play checkers. The chess players know you have to be willing to lose a piece or two to win the game … but if Jeb Bush wants to survive the ‘Trumpnado’ and become the nominee he needs to be, he should play a little chess, get out of Iowa, and get to New Hampshire as soon as possible.” There are numerous further examples, but I particularly like the following by former state counselor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, shortly after her National League for Democracy party won the 2015 elections: “If you look at the democratic process as a game of chess, there have to be many, many moves before you get to checkmate. And simply because you do not make any checkmate in three moves does not mean it’s stalemate. There’s a vast difference between no checkmate and stalemate. This is what the democratic process is.” One politician who shouldn’t be named in the same sentence as chess—at least as far as Garry Kasparov is concerned—is Vladimir Putin. Retired as a chess player since 2005, Kasparov is a fierce opponent of the Russian leader, and in an interview with Der Spiegel in 2015, he proclaimed, “Putin is more of a poker player. In poker, unlike chess, you can effectively compensate for a very weak hand by bluffing. There are fixed rules in chess, and no one knows how the game will end. Things are currently the other way around in Putin’s realm.” Russian politics have been deeply intertwined with chess for a long time. It should be noted that chess was already quite popular in the big Russian empire (that included parts of current-day Poland and the Baltic countries), where big names like Mikhail Chigorin, Alexander Alekhine, Aron Nimzowitsch, and Akiba Rubinstein were from. After the revolution in 1917, the game developed into a means of propaganda for the Bolsheviks, whose leaders Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Nikolai Krylenko were all chess players. Luxurious tournaments were held in Moscow in 1935 and 1936 to show the world that in Russia, grandmasters were treated as kings. When the USSR beat the US with a big margin in a radio match in 1945, Stalin congratulated his team. The Soviet state strongly supported chess education in order to create the best players in the world, thereby demonstrating the intelligence and sophistication of the Soviet people. Between 1995 and 2018, FIDE was led by the eccentric Russian oligarch Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who was also president of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Russian Federation from 1993 to 2010. The chess world mostly remembers him for his friendly ties with dubious leaders like Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, and Bashar al-Assad; his claim to have been abducted by aliens; and his administration’s alleged involvement in the murder of a journalist in 1998, although there was no proof of his involvement. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former deputy prime minister and a former assistant to the president of the Russian Federation, succeeded Ilyumzhinov in 2018. Especially in the eyes of Western chess federations, Dvorkovich’s presidency became problematic when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Dvorkovich was nonetheless re-elected in August 2022 for a second term. In December 2023, FIDE voted to remove the two-term limit for its presidency, a “good-governance” measure Dvorkovich himself had introduced after announcing it during his 2018 campaign. After this remarkable 180-degree turn, the strong Russian (Kremlin?) influence on the chess world is not expected to end soon. Chess and Sports In a promo video produced by Puma in December 2023, Magnus Carlsen and soccer manager Pep Guardiola talked about the similarities between chess and soccer. Carlsen noted the games are comparable, saying: “I think both in chess and soccer, the important thing is to control the middle, so that’s one thing. If you control the middle, you control the pitch or the board. Another thing is that often in chess you attack on one side, force the opponent to overload, and then you switch, and you have an advantage on the other side in terms of space. It’s remarkably similar.” Guardiola shares an interest in chess with fellow managers Quique Setién and Felix Magath and players past and present including Edgar Davids, Fernando Torres, Christian Pulisic, and Mo Salah. Fans of chess from other sports include Steve Davis (snooker), Boris Becker, Daniil Medvedev, Andrey Rublev, Carlos Alcaraz (tennis), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Klay Thompson (basketball), Charles Leclerc, Carlos Sainz, Mick Schumacher (Formula 1), John Urschel, Chidobe Awuzie (football) and Ravichandran Ashwin (cricket). Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the sport with possibly the largest number of chess enthusiasts is said to resemble chess the most: boxing. Three-time heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is a chess fan and taught his corner team to play. The Ukrainian brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, who share 40 world heavyweight title fight wins between them, love to play chess as well, which is also the case for Manny Pacquiao, Anthony Joshua, and the MMA fighters Conor McGregor and Aljamain Sterling. Like his colleagues, Lewis said he used chess to “stay mentally sharp,” for example, when he was preparing for the 2003 “Battle of the Titans” with Vitali Klitschko, who commented before the match, “First I beat Lewis on the chessboard, and then we meet in the ring.” In the end, it was Lewis who won by technical knockout. Speaking of which, did you know that chessboxing is a thing? People have played chess while hanging on a parachute or while bathing in a lake of freezing cold water, so putting a chessboard and pieces inside a boxing ring perhaps isn’t so crazy. After all, we’re dealing with another two-person confrontation where the anticipation of the opponent’s moves is key. It works as follows: the two contestants, reasonably trained in both disciplines, play alternating boxing and blitz-chess rounds until someone wins by either knockout or checkmate (or if the opponent’s clock time runs out). I happened to be present at the first official competition, on November 14, 2003, held by the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO) in Paradiso, Amsterdam, between Luis the Lawyer (Jean Louis Veenstra) and Iepe the Joker (Iepe Rubingh). The latter won after his opponent lost on time in a winning position. Rubingh, the main event organizer, was a Dutch conceptual artist who sadly passed away in 2020 at age 45. The history of chessboxing goes back even further: it featured in the 1979 kung fu film Mystery of Chess Boxing by Joseph Kuo (where Chinese chess, xiangqi, is played), which the band Wu-Tang Clan referred to in their 1993 song “Da Mystery of Chessboxin.’ ” On December 11, 2022, chessboxing found itself under the spotlight again when the popular YouTuber Ludwig Ahgren organized the Mogul Chessboxing Championship. Twelve of the biggest content creators on YouTube and Twitch, all with an interest in chess (more on that in Chapter 10), stepped into the ring in front of 10,000 fans inside the Galen Center in Los Angeles and 558,000 viewers online, who enjoyed commentary by Levy Rozman, chessboxing world champion Matt Thomas, and Ludwig himself. The Canadian grandmaster (GM) Aman Hambleton won the matchup among the chess experts by beating international master (IM) Lawrence Trent with a technical knockout. The highlight of the evening was the fight between two chess content creators, where Dina Belenkaya initially won, as Andrea Botez resigned the chess game. (Both were seasoned chess players who had spent months in the gym training for the boxing part.) However, fans quickly pointed out that the referee had made a mistake. Before that final chess session, Belenkaya had received four eight-second standing counts, which should have been enough for Botez to win on a technical knockout (TKO). Two days after the fight, the organizers adjusted the result, writing on social media: “After discussing with the players, we are not reversing Dina Belenkaya’s win because the fighters played it out in the moment, and she competed valiantly. However, we have decided to award Andrea a belt for her performance and to correct the decision that was made in the ring.” The British philosopher and radio documentary maker David Edmonds described the sport in BBC News Magazine as follows: “Chess and boxing seems as bizarre a pairing as anything, but they do have something in common. One is a duel often characterized by cruelty, ruthlessness, and violence. And boxing is much the same.” Chess Is Everything The oldest tools used to play board games are at least five millennia old. In his landmark 1938 book Homo Ludens, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga analyzed play as a cultural phenomenon: “For many years the conviction has grown upon me that civilization arises and unfolds in and as play.” Elsewhere, he writes that playing games is “older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing.” Chess quickly became the most popular game when it entered Western society. It was prominently depicted in medieval texts and art, and is still firmly embedded in our culture. The big question is: why chess? What is it with chess that “beat” other board games, dice, cards, etc., to become the dominant game in our society? In a conversation for this book, Sir Tim Rice summarized: “The game is in some respects a metaphor for life. You’ve got pawns who don’t have much power. You’ve got kings and queens who’ve got a lot more power. This is all very interesting, and so, obviously, it’s very easy to make those pieces a metaphor for aspects of life. And many great writers have done that.” In his 2023 documentary Through the Mirror of Chess: A Cultural Exploration, the filmmaker and author Howard Burton has suggested that the dominance of chess has to do with the complexity of the game resulting from the different pieces having different values and different movements: “Chess is special because it isn’t just the fact that it uses an array of different types of pieces that need to be coordinated with each other. It’s that each piece is constantly, ever so subtly, changing its value depending on its position with respect to all the others. And it’s precisely this highly nuanced, constantly shifting dance of individual pieces and overall positions that gives chess its unique aesthetic appeal.” My own view on chess comes closest to what Robert Desjarlais wrote in his 2011 book Counterplay: An Anthropologist at the Chessboard: “Chess play entails narrative intrigue. Undertaking a chess game trips a sense of adventure, of venturing into surprises and unanticipated situations.” Although the pieces were initially created as members of a small army, they’ve always felt more like characters in a story to me. I’ve always thought of a game of chess as a tale written by two authors who don’t know yet where things will go. This analogy perhaps works even stronger for me as a serious player who needs to write down his moves on a scoresheet (per official regulations). This means that after the story is over, it is stored forever in the human knowledge database for everyone to pick up and enjoy. For anyone who has read many chess books that discuss master games from the past, the comparison with literature comes naturally. Marcel Duchamp—a key figure in the Dada movement and one of the most influential twentieth-century artists—must have had something similar in mind when he said, in a short speech at a banquet of the New York State Association of Chess in 1952, “Actually, I believe that every chess player experiences a mixture of two aesthetic pleasures: first the abstract image akin to the poetic idea of writing; second the sensuous pleasure of the ideographic execution of that image on the chessboard.” I would like to add another aspect: the element of time. For advanced players, it is common to use a chess clock during a game, but every single move, in itself, is a fundamental element of time. When fully immersed in a complicated game, you get the sense that the longer a player thinks, the more you feel time is frozen. At such moments, you feel inside a separate world, an existence cut off from reality—the same experience as reading a book or watching a movie. This is what chess means to me, but it’s just one personal approach. Chess has meant so many different things to different people, starting from a war game for the Indians and Arabs, a symbol of social hierarchy in medieval times, an art form in itself, “the touchstone of intellect” (Goethe), a social enterprise, an organized sport, and a complex of problems that can be approached scientifically, as we will see in the third chapter. The Dutch grandmaster and author Jan Hein Donner once stated that “chess cannot be compared with anything” while “many things can be compared with chess.” I believe what he actually did was point out that there are apparent similarities between chess and many aspects of life, as long as you also acknowledge that chess is unique in itself. How else can I end this chapter than by quoting my favorite player of all time, Bobby Fischer, who said, “Chess is life.”",

      "content": "Chapter 2Duchamp, Nabokov, Bogart, Kubrick: Chess in the Arts “It’s a great huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the world—if this is the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them!” —Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 In 1923 Marcel Duchamp decided quite suddenly to interrupt his art career … to play chess. Years later, he said, “While not all artists are chess players, all chess players are artists.” He became a fanatic and eventually master-level player who participated in the French Championships and even represented his country at four Chess Olympiads. He justified his sudden switch to a chess career by stating that chess “has all the beauty of art—and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.” The story goes that Duchamp was so crazy about chess that in the first week after getting married to his first wife, Lydie Sarazin-Levassor, in 1927, he hardly spent any time with her but instead visited the chess club every night. She got so angry that she glued the pieces to his chessboard. The marriage didn’t last long. Chess as an Art Form Many will see chess as a mere board game, while others may accept it as a sport. To anyone who has dedicated more than just a few months of their life to it, chess is also an art. Among the infinite number of possible games and positions, there is so much hidden beauty, invisible to the untrained eye but an enormous pleasure to everyone willing to go beyond merely knowing the rules of the game. Chess is a labyrinth of endless pathways often paved with brilliant gems—as long as you keep looking for them. The ancient Arabic manṣūbāt, mentioned in the previous chapter, often had rather ingenious solutions that can easily be described as pretty or artistic. In the last two centuries, this old tradition has developed into the field of endgame studies (positions where one side can win or defend to a draw beautifully) and problems (positions where a forced checkmate needs to be found). Many chess compositions are considered pieces of art, and their composers are true artists of the game. The Russian Alexey Troitsky (1866–1942), the Frenchman Henri Rinck (1870–1952), and the Armenian Genrikh Kasparyan (1910–95) can be considered the Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven of endgame composition. The notion of chess as an art form is also reflected by the fact that our game had its so-called romantic period during the late-eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries. It may be a stretch to claim that this was directly influenced by Romanticism in the arts, but the periods did overlap. While Eugène Delacroix, Francisco Goya, Caspar David Friedrich, and John Constable created their masterpieces on canvas, players like Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, and the American genius Paul Morphy did the same on the chessboard. The “romantic” aspect of their chess was characterized by aggressive, tactical play that often involved gambits (pawn or even piece sacrifices in the opening) to attack the opponent’s king from the get-go. Two games by Anderssen—true artistic (and romantic!) masterpieces—have received names: the “Immortal” game, played against Lionel Kieseritzky at the London 1851 tournament; and the “Evergreen” game against Jean Dufresne in Berlin in 1852 (see annotated games on pages 382–84). (It was a kind of swashbuckling style of play, perhaps comparable with the English soccer club Arsenal under Arsène Wenger, or with the now fairly extinct service-volley style in tennis.) Wilhelm Steinitz, the first official world champion, has been deemed responsible for halting these crazy attackers as he led the foundations of positional, strategic play. About half a century later, Modernism, the art movement, reflected the newly emerging industrial world, and saw its counterpart in chess. It was called “hypermodernism,” a strategic approach where a player intentionally avoided occupying the center of the board with pawns early in the game, opting to control it from a distance, or intending to counterattack the opponent’s pawn center. This style of play came into swing in the 1920s as a reaction to the classical principles of chess, which typically advocated the center’s direct occupation and control. Key figures associated with hypermodern chess were Richard Réti and Aron Nimzowitsch, who both penned their thoughts in books considered classics. A century later, top-level chess mixes both classical and hypermodern ideas. Sometimes, single moves in a chess game are simultaneously brilliant and beautiful. Chess fans get a sparkle in their eyes in recognition of their appeal when they see Frank Marshall’s astonishing final move in his game with Stefan Levitsky (Breslau, 1912; see annotated game on page 384), Anatoly Karpov’s unexpected knight retreat against Garry Kasparov (Moscow, 1984; see pages 387–88), or Alexei Shirov’s stunning bishop sacrifice against Veselin Topalov (Linares, 1998; see pages 392–93). The chess pieces themselves can also be pure works of art. When I asked the Dutch former top grandmaster Jan Timman what initially attracted him to chess as a young boy, his answer was, “the pieces.” In his case, it was his grandmother’s beautifully decorated chess set, although even the pieces of the standard version can be inspiring. Officially sanctioned by FIDE, the Staunton chess set is named after the nineteenth-century English top player Howard Staunton. However, credit should go to the journalist Nathaniel Cooke, who designed the pieces in 1849, while Staunton only endorsed the set. Long before the Staunton pieces became the standard—afterward, too—an incredible variety of sets were designed containing the most beautiful chess pieces you can imagine. Archeological findings of chess pieces from the earliest times in India don’t exist, but it is assumed they depicted humans and animals. That is also the case for the oldest chess pieces that have survived, which were discovered in 1977 at the ancient site of Afrasiyab in Northern Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and date back to between the late sixth and early eighth centuries. Pieces from the subsequent Arabic period have a more basic design. As the beliefs of the day prohibited the depiction of humans or animals, those pieces were of quite abstract shapes, holding three geometrical forms: the cylinder, the rectangle, and the cone. During the Middle Ages, the shape of the chess pieces gradually changed under the influence of Christian culture, often showing more human-like figures. The most famous medieval chess pieces are the Lewis Chessmen: twelfth-century pieces discovered on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in 1831. They were almost certainly brought there by the Vikings, demonstrating that chess was already known and played in Scandinavia in the 1100s. These beautiful pieces were made of walrus tusks, varying in height from 3.5 to 10.2 centimeters. Except for the pawns, all the 79 pieces found (from multiple, incomplete chess sets) depict human figures: the knights are mounted on horses and are shown holding spears and shields, while the rooks are standing soldiers or “warders” holding shields and swords. At an auction in 2019 one of those warders, which had been kept in a drawer in Scotland for 55 years, was sold for £735,000 ($933,000). The king and queen pieces from the Lewis Chessmen, a set made in the twelfth century from walrus ivory and discovered in Scotland in 1831. Various materials have been used to make chess sets, such as ivory, bone, and different types of woods, but also rock-crystal, jasper, amber, and even silver or gold. Queen Margaret of England (1430–82) is said to have possessed green and red chess pieces made of jasper and crystal. Another common idea has been that the two armies of chess pieces represent real-life armies—for instance, a “Battle of Waterloo” chess set, with Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington as the adversary kings. (Wasn’t chess supposed to be a way to fight a war without bloodshed? Well, that didn’t work out for humanity, so instead we playfully depict bloody battles on the chessboard.) At some point, designs returned to more abstract forms, eventually leading to the Staunton pieces, although artists continued to be inspired by the royal game and often designed unique chess sets. Beautiful examples include Josef Hartwig’s minimalist 1923 design that followed the Bauhaus art school, where the shape of the cube-like pieces reflects how they move, and Man Ray’s equally abstract but more rounded design from 1920. Man Ray was not the only Dadaist who designed chess sets; the same can be said for his friends Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp was famous for his “readymades,” such as the porcelain urinal (titled Fountain) he declared a piece of art, because he could, in 1917. He was a hero of the early anti-art movement and a forefather of postmodernism. In his earlier work as a painter, before he became a fanatic player, chess played a prominent role. His 1910 work The Chess Game is painted fairly realistically, while his The Chess Players from a year later fits the Cubist movement of that time. Chess and art were not two completely separate territories for Duchamp. The two worlds came together at an exhibition in 1966 titled Homage to Caissa, also the title of a readymade chessboard that is missing its pieces. The exhibition opened on the rooftop of 978 Madison Avenue in New York, where Duchamp played chess with Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol. In 1968, Duchamp appeared with the avant-garde composer and music theorist John Cage (famous for his piece “4´33˝”—four minutes and 33 seconds of silence) at a concert titled Reunion. The two played a chess game on a special board with audio outputs connected to photoelectric cells underneath the board, so each move created a sound. In one of his interviews, Duchamp said, “I tried to protect my work with silence by dedicating myself for a long time to the game of chess. That is a game which always enthralled me because of its complexity. I always loved complexity.” I’d like to think that a love for complexity also defined his special relationship with art. The art photographer Julian Wasser, who passed away in early 2023, owed part of his celebrity to an iconic photo that he took in 1963 of Duchamp playing chess against the fully nude writer Eve Babitz at the Pasadena Art Museum in Los Angeles. In the 2009 book Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Chess, Francis Naumann and Bradley Bailey explored Duchamp’s chess career, and the two-time United States chess champion Jennifer Shahade analyzed 15 of his games. On this occasion, she shot a performance art video at the Philadelphia Soundstages inspired by the Duchamp versus Babitz picture. Shahade turned it around, playing with clothes herself (though wearing a corset) against a fully naked man named Jason Bretz. The two used a beautiful chess set, the pieces of which were also naked figures. Afterward, Shahade noted in a story on her website, “One great thing about playing against a naked man in chess is that there are no pockets for electronic devices, so you can be absolutely sure he is not cheating.” (At the height of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal, organizing a tournament involving participants wearing swimming shorts was jokingly suggested, as we will learn in Chapter 7.) It is a sign of the importance of chess in our culture that the game has been represented in the visual arts many thousands of times over the centuries. Some well-known examples include Lucas van Leyden’s The Game of Chess (1508), which you can see in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin; Sofonisba Anguissola’s The Chess Game (1555), hanging in the National Museum in Poznań, Poland; and Honoré Daumier’s The Chess Players (c. 1863–67), to be found in the Petit Palais in Paris. More recent examples are Chessboard, Glass, and Dish (1917) by the Spanish Cubist Juan Gris, to be found in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and M. C. Escher’s Metamorphosis II (1939), at the Escher in Het Paleis Museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. In these works, chess often functions as a metaphor, reflecting a strategic setting, a complex battle, a symbolic fight against fate, or the proximity of victory or defeat. Personally, I think the inner beauty of the board and pieces was often enough inspiration for artists to depict the game. De schaakspelers (Game of Chess), a painting by Dutch painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden, 1508. The most rudimentary meaning of chess is that of war. The earliest chess pieces reflected members of the Indian armies, with, as noted, specially designed chessmen who modeled actual armies of real-life battles. One avant-garde artist had a fundamentally different take, and she was the first to present it vigorously as a game of peace: Yoko Ono. Ono’s art installation Play it by Trust consists of a large and entirely white chess set. Half of the chessboard’s squares are placed on a slightly different level to maintain the checkered pattern, while both sets of pieces are painted white. The chess set is also a metaphor here, but, in this case, represents the futility of war, as the artist encourages humans to unite rather than divide. The installation was first exhibited in 1966 in London’s Indica Gallery and featured in her late husband John Lennon’s 1972 television film Imagine, which was soundtracked by the album of the same name. Half a century later, in March 2024, Sean Lennon, son of John and Yoko, won an Academy Award for his short animated film War Is Over! The film holds an anti-war message as well and shows two soldiers from rival armies playing chess with each other by sending their moves across the battlefield via carrier pigeon. Chess and Literature In a popular romantic story originating in France around 1160, Floris is trying to rescue Blancheflour, who is being kept in the emir’s tower. By playing chess with the tower watchman, Floris gains admission to the prison. In the Tristan en prose (Prose Tristan) from around the same time, the knight Tristan is sent to Ireland by King Mark to fetch his bride, Iseult. On the way back, while on a boat and immersed in a chess game, the two accidentally drink a love potion and fall in love, with disastrous consequences. Like in art, chess has been a source of inspiration in literature from a very early age. Chess plays an even greater role in the Roman van Walewein (Romance of Gawain), a Middle Dutch chivalric romance from the thirteenth century, in which a magic chessboard suddenly flies in through the window as King Arthur and his knights enjoy a banquet at Camelot. After the board flies away again, Arthur announces that whoever can fetch it for him will inherit his fortunes. Walewein (Gawain) goes for it and eventually brings it back after experiencing many adventures that involve slaying dragons, saving a damsel, and obtaining a special magical sword. Those were the days! The Roman van Walewein can be read as a traditional chivalric romance. However, some parts suggest that the authors Penninc and Pieter Vostaert were toying with the genre, as their story includes satirical elements. In general—and this can be said about many medieval literary texts involving chess—the story commented on the political order of the time. In his 2006 book The Immortal Game, David Shenk convincingly explains why chess was so well equipped for metaphorical usage (italics by Shenk): It largely came down to the fact that chess had been designed as a symbol to begin with. Out of the box, it came furnished with a wide variety of generic attributes that lent themselves to an even wider variety of metaphorical applications: chess was a battle between two groups, each stratified by social ranking, contesting for dominance over a finite piece of geography, interacting in a dynamic so complex it seemed to take on a life of its own, each army manipulated by a player, battling each other with wits rather than brawn, employing both tactics (short-term planning) and strategy (long-term planning), in a game that could never truly be mastered. Chess, therefore, lent itself perfectly to the allegory, a literary form that was highly popular in the Middle Ages. This way of using a narrative or visual representation to communicate a hidden meaning, often with moral or political significance, came from both biblical and classical traditions and was readily recognized by the readers of the time. The omnipresence of allegorical stories that involved chess, usually called “moralities,” emphasized the game’s status and further helped spread it. The oldest chess morality is a thirteenth-century Latin treatise titled Quaedam moralitas de scaccario. H. J. R. Murray called it Innocent Morality and summarized: “The world resembles a chessboard which is chequered white and black, the colors showing the two conditions of life and death, or praise and blame. The chessmen are men of this world who have a common birth, occupy different stations and hold different titles in this life, who contend together, and finally have a common fate which levels all ranks. The king often lies under the other pieces in the bag.” One of my favorite chess expressions goes: “At the end of the chess game, both the king and the pawn go back into the same box.” It seems to date back to Innocent Morality. I love the added detail that the king is often lying under other pieces—a similar lesson in humility as the one from the Brahmin mathematician Sissa (see page 11). The best example of a chess morality is the Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium super ludo scacchorum (Book of the Morals of Men and the Duties of Nobles and Commoners, on the Game of Chess) by the Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis, a very famous work from the mid-thirteenth century. According to Murray, the number of existing manuscripts and translations suggests that its popularity “must have almost rivaled that of the Bible itself.” Cessolis’s work further established that chess was a symbolic representation of society. The king, queen, and knight have their expected roles, but he described the alfils (bishops) as the judges, the rooks as the king’s governors, and the pawns as members of the common people, who represented eight different trades or professions. Unlike the Roman van Walewein, the Liber does not have the king as a center point but concerns all members of society, who should learn the game so they will be able to master their role. A facsimile of a page with a woodcut illustration of a chess player, from William Caxton’s The Game and Playe of Chesse, 1474—a translation of an earlier work by Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis. A few decades after the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press (which was around 1440), the English merchant William Caxton published Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye in 1473, a collection of stories associated with Homer’s Iliad. Caxton printed The Game and Playe of Chesse a year later, his translation of Cessolis’s book. What was probably the second book ever to be printed in the English language had chess all over it. Scachs d’amor (Chess of Love), a poem written around 1475 and published in Valencia, is significant for being the earliest available source delineating the new powers of the chess queen. The poem uses chess as an allegory for love: it describes a chess game between two players representing the gods Mars and Venus, while a referee (Mercury) watches over them. Almost half a century after Scachs d’amor was written, another chess poem appeared: Scacchia ludus (The Game of Chess), from 1527, by the Italian humanist, bishop, and poet Hieronymus Vida (Marco Girolamo Vida). This lengthy poem, written in Latin, was very popular for over a century and was reprinted more than 40 times. Once again an allegory for love, it describes a mythological chess game between Apollo and Mercury in the presence of the other gods and a nymph called Scacchis. In 1763, the British philologist and orientalist William Jones used it to write a chess poem, replacing “Scacchis” with “Caissa,” nowadays known as the goddess of chess. In chess literature, Caissa usually appears when discussing luck; for instance, a writer describing a fortunate victory can say, “Caissa was on my side.” (I’ve used that phrase myself too many times.) Go figure: the game’s divine protector is a woman, albeit one that you will not find in the writings of Homer or Sophocles. Caissa is a tawdry invention from the post-Renaissance. Although I play myself for a Dutch chess club named after Caissa, it’s hard not to see her as some kind of a kitsch goddess—the Betty Boop of the Greek gods, if you will. Chess continued to play a respectable role in written text in the following centuries, showing that the game was here to stay. In three books, chess plays a key part from start to finish. Stefan Zweig’s Die Schachnovelle (The Royal Game, also published as Chess Story) and Vladimir Nabokov’s Zashchita Luzhina (The Defense or The Luzhin Defense) have always been considered to be the “big two.” Since 2020, Walter Tevis’s novel The Queen’s Gambit should perhaps be mentioned in the same breath. Written by two literary heavyweights of the twentieth century, The Royal Game and The Defense were highly successful. Both deal with characters who are deeply obsessed with chess while also showing the destructive powers the game can have. In that sense, the two works have helped create the chess grandmaster’s archetype of the tormented genius. It’s a common and regrettable prejudice to think that brilliance in chess necessarily goes hand in hand with some form of lunacy. Still, I wouldn’t want to suggest that chess would have been better off without these books. The Royal Game was Zweig’s last and most famous work. The Austrian-born author wrote it while in exile in Brazil, where he tragically committed double suicide with his wife Lotte in early 1942, too depressed and disillusioned about what he saw as the inevitable destruction of his “spiritual homeland Europe” by Nazi Germany. First published posthumously in late 1942, the novella draws a clear parallel with Zweig’s personal life. The personage Dr. B. also feels the fascist pressure when imprisoned by the Gestapo. While in captivity, he teaches himself chess with the help of a book full of master games. On a boat traveling from New York to Buenos Aires, Dr. B. even manages to win a game against the reigning world champion, Czentovic. During their second game, Dr. B. has to withdraw prematurely as he fears a return to his obsessive behavior during his imprisonment. There are minor flaws in the story, such as Dr. B. and Czentovic reaching world-class strength in an unrealistically short period (the latter took a mere five years from learning the rules to winning the highest title, which is as unlikely in chess as in any sport). Still, The Royal Game sold millions of copies and was translated into many languages, and rightly so. It was turned into a film four times, most recently in 2021 in Philipp Stölzl’s Chess Story. An opera based on the novel ran in 2013 in the Kiel Opera House, and a theater production was produced for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2015. Zweig is still considered an important twentieth-century author with a corpus that includes poetry, theater, short stories, and biographies, and contains numerous chess references. The Defense was Nabokov’s third novel, written after he moved to Berlin. Published in 1930, it was among his first nine novels written in Russian; an English version appeared in 1964. The book is about Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin, who learns chess as a young boy and becomes one of the world’s strongest grandmasters. Despite having a unique gift, Luzhin’s life grows increasingly unstable. Even his beautiful and intelligent wife cannot save him from his ultimately fateful escape from reality. Despite frantic efforts, Luzhin fails to exterminate chess from his life and his thoughts. Although the game fully absorbs Luzhin until it checkmates him, Nabokov doesn’t make chess the direct cause of his demise. The Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree told me, “More important are Luzhin’s youth and his relationship with his impresario. Chess was a defense against the toughness of life, which it has been for me as well, although in a less dramatic way. Life can be difficult, but you can still score your little triumphs on the chessboard.” The book was neither the first nor the last time Nabokov would reference chess, but it’s the only one that deals with the game throughout the story. The thing was: Nabokov loved chess. He even liked to create chess problems and published a book in 1970 titled Poems and Problems (a compilation of 53 poems and 18 chess problems). He wrote, “Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterize all worthwhile art: originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity.” Nabokov’s love for creating puzzles that, by definition, have only one unique solution also shines through The Defense, which even has a structure that resembles a chess game. He wrote in the preface to the English edition: “The chess effects I planted are distinguishable not only in these separate scenes; their concatenation can be found in the basic structure of this attractive novel.” Like literature, chess is an invented reality in constant tension with the actual reality. For Luzhin and the reader, these realities can be hard to separate. Chess plays a smaller but significant part in an enormous variety of books. For example, many detective stories have been written where chess skills are used to solve the mystery at stake. In a recent title, the world’s biggest chess star plays a role. Magnus Carlsen og sjakkmorderen (Magnus Carlsen and the Chess Killer) is a Norwegian graphic novel from 2020 by Aleksander Kirkwood Brown. It has Carlsen using his chess prowess to chase down a serial killer in Oslo. The best example in this category is The Eight, a novel from 1988 by Katherine Neville. The book intertwines historical and modern storylines and revolves around a mysterious and powerful chess set with a centuries-old secret. The Eight is an avant la lettre Dan Brown with lots of chess (and is much better written). I cannot talk about chess and literature without mentioning Lewis Carroll’s children’s novel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, the sequel to Alice in Wonderland. Published in 1871, Through the Looking-Glass again follows the adventures of a young girl named Alice, who this time steps through a mirror into a whimsical world where everything is reversed, including logic. Chess forms a constant theme. Early in the story, Alice discovers chess pieces that have come to life. She then meets the Red Queen, who shows her a landscape resembling a giant chessboard, but also offers to turn Alice, now a pawn in a chess game, into a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank. Alice meets all kinds of strange creatures, such as Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, and talking flowers, while making her way across the board. The Red Queen chastises Alice in an illustration by John Tenniel for Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 (dated 1872). Nabokov saw a strong resemblance between composing a chess problem and a poem, but kept them separate. Carroll did not. In his story he presents an actual chess problem before anything else. After the title page and an overview of the characters, the book features a chess diagram where White has a queen, rook, knight, and pawn, and Red has a king, queen, and knight. The task is supplied—“White Pawn (Alice) to play and win in eleven moves”—and also the solution, which is a list of moves that, at the same time, functions as an index of key moments that will occur in the story. You could say that Carroll goes a step further than Nabokov when it comes to the game played with the reader, because the solution to the diagram, at least for chess players, doesn’t strictly follow the game’s rules and therefore doesn’t make much sense. (White can actually checkmate the enemy king in just three moves.) But the fact that it’s illogical isn’t illogical in a world behind a mirror, right? In the 1887 edition of the book, the author wrote in his preface (italics by Carroll): As the chess problem given on the previous page has puzzled some of my readers, it may be well to explain that it is correctly worked out so far as the moves are concerned. The alternation of Red and White is perhaps not so strictly observed as it might be, and the “castling” of the three Queens is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace; but the “check” of the White King at move 6, the capture of the Red Knight at move 7, and the final “checkmate” of the Red King, will be found, by any one who will take the trouble to set the pieces and play the moves as directed, to be strictly in accordance with the laws of the game. That still didn’t explain things fully, and perhaps rightly so, because it’s not necessarily an author’s task to explain his book. Many interpretations have been suggested over time. Alexander Taylor provided the best one in his 1952 biography of Carroll, titled The White Knight. He pointed out that one shouldn’t read it from the perspective of one of the players who has a complete vision of the board, but from the perspective of the pieces: Alice, as a pawn, but even the queens in the story, who cannot see or understand very well what is happening around them. He based his story, not on a game of chess, but on a chess lesson or demonstration of the moves such as he gave to Alice Liddell, a carefully worked-out sequence of moves designed to illustrate the queening of a pawn, the relative powers of the pieces—the feeble king, the eccentric knight, and the formidable queen whose powers include those of rook and bishop—and finally a checkmate. That is to say, he abstracted from the game exactly what he wanted for his design, and expressed that as a game between a child of seven-and-a-half who was to “be” a White Pawn and an older player (himself) who was to manipulate the other pieces. Considering his love for mirrors, labyrinths, and chess, it is unsurprising that the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges tremendously enjoyed Carroll’s books and made multiple references to him in his writings. In his 1976 preface to the Spanish translation of Carroll’s works, Borges highlights the concept of the reciprocal dream: “Alice dreams of the Red King, who is dreaming of her, and someone warns her that if the King awakens, she will go out like a candle because she is no more than a dream of the King that she is dreaming.” Such a reciprocal dream also represents another common theme in Borges’s work (for instance in his lovely poem “Chess”), which is that of “infinite recursion”—the effect of endless representations of realities, such as in a room covered with mirrors. For Borges, as we have seen with Nabokov, chess was a metaphor for his interpretation of literature. In both cases, we create an independent world with arbitrary features while challenging our understanding of reality. This could be said for any game, but chess is not just any game—and not for Borges either. In a 1981 interview, he said, “Chess is one of the means we have to save culture, such as Latin, the study of the humanities, the reading of classics, the laws of versification, ethics.” He had clearly placed chess on another level, as he continued, lamenting, “Chess is now replaced by football, boxing, or tennis, which are games of fools, not of intellectuals.” (It makes you wonder what he would have thought about chessboxing.) Borges’s poem is just one of numerous examples where chess features prominently in poetry. In his 1981 anthology The Poetry of Chess, Andrew Waterman covered six centuries of English poetry mentioning chess, which included works from Geoffrey Chaucer, John Skelton, Richard Lovelace, Abraham Cowley, Oliver Goldsmith, William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Louis MacNeice, Robert Lowell, and John Berryman. “Chess resembles writing, painting, and music in being an obsessional mental activity preoccupied with exploring tension and complication to resolve them to triumphant harmony,” Waterman wrote in his introduction, providing another tremendous meaning to our beloved game. It would be impossible and unnecessary to try to list all books and stories with chess prominently present. To end this section, I feel obliged to mention just a few more: Agatha Christie’s The Big Four, Ilya and Evgeny Petrov’s The Twelve Chairs, Elias Canetti’s Auto-da-Fé, Samuel Beckett’s Murphy, Isaac Asimov’s Nightfall and Pebble in the Sky, Ian Fleming’s From Russia, with Love (for the latter, see page 67 of the section on films), John Healy’s The Grass Arena, J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s The Flanders Panel and What We Become, Tom Clancy’s Red Rabbit, and Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club. Chess is omnipresent in literature, seemingly more so than any other game. Matthew James Seidel observed in an essay in 2017: “The most obvious explanation why fiction is so replete with chess players is that at their core, chess and stories are about the same thing—conflict. And it is a particular kind of conflict that is utterly devoid of chance. Whether a king is playing against a beggar or a nuclear physicist against a kindergartener, all that matters are the choices you make.” That so many authors have chosen to depict chess in their works cannot be considered a coincidence. At the end of this segment about chess and literature, I should mention that there’s also an incredible wealth of chess literature: books that, to a greater or lesser extent, are of a technical nature and discuss chess openings, middlegames, endgames, players, tournaments, and many other subtopics. I was once told there are more books written about chess than about any other sport, and I think it’s true. To give you an idea: the Royal Library in The Hague has the largest collection in Europe, with around thirty thousand books on chess and draughts (checkers, but played on a ten-by-ten board). I suspect quite a small minority is about draughts. In the chess world some of these books are considered absolute classics, regarded in high esteem for the literary style in which they are written. Famous titles are My System (1925) by Aron Nimzowitsch, My 60 Memorable Games (1969) by Bobby Fischer, and The King (1987), a large selection of articles by Jan Hein Donner. All three include sentences that have become iconic and/or part of typical chess jargon. Nimzowitsch, for example, wrote, “The passed pawn is a criminal, who should be kept under lock and key. Mild measures, such as police surveillance, are not sufficient.” Fischer’s famous line “best by test” to describe his favorite first move for White (1.e4) is another one, while you will find plenty of Donner examples elsewhere in this book. Chess and Theater With literature and theater being intrinsically linked, it is not surprising that we find many chess-related stories performed on stage. If one says “theater,” you think immediately of William Shakespeare. Still, the few mentions of chess in his works (and the game Miranda and Ferdinand are playing in The Tempest) merely demonstrate that chess was widely known at the time and that some of its terminology (such as “check” and “mate”) had already enriched the English language. More notable is Thomas Middleton’s A Game at Chess from 1624. This satirical play featured a chess plot but actually alluded to Anglo-Spanish diplomacy in such a way that King James I of England made sure the performances were stopped after just nine days! We find a more significant use of chess in Samuel Beckett’s oeuvre. The Irish novelist and dramatist, who won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature, had a lifelong love for the game. Beckett played chess, studied technical books and even followed important tournaments. In his work he often used chess, exploring its artistic and metaphorical possibilities, such as in his 1938 avant-garde novel Murphy, where the main character’s involvement in a chess game also signifies his personal struggle. But since we are discussing chess and theater, I will focus on Beckett’s piece Endgame—its title doesn’t leave much room for doubt. This tragicomedy from 1957 is basically a game of chess—well, the final phase of it—performed on stage. In fact, you can distinguish multiple games of chess, as the Dutch researcher Onno Kosters suggested in an article in 1996. As the curtain opens, we see the character Hamm sitting in a wheelchair and wearing sunglasses; he is blind and unable to use his legs. Next to him stand two large metal dustbins; Hamm’s parents Nagg and Nell, both without legs, are inside them. The fourth character is Hamm’s servant, the restless Clov, who constantly threatens to leave but never does. Most of the play consists of seemingly unimportant actions, with Hamm ordering Clov to move to different places and Clov moving Hamm’s wheelchair for no understandable reason. It’s easy to see Hamm as a king, moving slowly over the chessboard, and Clov as a freedom-seeking pawn, while Nagg and Nell appear like captured pieces, no longer involved in the main action. At the same time, Hamm and Clov and Nagg and Nell seem involved in a chess game against each other. And then, there is the game played between the playwright and his audience. According to James Acheson, a former Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, this particular game serves the purpose of frustrating “our attempts to interpret Endgame definitively; checkmate occurs when we recognize that the play is deliberately designed to resist even the most ingenious of explications.” Probably the most famous chess-related stage performance is the musical production Chess, conceived by Sir Tim Rice, with music by ABBA’s male half, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson. After a concept album was released in the autumn of 1984, the show opened in London’s West End in 1986, where it ran for nearly three years. Although it didn’t have a major Broadway run, the musical was still quite successful as it was also performed in Sydney, Los Angeles, Stockholm, Florence, Moscow, Budapest, Tokyo, and St. Louis, among other places. The hit song “One Night in Bangkok,” from the musical’s 1984 concept album, topped the charts in countries including West Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, and South Africa. The plot centers on two rival chess grandmasters—Freddie Trumper from the United States, and Anatoly Sergievsky from the Soviet Union—playing a world championship match in Merano, Italy. As the championship progresses, a love triangle emerges, with Florence Vassy, Freddie’s assistant and former lover, becoming romantically involved with Anatoly. The match itself is not only a battle of chess strategy but also a reflection of the political tensions between the two superpowers. So, once again, we see the game of chess used effectively as a metaphor: the musical portrays the ideological struggles of the Cold War era, with the American–Soviet rivalry serving as a backdrop to the characters’ personal struggles. The musical was inspired by the famous 1972 Fischer–Spassky world championship match. Rice, already famous as the author of the lyrics for Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, was among the millions who closely followed the “Match of the Century.” “It was the characters, the East–West clash, and the politics that drew me in,” Rice told me. He said he built the two main characters on Fischer and Spassky: “I found it interesting that Fischer was being not a very nice man, and yet he was meant to be the on the side of the good guys, being an American, a Westerner—and Spassky was meant to be an evil, commie bastard, but he was a nice guy.” It should be noted that the Sergievsky character also possessed elements of Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi, the two who played world championships in 1978 in Baguio City, Philippines, and in 1981 in Merano, Italy—Rice even visited the latter event. Sergievsky’s defection from the Soviet Union, seeking asylum at the British embassy, matches Korchnoi’s defection in 1976; and the Leonid Viigand character, who appears in the second act, has elements based on Karpov. The musical’s premiere in 1986 was met with disapproval in the Soviet Union, where the songs were banned for a long time. Thirty-four years later, in October 2020, the musical was performed in Russia for the first time. The 1,800-seat MDM Theatre in Moscow was sold out, and the show ran for two years. Rice told me it was quite special for him: “I was more excited about the Russian production than any other, really. In a way, the Russian character is more the central character than the American one. If it’s anybody’s story, it’s Anatoly’s story, or possibly Florence’s. But, who knows? I am not sure I know, and I wrote it!” Chess on the Big Screen Countless movies have included chess in one way or another, from a seemingly random prop in the background to a full-blown scene with dialogue, or anything in between. In a 2004 article in New in Chess magazine, David Edmonds and John Eidinow have pointed out that it has often served as a signaling system: “Chess has been used to create atmosphere and tone and to make instant narrative references to personality, temperament, and states of mind. Indeed, it is hard to think of any other pastime that would allow such a range of instant visual allusions and offer directors such certainty that they will be read appropriately by the general audience, no matter how fleeting the scene.” In many famous films, chess plays more than just a minor role. One of the earliest and possibly best examples is Ingmar Bergman’s classic The Seventh Seal, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and further cemented Bergman’s position as a world-class director. The story is set during the Black Death pandemic in the fourteenth century and follows a knight named Antonius Block and his squire, Jöns, who return from the Crusades to a plague-ridden Sweden. Block challenges Death to a chess game to delay his demise and seek answers about the meaning of life, while encountering various characters who represent different aspects of human existence and belief. Using chess, the film explores themes of existentialism, faith, and the search for meaning in the face of mortality. A still from Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, 1957, with Bengt Ekerot as Death, left, and Max von Sydow as the knight Antonius Block, right. In his 1971 book A Short History of the Movies, Gerald Mast noted that death is treated as a bitter and hopeless joke and added, “Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well and live is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the Church urges in Bergman’s metaphor.” I want to briefly mention four more movies based on fiction where I feel both the chess part and the plot were done well. In the 1992 thriller Knight Moves, directed by Carl Schenkel, a chess grandmaster played by Christopher Lambert is accused of several horrid murders. In the 2000 film The Luzhin Defence, based on Nabokov’s book and directed by Marleen Gorris, John Turturro plays Luzhin; Emily Watson, his wife. Pawn Sacrifice is a 2014 biographical drama film by Edward Zwick about Bobby Fischer (played by Tobey Maguire) and his fight against the Soviet chess players. And more recently, there was The Coldest Game (2019), with an alcoholic grandmaster (Bill Pullman) who becomes involved in espionage related to the Cuban missile crisis. There are also many chess-themed movies based on true stories that can be recommended to the readers of this book, such as Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), Life of a King (2013), The Dark Horse (2014), Queen of Katwe (2016), and Critical Thinking (2020). And, although it’s not a movie, the Canadian drama series Endgame (2011) features a former Russian chess champion (played by Shawn Doyle) who uses his chess prowess to solve criminal cases. In his 2005 book Chess in the Movies, Bob Basalla collected almost two thousand films and TV shows, described their “chessic content” and provided details on directors, languages, and awards, as well as the “correctness” of the actual chess played in the scenes—because, it seems that more often than not in cinema there are issues with the chessboard (placed wrongly, not having a dark square in the lower left corner) or the pieces (usually the king and queen placed on the wrong starting squares). Keeping in mind the multimillion-dollar budgets of some of these titles, it’s hard to believe that such basic mistakes can be found in famous films like The Great Escape (1963), Never Say Never Again (1983), The Da Vinci Code (2006), and even the all-time number one on the Internet Movie Database Top 100, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). For chess fanatics, such errors can be rather annoying, and it is telling that Basalla, in his book, works with a special, symbol-based index system to categorize which type of error is being made in a particular film. Yes, we take such things very seriously! I remember a story by Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree where he wrote about a chess shop that he walked by on holiday and saw a chess set wrongly set up in the window. The owner told him he had done it intentionally because more customers would come inside that way. As Ree noted, it’s similar to a newly painted door having a sign that reads “just paintted” (with the double t), so that people will pay more attention. A painter like that pays more attention to detail than your average Hollywood producer. Some chess scenes form a truly iconic part of large Hollywood productions. I have always loved the opening scene of the 1963 James Bond movie From Russia with Love, where we see a chess game being played in a stunningly beautiful hall (likely a museum) on a circular stage placed on a brown-blue checkered floor. It is the Venice International Grandmasters’ Championship’s match final between Kronsteen from Czechoslovakia and MacAdams from Canada. After Kronsteen takes MacAdams’s bishop with a check, a waiter serves him a glass of water. He reads through the bottom of the glass some text on the paper coaster that says: “You are required at once.” He dries his lips with the paper, tears it, and then, as MacAdams moves his king, Kronsteen gives a decisive check with his queen. MacAdams tilts his king over (something that happens all the time in Hollywood but rarely in the real world) and congratulates his opponent, who immediately walks away from the board. Kronsteen, SPECTRE’s key asset to fight Bond in this movie, must have been one hell of a player if he could finish a game of chess whenever he needed to. The film uses a real game, played between the Russian top grandmasters Boris Spassky and David Bronstein (surely no coincidence that it sounds so similar to Kronsteen!) from 1960. In that game it was Spassky who was victorious, with the same final moves, but in the movie two of White’s central pawns had been removed from the board. For a long time it was speculated that the director, Terence Young, felt they ruined the shot aesthetically. However, a 2002 BBC Radio 4 documentary revealed that the producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman wrongly assumed that chess games are copyrighted and wanted to avoid legal issues by making this small alteration. In any case, I’d like to believe that the scene was famous enough for director Sam Mendes to place Daniel Craig behind a chessboard in the 2015 Bond film Spectre, perhaps paying homage to From Russia with Love. The chess scene in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey is also highly symbolic. In what is one of the greatest and most influential science fiction movies ever made, we see Dr. Frank Poole, one of the pilots of the spacecraft Discovery One that is bound for Jupiter, playing chess with the onboard computer HAL 9000. Frank plays at a board with 2D pieces on a screen that resembles an iPad. He stands no chance against this computer from the future. After Frank agrees to the inevitable and throws in the towel, HAL says, “Thank you for a very enjoyable game.” Annoyingly, the computer is not only unbeatable, showing it is capable of the purest form of human intellect, but also human-like. We’ll look closely at chess and artificial intelligence in the second part of this book. That Kubrick used chess in this film was unsurprising: he was a lifelong chess lover. As a teenager, he could be seen playing in New York’s Central Park or Washington Square for money, or even at tournaments at the Marshall Chess Club in Greenwich Village. Kubrick also included chess scenes in his 1956 film The Killing and even in Lolita (1962), although those were not part of chess-lover Nabokov’s book. Kubrick was also known for sometimes playing chess in between directing scenes. As Adam Feinstein wrote in New in Chess magazine, during the filming of 2001, Kubrick played many games with the American physicist Jeremy Bernstein at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Bernstein remembered Kubrick as a real hustler: “Finally, we reached the 25th game, and it was agreed that this would decide the matter. Well into the game, he made a move that I was sure was a loser. He even clutched his stomach to show how upset he was. But it was a trap, and I was promptly clobbered. ‘You didn’t know I could act too,’ he remarked.” Among the many chess-loving Hollywood actors (such as Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Laurence Fishburne, Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, and Viola Davis, to name just a few), the most fanatical and perhaps best player was Humphrey Bogart. Before his acting career (and like Kubrick), Bogart hustled opponents for small money in New York parks and at Coney Island. Bogart has been a tournament director, was active in the California State Chess Association, and often visited Hollywood’s chess club. He even held the world-class grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky to a draw in a simultaneous display in 1952 in Beverly Hills. Chess aficionado Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, play chess at their California home, c. 1949. That Bogart can be seen in front of a chessboard in Casablanca (1942) is not a coincidence, even though it was not part of the original script. The Hungarian film Curtiz from 2018, based on the making of Casablanca by director Michael Curtiz, furnished an interesting explanation: Bogart didn’t know what to do with his hands in the scenes where he was sitting and talking, so he suggested using a chess set. He put up the position himself from a correspondence game he was involved in. Because Curtiz agreed, we find chess as part of one of the most famous movies ever. Chess and Music The French eighteenth-century genius François-André Danican Philidor (see pages 19 and 79) was not only the best chess player of his time but also a talented musician. He was considered among France’s leading opera composers, creating over twenty opéras comiques. The German composer Richard Strauss liked to play chess too, as did Dmitri Shostakovich. A story the Russian composer loved to tell later in his life relayed how he once played world champion Alexander Alekhine in the lobby of a Leningrad cinema. However, the best player among all classical composers was the Russian Sergei Prokofiev—“a first-rate chess player” who “played a very vigorous, forthright game,” according to former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. (If he said so, who are we to argue?) Prokofiev was also friends with another former world champion, José Capablanca, and even beat the great Cuban once, rather convincingly, in a simul. What does it say that some famous musicians were fond of chess? It may not be such a coincidence, Achilleas Zographos argued in his 2017 book Music and Chess. According to Zographos, chess is “an art in itself” and “strongly related to mathematics and music.” He points to the many similarities between chess and music: both are a universal language (making age, gender, race, or religion irrelevant) and a means of personal expression (musicians and chess players have styles of play); both are a performance art that is played; both have symbolic languages; and both rely on patterns (chunks of notes or moves). The great Italian composer Ennio Morricone—one of the absolute giants of twentieth-century cinema; the man behind famous film scores such as Sergio Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Brian DePalma’s The Untouchables, and Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight—had something to say about this topic as well. His career spanned more than six decades as a composer, orchestrator, conductor, and trumpet player. On top of all that, he was an avid chess fan and even played serious tournaments in the 1950s before his musical career took off. In the 2019 book From Ennio Morricone: In His Own Words, Alessandro De Rosa quoted Morricone about the links between music and chess: In time, I’ve discovered that strong links exist between chess and the musical notation system, set up as it is in durations and pitches. In chess, the two dimensions remain spatial, and time is what players have at their disposal in order to make the right move. In addition there are horizontal and vertical combinations, different graphic patterns, just like musical notes in harmony. Even still, one can pair patterns and plays as if they were instrumental parts in an orchestra. Morricone’s love for the game can also be seen in different examples of his chess-related compositions throughout the years. One of these is “Chess Game,” on the soundtrack of The Endless Game (Gioco senza fine), a TV miniseries from the late 1980s. Another is “Dance of the Chess Game,” also part of a TV miniseries from the same period, Secret of the Sahara (Il Segreto del Sahara). Morricone also composed the “Chess Players’ Anthem” (Inno degli scacchisti) for the 2006 Chess Olympiad in Turin. In 2007, after he had won the Academy Honorary Award, Morricone was asked on Italian TV if he would have liked anything more than that prize. His answer: “To be a grandmaster, like Kasparov.” Chess is not alien to pop music either, with numerous appearances in lyrics or visuals. The Wu-Tang Clan’s “spiritual head” GZA released the album Grandmasters in 2005, with songs referencing chess such as “Advanced Pawns,” “Unprotected Pieces” and “Smothered Mate.” Taylor Swift must have a certain fondness for the game as she references chess in several songs, such as “Dear John” (2010). Katy Perry’s 2015 Super Bowl half-time show featured spectacular chess choreography around her song “Dark Horse.” Beyoncé’s second visual album Black Is King (2020) featured a big chess motif, with her husband Jay-Z pressing a chess clock and Beyoncé herself as an all-powerful black queen. As we have seen, chess continues to be the most prominent game to feature both as an art form in itself and in the arts, literature, theater, cinema, music, and popular culture. There is one more very important part of society where chess plays an important role: that of science. As we will see in the next chapter, science has revealed much of the game of chess, while chess has contributed massively to science.",

      "content": "Chapter 3A Mutual Understanding: Chess and Science “Chess: Symbol of military tactics. All the great generals were good at it. Too serious as a game, too futile as a science.” —Gustave Flaubert, Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues, 1913 “Before I was born, my parents decided that I was going to be a genius.” With this intriguing sentence, Judit Polgár started her TED Talk in 2016. The most successful female chess player in the history of the game revealed the secret behind her brilliant career—one that would see her reach a level of play that no other woman has ever achieved. It’s a story of original thinking, determination, and love. Judit’s parents, László and Klára, were both teachers. Before they married in 1967, László shared his strong opinions with Klára about the Hungarian education system which, he felt, wasted talent due to a lack of focus. He wanted to teach their future children at home and, for each of them, focus on a single topic in which they could excel. “My mother initially thought he was crazy,” Judit later said, but Klára was impressed by László’s boundless energy and commitment and agreed to the marriage. The two read psychology books and immersed themselves in all the information they could find about prodigies and the early life of geniuses. And then they made their big decision: they embarked on a parenting experiment. Susan was born in 1969, followed by Sofia in 1974, and Judit in 1976. The three girls were homeschooled in different languages, math, and chess. László and Klára chose to focus on chess because it demands creative and intellectual capacities, while the results are easily measurable (more about that later). Soon, the unique upbringing of the girls meant a full-time job for their parents. In 1989, László explained his educational ideas in a small book titled Nevelj Zsenit! (Bring Up Genius!) It was his response to the famous nature-nurture debate: he considered talent not a hereditary trait but something you could teach to any child. In 1992 he told the Washington Post, “A genius is not born but is educated and trained.” Judit herself said chess is “80 percent hard work and 20 percent talent.” When I asked her in September 2023 to define talent, she thought briefly and said, “Talent is a tricky thing. Sometimes I feel it is kind of an attitude. It’s your personality. Many people want to be somebody different, but the people who are really doing good things dare to be themselves. I became exceptional in the chess world, but I was not exceptional. I created it to be. I mean, basically, I was doing something a lot on a daily basis, and the circumstances helped me.” In 1991, Judit became a grandmaster at the age of 15 years and four months, the youngest to ever achieve this feat at the time. In doing so she broke the record Bobby Fischer had held since 1958. While Sofia became an international master and Susan a strong grand-master (winning, for instance, the women’s world championship), Judit became the first and only woman to ever break into the world’s top ten in 1996. At her peak, in July 2005, she was ranked eighth in the world. The Polgár sisters at the 1988 Chess Olympiad in Thessaloniki, Greece. From left to right: Judit, Susan, and Sofia. László Polgár’s opinion that practice is (much) more important than talent is now generally accepted, but wasn’t at the time. He developed his ideas in a period when the study of expertise and the field of cognitive psychology were still in their infancy. Half a century later, we can see that chess has played a fundamental role in the development of these areas of science. It continues to do so, more than ever. Chess as a Toolbox for Science In the twenty-first century, chess-related scientific research has exploded. Between 1970 and 2007 Google Scholar lists 1,785 papers with chess in the title. In the period since: 3,400. Chess is booming, and chess research is too. It can be argued that chess has significantly impacted various branches of scientific thought, demonstrating incredible versatility and usefulness, and as a source of inspiration. As it is seen as the area closest to the game, let’s start with mathematics. The German mathematician and logician Ernst Zermelo was an avid chess player, and in 1913 he published his “Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels” (“On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of Chess”). It was the first paper on game theory. Zermelo introduced an important theorem that holds for any two-person non-chance game where players move alternately, have opposing interests, and access to “perfect information.” The latter means that both sides have complete knowledge of what is going on (as opposed to, for example, poker, where there’s both available and hidden information as the players are hiding their cards from the others). Zermelo attempted to mathematically formalize the concept of a winning position, noting that if a player is in a winning position, they can always force a win no matter what strategy the other player may employ. Zermelo’s work has contributed to various areas of mathematics and computer science. Chess has also been connected to language studies, beginning with the Swiss linguist, semiotician, and philosopher Ferdinand de Saussure. His Course in General Linguistics, published in 1916 and based on lectures he gave at the University of Geneva, is generally regarded as the starting point of structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the meaning of words is not fixed or independent but depends on how they relate to each other. However, even though individual words are arbitrary, the overall structure of language is not random but follows social conventions. Understanding how words work in a specific context involves looking at the rules and practices rather than just the history of individual words. To explain this, Saussure used a comparison to chess: “The respective value of the pieces depends on their position on the chessboard, just as each linguistic term derives its value from its opposition to all the other terms. The system is always momentary; it varies from one position to the next. It is also true that values depend above all else on an unchangeable convention, the set of rules that exists before a game begins and persists after each move.” In his Philosophical Investigations, published posthumously in 1953, the famous philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein reflected several times on chess. For instance, he compared linguistic expressions with chess pieces to explain that it is not enough to know the rules of a language to be able to recognize words and use them correctly: “When one shows someone the king in chess and says, ‘This is the king,’ this does not tell him the use of this piece—unless he already knows the rules of the game up to this last point: the shape of the king. You could imagine his having learned the rules of the game without ever having been shown an actual piece. The shape of the chessman corresponds here to the sound or shape of a word.” Later, he added, “But we talk about it as we do about pieces in chess when we are stating the rules of the game, not describing their physical properties. The question, ‘What is a word, really?’ is analogous to ‘What is a piece in chess?’ ” Chess and Psychology Aside from artificial intelligence, the scientific field that chess has had the most profound impact on is psychology. Chess has been used to study many aspects of the human mind, including perception, attention, memory, learning, creativity, thinking, and decision-making. The earliest recorded use of chess in psychological research dates from 1893. Alfred Binet, known for inventing the first practical IQ test, became fascinated by a particular aspect of chess that has mesmerized people for centuries: playing blindfold chess. Binet decided to do a study to test his hypothesis that chess masters were using a photographic kind of memory—an “inner mirror,” as he called it. Among his study participants was one of the world’s best players, Siegbert Tarrasch. The participants answered questions about what they were “seeing” during play, but their answers did not conform to Binet’s “inner mirror” idea. As it turned out, the players were not keeping complete positions sharply in their minds; what their internal memories stored were more like abstract patterns that they recognized, similar to musical chords or melodies. One of the participants, the French master Alphonse Goetz, said, “I grasp it as a musician grasps harmony in his orchestra.” Memory, it came to be understood, is only partly a visual concept; giving a meaningful context to the patterns and the impressions those patterns sparked help players remember positions. Binet concluded that it was “the multitude of suggestions and ideas emanating from a game which makes it interesting and establishes it in memory.” Binet’s study was the first in a long period of research in cognitive psychology that continues until this day, trying to answer fundamental questions like, “How do great chess players think?”; “How is that different from how amateurs think?” And, “What do these differences in chess thinking say about cognition in general?” Regarding the fascinating topic of blindfold chess, it’s important to stress that the ability to play a game of chess without looking at the board or the pieces is not as hard as it seems, nor is it limited to just a handful of brilliant minds. It is something any strong club player is capable of. I would compare it to playing a whole repertoire of études and nocturnes on the piano without needing the music in front of you, simply because you have practiced it for years. What is extraordinary, however, is the ability to play a blindfold simul. (This, in particular, was what inspired Binet to do his research.) When the great Philidor played two blindfold games at once in 1782, The World described it as “a phenomenon in the history of man” which “should be hoarded among the best samples of human memory, till memory shall be no more.” However, 150 years later, George Koltanowski played 34 blindfold games simultaneously. The current record stands at 48 games, played by the Uzbekistani American grandmaster Timur Gareyev in 2016 while wearing a blindfold mask and riding 80 kilometers (50 miles) on a spin bike. An engraving from 1794 depicts French composer and chess player François-André Danican Philidor, center, playing chess blindfolded, as members of the London Chess Club look on. It took several decades for another pioneer in the field to arrive on the scene—who, like Binet, was a remarkable scientist. I am talking about my fellow Dutchman, the internationally renowned psychologist (and chess master) Adriaan de Groot. De Groot suspected that grandmasters see more and calculate better than weaker players, and wanted to test his hypothesis. He convinced five of the eight participants of the international AVRO tournament in 1938 in the Netherlands to participate in some experiments. Still a student, de Groot was starting to collect data on what would become his now famous doctoral thesis from 1946, Het denken van den schaker, which in 1965 was translated into English and published as Thought and Choice in Chess. Apart from world-class grandmasters, de Groot worked with two other categories of players: experts and amateurs. He gave all of them two tasks. First, he asked the chess players to think aloud while looking at a position and choosing their next move, then recorded their verbal utterances. These “verbal protocols” were subjected to both a statistical and an interpretative analysis and yielded surprising results. Although grandmasters play better moves, their structural thinking isn’t much different from that of experts. For instance, they don’t see many more positions, and they don’t calculate much deeper. Allow me an intermezzo, because this brings me to the most frequently asked question for chess grandmasters by layman interviewers—a question which is utterly boring and completely misses the point: “How many moves can you think ahead?” The answer is: “It depends.” And usually the chess player doesn’t even bother trying to explain why. A century ago, someone gave arguably the best answer possible. The anecdote has appeared in different forms and has been attributed to many famous players. The version as told by Israel Albert Horowitz in 1946 in Chess Review, about a game from 1913, might be the most accurate: Apropos is the story of the game between the invincible Capablanca and Charles Jaffe, pride of the East Side. Capa forgot he was invincible: he lost. A reporter who was present asked the Cuban, “How far do you see ahead?” Capa replied impressively, “About ten moves.” Then the reporter went over to Jaffe: “How far do you see ahead?” Much to everyone’s surprise, the reply was, “Only one move.” This didn’t make sense. “How could a player who can see only one move ahead defeat another who can delve so deeply?” Here Jaffe explained: “I see only one move ahead, but always the best move.” An important difference between the grandmasters and the weaker players in de Groot’s experiment was that the strong players quickly discovered promising options, making their thought processes more efficient. The difference was so stark that, according to de Groot, a world champion had a better understanding of the positions after five seconds of looking at them than a strong amateur player after 15 minutes! De Groot concluded that superiority in chess must be related to how players look at positions—i.e., perception, and how that is linked to previous knowledge. That prompted him to devise a second task. This time, the players were confronted with several diagrams of chess positions and could only look at them briefly (two to 15 seconds). After each brief viewing session, the diagram was taken away, and the participants were asked to set up the position on a chessboard as precisely as possible. Grandmasters were clearly better at this task than experts and amateurs. In later research, de Groot and his PhD students discovered something that appears to be related to Binet’s findings: strong players quickly recognize patterns, groups of pieces, possible moves, or even sequences of moves. This allows them to remember positions without focusing on all the individual pieces and pawns. In the 1960s, de Groot further investigated this theory when he began measuring eye movements. Grandmasters spent more time looking at parts of the chessboard where groups of pieces were connected in a relevant way, and were more often fixated on the intersection of squares than weak players were. De Groot’s experiments in the 1930s, and his conclusions about knowledge, thinking skills, and perceptual-memory skills, formed the foundation for later research in the 1960s and beyond. The American research psychologist Christopher Chabris described him to me as a brilliant and groundbreaking researcher: “He was ahead of his time for the research methods he was using, the questions he was asking, and the kinds of conclusions he was coming to. It took decades for other people to do similar things.” Two more scientists have strongly impacted cognitive science with their chess-related research: William Chase and Herbert Simon. The two Carnegie Mellon psychologists offered valuable contributions in the areas of memory and problem-solving, which are still relevant in and outside the scope of chess. Building upon de Groot’s work, Chase and Simon were instrumental in the development of what is known as the chunking theory. Chunking, first mentioned in a 1956 paper by the American psychologist George Miller, is the process of connecting individual pieces of a set of information to create a meaningful whole that is easier to memorize. A clear example is the phone number 0603091943, which can be separated into 06 03 09 1943. The “06” signifies a mobile phone number (in the Netherlands) and forms a chunk almost automatically, while “03” and “09” can be remembered as March 9, and the last chunk clearly forms a year. Other examples of chunks are words created from single letters and sentences from words. Chase and Simon assumed that the long-term memory of chess players consists of chunks of chess information—again, somewhat similar to Binet’s patterns. Examples of such chunks are three pawns in front of a white king and rook in the third quadrant of the board (a typical situation after White has castled kingside) or an advanced white knight threatening a double attack on Black’s king and queenside rook. Chess chunks are familiar situations where a small number of pieces and pawns on a part of the board are somehow connected. The results of Chase and Simon’s research supported the hypothesis that strong players have stored many more such chunks—up to 50,000 in the case of a chess master—than an amateur player, allowing them to recognize more of them in new positions and remember these positions better. And because the chunks provide helpful information about what might be going on in the position, strong players can more easily pre-select moves to choose from. In other words, more knowledge and a better understanding of previous positions leads to more efficient reasoning in new positions. Together with the cognitive psychologist Fernand Gobet, Simon later refined the chunking theory into what is known as the template theory, which shows how high-level, schematic structures (templates) can evolve from perceptual chunks. In 1992, when the field of cognitive psychology was still relatively young, the American psychologist Neil Charness convincingly demonstrated that chess research had already impacted cognitive science and various areas of general psychology. Among other insights, studies using chess showed that acquiring knowledge is more important than age factors, and that problem-solving performance depends on skill, but not on age. In contrast, memory performance declines with age but increases with skill. The area in psychology that has probably experienced the most chess-related research is expertise. Why do some people become experts in their field and others don’t? Can anyone become a chess grandmaster, or a top musician or mathematician, for that matter? Is there such a thing as natural talent? Or is it all about getting those famed 10,000 hours of practice in? The “10,000-hour rule” stems from Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book Outliers. He gave several examples of how people became successful (including Bill Gates, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Bobby Fischer, and the Beatles) and claimed that achieving world-class expertise in any skill requires 10,000 hours of practice. Gladwell’s theory was based on a 1993 study led by the Swedish psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, who found that the best violinists had put significantly more hours into practicing their instrument from a young age than amateur or expert musicians. In a 2013 paper, Ericsson corrected what he saw as an oversimplification in Outliers. His most important point was that the best violinists had accumulated an average of over 10,000 hours by the age of 20, while Gladwell claimed they totaled 10,000 hours of practice. Ericsson further explained: “Our main point was that the best group of violinists had spent significantly more hours practicing than the two groups of less accomplished groups of expert violinists, and vastly more time than amateur musicians. There is nothing magical about exactly 10,000 hours.” The difference between total and average means a lot in practice, as was demonstrated in 2007 by psychology researchers Guillermo Campitelli and Fernand Gobet. After observing 104 competitive chess players of different skill levels, they concluded that to reach the level of a strong expert, about 11,000 hours of practice are needed on average. However, the range among their test subjects was striking: one player had needed only 3,000 hours to reach that level, while another required 23,000 hours. Others had spent more than 25,000 hours without getting as good. All of this suggests that practice is an important factor for success, but talent does play a role. The highest-rated player on the planet, Magnus Carlsen, became a grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 27 days—about five and a half years after starting to play chess. With a case like him, it’s hard not to believe in talent. I’d like to make one more important point about practice, for all you parents out there who are still eager for your child to put in those 10,000 hours. The 1993 study with musicians was not just about spending time on a particular skill; it concerned what Ericsson and his colleagues called deliberate practice, which is characterized by focused, systematic, and purposeful efforts to improve performance. In other words, both the quantity and the quality of practice lead to results. The good news is that nowadays it is easier than ever to practice chess meaningfully, thanks to the computer and the internet. Women and Chess: What Science Says Back in the 1970s when László and Klára Polgár decided to teach their children chess and demonstrate that practice trumps talent, some might have said it was a bummer that all three were girls. Because women can’t play chess, right? It’s a ludicrous question nowadays, but despite the first feminist wave in the late 1960s, much of the chess world agreed with this notion when Susan, Sofia, and Judit were born. The idea that only men are good at chess had been advocated by some big names, including Bobby Fischer, the Dutch grandmaster/writer Jan Hein Donner, and a young Garry Kasparov, who later corrected himself after suffering defeat at the hands of the youngest of the Polgár sisters. A decade after her retirement, Judit’s chess career is still unique. Only two other women have ever reached the world’s top 100: the former women’s world champions Maia Chiburdanidze (Georgia) and Hou Yifan (China). Neither of them made it into the top 50. The question of why so few women reach the absolute top is relevant to chess and other fields where women are underrepresented, such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. To explain and narrow the gender gap, chess can learn from science, and science can learn from chess. For starters, it’s essential to realize that the gender gap at the top is largely caused by underrepresentation. In January 2024 there were 440,390 chess players with an official FIDE rating (obtained in internationally rated tournaments), but only 47,435 of these were women—about 11 percent. In the highest segment, from strong club players to grandmasters, women count for just 6 percent. The higher the level of the players the further the women drop: roughly 1,800 players hold the grandmaster title, but only 42 women do—about 2.3 percent. Why is this? The world of statistics tells us that extreme values in a large sample are all the more probable than those in a small sample. This is explained by a thought experiment I borrowed from fellow Dutchman Wei Ji Ma, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at New York University. Take two groups, one consisting of ten people and the other of two people. All 12 people are given a random number between one and 100, and then we take the highest score in each group. If we repeat these steps many times, we will see that Group A will score 91.4 and Group B 67.2 on average. Because the larger group has more shots at a high score, it will get a higher score on average. Similarly, we can expect many more men at the top of the chess rankings than women because there are many more of them playing chess. A 2009 study led by psychologist Merim Bilalić used this argument to demonstrate that women are not underachieving but that their performance at the top is more or less what can be expected from statistics. The researchers looked at the more than 120,000 members of the German Chess Federation in April 2007, where only one in 16 members was a woman. The model used in the study predicted for 96 percent of the rating difference between the top 100 male and top 100 female players, meaning that those rating difference between genders closely followed the statistically expected difference. Subsequent research questioned the statistical approach of this study and argued that the participation rate only partly explains the observed differences between men and women. It’s not just a numbers game; there’s more to the story. What about the brain? The British grandmaster Nigel Short asked that question in a controversial column for New in Chess magazine in 2015. Short assumed that the difference in achievements between men and women in chess is most likely the result of differences between the male and female brains. He wrote: Men and women’s brains are hard-wired very differently, so why should they function in the same way? I don’t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than I do. Likewise, she doesn’t feel embarrassed in asking me to maneuver the car out of our narrow garage. One is not better than the other, we just have different skills. It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact. If anyone had something to say about the topic, it was Judit Polgár. As the strongest female chess player in the history of the game, she knew better than anyone what it’s like to compete against (and beat!) mostly male opponents. Responding to Short in TIME magazine, she said, “We are capable of the same fight as any other man, and I think during the decades that I actively played chess, I proved it as well. It’s not a matter of gender; it’s a matter of being smart.” Judit Polgár, the best female chess player of all time, in September 2021 at the Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. But, I hear some readers ask, don’t neuroscientists agree that the male and female brains are different and affected by separate hormones? Well, I have to point out two things here. First, this might be true, but no direct links with chess ability have ever been demonstrated convincingly. As Polgár pointed out in a tweet: “Men and women are different, but there are different ways of thinking and fighting [while] still achieving the same results.” Secondly, the neuroscientific research in this field is ongoing and inconclusive. Even a (substantial) distinction between male and female brains is under debate. In 2015, a team led by neuroscientist Daphna Joel from Tel Aviv University did a comprehensive study of over 1,400 brain scans from four different labs. The wide range of variability between each brain led them to conclude that we should “shift from thinking of brains as falling into two classes, one typical of males and the other typical of females, to appreciating the variability of the human brain mosaic.” That being successful in chess isn’t related to biology is perhaps easier to accept when you realize that domain knowledge (expertise obtained by encountering thousands of chess patterns and motifs) is one of the most consistent predictors of chess skill. The two-time US champion Jennifer Shahade wrote in her 2022 book Chess Queens: “Learning the rules of chess takes a few hours, but gaining competence in its intricacies and developing a personal style takes years of work. Playing a highly focused board game for four to six hours is difficult, and neither men nor women nor non-binary players are born with the concentration and motivation to excel at it. For that reason, I find the emphasis on women’s biological inferiority absurd: when it comes to chess, we are all born inept.” In an interesting paper published in 2008, researchers from the University of Padova argued that gender stereotypes are partly responsible for the underperformance of women in chess. They had 42 male–female pairs, all Italian and matched for ability, playing games online. When players were unaware of the sex of their opponent, the women played approximately as well as the men, as could be expected from their similar chess strength. However, when women knew they were playing against a male opponent, they showed a drastic performance drop. Also, when they (falsely) believed they were playing against a woman, they performed as well as their male opponents. The researchers concluded: “This small-scale pilot study suggests that gender stereotypes are very pronounced in the chess world and that both male and female players are perfectly aware of these stereotypes.” In 2020 a research team led by Australian chess grandmaster and researcher David Smerdon replicated these results in an analysis of over eight million tournament games played by over 180,000 players. They concluded that women perform statistically worse than expected when playing against men, with this stereotype threat being “especially large when games are played under tight (rapid or blitz) time constraints.” The latest news on this topic comes from the Dutch scientist Remy Rikers. In a 2022 study, he mentioned the term reversed stereotype threat. Rikers found that the influence of a negative stereotype of women’s ability to play chess is not only limited to their level of performance but that it also has an effect on their opponent’s performance. He had a hundred players play games online, unsure whether they were facing a man or a woman. Ultimately, the study participants were unaware they played neither: their opponent was always a computer. However, sometimes they would see a male nickname and sometimes a female one. The results showed that participants who played against a female nickname played less well, lost more games, and made more mistakes and blunders than participants who played against a male nickname. One way to explain the low female participation in chess is to look at similar fields in society. For instance, women are also underrepresented in careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which are considered to require cognitive abilities similar to chess. In 2017, Ming-Te Wang and Jessica Degol of the University of Pittsburgh reviewed research from the fields of psychology, sociology, economics, and education over the preceding 30 years. They summarized six empirically supported explanations for US women’s underrepresentation in math-intensive STEM fields, and noted a complicated interaction between them. Their conclusions seem to be quite relevant to the chess world. Wang and Degol first mentioned cognitive ability but noted that it had only little effect. On average, girls hardly did worse than boys in math. Boys outperformed them in spatial relations tests involving mental rotation tasks, but only slightly, while girls did somewhat better in verbal tasks. Relative cognitive strengths played a more significant role in future career choices. Among the best math students, girls were more likely to also possess high verbal ability, while boys were more likely to demonstrate higher math relative to verbal ability. As a result, young women often have a greater variety of career options with less of a necessity to focus on a single strength. The third reason Wang and Degol presented for the gender gap concerned women tending to have different career interests or preferences, sometimes explained by the short notion that “males prefer working with objects whereas females prefer working with other people.” These differences can reach back as far as early adolescence. Another factor involved lifestyle values or work–family balance preferences, where women, especially when planning to have children, were more willing than men to make occupational sacrifices for the sake of their families and didn’t like work-centered lifestyles as much as men. Field-specific ability beliefs could be a factor as well. The American psychologist Carol S. Dweck noticed in 2007 that when girls were told about the “innate ability” and “natural talent” of math geniuses, after that they would perform significantly worse on a geometry task than girls who were told the math geniuses were hard workers. Based on this, Wang and Degol noted that women might be avoiding STEM careers because they wrongly assume two things: that innate intelligence is required and that they are lacking this. The final explanation for female underrepresentation was discussed earlier: gender-related stereotypes and biases. The researchers noted that while overt (intentional) and hostile forms of gender discrimination were occurring less frequently than some decades ago, covert (more subtle) and benevolent (overly affective) forms of discrimination still happen all the time and no doubt affect women’s career choices. We can try to explain the gender gap in chess in another way. The percentage of female (to male) players varies quite a bit across different countries—but figuring out why might reveal something about the reasons behind the female minority in chess in the first place. In an article written in 2019 on his website, David Smerdon attempted just that. Interestingly, the numbers go against intuition completely. It would be fair to assume that in countries with less gender equality, female participation in chess would be smaller, right? As Smerdon put it: “In more conservative countries, one might expect that a girl would be encouraged to get married and stay at home with the kids, rather than play rated tournaments. In poorer countries, a family might not be able to afford to send all of the children to chess lessons, and so the girls might miss out.” However, in practice, it’s not like that at all. Countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, which are among the top-ranked in the United Nations Development Program’s annual rankings of gender equality, have the lowest percentage of women chess players (about 5 percent). Meanwhile, countries with much lower gender equality—such as Georgia, China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and the UAE—all have percentages above 25. So, the more gender-equal a country, the fewer females play chess. But why? One possible explanation for the small minority of women engaged in STEM fields is that women are more likely to have a variety of interests. While that was linked to relative cognitive ability before, it turns out this is also the case for their status in society: researchers have observed that the more women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences. But it would be too simple to state that women don’t like chess as much as men. Smerdon suggests that more women might play chess in gender-unequal countries “because it’s one of the few fields where they can both compete with men and be sure that the result is judged objectively and without discrimination (as opposed to, say, promotions in the workplace).” The economist Maryam Dilmaghani signaled in 2021 that a legacy of a command economy, where major economic decisions are made by the government (such as in the former Soviet Union), was the most significant predictor of a smaller gender gap in competitive chess across countries. Apart from the general popularity and governmental support for chess in formerly communist countries, a possible explanation for this smaller gap was that women participated as much as men in the labor force, taking jobs traditionally seen as male in the West, which perhaps made it easier for them to navigate the male-dominated chess world. Another difference in gender is something that anyone can easily detect by looking at youth chess across the world. At a young age—say, eight to ten years—the overrepresentation of boys in chess classes is not as significant as in older age groups, but more girls than boys stop playing chess at some point. Why is this happening? I believe it is a combination of girls starting as a minority in the first place (boys get introduced to chess more often than girls) and then also finding themselves in a somewhat hostile environment where boys tend to dominate the space and blurt out answers. In contrast, many girls turn silent in a group where the boys have a majority. Although chess-playing girls tend to be part of a social group with other girls during their school years, such comfort usually disappears upon finishing high school and joining a chess club, which means entering an environment with very few girls or women to interact with. This was reflected in a somewhat forgotten paper from 2002 by researcher Ingrid Galitis. She tried to discover how boys came to dominate her primary school’s chess club in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Interviews with 18 girls aged seven to 12 revealed the perception of hostility from boys and an aversion to the boys’ aggressive attitudes. Also, girls tended to talk much more freely when they were among girls only. Other factors related to dropping out included whether girls had family members or friends involved in chess and a lack of attention given to them by tutors. A paper from October 2023, co-written by Jennifer Shahade, revealed another reason girls might drop out of chess more than boys—one we have seen when discussing STEM careers. The research pointed out that parents and mentors often believe girls have a lower potential in chess than boys. This bias is more pronounced among those who think chess success requires brilliance. “It is striking that even the parents and coaches who have a vested interest in girls’ success hold biases against them and may also have some blind spots about the barriers to girls’ success,” said Andrei Cimpian, the paper’s senior author. To coaches and parents who are reading this: you need to believe in girls, because your attitude might hinder them from succeeding if you don’t. In an article for Slate.com from December 2020, Wei Ji Ma mentioned social, cultural, and economic factors that explain why all top chess players are men. It is one of the best pieces ever written about this topic. I quote Ma as he sums up many good reasons why women are underperforming: Top female players are often relegated to women-only invitational tournaments, most likely limiting their ability to increase their ranking. It is possible that national federations invest less in top female players than in their male counterparts, for example, in terms of training or finding sponsors. It’s much easier for male players to make a living from chess. Among top players with children, women might be more burdened with child-care duties than men and therefore have less time to play in and prepare for tournaments. Top female players might fall victim to stereotype threat (where a member of a negatively stereotyped group underperforms due to the pressure or anxiety induced by the stereotype), which indeed seems to manifest itself in the results of chess games. It is also likely that top female chess players face a particularly hostile environment, leading them to drop out in higher proportions than lower-ranked women. The chess world was rather slow in responding to the #MeToo movement, but when several cases of sexual assault came to light in 2023, they showed that Ma’s last point was spot on. Like everywhere else in society, we need to work harder to make chess safer for all genders. That includes transgender people, who have their own battles to fight. As of August 2023, FIDE decided that transgender women cannot compete in its official events for women until its officials make an assessment of the gender change. While some top women players approved of this measure, the French transwoman chess player and coach Yosha Iglesias was baffled. She wrote on X: “The new regulations will make trans chess players all over the world face a horrible dilemma: transition or quit chess”—adding that for trans players and especially women “it will do so much unnecessary harm.” Regarding the attempts to increase the participation and improve the atmosphere for women, there are signs that systemic changes might be happening. A promising new initiative is the Women in Chess Foundation, launched in the fall of 2023. More good news came from FIDE in November 2023 when it published its first Gender Equality in Chess Index, an innovative instrument designed to measure and compare the level of gender equality in chess federations across the globe. I have high hopes for research being conducted under the supervision of Jeroen Struben, Associate Professor of Strategy and Organization at the Emlyon Business School in Lyon, France. Struben, a specialist in systems thinking, examines gender segregation dynamics resulting from interactions between a variety of factors. He looks at how players decide to start with chess in the first place, their decisions about commitment to improving, gameplay, dropout, performance, and influences from peers, role models, and the broader community. He has compiled a dataset of over 40,000 members of the Dutch Chess Federation between 1994 and 2018 and combined it with elite-player interviews, an integrative literature review, and computation and simulation. Whereas scientific research usually focuses on a single aspect, Struben believes system thinking is crucial in areas like sustainability and gender. “Because research has shown that many factors play a role, you cannot isolate one since their interaction could be very important,” he said. “By looking at them together, we can figure out why, despite well-intended efforts, little progress has been made, and, secondly, we can conclude that some factors are of little importance individually but become important together, which can help [us] to come up with strategies that act following the whole system.” When I spoke to Struben in November 2023, he could share some initial conclusions. His model showed that peer influence and role models have a measurable relationship with dropout rates and effort. Also, no single factor is dominant in the gender differences in chess, so we must look deeper into how their inter-dependency works. The ultimate goal is to help the Dutch Chess Federation, and, hopefully, other federations, to develop a long-term policy toward more inclusion and integration in the chess world. For Struben, the next step will be to use his insights as a starting point for research in STEM areas. Elo Ratings, Databases, Engines: A Researcher’s Gold Mine As a closed environment that requires solving complex tasks, chess facilitates the design of experiments that specifically address theoretical questions. The researcher Roy Roring explained it perfectly: “Finding the best move in a chess position is a highly complex, real-world human activity, and each chess position represents a well-defined problem environment, with a fixed number of identifiable moves that can be played at any given point—perfect for studying search processes and problem-solving.” There are three more technical reasons chess lends itself well to scientific research: Elo ratings, databases, and engines. The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players. Developed by the Hungarian American physics professor Arpad Elo, the system assigns numerical ratings to players based on game performance. Players gain or lose points depending on the outcome of games, and this gain or loss is higher if the rating difference with their opponent is bigger. The system has been used since 1960 in the US and since 1970 internationally. Beginners have ratings of around 500 to 800, novices around 1100, and average players around 1500. We tend to call players above 2000 experts. An international master normally is between 2400 and 2500. An international grandmaster usually has a rating above 2500. In January 2024, 36 players were rated over 2700. “The Elo system is one of the reasons why, early on, chess was very useful for expertise research in particular,” research psychologist Christopher Chabris told me. “You could objectively identify who was an expert and even finer gradations of expert versus novice. You could identify the exact skill difference between two people. You can’t do that with anything else than the Elo system, and it’s a huge benefit. Even having a consensus on who are the experts and who are the novices, and how far apart they are in their actual ability to succeed in the task, doesn’t exist in law, it doesn’t exist in medicine or other areas.” Using chess ratings has become particularly useful in science since around 2006 when FIDE computerized all official ratings data gathered since their inaugural 1970 list. This means there is now a consistent database for the last half-century, and the rating progress of thousands of players can be tracked over years and sometimes decades. With such a well-organized, objective, and complete dataset, one advantage for researchers is that they don’t need to worry about sampling bias, which is when a sample selected for a study does not represent the broader population it intends to represent. Another type of chess database provides a second tool for the researcher: one that forms a structured collection of games that have been recorded and stored electronically. Such databases are used by both chess players and researchers to study and analyze games, track historical trends, and improve their understanding of the game. Chess databases typically include a wide range of games played by various players at different skill levels, from early historical events until present-day tournaments. With a software program, a search can filter out games based on all kinds of data, including the players’ names, the date the game was played, the event, the result, the opening played, or even specific positions. Since 1987, the Hamburg-based company ChessBase has been selling the leading chess database software bearing the same name. It was originally developed with the help of none other than Garry Kasparov, who commented about a prototype he had seen a year earlier: “This is the most important development in chess study since Gutenberg.” Decades later, it is also an important development for broader study. “These databases present a gold mine for researchers interested in various topics in psychology,” wrote the research psychologists Nemanja Vaci and Merim Bilalić in 2017. “Similarly to those in other fields, chess databases offer the possibilities of applying data-mining and modeling approaches on large datasets and of investigating a number of cognitive effects.” The pair noted that chess databases can be used “to tackle topics such as skill development over the lifetime, birth cohort effects, effects of activity and inactivity on chess play, and even gender differences.” Databases of over-the-board games have existed since the late 1980s and can include millions of games. The website Lichess allows users to download its complete database of all games played on the site since 2013. In January 2024, that consisted of an incredible 7.9 billion games. Because researchers have become much better at analyzing big data, sometimes helped by artificial intelligence, such online databases have become invaluable. The third handy research tool is an aspect of the modern chess world I will elaborate on later in the book: chess engines. These are basically computer programs that can play chess, but they can also analyze already-played games, which is particularly interesting for the scientist, as David Smerdon explained to me. Apart from looking at game results, we can now look at individual chess moves. It is as if, apart from the final scores, we can now also analyze the quality of passes, assists, and shots on goal to objectively evaluate the performance of soccer teams. In the past, we could only analyze performance at the game level, and the performance scores were also not independent of what the opponent was doing. From a statistical point of view, we can’t treat the performances of both players in a game as independent observations, so we end up throwing away a lot of data. Being able to analyze the quality of individual moves with engines improves both the quantity and the quality of research. First of all, the data size increases a lot because instead of looking at each game that you play as one data point, we’re looking at each move by each player as a data point. By treating each move as an independent decision problem, we end up with roughly 80 times more data. Secondly, the evaluation by the engine gives us an objective benchmark for the best move, which means we can get a reliable, independent measure of cognitive performance. The first time a chess engine was used for scientific research was probably in 1999 in Christopher Chabris’s doctoral dissertation, Cognitive and Neuropsychological Mechanisms of Expertise: Studies with Chess Masters. He analyzed 1,188 chess games with the help of the German program Fritz 5 to demonstrate in a reasonably objective manner that when players had additional time to think ahead, the quality of their decisions improved significantly. This might sound logical but was contrary to a theory that existed at the time, which held that pattern-recognition processes (which require little time on the clock) played a dominant role in top-level chess expertise. Voilà! Now we understand why there’s been such a boom in chess-related research over the last ten to 15 years: thanks to the Elo rating system, databases, and engines, many cognitive scientists and people interested in cognitive performance from different disciplines (such as economics, psychology, or computer science, including some high-profile researchers from Ivy League universities) suddenly became interested and started publishing papers using these tools. An excellent example of how all these chess tools combined can be used to study real-world phenomena was supplied by Smerdon himself. In a 2022 paper, he looked at the effect of face masks on cognitive performance. Two years after the COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020, 178 of 186 researched countries required facial coverings to be worn in some or all public spaces, workplaces, and educational settings. Little was known about the impact of masks on cognitive performance. Smerdon jumped on it. Using chess databases, he collected data from over 70 chess tournaments with mask requirements held during the pandemic. He matched those to an approximate figure of 140 tournaments staged without mask requirements but with a considerable overlap of the same players. He used a chess engine to analyze almost three million chess moves played by more than 8,000 people in 18 countries. His study showed that wearing a face mask during a chess game decreased the quality of chess players’ decisions—an effect that was relatively short-lived—and mostly hurt stronger players. While mask-wearing negatively impacted chess performance, the effect subsided after four to six hours of playing. “The decrease in performance was due to the annoyance caused by the masks rather than a physiological mechanism, but people adapted to the distraction over time,” Smerdon said. “The results suggest that the effect of masks may depend on the type of task, the duration of the task and the working memory load. This is something to keep in mind for occupations in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as well as other professions that demand a high level of working memory such as language interpreters, performers, waiters, and teachers.” The Benefits of Chess On Wednesday, February 11, 2015, something happened that the Spanish journalist Leontxo García called “the Spanish Miracle.” García has covered chess since the early 1980s. He is also a passionate promoter of the game, and, throughout his career, has supported the idea that teaching chess in schools is beneficial for children. On that winter Wednesday in 2015, the Spanish parliament agreed with him. “I was tempted to call the Vatican to report a miracle,” he told me, “because, in Spain, to get all parties with no exception agreeing on anything is a miracle, and it happened that day.” In a unanimous vote, the Education and Sports Commission of the Congress of Deputies recommended using chess as an educational tool in the curriculum. “It had to be a recommendation; it could not be compulsory because, in Spain, except for the major ones, the education competencies are transferred to the regional governments,” explained García. “But in the following three years, ten out of 17 regions introduced chess into the curriculum, and, after the pandemic, at least two or three more are thinking about it.” He estimates that over a million Spanish children are now connected to chess in their schools in one way or another. Almost a decade later, chess-related educational programs can be found across the globe, following the example of countries with an even longer tradition in the game, such as Armenia, Georgia, and Russia. Even in England, where chess is not officially recognized as a sport, the game was given a massive boost in the summer of 2023 when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced almost £1 million ($1.27 million) in funding to support the English Chess Federation, to promote chess in British schools and to install a hundred tables in public parks. When Sunak visited a school in Washington, DC, he said he was trying to get British children to play more chess, describing it as “good for you.” In general, chess is believed to be beneficial to educational development, and why wouldn’t it be? There are so many different types of skills and competencies needed for chess that are useful elsewhere in life: collaboration, communication, strategic thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, deduction, anticipation, concentration, clever use of resources, preparation, learning from mistakes, and even the concept of fair play. The benefits of chess are, however, the topic of an ongoing scientific debate. Research has shown that, like musicians, chess players are, on average, slightly more intelligent than the general population. This, however, doesn’t automatically mean that chess makes you smarter. People with a higher IQ may like chess (or music) more than others and choose to indulge in the game more often. This effect is known as self-selection. The question is whether certain qualities necessary for chess or music can transfer to other areas; chess as basis for developing intelligence. Scientists use the term transfer of learning, and distinguish between “near transfer” (the transfer between closely related domains—e.g., knowledge of Latin transfers to other languages) and “far transfer”(the transfer between domains that are only loosely related—e.g., Latin and geography). If chess could make kids better at mathematics, this would be a clear case of far transfer. Some research has pointed to the positive effects of chess teaching on math test results. At the same time, there are papers that fail to demonstrate a link. Which study to believe? In 2017, Giovanni Sala and Fernand Gobet of the University of Liverpool decided to look at 24 existing studies regarding the potential benefits of chess for children concerning mathematics, reading, and cognitive skills. Sala and Gobet’s meta-analysis showed small positive effects “with chess enhancing primary and middle-school students’ achievement in mathematics and overall cognitive ability.” However, the overall effect size was “not large enough to convincingly establish the effectiveness of chess instruction in enhancing the skills [under] consideration,” according to the researchers. They also pointed out a major problem in the existing research on the effectiveness of chess instruction: “Almost none of the reviewed studies compared chess-treated groups with active control groups to rule out possible placebo effects.” A 2022 paper by the Spanish research psychologist Angel Blanch noted similar issues with the existing research. He looked at 45 studies in 19 countries targeting cognitive ability and academic performance and noted that most had theoretical and methodological drawbacks. Only 16 percent of the studies had a robust research design with large enough sample sizes or more sophisticated data-analysis approaches. These studies tended to report lower or null effects, causing “reasonable concerns over the evidence about the benefits of chess instruction.” All in all, we have to conclude that the data doesn’t demonstrate proof that chess makes you smarter. But does this mean we should stop teaching chess at schools? Maybe not. Despite his “reasonable concerns,” Blanch ended his paper as follows: Nonetheless, chess seems … an interesting activity to teach in school contexts. Chess is an ancient universal game, an intellectually related activity that is part of human cultural heritage, and that comprises a considerable body of specialized knowledge. It is easy to implement, it is relatively cheap, and it is appealing to both children and adults because of its playing and competitive nature.… Perhaps it is not necessary to justify the need of teaching chess in the classrooms because of being beneficial for intelligence and academic performance. What is needed ultimately is the undertaking of higher quality studies about the benefits of chess for other kinds of simpler outcomes that may be relevant for education. As Blanch intimated, chess may not directly boost cognitive abilities but it may indirectly benefit academic achievement by enhancing skills such as concentration, risk-taking, and patience—something backed up by an Australian study published in 2020 on the effects of chess instruction to grade-five students on academic and non-cognitive outcomes. The research took place in 2016 in 16 rural primary schools in Bangladesh, where the children did not have previous experience playing chess, so the impact of the lessons might have been higher than in previous research. The main finding of the Bangladesh study was that, almost a year after the chess training had ended, it had reduced the level of risk aversion among the children. At the end of that period, nine out of ten students were still playing and reached a level where taking risks had become a regular aspect of their games. There were also signs of a slightly better performance in math and a higher level of patience than in the control group that did not partake in chess lessons, but those results were not statistically significant. Other indirect academic benefits were shown in a Danish paper from 2017. Chess was taught in five schools in Aarhus, the second-largest city in Denmark, to 482 children (grades one to three). About two-thirds had one of their four weekly mathematics lectures replaced with chess instruction; the other third was the control group. The results indicated moderate positive effects on the math skills of the pupils involved in chess. The most interesting conclusion was that these positive effects almost exclusively impacted children who were not very happy at school and those who were occasionally or always bored. Obtaining mathematical concepts through chess could be a more engaging way to deliver teaching. As we have seen, teachers skeptical about including chess lessons in the curriculum can claim their doubts are scientifically justified. The goal, however, doesn’t need to be that children learn chess. It is also possible to use chess to teach children whatever they need to know at school. This has been demonstrated in Hungary for over a decade with the “Chess Palace” program, developed by the Judit Polgár Chess Foundation for Educational Benefits. Since 2013, Chess Palace has been part of the national curriculum of Hungarian elementary schools. A decade on, it is used in over a thousand schools, with over 4,000 teachers teaching 50,000 children annually. The material, intended for children aged 4–10 years, is unique because it goes beyond the regular borders of chess teaching. The chess-themed program teaches children areas like mathematics, science, arts and crafts, foreign languages, reading, and writing, thus demonstrating the incredible versatility of the game. Judit Polgár, here with Magnus Carlsen at a primary school in Stavanger, Norway, in 2019, dedicates a lot of her time to chess education. When I spoke to Leontxo García in September 2023, we discussed science’s failure to back up claims about the beneficial nature of chess. He wasn’t discouraged. “I have talked to more than 200 neurologists during my career,” he said. “There is no doubt. Of course, chess is not the only thing you can do, but it is one of the best, for sure. Nobody is questioning that, as far as I know.” The benefits of chess don’t need to be limited to general educational purposes either. Growing research is focusing on specific groups, such as children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A review article from 2023 that looked at four studies published in medical journals concluded that “chess has positive effects on ADHD symptoms and their severity” and recommended chess be “included for the management of ADHD patients as a complementary therapy.” Chess may also benefit the elderly, preventing or delaying the onset of dementia. This field of research has existed a bit longer. In a 2019 review article that looked at 21 studies, a group of researchers from Spain concluded that “even though the evidence is weak to demonstrate its role as a protective factor, other evidence indirectly related to chess and based on its cognitive stimulating functions suggest it may work as a protective factor.” On a final note, which once again shows the versatility of chess, I will mention the positive impact a chess program had on an unexpected group: prisoners. In 2012, Sheriff Thomas Dart and coach/organizer Mikhail Korenman started a “chess in jail” program in Cook County, Illinois, that involved chess classes for inmates. “Chess is more than an entertaining pastime,” Dart said in 2020. “The game teaches its players valuable life lessons. It requires critical thinking to consider the risks and rewards of their decisions, which are valuable skills that help foster a reduction in violent behavior.” When I visited the London Chess Conference in March 2023, Korenman presented some results after a decade of running the project with about 3,000 inmates. An important conclusion was that spending time with chess had a positive effect on bringing down the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among those participants who had been involved in the program for more than six months. There were also lower levels of inmate fights, uses of force, batteries to staff, and recidivism among the chess participants compared with a control group that did not join the program. In their landmark 1973 article “Skill in Chess,” Herbert Simon and William Chase were the first to make the now famous comparison between chess and the fruit fly in print. This comparison suggests that both chess and the common fruit fly (Latin name: Drosophila melanogaster) are simple and widely known tools for experiments that can be effectively used to gain valuable insights into more complex systems. While the fruit fly has played a key role in bio-medical research, revealing fundamental principles of genetics and development and illuminating human health and disease, chess has played a similar role in other areas of scientific research. As we have seen in this chapter, chess has indeed been a perfect model and an incredibly versatile tool for cognitive psychologists, in particular, but also other kinds of scientists. In the second part of this book, we will see that this analogy worked even better for chess and artificial intelligence—where the comparison was made first. But first, we’ll learn which players have left the biggest mark on chess, thus shaping the cultural meaning of the game in their stead. I’ll also try to answer the impossible but ever-entertaining question: who was the greatest of all?",

      "content": "Chapter 4Brilliance at the Board: The Biggest Stars in Chess “Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see.” —Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation (Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung), vol. 2, 1844 It is March 9, 2014, the day Bobby Fischer would have celebrated his 71st birthday. As we make the 60-kilometer (37-mile) ride from Reykjavík to Selfoss, snow is falling and the road is slippery. Garry Kasparov, however, is determined to continue the drive. The 13th World Chess Champion will be visiting Fischer’s grave, carefully planned on this day, at the small Christian cemetery of Laugardælir church in Selfoss. Dressed appropriately, with dark trousers, a warm black coat, and a dark gray hat to protect him from Iceland’s cold breeze and snow, Kasparov gets out of the car and walks toward the small graveyard, leaving deep footsteps in the thick snow. He takes off his hat and waits respectfully for a moment, at a distance of a few meters, before walking closer to the marble tombstone that says: ROBERT JAMES FISCHER F. 9. MARS 1943 D. 17. JANÚAR 2008 It is a historic moment for chess. The two giants of the game had never met, yet never were they so close. I was honored to be present that day, to witness a unique and touching synergy between two of my biggest heroes. Few players have meant as much for chess as Fischer and Kasparov—until Magnus Carlsen arrived. All three influenced the game’s cultural development enormously, and are also considered the three best players in history. This chapter is about them, what they have in common, and which of them was the Greatest of All Time (GOAT). The Lone American Warrior Robert James Fischer was born in Chicago on March 9, 1943. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was still legally married to a man named Hans Gerhardt Fischer. He was named the father on Bobby’s birth certificate despite never entering the US. Most likely, the real father of the future world champion was the Hungarian mechanical engineer Paul Neményi, who became friendly with Regina in Colorado in 1942 and sent her money regularly after Bobby was born. In any case, Bobby grew up without a father. In 1949, the family moved to Manhattan and a year later to Brooklyn. Soon after Bobby’s sixth birthday, his sister, Joan, bought a $1 plastic chess set at a candy store. It didn’t take long before Bobby beat both her and his mother. After that, he started playing games against himself. In an interview many years later, he quipped, “I usually won.” Bobby soon started frequenting the Brooklyn Chess Club, while a man named Carmine Nigro began to give him lessons at his home on Saturdays. He would also take him to Washington Square Park’s open-air tables in Greenwich Village. Fischer would later say that meeting Nigro was “probably a decisive factor in my going ahead with chess.” Bobby was 12 when he joined the prestigious Manhattan Chess Club, and, about a year later, met with the chess master Jack Collins, who took over the role of trainer/mentor from Nigro. Bobby played thousands of blitz games with many strong players, read the chess books on Collins’s bookshelves, and often stayed for dinner. Bobby was eating, sleeping, and dreaming chess. A young Bobby Fischer, c. 1957. It took a few years before his breakthrough came, but after that his rise to the top was faster than anyone before him. In 1956, he first won a tournament at the Manhattan club and then the US Junior Chess Championship, something that had never been achieved by a 13-year-old. And then, in October of that year, he did something that catapulted his name into fame all over the United States and abroad. At the Rosenwald Memorial, held in the Marshall Chess Club, it was his round-seven game against Donald Byrne that left a deep impression (see annotated game on pages 384–85). With tactical wizardry that included a queen sacrifice, he won in beautiful style. Hans Kmoch, the arbiter at the tournament, called it the “Game of the Century” and wrote, “A stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies.” Some of America’s strongest grandmasters played in the Rosenwald Memorial, and Bobby lost more games than he won. He bridged that gap just 14 months later when he unexpectedly won his first “adult” US championship in 1957–58 without losing a single game, two months before his 15th birthday. Fischer was nothing less than a sensation. With his first-place finish he qualified for the upcoming Interzonal tournament in Portorož, then part of Yugoslavia, in August 1958. It was his first step into the world championship cycle. The top six players at the Interzonal would qualify for the 1959 Candidates Tournament, where the winner would play the world champion. All very nice, but a 15-year-old boy wasn’t going to be among the top six finishers, was he? Well … scoring 12 points from 20 games, Bobby tied for fifth–sixth place and just made it! An incredible achievement about which the Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh wrote, “In Fischer’s play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition, one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess.” Thanks to his result in Portorož, Fischer became the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, six months, and one day—a record that would only be broken three decades later by Judit Polgár. Fischer also became the youngest person to qualify for the Candidates, a record only broken in 2007 by Magnus Carlsen (using a different qualifying system). The 1959 Candidates Tournament in Yugoslavia was too strong for Fischer, but a worthwhile experience. Three years later Fischer again qualified for the Candidates Tournament, held in May 1962 in Curaçao. The now 19-year-old Fischer finished in fourth place among eight participants. After-ward, in an article in Sports Illustrated, he accused the Soviet players of drawing their mutual games quickly, saving energy for their other games, and even helping each other during play. He would remain suspicious of the Russians for the rest of his career. Substantial proof of collusion does not exist, but Viktor Korchnoi, one of the Soviet participants, confirmed Fischer’s suspicions in his 1977 memoir Chess Is My Life. How many times can a player do something unique? Fischer found a new way (and not for the last time) when he played his sixth US championship, the 1963–64 edition, and won all 11 games against top opposition. By now it was clear Fischer was by far the best player in his country, and he made the point rather perspicuously. In tournaments like these, Fischer established his lasting influence on chess as someone who always played to win, even with the black pieces—something we would also see with Kasparov and Carlsen. Since 2009, a $64,000 Fischer Memorial Prize has been at stake for anyone who can sweep the field at America’s national championship, but it hasn’t happened yet. After beating everyone at home, six years later Fischer would start doing the same internationally. The years between 1970 and 1972 bore witness to the most dominant period at the top of the game by a single chess player the world has ever seen—only comparable with how Paul Morphy (1837–84) outclassed the entire European chess community a century earlier. Fischer won several strong tournaments, most importantly the 1970 Interzonal tournament in Palma de Mallorca. He’d failed to qualify for this event by missing the previous US championship, but the Hungarian American Pal Benko stepped aside and let Fischer play instead—a little detail in chess history that had huge consequences. The next stage of the world championship cycle consisted of Candidates matches. Fischer was paired with the Soviet grandmaster Mark Taimanov for a best-of-ten in Vancouver, Canada, and set down an unprecedented 6–0 score. Wow! Below is an eyewitness account from chess editor Daniel Bailey that beautifully describes Fischer’s presence at the board and intense concentration: In the summer of 1971 I went up to Vancouver to see one of the Fischer–Taimanov games. I sat near the front. All I can say is I have never been in the force field of more powerful human concentration. That includes master politicians, superb actors, and consummate concert musicians. Fischer would come on stage from the wings and in three long strides reach the table, sit and start analyzing in one swift seamless motion. Then he’d freeze, his body motionless but his mind no more motionless than a big cat’s riveted on prey. The intensity of his focus bumped up my pulse and blood pressure and made my breath come shallow minute after minute, hour after hour in the dark silence of the hall. I can only imagine what Taimanov must have been feeling from merely across the board. In the next match, held later that year in Denver, Colorado, Fischer defeated the great Dane Bent Larsen, scoring 6–0 again. A whirlwind was ripping through the chess world, following the quickest path to the crown. Winning his last Candidates match 6½–2½ against the former Soviet world champion Tigran Petrosian, Fischer achieved his goal: he would play for the world title. A chess craze started in the US as Fischer became a national hero, appearing on television and in magazines. Among the congratulatory telegrams was one from President Richard Nixon. Set at $250,000 (equivalent to $1.8 million today), the prize fund was higher than all previous world championships combined. Just three years earlier, Boris Spassky had earned $1,400 for winning the championship. The 1972 prize fund was astronomical for its time and, in hindsight, the first proper payout for chess. According to Kasparov, this was Fischer’s biggest legacy: “Fischer—and this is his chief merit—placed chess on a professional footing. He was the first genuine chess pro!” The match started disastrously for the challenger. He lost the first game due to a silly blunder, and then, after a conflict with the organizers about the placement of the TV cameras, Fischer refused to play the second game. In this best-of-24 match, he was 2–0 down. Spassky would have been justified in leaving the battlefield there and then, and was even urged to do so by the Soviet authorities, but he wanted to play. Spassky saved the match, and with that, he determined Fischer’s fate. The third game was played in a back room, away from the cameras, and Fischer scored his first-ever win against Spassky. After this, the players returned to the main stage for the remainder. Fischer won five times in games 4 to 13, some in brilliant style, while Spassky won just one more time. Seven draws followed, and Fischer won the match 12½–8½ to become the 11th World Chess Champion. The mighty Soviet chess machine, which had dominated the game for decades, was defeated by the lone American warrior. Fischer’s sister Joan put it unpolitically: “Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship.” After returning home, Fischer was received by Mayor John Lindsay at New York City Hall. He was the first Western world champion since Dutchman Max Euwe held the title between 1935 and 1937. “I never thought I’d see the day when chess would be all over the front pages here, but confined only to one paragraph in Pravda,” Fischer said in his speech, referring to the Russian newspaper Truth, the official voice of the Soviet Communist Party. By single-handedly defeating the representatives of a Communist country full of chess experts, Fischer instantly became one of the world’s most famous personalities, not just in sports. And, more than anyone before (and perhaps after) him, Fischer popularized the game immensely. Over a million viewers—an incredible number at the time—had tuned in to watch live commentary of the games by the chess teacher Shelby Lyman on the PBS television station Channel 13. One day, a reporter had walked past 21 bars in Manhattan and discovered that 18 of the televisions showed Lyman instead of a New York Mets baseball match that was also underway. The match had been front-page news globally. Chess author and Fischer expert John Donaldson told me, “On the news, there would be Walter Cronkite saying, ‘The war in Vietnam rages on, the stock market is down, oil prices are … ’ and then he’d say: ‘But first we go to Reykjavík!’ ” Fischer once again featured in major newspapers and magazines and on television, appearing on famous show such as The Bob Hope Special, 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and (a third appearance on) The Dick Cavett Show. Richard Nixon again contacted Fischer, this time inviting him to the White House. In subsequent years, chess experienced an international “Fischer Boom.” As sales of chess sets went through the roof, the United States Chess Federation membership doubled in 1972, and similar effects were seen at chess federations worldwide. Fischer meant more to the game than anyone before him. How did Fischer become so good? Talent is obviously part of the equation, while an immense love for the game made him spend most of his time analyzing, playing, and reading chess books and magazines as a child and adolescent. He had ample access to chess literature in New York City, where he found coaches early on. Donaldson wrote in his 2020 book Bobby Fischer and His World: If Bobby had stayed in Mobile, Arizona (35 miles southwest of Phoenix near the Sierra Estrella Mountains), where his family lived for a year (his mother taught school there), it’s almost inconceivable that he would have developed into a world champion. Today, with the internet, databases, computer programs, and tons of chess literature, a player from an isolated area can go far. This was not the case when Bobby was growing up. It was pretty much New York City, or forget it. Fischer’s life would be a true fairytale if the story ended there, but the remainder was altogether different. For starters, he didn’t defend his title: not all of his demands about the format of the match were accepted by FIDE, and he wouldn’t budge. The challenger, Anatoly Karpov, was declared the 12th world champion in 1975 without playing. As the years went by, Fischer lived an increasingly secluded life, and whenever people heard from him, he seemed to display signs of paranoia. He went so far as to suggest that all the Karpov–Kasparov matches were fixed. And then there was the antisemitism. A few hours after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, Fischer called it “wonderful news” on a Philippine radio station, expressing the hope that “the country will be taken over by the military—they’ll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.” It was not altogether new. The Dutch grandmaster Jan Hein Donner wrote about meeting a young Fischer in 1961: “He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of antisemitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.” At the same time, it is known that Fischer had good relations with several Jewish chess players. It might be that, at least when he was still young, he had something against Judaism but not necessarily Jewish people per se. In 1968, he played a tournament in Netanya, Israel, and even visited a kibbutz. There, he told the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree that his former antisemitism was “stupid,” and added, “Besides, I’m half-Jewish myself, so how can I be antisemitic?” But, particularly after his active playing career, Fischer was definitely antisemitic, as he made numerous comments about Jews and denied the Holocaust both publicly and privately. Given that most experts believe Paul Neményi was his father, we now know Fischer had not one, but two Jewish parents. Still, even if his rabid antisemitism only started long after his chess career, his fans are left with an uncomfortable double emotion. We like to remember him as the brilliant chess player that he was—but, at the same time, we cannot ignore his rather unpleasant characteristics. On a more positive note, Fischer’s legacy goes beyond the brilliant results and the many wonderful games he left behind to be studied and admired by students of the game. In the 1990s, Fischer promoted what he called “Fischer Random,” where before the game starts, the pieces are shuffled on the first and eighth rank to avoid opening theory. It is also called “Chess960” (or “Freestyle”), because there are 960 possible starting positions. (As early as 1792, the Dutch chess enthusiast Philip Julius van Zuylen van Nijevelt had a similar idea.) And then there is his chess clock, which he patented in the late 1980s and which became the standard for the chess world. In contrast with older chess clocks, a Fischer time control gives each player a small increment after each completed move, on top of a fixed period at the start of the game. In 1992, Fischer suddenly returned to the chessboard. The shady Yugoslav banker Jezdimir Vasiljević, who would later be convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, had convinced him to play another match with Spassky, exactly 20 years after Reykjavík—and for a prize fund of $5 million. The event occurred in Yugoslavia (partly on Sveti Stefan, an island off the coast of Montenegro, and partly in Belgrade). It was global news, not least because of Fischer’s reaction to the US government’s warning not to play the match as it would violate UN sports sanctions imposed following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Fischer showed the letter to the journalists during a press conference and spat on it. He won the return match 10–5 (with 15 draws) but never returned to the United States, knowing he would be arrested upon arrival. Fischer lived the final years of his life in Iceland, where he died from degenerative kidney failure on January 17, 2008. He was 64 years old—a year for each of the squares on the chessboard. News of his death was released on a Saturday morning—my mother texted me about it while I was in the car on my way to the Wijk aan Zee tournament. I was shocked and felt it in my stomach. At the start of the first round the sad news was announced, and I made a video where I filmed the playing hall with all the top grandmasters and the hundreds of amateurs standing up for a minute of silence, a truly heartbreaking moment. The chess world had lost one of its greatest players. When Kasparov visited Fischer’s grave in 2014, I had the unforgettable opportunity to record a video interview. As I held my Nikon D90 camera, I ensured Fischer’s snow-covered grave and the tombstone were visible in the background. Later, I would edit out my questions and combine Kasparov’s touching words with appropriate background music. Ten years on, the video on YouTube has collected 856,000 views. It might be the one thing I am the proudest of in my career. Kasparov said: I can’t help but think that this is the graveyard also for great, unfulfilled hopes, because so much could be achieved. This is the country where Robert Fischer reached his peak. It was not only his peak, but it was one of the most glorious moments in the history of the game of chess. It could have ended differently. It’s not for us to come up with hypothetical versions of alternative history, but it’s still very sad. It’s as if this graveyard.… We could feel that so many great hopes and expectations have been buried without being realized. It’s all behind us, all the controversies, and what is left is the unique contribution of Robert James Fischer to the game of chess, and I’m here to pay this tribute. The Beast from Baku Garry Kasparov was born Garik Kimovich Weinstein in Baku, Azerbaijan, on April 13, 1963. His Armenian mother, Klara Kasparova, and his Jewish father, Kim Weinstein, were engineers. Garry learned chess from his father at five and beat him a year later. However, like Fischer, he mostly grew up without his father, who sadly died of lymphatic sarcoma at age 39, not long before Garry’s eighth birthday. Four and a half years later, in August 1975, he took his mother’s surname and became Garry Kasparov. His uncle started playing a lot of chess with seven-year-old Garry, and, within three months, he couldn’t beat his nephew any more, so he took him to the Pioneers’ Palace in Baku. In the Soviet Union all big cities had such palaces: institutions designed to engage and educate young people in various extracurricular activities, including sports, arts, cultural programs, and chess. Young Garry’s chess talent was immediately recognized at the Baku Pioneers’ Palace. When he reached the final of the Baku adult blitz championship in June 1972, a newspaper wrote about the nine-year-old, dark-haired boy: “Third-year pupil Garik Weinstein, playing standing up (when sitting he can’t reach all the pieces), achieved the overall best result in the first stage—9 points out of 9.” Even a newspaper in West Germany picked up the story. You could say that in the same summer when Fischer played his last serious chess games, Kasparov entered the arena. In 1973 Kasparov was accepted into the prestigious school of the legendary former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Just a few years later, Kasparov achieved a very high level of play. He became the youngest player ever to win the junior championship of the USSR in 1976, at 13, and then unexpectedly won the 1978 Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk, Belarus, at 14. He scored 3½ points more than was needed to obtain the Soviet master title. He was not an international master yet, as up until that point he had only played in a small number of youth championships abroad. As a chess player (or any sportsman, for that matter), one depended on the whims of the Sports Committee to be allowed to play internationally. The first published photo of Garry Kasparov, at 10 years old already attracting spectators as he defeated grandmaster Yuri Averbakh in 1973 in Moscow. That changed in April 1979, when Kasparov, after helpful talks between Botvinnik and the organizers, was invited to a strong tournament in Banja Luka, in then Yugoslavia. Without holding an international title or rating, Kasparov—again rather unexpectedly—won the 15-round tournament with a two-point margin, ahead of 14 grandmasters. It was a true breakthrough moment in his career. Kasparov’s first official rating, published in January 1980, was a stunning 2595, instantly throwing the 16-year-old schoolboy into the world’s top 20. Only two other players had scored a similar result at that age: Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Even though he was already approaching the world’s top ten, Kasparov decided to participate in the 1981 World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, Germany. He won the tournament—this time surprising no one—with a certain Nigel Short of England taking second place. (The two would play a major role in the chess world 12 years later.) In 1982 Kasparov finally obtained the grandmaster title officially—having demonstrated that level of play for years. In 1983, he defeated three world-class grandmasters (Alexander Beliavsky, Viktor Korchnoi, and Vasily Smyslov) in Candidates matches to become the challenger to the reigning world champion, Anatoly Karpov. The 21-year-old Kasparov, who became the number-one ranked player in the world in January 1984 with a rating of 2710, would prove to be Karpov’s fiercest opponent. Their first match began on September 9, 1984. It started one of the most epic rivalries in sports history, eclipsing contemporary clashes such as Ali versus Frazier, Evert versus Navratilova, or Prost versus Senna. Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov during their 1984 match in Moscow, the longest in the history of the game, lasting five months and 48 games. The winner would be the first to score six wins, with draws not counting. The world championship thus returned to an ancient format (and one that Fischer proposed in 1975), resulting in the longest title match in history. Karpov initially took a 5–0 lead, winning games three, six, seven, and nine (see annotated game on pages 387–88), and, after a string of 17 draws, also game 27. Kasparov, however, refused to throw in the towel. The longer the match progressed, the stronger the player he became, all the while learning from his formidable opponent. Kasparov finally scored a win, his first ever against Karpov, in game 32—94 days into the match! Karpov failed to deliver the final blow in the 14 more draws that followed, while the chess world closely followed this fascinating struggle between the “two Ks.” And then, a bombshell. No, two. With the sword of Damocles hanging above him for weeks on end, Kasparov suddenly won games 47 and 48. The 32-year-old Karpov was collapsing. On February 16, 1985, a week after that 48th game and five months after the start of the match, the players appeared at a press conference alongside Florencio Campomanes, president of the International Chess Federation. Astonishingly, “Campo” stopped the match without a result and announced that a new one would begin in September. Both Karpov and Kasparov wanted to continue, but the FIDE president stuck to his controversial decision, saying the match had “exhausted the physical if not the psychological resources” of the players. Kasparov and many chess experts suggested that this was mostly true for the reigning champion, but Karpov stepped on the stage and retorted, “The reports of my death are exaggerated. I believe we can and should continue.” Kasparov would later write: Later I became convinced that the decision to stop the match was carried out not so much because of any risk to the champion’s health, but rather in view of his psychological exhaustion, confusion, and fear of continuing. No other way of retaining his title was now apparent: had Karpov also lost a fourth game, the only way to complete the match would have been in accordance with the regulations. And the powers which at that time controlled Soviet sport, including chess, decided not to take the risk. This comment also reveals the political aspect of the rivalry: while the closed and compliant Karpov represented the old power, the brash, open-minded and pro-Western Kasparov represented the demise of the Soviet Union. Within one year, the chess world would discover how much stronger Kasparov had become. For the new match, FIDE returned to a format of 24 games. If the result was 12–12, Karpov would retain his title. On November 9, 1985, Kasparov won with a score of 13–11, becoming the 13th and youngest world champion in history at 22. Kasparov and Karpov played three more matches—in 1986, 1987, and 1990—all closely contested, with Kasparov barely managing to keep his title. Over seven years, the two gladiators had played 144 world championship games, with Kasparov scoring 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws. In 1993, Karpov failed to qualify for a sixth clash with Kasparov as he lost a Candidates match to the English number one Nigel Short. Unsatisfied with the $1.38 million FIDE had raised for their upcoming title match, Kasparov and Short decided to play outside FIDE’s jurisdiction. They raised $2.55 million themselves and played under the newly launched Professional Chess Association (PCA). Kasparov convincingly won their match in London, but the two had disrupted the chess world in a way that would have a lasting impact. FIDE stripped Kasparov of its title and organized a match between the highest-placed players in the world championship cycle. Karpov defeated Jan Timman and won back his FIDE world title, but most fans saw Kasparov as the legitimate world champion. It was the start of a very messy situation in chess, which continued to produce multiple world champions until 2006 (see also Chapter 1 on this). Kasparov defeated Viswanathan Anand in 1995, a match in which one of his seconds (the chess term for coach/trainer/assistant) was Vladimir Kramnik. The young Russian grandmaster put his experience to good use, later dethroning his former boss in 2000. After years of failed attempts to organize a new world championship match, Kasparov retired from competitive chess in March 2005. Only in 2006 was the situation resolved when Kramnik won a “reunification match” against the FIDE world champion, Veselin Topalov. In 2009, the old legends Kasparov and Karpov played an exhibition match in Valencia, Spain. This time, Karpov was no match for his opponent in a series of rapid and blitz games. At the press conference the two legends were critical of FIDE and its handling of the world championship cycle over recent years. When I asked whether it might be an idea for the top players to consider starting a new organization altogether, Kasparov reacted as if stung by a bee, saying, “I have apologized many times for what I did in 1993!” Later, he wrote that creating the PCA was the worst blunder of his chess career. Kasparov has remained active in chess as an occasional trainer of upcoming players, including Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. And he still plays a bit, just not official games at a long time control. Every year, the chess legend can be seen in action in St. Louis, where he participates in exhibition events financed by billionaire Rex Sinquefield. I will never forget when I placed my camera about a meter and a half away from Kasparov’s board during the first round of a St. Louis blitz tournament in 2017, his first official (rated) game since 2005. Playing Sergey Karjakin with the white pieces, he employed the King’s Gambit, an ancient, romantic, and somewhat dubious opening he had never played before in his long career. Witnessing Kasparov grab that pawn in front of his king’s bishop and move it up two squares, it felt special just being there, watching it as a chess fan and filming it for the many fans who could soon watch it on YouTube. The game was an eventful draw (see annotated game on pages 398–99). Part of Kasparov’s incredible legacy springs from his books, in particular his famous My Great Predecessors series, published between 2003 and 2006. Over the course of five volumes, he gives a detailed account of the careers of the first 12 world champions, analyzing their most important games and covering the other strong players of their time. It is an extensive and beautiful account of the history of top-level chess in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and an indispensable part of any serious chess fan’s library. Kasparov also wrote books about his matches with Karpov, as well as three vol-umes focusing on his best games, totaling 12 wonderful works. Most of his time, however, is spent on something else. Soon after his retirement, Kasparov became a political activist and a fierce opponent of Vladimir Putin. In the fall of 2007, he briefly ran for president of Russia but the authorities prevented him from participating in the elections, as they did with many other opposition figures. He was jailed for five days for participating in a protest in November of that year. He moved to New York in 2013 and has not returned to Russia since. His 2015 book Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped wasn’t taken seriously enough by Western policymakers; only when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, did it become clear how accurately Kasparov had predicted the future. Kasparov had an incredible chess career. He won the Chess Oscar, an award based on votes by chess journalists, 11 times. He reached the highest-ever Elo rating of 2851 in 1999, a record that stood for 13 years. He still holds the record for the most months (255!) as the number-one rated player in the world (with Kramnik in shared first place in January 1996). He also has the most consecutive professional tournament victories, finishing first or tied for first in a remarkable 15 individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990. (Once, he quipped that he “lost a tournament,” referring to the fact that he did not finish in first place!) How did Kasparov get to dominate his peers? The answer lies in a combination of immense talent, excellent work ethic, and being raised in a good environment for chess. His matches with Anatoly Karpov brought him to another level. And, as we will learn more about in the second part of the book, as soon as computers became strong enough, Kasparov used them to maximum effect for his preparation. Kasparov’s presence at the board was legendary—in fact, it edged toward terrifying. He famously removed his watch from his wrist and placed it on the table at the start of a game. He would put it back only when he knew he had a winning position, by which point the opponent knew they were toast. The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler, who played Kasparov many times, told me, “A game against Garry would always take out all the energy from me; I would be half-dead the next day. I like Garry, I admire Garry a great deal; Garry is somebody I tried to model my chess life and career on, but the words ‘energy vampire’ kind of enter the conversation there a little bit.” Garry Kasparov, at a business-meets-grandmasters exhibition event in Paris in 2018, looking fierce as ever. The Mozart of Chess While the fifth and final match between Kasparov and Karpov was underway, Magnus Øen Carlsen was born on November 30, 1990, in Husvik, on the edge of Tønsberg, Norway’s oldest city. Magnus has one older and two younger sisters. He has in common with Kasparov that his parents, his mother Sigrun and his father Henrik, both graduated as civil engineers. Henrik, a chess lover, taught Magnus the game before he turned five. His son seemed interested, but it was difficult for him. He returned to it when he was seven due to a desire to beat his older sister, Ellen. The young Magnus could spend hours alone with a chess set, playing games against himself, trying to find combinations, or going through games his father had shown him. Later, playing online became part of the routine as well. Magnus spent thousands of hours playing chess, which Henrik emphasized when I asked him about the mystery behind his son’s talent: “I think the answer is a bit boring: he has practiced these capabilities a lot. Chess was something he delved into and tried to discover, find out about, a mystery that he wanted to understand more about.” Having produced just four grandmasters, Norway wasn’t exactly a chess-minded country. Its youth chess infrastructure was in pretty good shape, though, partly thanks to the efforts of the country’s number-one player. The multitalented Simen Agdestein was a strong chess player, ranked number 16 in the world at his best, and a professional soccer player who made eight appearances for the Norwegian national team as a striker. Agdestein had started a chess department at the Norges Toppi-drettsgymnas (Norwegian College of Elite Sport) just two years before Magnus joined, and soon introduced a trainer for him, the International Master Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen. Weekly training sessions, where Hansen discovered his pupil’s great memory and intuition, quickly bore fruit, helping Magnus increase his rating by a thousand points in a year. In July 2000, four months before his tenth birthday, Magnus played in the Norwegian championship for kids under 11. When speaking about it in a podcast in 2022, he still considered it the most satisfying tournament victory of his career, despite everything he achieved later: “At that point, I realized, you know, I could actually be very good at this.” After finishing primary school Carlsen took a year off in 2003–4, as his parents decided to take the family on a big trip. They rented out the house for a year and hit the road with a secondhand Hyundai H-100 van they named “Kassa.” The route meandered through Central and Southeast Europe and then back home to Bærum, Norway, for Christmas. “The focus was on educating the children and getting to know the world, and chess was something Magnus could do along the way,” Henrik explained. “In practice, we made a route that was consistent with him playing a lot of tournaments, but that was not the focus, really.” The first time I saw Magnus was when the family had just started the second part of their trip. In January 2004, I played in the amateur section in Wijk aan Zee and noticed a 13-year-old Norwegian boy playing in Grandmaster Group C. This was the third-highest tournament of the festival, held on stage just meters away from the main event. The tournament saw his international breakthrough. Magnus started with six wins and two draws, before losing one game—but with three more wins and a draw, he won the group with 10½ out of 13. He scored his first grandmaster norm (a tournament score at GM-level; you need three of those and a rating over 2500 to obtain the title) and was promoted to next year’s B group. Meanwhile, his beautiful win against the Dutch grandmaster Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round was published in chess magazines worldwide. He was a true wonderboy, which would be the title of the first biography written about him, by Agdestein in the same year. The Czech-American grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek compared Magnus to the prodigy of all prodigies. “In January 2004, I called Magnus Carlsen the Mozart of chess for the first time,” Kavalek wrote years later. “It was a spontaneous, last-minute decision to meet a deadline for my column in the Washington Post. The name was picked up immediately and spread around quickly. It was used, misused, overused.” The thing is: many past masters, including Morphy, Spassky, and Fischer, were also compared to Mozart. “How rich the chess world is!” noted the Dutch chess writer Hans Ree. “The music lovers have Mozart, but we have at least 11 of them.” Two months later, in March 2004, a rapid tournament in Reyk-javík witnessed a historic moment for chess as Magnus played against Kasparov for the first time (see annotated game on page 394). The time control was 25 minutes per person plus five seconds per move—the now common Fischer increment. Magnus, who had beaten Anatoly Karpov earlier in the tournament, again played brilliantly. He reached a winning position but spoiled it to draw, which was still a good result that made him a national celebrity as all major Norwegian media reported on it. After losing the second game, Magnus was quoted as saying, “I played like a child.” The next month, in April 2004, that child fulfilled all requirements to become the world’s youngest grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 26 days. At the 2007 tournament in Wijk aan Zee, the first where I worked as a reporter, Carlsen debuted in the highest group. He finished in last place, and the general thought was that this event had come too soon for him. The critics were quickly silenced when he finished in shared second place at another world-class event, Linares, Spain, only a few weeks later. It was a brilliant result for the now 16-year-old Norwegian in a field with seven of the best grandmasters in the world. In September 2009, the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang (VG) broke the news that, in all secrecy, Kasparov was training Carlsen, an arrangement that had started six months earlier and would end in early 2010. The news came out just as Kasparov arrived in Valencia to play his old nemesis Karpov, who had brought several grandmasters to assist him, while Kasparov came only with his wife, his mother, and a companion of hers. When someone doubted this modest entourage, Kasparov countered, “But I just came from a training session with Magnus!” Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, the two best players in the history of the game, first played each other in March 2004 in Reykjavík. Carlsen was thirteen. Carlsen, now 18, was the fourth-ranked player in the world, and the main goal of the training was to bring him to pole position in the coming year. That happened faster than anticipated. A spectacular performance at a tournament in Nanjing, China, where he played at a 3002 rating level (that is, his six wins and four draws at the tournament was equal to the expected score of a player with a theoretical rating of 3002), got him to second place, and then the London Chess Classic in December gave him the last push toward a rating of 2810. That was two points shy of Kasparov’s last published rating, but on January 1, 2010, a month after turning 19, Carlsen was the official world number one. (Fourteen years later, he still is.) In the fall of 2010 fans got to see yet another version of Carlsen: one that started to popularize the game in a broader sense. In a first for the chess world, he became a fashion model, joining the Dutch brand G-Star Raw’s Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn photographed the campaign, and suddenly Magnus could be seen on billboards and fashion magazines in 80 countries. He would also be part of G-Star’s Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole. As the Norwegian writer Arne Danielsen pointed out, it was at this point Magnus Carlsen became a brand, while his fashion activities aligned with the credo of trendwatchers in those days: “Smart is the new sexy.” Carlsen would later embark on further collaborations outside chess, including appearances in The Simpsons and Norway’s Donald Duck comics magazine and in commercials. For several years he was a global ambassador for Unibet; he helped create a special edition shoe for Puma; and in 2013 he took the honorary kickoff in a La Liga game for his favorite club, Real Madrid. In December 2019 he briefly led the official Fantasy Premier League ahead of seven million other players before eventually finishing the season in tenth place. More than any chess player previously, Carlsen has connected with global brands and promoted the game along the way. Three years after becoming the world number one, London was the scene for another special occasion for Carlsen. On December 8, 2012, he broke Garry Kasparov’s 2851 rating record. I filmed him throughout the day and interviewed him in the Hilton London Kensington hotel lobby afterward. “I think that’s pretty cool,” he commented with a smile. “It’s probably the biggest achievement of my career so far because I didn’t think that anyone thought it was going to be broken this soon.” The same interview revealed the kind of honesty about his play that Fischer and Kasparov were known for: “My games haven’t been brilliant. They haven’t been bad, but they haven’t been brilliant either, so it’s just about fighting, I think. And in the end, I believe you always get what you deserve, so to some extent I think I at least deserve this score.” In March 2013, Carlsen participated in what proved simultaneously to be a crucial tournament for his career and one of the most dramatic events in chess history. He was one of the eight participants of the Candidates Tournament, a double round-robin (all eight players faced each other twice) from which the winner would qualify for a world championship match against Viswanathan Anand. A round before the end, Carlsen was in a tie for first place with former world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Carlsen was slightly ahead on number of wins, so only had to match or better Kramnik’s final result. On a final day that couldn’t have been contrived by the best Hollywood scriptwriters, Carlsen and Kramnik both lost their games. As a result, Carlsen won on that tiebreak rule of scoring more wins. “I think a lot of other players would have gone for a draw in the last round or kind of secured the draw,” Carlsen’s father Henrik said. “But he wanted to win the game, to control his own destiny. I was so proud of that.” The Anand–Carlsen world championship started on November 9, 2013, in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chennai, India—a 15-minute drive from Anand’s home. I was among the 150 journalists present (40 from abroad, half of those from Norway), a number I had never seen before at a chess event. “Magnus and I both underestimated the intensity of a match,” Henrik told me. “The thought was, ‘Well, [Magnus] is the best tournament player in the world; he should play like it’s a tournament.’ But when Magnus came to the first game, he was pretty nervous, and before the second game, he was shaking, basically. He was fumbling with his pieces and twice dropped a piece; I had never seen him like that, ever. He was really on the edge. The experience was larger than life in a way, exotic and quite unique.” After four draws, Carlsen was the first to win a game and hit again in the next game. The remainder of the match saw one more win for the challenger and three draws, which in this best-of-12 match was enough for Carlsen to be crowned the 16th World Chess Champion a week before his 23rd birthday. For my news report I used the now iconic photo taken by my Norwegian friend and colleague Tarjei Svensen, who was responsible for Carlsen’s social media at the time. Magnus is standing in the water in a dark suit and white shirt, completely soaked but with two hands victoriously in the air. He had just been thrown into the hotel pool by his sponsors during a victory party with family, friends, former trainers, donors, and fans, including the Norwegian ambassador in India and his wife. Tarjei Svensen’s photograph of Magnus Carlsen, soaking wet but all smiles, as the newly crowned world chess champion who had just been thrown into the hotel pool, November 22, 2013. The next day the new world champion was officially crowned at the closing ceremony, hours after playing basketball with friends, sponsors, and media members. (Embarrassing photos exist of me failing horribly to defend against him.) My publisher insisted on including this picture of me playing basketball with Magnus Carlsen (and Tarjei Svensen, far right), in November 2013 in Chennai. Throughout the match, Carlsen played a lot of soccer and basketball on rest days. He is probably the biggest sports lover among all the top chess players. Since he was small, he has played soccer, tennis, and other ball sports. Skiing is still a favorite pastime when he is in Norway. As a result, he is generally fit, which has helped him in many long games that can take up to seven hours—for example, the crucial sixth game in his world championship match with Ian Nepomniachtchi in Dubai on December 3, 2021, where he won after 136 moves, seven hours, and 46 minutes of play. In late 2023, Carlsen answered the typical sports question concerning what was going through his mind after that marathon game: “I felt good; I was ready to play more! Because that was the key breakthrough, that was the moment I had been waiting for, for the first six games of that match. I remember I was so calm, so focused for the last two and a half hours. I was playing with fairly little time on my clock, but I knew: this is my chance; if I win this game I’m probably winning another world championship, so I knew that was my moment. Afterward I was just so calm, I even told my manager I was ready to go for three more hours.” Back to 2013 and Carlsen’s world championship match against Anand. The chess craze was truly incredible in Norway. The match was covered live on the website of the country’s biggest newspaper VG and on television at prime time. There were close to a million concurrent viewers, while about two and a half million people watched at some point, which is half of Norway’s population. VG declared him “Man of the Year,” and at the national sports gala he clinched the three biggest trophies. The following year Anand won the 2014 Candidates Tournament to qualify for a return match, showing that class is permanent. The Indian legend also lost his second match to Carlsen, in Sochi, Russia. Carlsen played his next two title matches—in 2016 against the Russian Sergey Karjakin and in 2018 against the American Fabiano Caruana—deciding both in the rapid tiebreak after the regular games had ended 6–6. In 2021, he defeated Nepomniachtchi more convincingly, 7½–3½. Meanwhile, he won multiple gold medals at speed chess events, winning the World Blitz Chess Championship seven times and the World Rapid Chess Championship five times. Carlsen holds the longest unbeaten streak in history, going undefeated for 125 classical games between August 2018 and October 2020. His peak classical rating is 2882, which he has reached twice in his career, in May 2014 and August 2019, in two different ways. “Specifically in 2019, I benefited a lot from opening preparation, while in 2013–14, I mostly tried to avoid my opponent’s preparation rather than that being [my] strength,” he said in the summer of 2022. In Chapter 6 we will see how Carlsen changed his approach to the game, becoming stronger also in the opening thanks to remarkable computer developments. Carlsen is a player from the modern era, meaning many of his events have occurred online. He won numerous internet tournaments, first on the platform Chess24, and then, following a merger in 2022, on Chess.com. One of his toughest opponents in very fast online games is the American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, who managed to beat him in the 2022 Speed Chess Championship final (Nakamura is a player we’ll learn more about in Chapter 10). Carlsen took revenge in the 2023 edition but only won narrowly: 13½–12½. In the summer of 2022, Carlsen shocked the chess world by announcing that he wouldn’t be defending his world championship title. “I’m not motivated to play another match. I simply feel that I don’t have a lot to gain,” he said in a Norwegian podcast. Luckily for his many fans, he didn’t retire like Kasparov, or vanish like Fischer. Carlsen is still playing a lot of tournaments, online and offline, and thus far has retained his number-one ranking. His legacy is still being written. Why is Carlsen better than his rivals? Kasparov has said, “Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov, which is very unusual because Fischer’s style was very dynamic, just fighting to the last pawn, just using every resource available. Karpov was very different. He had an unparalleled ability to use every piece with a maximum effect.” Henrik Carlsen suggested that Karpov was closer in style to his son than Fischer, with Magnus taking Karpov’s prowess to the next level: “Fischer had more of Fischer in him than Magnus, but if Karpov had more of Karpov in him than Magnus, I’m not so sure.” Magnus Carlsen during the 2018 Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. I asked the same question, why Carlsen is superior to his rivals, to the Dutch number one, Anish Giri, who’d played Carlsen dozens of times. His answer was insightful: He does what everybody does: a little better here, a little better there. Where he is the best is that he has this insane feel for pattern recognition, which is a subconscious thing, coming from somewhere deep in the trenches of your memory. But you can try to trace it, like, “Where have I seen it?” And then it can be something like: “Ah, it’s actually kind of similar to the Fischer–Taimanov game.” Magnus has the best pattern recognition: the passive, intuitive one where he sees the position, and he knows White is better. His evaluations are spot on, especially for positions that are positional when nothing concrete is there [lacking direct, forcing tactics]. If he has an argument with another top player about a position, I think 29 out of 30 times, he’s right. And then, what is also very impressive is that he will also tell you what it reminds him of right away. So, he knows where the connection comes from. His pattern recognition is not only better, it’s also closer to his consciousness. They are better connected in him. And what impresses me also is the speed of his connections, the consciousness of his subconscious. That he recognizes what it is that he sees so quickly. I think that is talent. Who Is the GOAT? On October 8, 2023, the late Kelvin Kiptum from Kenya set the official world record for marathons at 2:00:35 in Chicago. In 1925, the American Albert Michelsen was the fastest at the Port Chester, New York, marathon with a time of 2:29:01. On February 11, 2024, Pan Zhanle of China swam the 100 meters freestyle in long course (a 50-meter pool) in 46.80 seconds, in Doha. It took the American Johnny Weissmuller 57.4 seconds to finish the same distance in Miami in 1924. In the span of a century, top runners and swimmers have become roughly 20 percent faster. As time progresses, athletes get better and stronger in just about any physical sport, decade after decade. The most famous exception is Bob Beamon, whose long-jump world record of 8.90 meters at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics stood for almost 23 years until it was broken in 1991 by Mike Powell. What Beamon had done was an unbelievable performance, way ahead of his time. New generations of athletes are continuously beating their predecessors because of the progress made in training methods and the accumulated knowledge about nutrition, sleep, and other relevant factors. That also makes it harder, or perhaps nonsensical, to compare contestants from different periods in time. Was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar better than Michael Jordan? Would you prefer to have Shohei Ohtani in your team over Babe Ruth? The times are different; everything is different. Only boxing might be an exception here, where it has been suggested that the greats of the past might be on a par with, or even better than, the greats of today. But what about chess? It would seem that the Elo rating system is the perfect tool for making such comparisons for chess players. We have the numbers to tell us who was the best player, right? Well, there are two problems. For starters, Arpad Elo only introduced his calculations in the 1960s, so we must disregard any great master from before then. A bigger issue stems from the nature of the rating system, which Elo himself pointed out: it doesn’t provide stable numbers of a certain level of play. Instead, it measures the strength of a player as compared with their contemporaries. Regarding our topic, it can only tell us how much someone dominated their peers. As early as 1962, Elo noted that ratings are mere approximates. He compared the calculations to “the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yardstick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind.” In the late 1990s and early 2000s the American statistician Jeff Sonas acknowledged the second problem, but more or less solved the first. Working with his own rating formula, he evaluated the strength of historical tournaments and the performance ratings of players. Based on that, he calculated monthly historical ratings going back to 1843. His main conclusions: Bobby Fischer established the largest gap between the number-one player and the rest of the world, but that lasted only a few months, and then he retired. Emanuel Lasker had the longest reign as world champion (27 years) and was at the top of Sonas’s rating list for most months, but his career included several periods when he hardly played, including during World War I. No, Garry Kasparov was the most dominant player of all time. One of Sonas’s arguments (which refers to his own rating formula, not the official FIDE ratings) is pretty convincing: “For a stretch of 18.5 years, not a single other player even came within ten rating points of Kasparov on any of the monthly lists.” We can now agree that Kasparov beats Fischer in dominance, if only for the longevity that Fischer is missing. But what about Carlsen? We cannot ask Sonas, who stopped looking at this topic after Kasparov’s retirement. Two experts answered the GOAT question more recently, though. At the end of 2020, the grandmasters Jan Gustafsson and Peter Heine Nielsen published their list of the 50 greatest players of all time on Chess24. Their top three: Kasparov, Carlsen, Fischer, in that order. Nielsen said, “There’s just nothing to talk about, it’s as simple as that.” Gustafsson: “The only guy who could match him [Kasparov] is if Magnus has another ten years like the ten years he’s had, then we have something to talk about. That we can do in 2030 when we redo this series.” In 2017, the French researcher Jean-Marc Alliot took a different approach. Instead of going by ratings, he used a chess engine to look at the quality of moves in 26,000 games played by all world champions since Wilhelm Steinitz. His model predicted the results of the games extremely close to actual results, and better than predictions based on Elo scores. Alliot’s list, based on the year when individual players were at their peak, had an interesting number two: 1. Carlsen (best year: 2013); 2. Kramnik (1999); 3. Fischer (1971); 4. Kasparov (2001). In the same year, 2017, Chess.com introduced its Computer Aggregated Precision Score (CAPS), an engine-based tool that evaluates the strength of play for a chess player, or the quality of moves in a chess game. Their top four was similar: 1. Carlsen; 2. Kramnik; 3. Kasparov; 4. Fischer. In August 2023, the American grandmaster Larry Kaufman pointed out that such research needs some tweaking. He noted that players who prioritize not losing and excel in endgames play more draws than those who prioritize winning and excel in attacking, and draws usually show much higher overall quality of moves than decisive games. He did his own research where he excluded draws from the data and limited himself to games that were part of world championship matches and tournaments, Candidates matches or tournaments, and Interzonals. All this didn’t help Kramnik, because Kaufman’s list has Carlsen first, Kasparov second, Fischer third. The conclusion is that of all the players that ever lived, Carlsen has shown the highest objective quality of play. However you want to look at it, and whichever player you prefer, it cannot be denied that the Norwegian superstar has been responsible for the best moves ever played. It’s impossible to say whether he is also the most talented player who ever lived because, like all modern athletes, Carlsen has benefited from greater accumulated knowledge, modern training methods, and the strongest computer engines. (For what it’s worth, Carlsen himself still put Kasparov slightly ahead of him in August 2022, when he said, “Garry generally edges it because of the longevity in the competitive era.”) The “previous GOAT,” Kasparov, was a pioneer when it came to using computers, as we will see in the following chapters. Fischer, however, had to do without machines altogether. In fact, he hardly had any seconds or coaches through most of his career, while his estimated performance rating during his peak period of 1970–72 was over 2800, the level of the absolute top players of today. Just imagine what he could have done in the modern era. John Donaldson believed, “If Bobby Fischer had access to the engines they have now, and ChessBase, and he was exactly the way he was back then, so he would be, like, studying for 12 hours a day, right? I mean, I don’t know, he would come to the tournament, and probably there would be like steam coming from his brain, like fully cooked.” Fischer might not be the objective GOAT by generally accepted criteria, but what he achieved, mostly all by himself, is perhaps still unique, after all—as unique as Bob Beamon was for the long jump. With its 1,500-year history that has left indelible marks on art, literature, and science, chess has established itself as a unique cultural phenomenon. A world without the game of kings is unimaginable. Meanwhile, the kings of the game have left their mark. Fischer, Kasparov, and Carlsen have each played unique roles in shaping the narrative of chess in Western culture. As we will explore in the next two parts of the book, chess eventually became more popular than ever after two giant forces deeply impacted the game—the computer and the internet.",

      "content": "Chapter 5AI and Chess: From Babbage to Deep Blue “If we choose to call the [Mechanical Turk] a pure machine we must be prepared to admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the most wonderful of the inventions of mankind.” —Edgar Allan Poe, “Maelzel’s Chess Player,” Southern Literary Messenger, 1836 It’s May 11, 1997, and a drama is unfolding on the 35th floor of the Equitable Center on Seventh Avenue in Midtown, Manhattan. Thirty-four-year-old Garry Kasparov, the best chess player on the planet, sits with his head in his left hand and looks out into the crowd. On the first row, he sees his mother, Klara, who accompanies him to all his important matches. He starts shaking his head. As he takes a few more seconds to accept the inevitable, Kasparov eventually offers his hand to the game operator, quickly signs the scoresheet, and walks straight out of the room with both hands up. The video showing Kasparov’s resignation would be played in news bulletins worldwide as the supercomputer Deep Blue’s win was heralded as the machine’s victory over mankind. The footage went viral a decade before social media became a thing. In his late-night show, David Letterman joked, “Over the weekend, world chess champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by the IBM computer, Deep Blue. Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. In a related story, earlier today, the New York Mets were defeated by a microwave oven.” Deep Blue’s victory against Garry Kasparov in 1997 was a significant milestone for artificial intelligence. At the time, the match symbolized the competition between humans and computers at the highest level of intelligence, setting Deep Blue’s win as a marker of AI’s potential to surpass human performance in complex tasks. It was a legendary match, which had its origins almost 200 years earlier, when a young man marveled at automatons. Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine In 1800, a boy of about nine years old, accompanied by his mother, stepped into the depths of John Joseph Merlin’s Mechanical Museum in the heart of London. It was an enigmatic place filled with gadgets and wonders, such as a gambling machine, perpetual-motion clocks and a collection of alluring music boxes. The boy’s eyes were transfixed, captivated by the mysterious mechanisms before him. Little did he know, on that fateful day in central London, one of the early seeds of artificial intelligence would be planted deep within his young mind. The boy’s name was Charles Babbage. The nineteenth century’s renowned mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer designed his Difference Engine in 1822, an audacious creation to generate error-free logarithmic tables. It was an early example of a mechanical computer, where the term computer should be understood as a machine that can compute or calculate something. Around 1833, Babbage started working on his even more ambitious Analytical Engine. This was a mechanical, general-purpose computer that would use punched cards for programming and have a “store” for memory, a mill for computations, and a control unit for instruction sequencing. It was to perform arithmetic operations, support conditional branching and looping, and store intermediate results. An engraving of a section of Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine No. 1, from the frontispiece of his autobiography Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, 1864. None of Babbage’s engines, which would have been roughly the size of a room and extraordinarily heavy, were completed in his lifetime due to disputes with the engineers and the collapse of the British government’s funding. Still, they laid the foundation for subsequent developments in computing technology in the twentieth century. In his autobiography, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, from 1864, Babbage revealed that he had intended to “test” his Analytical Engine and see whether it could play “a game of purely intellectual skill successfully” such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, or chess. He concluded that theoretically, it should be possible, but that chess encountered practical limitations. “In consequence of this, the whole question of making an automaton play any game depended on the possibility of the machine being able to represent all the myriads of combinations relating to it,” Babbage wrote. That “myriad of combinations” turned out too large for such a machine (and we will soon learn why): “Allowing one hundred moves on each side for the longest game at chess, I found that the combinations involved in the Analytical Engine enormously surpassed any required, even by the game of chess.” He spent more time on tic-tac-toe, but also here, while leaving many design sketches, he could not create an actual machine himself. Although Babbage’s influence on computer chess is limited, there is a link between his Analytical Machine and the earliest computers of the twentieth century. It is, therefore, fascinating to consider that one of the brightest minds of his time was at least thinking along the same lines as the first explorers of artificial intelligence, but more than a century earlier. And, in this case too, chess had played its part. Alan Turing and His Paper Machine If I ask the reader when the first computer chess program was written, you will probably start thinking about the number of years since the first electronic computer appeared. However, the answer may astound you: it was a few years before such a computer was born. The man who wrote it was Alan Turing. Born in 1912 in London, Turing emerged as one of the twentieth century’s most brilliant and visionary minds. His contributions to computer science, his role as a codebreaker during World War II at Bletchley Park, and his pioneering work in artificial intelligence and early computer design have secured his legacy. Oh, and he also liked chess. While working at Bletchley Park, Turing had plenty of opportunities to play during breaks. Among the codebreakers who regularly penetrated and deciphered the coded messages of the Germans, Italians, and Japanese were many strong chess players, including three members of the English team: Conel Hugh O’Donel Alexander (the reigning British champion at the time), Stuart Milner-Barry, and Harry Golombek. In 1948, when Turing was 36, he started writing his chess program. Assisted by his friend David Champernowne, Turing programmed the rules of the game but also created a set of values for the pieces (pawn = 1, knight = 3, bishop = 3½, rook = 5, queen = 10) and some positional evaluation functions, which gave numeric values to things like piece mobility, piece safety, castling, check, and mate. Some of these ideas are still valuable concepts used by modern-day chess programs. Turing and Champernowne called their chess-playing program the “Turochamp,” also known as “Turing’s Paper Machine.” Since a computer capable of running the program did not exist, Turing had to go through the algorithm for each move and calculate Turochamp’s next move with pencil and paper, thus acting as a human central processing unit (CPU). The whole process took more than half an hour per move. At the time, Turing’s chess computer program had evolved from what has been named “the Turing Machine.” He described it in his famous paper “On Computable Numbers,” published in 1936 when he was 24. Turing gave a mathematical description of a universal machine, an abstract model of a computing device capable of processing information. Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” posed a pivotal question that ignites passionate debate to this day: can machines think? In his quest for the answer, Turing first noted that you need definitions of “machine” and “think,” but then suggested something altogether different, which he called “the imitation game.” This notion, portrayed in the 2014 biographical film bearing the same name, is now immortalized as “the Turing Test.” It postulates that when a computer’s response becomes indistinguishable from a human’s, the boundaries of intelligence blur and the computer can be deemed to be thinking. Nowadays, the fundamental importance of the Turing Test in the field of AI is probably somewhat overrated. In fact, instead of a rigorous formal test, Turing himself saw the notion as more like a philosophical idea, a helpful thought experiment. In a podcast in July 2023, the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari described the Turing Test concisely as “a social test, not a logical proof.” Still, what’s nice about Turing’s 1950 paper is that it’s there, within those pages, that chess and AI started their joint journey through the twentieth century and beyond. In his imitation game, Turing gives four example questions (and supposed answers from the computer), two of them related to chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Count me out on this one, I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give an answer) 105621. Q: Do you play chess? A: Yes. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. (If the notation of the chess moves looks odd, that’s because in those days descriptive notation was still more common than today’s standard algebraic notation, which uses coordinates of squares, like in 1.e4, 2.Nf3.) As Garry Kasparov commented in 2012, Turing, in the above dialogue, placed chess somewhere between simple sums and poetry. Not a bad place for our game! This author couldn’t resist the temptation to feed OpenAI’s well-known chat program ChatGPT the same “prompts” to see what the Turing Test gave us in early 2023. The answers I got mainly demonstrated that, at that point in time, the chatbot knew its way among texts but didn’t really know how to play chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Upon the Firth of Forth, a bridge stands tall, A marvel of steel, engineering’s delight. It stands against the storm, will never fall, A beacon in the day, a star at night. Three diamond towers, reaching for the sky, An icon of the North, proud and true. Steel girders forming lines that please the eye, Connecting banks where once a ferry flew. Across the waters, trains in rhythm move, On tracks suspended high above the tide. Each crossing a testament to human groove, Of perseverance, pride, and nation’s stride. So here’s to Forth Bridge, in elegance draped, Man’s triumph over space, in steel shaped. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: The sum of 34957 and 70764 is 105721. Q: Do you play chess? A: As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t actually “play” chess in the sense that humans do. However, I can certainly assist with understanding the game, explaining the rules, discussing strategies, or analyzing moves and positions. If you provide a situation from a game, I can help interpret it or suggest possible moves. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: In the scenario you’ve described, it’s important to prevent the opposing king from moving to a safe position. The best move would be to use your rook to give checkmate. You can do this by moving your rook from R1 to R2. The king on K1 has no legal moves and is in check from the rook on R2, which is supported by your king on K6, resulting in checkmate. Please note that the naming conventions of chess positions can vary based on the system used. ChatGPT’s chess answer included a few correct facts, but its suggested move was nonsensical. I don’t think that’s because ChatGPT got confused by the descriptive notation; it did not understand chess yet. That is still the main issue with large language models (LLMs) at this point in time: they are not ready yet for real understanding like humans do (and hardly anyone understands them!). Initially, I thought that for ChatGPT to be able to think and solve chess problems, it would need to be somehow connected to a chess program, because without it, it is only using language by predicting which next word in the sentence makes the most sense. But, if we could combine that with a chess program, we would have the chess version of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which, according to some experts, might be less than a decade away. However, many months into writing this book, I came across a special version of the now infamous chatbot called “GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct,” released by OpenAI in September 2023. It is a more versatile tool that can be instructed more precisely to complete various tasks or answer questions. And, lo and behold, it also plays chess, at the level of the average club player, without any connection to an actual chess program. How is that possible? In an online article in early January 2024, research engineer Adam Karvonen explained that this model was only trained to predict the next character in chess notation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and was never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess: “Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.” Playing a decent game of chess by predicting the next move from chess notation, thereby learning much more about the actual game, is just incredible. It also shows that LLMs are developing so quickly that any judgment you make about their capabilities today could be out of date tomorrow. Shortly before finishing the first draft of this book, in February 2024, I tried Turing’s last question again, and now ChatGPT (still version 3.5!) answered it perfectly: “In the situation you described, with your king at K1 and no other pieces, and my king at K6 and rook at R1, I would play rook to R8, checkmating your king at K1. This move involves bringing the rook to the eighth rank and delivering checkmate to your king along the back rank.” Claude Shannon and His Number Turing’s lecture for the Royal Astronomical Society in 1947 is considered the earliest public lecture on machine intelligence. With his 1950 paper and chess-playing computer program, he showed for the first time that chess could be a model for mechanical thinking and machine intelligence. In the early 1950s the game was a testing ground for the new and developing area of computer science. In 1943, Turing had spent two months working on speech encryption at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City. There, he met the academic and philosophical engineer Claude Shannon, whose 1948 article “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” would become the founding work for the field of information theory. Like Turing, Shannon worked on cryptanalysis during World War II, and the two distinguished gentlemen shared an interest in chess. Seemingly independent from Turing, Shannon published an article titled “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess” in 1950 based on a lecture he had given to the Institute of Radio Engineers on March 9, 1949—coincidentally, Bobby Fischer’s sixth birthday. “This paper is concerned with the problem of constructing a computing routine or ‘program’ for a modern general-purpose computer which will enable it to play chess,” Shannon opened his article. For him, too, chess was a testing ground that could prove helpful for other areas. While constructing a chess computer program was “perhaps of no practical importance,” he wrote, “the question is of theoretical interest, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem will act as a wedge in attacking other problems of a similar nature and of greater significance.” Shannon also explained why chess was so valuable: The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require “thinking” for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of “thinking”; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers. Shannon theorized that each position in a chess game has three possible evaluations: a won position for White; a drawn position; or a won position for Black. To play a perfect game, without errors, all the program needs to do is calculate from the starting position till the moment of checkmate or a drawn position, and see which result follows in deciding which first move it needs to make. Easy? Well, there is a bit of an issue with this approach. The thing is: there are a lot of possible games to calculate. Like, a lot. In the first chapter, we saw the power of exponential growth explained by the legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, and here’s it no different. As famously noted, the number of possible chess games is bigger than the number of atoms in the universe, and Shannon was the first to point this out. Here’s why. In the starting position, White has 20 possible opening moves (eight pawns can be pushed either one square or two, and each knight, the only piece allowed to jump over other pieces or pawns, can go to two different squares). Black has the same 20 options, meaning 20 × 20 = 400 possible ways to start a chess game with one move for each side. If we give White one more move, the number of variations quickly grows to 8,902, and adding a second move for Black means there are 197,281 different possible starts. As the game progresses, the tree of possibilities grows at an exponential rate that is impossible to comprehend. Based on an average of about a thousand (103) possibilities for a pair of moves and a typical game lasting for about 40 such pairs of moves, Shannon concluded that there are 10120 variations (possible games) to be calculated from the initial position, which is a one followed by 120 zeroes. This is known as the Shannon number. And it happens to be much (much!) bigger than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which is estimated between 1078 and 1082, give or take. Like Babbage, Shannon realized chess is a rather complex game. Okay, so what do we do? We may be too ambitious, and playing the perfect chess game sets the bar somewhat high. Magnus Carlsen would be the first to admit that he became a world champion while playing far from perfect chess. Instead, Shannon set the task to create a program that can play “a skillful game, perhaps comparable to that of a good human player.” He worked toward creating a strategy: choosing from the possible legal moves in a chess position based on the evaluation of the position. Just like Turing and Champernowne, Shannon mentioned the relative value of the chess pieces (such as that the rook is worth about five pawns) as well as king safety while also speaking about more sophisticated concepts like “open files” and “weak pawns.” But how do we make sure that a computer chooses, from the infinite universe of possibilities, a decent move without thinking for too long? Also here, Shannon has been instrumental in developing computer chess by distinguishing two types of searching for the best move in a position. Type A is known as the “brute-force search,” looking at every variation to a given depth—say, three moves for each side—and then deciding. The alternative method, Type B, is “selective search”: here, the computer, instead of looking at all possible moves each time, looks at important branches of the tree only; namely, the branches that include, for example, checks, captures, and attacking moves. A year later Turing presented similar ideas in his article “Digital Computers Applied to Games” (1951), published independently from Shannon. Therefore, Shannon gets the credit for being the first to put on paper a strategy for a computer to meticulously select its moves, while Turing will always be known as the architect of the first-ever chess algorithm. Early Chess Programs Around the same time Turing and Shannon wrote their groundbreaking papers on chess and computer intelligence, the first generation of electronic computers was born. Between 1935 and 1945 the first digital computing machines were built, largely thanks to the need for warfare-related mathematical computations. These machines were created for table-making, ballistics calculations, and codebreaking tasks. Chess was still too complex for the early electronic computers that appeared in the 1950s, but that didn’t stop humans from attempting to program chess into the giant mainframe machines that took up the space of a large living room. (Apart from their improvements in speed and memory, the most striking part of the evolution of computers in the second half of the twentieth century was their change in size.) The challenge was just too exciting to let go of, as chess, the famous board game that had kept its prestige throughout the centuries, was seen as a representative measure of intelligence. And if chess was “too big to handle,” they would just make it … smaller. That’s what a team of scientists did at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, where the atomic bomb had been invented. The laboratory obtained the state-of-the-art MANIAC I computer to help with the necessary computations for nuclear weapons. In their spare time, when not occupied with further developing the most murderous weapon in history, the researchers created a chess program that could play on a smaller chessboard, with only 6 × 6 squares and no bishops. Why? Because even the MANIAC was too limited in memory and computing power to deal with 8 × 8 squares and 32 pieces. In any case, this “handicapped” computer chess program worked, and it is said to have won a game in 1956 against someone who had just learned the rules a week earlier, making it the first machine to beat a human fair and square in (a form of) chess. The American technology company International Business Machines was involved with computer chess much earlier than its famous matches with Kasparov in the 1990s. In fact, IBM had already set a record four decades before it would beat the world champion in chess. In 1957, an IBM 704 mainframe computer, a 9.7-ton vacuum tube machine, was the first that could run a fully automated chess engine, playing the game with no limitations. The program was written by IBM’s engineer and mathematician Alex Bernstein, and it took about eight minutes to make a move. On the Computer History Museum website, you can see wonderful footage of Bernstein sitting behind a chess set next to a giant machine full of lights, buttons, and levers. As the voiceover notes, the chess-playing program was given to the computer on a reel of magnetic tape. While Bernstein executed the moves for both sides on the chess set, he communicated them to the 704 by pressing down about a dozen levers and lifting them again in a specific order. The machine printed out the new position following each move, and after calculating its new move, it printed that out too. How deep was this computer thinking? Well, let’s listen to the film voiceover: Los Alamos physicist Paul Stein, left, and MANIAC project leader Nicholas Metropolis, right, play 6 × 6 chess against MANIAC, without bishops, 1956. In calculating its moves, the machine considers the board square by square. Is the square occupied? By whose men? Is it under attack? Can it be defended? Can it be occupied? All this is taking a long time by computer standards: one-tenth of a second. Now the computer proceeds to select its move. It has about 30 possible moves. After asking eight preliminary questions about each of them, it selects seven of the 30 for further analysis. It tests each of the seven through four moves ahead, considering its opponent’s possible replies and its own possible counter-responses in each case. It examines 2,800 positions in eight minutes. As it turns out, Bernstein’s program was a prototype of Shannon’s Type B kind of thinking because, in addition to brute-force calculation, there was some form of selective search. However, if he played the same moves in a new game, the computer would make the same moves and lose in the exact same way. The film footage ends with: “Someday, though not soon, Mr. Bernstein feels a program may be designed that will enable the computer to profit by its own mistakes and improve its chess game on the basis of its experience against human opponents.” It would take another 60 years for AlphaZero to appear on the scene (we’ll meet this computer program in the next chapter) and for reinforcement learning, alongside artificial neural networks, to become a key factor in chess engine improvement. Building on Bernstein’s landmark chess program, Alan Kotok and four of his classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created an improved version in 1962, which also ran on a newer computer: the IBM 7090. Since we’re keeping track of records, I mention Kotok’s program primarily for being the first-ever chess computer to lose to another chess computer. That story begins with a visit by the computer scientist John McCarthy (famously the first to coin the term artificial intelligence in 1956) to the Soviet Union in 1965. The Soviets hadn’t been sitting still, having created not only their own atomic bomb but also their own chess-playing program. In Moscow, McCarthy talked about his student Kotok and his chess program, after which he was challenged to a chess match against their chess program. Then, a year later, half a decade before Fischer–Spassky, a US versus USSR computer chess match was played by telegraph in 1966–67, and was won by the Soviet program. (Not that I want to suggest any type of violation of fair play, but it should be noted that the Russian team was advised by a certain Mr. Mikhail Botvinnik, who had a PhD in electrical engineering but also happened to be a former world chess champion.) The Soviet chess program was further developed into Kaissa, the first Computer Chess World Championship winner in 1974. By then, about 200 chess programs had already been developed, and special world championship tournaments for chess computers started to be organized every three years. During that first official championship, held in Stockholm, Sweden, Kaissa could not run on a local machine because of its unique Soviet operating system. It ran on a machine in Moscow instead, and the moves were communicated by telephone. Out of fear that the Soviets might cheat with their program and have someone interfere with the moves, the organizers had made sure someone was in the computer room to oversee the relay of moves. The Levy Bet The English chess master David Levy was instrumental in organizing those early computer chess tournaments in the 1970s and remained a key figure in the computer chess world for decades. In August 1968, Levy attended a machine intelligence workshop at Edinburgh University. He won a casual chess game at a cocktail party against John McCarthy, who then worked at Stanford. After the game, McCarthy said, “Well, David, you might be able to beat me, but I’m sure that in ten years there will be a computer program that will be able to beat you!” The optimism among computer pioneers was remarkable in those days. A decade earlier, in 1957, the American economist and political scientist Herbert Simon, who also worked in computer science, had proclaimed that a digital computer would beat the world chess champion within ten years. That was three decades off the mark. It should be noted that chess players did much better in the prediction game. The famous Russian grandmaster Yuri Averbakh, who was for many years the oldest grandmaster in the world until he died in May 2022, aged 100, appeared in a Moscow television show in 1963 and predicted that a computer would beat the world chess champion in 1998. Pretty close! But, back to that cocktail party in 1968. Levy, the reigning Scottish champion, thought John McCarthy’s prediction was utter nonsense and put up a bet of £500 (then worth $1,250), which was more than half his annual salary. McCarthy called over to Donald Michie—a British computer scientist who had worked with Alan Turing and others at Bletchley Park—who was also in the room. Upon hearing it, Michie said, “Can I take half the bet?” In subsequent years, a few more machine intelligence researchers joined and added to the bet until it had grown to £1,250 ($2,925) in 1974. It wasn’t until 1977 that a chess program was strong enough to put up a decent fight and seriously test the bet. Levy played a two-game match against CHESS 4.5, a program created by Larry Atkin, Keith Gorlen, and David Slate, computer scientists at Northwestern University. The program had participated successfully in human events and even won the 1977 Minnesota Open. The way Levy describes the match in his 1980 book More Chess and Computers echoes the sentiment of Kasparov upon facing Deep Blue almost twenty years later: “It was time for me to face up to my responsibilities and to defend the human race against the coming invasion.” Levy won the first game, after which the second game was not played because the best the computer could possibly do was tie the two-game match. In the following months, Levy won a few more matches, including one against Mac Hack, a program created by Richard Greenblatt at MIT. The program, also known as the Greenblatt Chess Program, had played against Bobby Fischer in spring 1977. (See annotated game on pages 385–86. Fischer crushed the chess program in three games and sent the notation to the Computer Chess Newsletter. These were Fischer’s first published games since his match with Boris Spassky in 1972, and the last until their rematch in 1992.) Then shortly before the ten-year deadline of the bet, in August–September 1978, Levy played a six-game match against CHESS 4.7, Slate and Atkins’s latest version, which ran on a CDC Cyber 176 mainframe computer located in Minneapolis (see annotated game on pages 386–87). Playing in a tuxedo in a soundproof booth at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Levy also won this match, but this time the computer managed to draw one game and win another. The world had witnessed the first computer victory against a human master in a serious event! Levy called the whole affair the end of an era in the annals of computer chess: “I had proved that my 1968 assessment had been correct, but, on the other hand, my opponent in this match was very, very much stronger than I had believed possible when I started the bet.” Shortly after winning the bet, Levy, in turn, offered a prize of $1,000 to the first programming team that would write a program capable of beating him in a four- or six-game match—to which the magazine Omni added another $4,000. It took some years (and one more failed attempt by the program Cray Blitz in 1984), but by 1989 the time had come. The program Deep Thought managed to beat Levy in a four-game match, winning all four games—the true end of an era. Well, Levy’s era. “I was quite happy,” he said much later. “I’d had a good run for my money: 21 years against an original bet of ten years. I think I sort of held out the human end versus machine struggles in chess pretty well. I got a lot of publicity; it was very good for my career.” While computer engineers were hopelessly optimistic in the 1960s and 1970s, chess grandmasters were eager to point that out, if only to defend their special status as intelligent thinkers. And they were right: those early chess programs were, simply put, rather terrible at chess. Another factor was that their progress was plodding. Back then, computers gained less than 200 rating points in strength per decade—a gap that humans can often bridge with a few years of studying and playing the game. In his famous 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, a discussion about the development of chess computers inspired Douglas Hofstadter to coin “Hofstadter’s Law”: “It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.” According to Hofstadter, Herbert Simon’s flawed prediction in 1957 was “just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter’s Law.” Although it would take some more years before humans had reasons to be worried, a small revolution did take place in the computer chess world in 1980, when the program Belle won the Computer World Chess Championship in Linz, Austria, ahead of 17 other programs. Developed by Ken Thompson, Belle was named after Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Bell Labs), where Thompson worked four decades after Turing. Thompson is a legendary name within computer science: as the developer of multiple programming languages and as one of the two creators (alongside Dennis Ritchie) of the Unix operating system—the foundation of Apple computers and Android phones. “Ken is the smartest person I ever met,” the German computer chess expert Frederic Friedel told me. Thompson wrote his first chess program to work in Unix in 1971, which saw many different iterations over the following years. It grew particularly strong after Joe Condon, a colleague of Thompson’s at Bell Labs, implemented a hardware-based move generator to be used with the software version of Belle. In 1980, running on an LSI-11 computer with that special piece of “chess hardware,” it could calculate 100,000 to 200,000 moves per second. Computer programs were now also participating in human tournaments, making them eligible for an Elo rating. In 1983 Belle became the first computer to attain the rating of a “master” under the terms of the United States Chess Federation (USCF) titles system. Kasparov–Deep Blue, 1996 On June 5, 1985, five months before he beat Anatoly Karpov and became the 13th World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov played a remarkable simultaneous exhibition in Hamburg, Germany. All of his opponents were microcomputers. The four leading companies of the time that produced chess computers for the consumer market, Hegener & Glaser, Fidelity Electronics, Novag, and SciSys, all participated with their strongest four models. Kasparov won all games: 32–0. He likes to refer to this time as “the good old days of computer chess,” and it’s understandable why. The 1980s would be the last decade in which humans could still laugh at computers playing chess. Incidentally, in that same year of 1985, three computer science graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—Feng-Hsiung Hsu, Thomas Anantharaman, and Murray Campbell—created a chess program called ChipTest. It was based on new Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) technology that allowed millions of transistors to be placed onto a single chip. Hsu had worked on a special chess-move generator chip—in other words, a chip specially designed to do one thing: play chess. Such chips were then duplicated and used in parallel, and, as a result, his early program could search approximately 50,000 moves per second. “I had the basic blueprint to build the mother of all chess machines, a machine that could defeat the world champion. In other words, I had a chance to pursue one of the oldest holy grails in computer science and possibly make history,” the Taiwan-born Hsu would later write. Further development improved ChipTest significantly in terms of programming and search, and in 1988 it was renamed Deep Thought, after the supercomputer in Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. A year later, now capable of searching 720,000 moves per second, Deep Thought won the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship with a perfect 5–0 score. It attracted even more attention when it participated in an open tournament in Long Beach, California, and became the first computer to beat a human grandmaster in an official tournament. The victim was none other than Bent Larsen, a former world championship candidate from Denmark. Later that year, Deep Thought defeated David Levy, who made the wager described earlier in the chapter, 4–0. Meanwhile, Kasparov had made friends with the aforementioned Friedel, who had co-organized the computer simul that Kasparov played in 1985. Based on correspondence between Friedel and the Deep Thought team, it’s interesting to see Kasparov’s thoughts on computers back then: Beginning of 1988: “Computers will never beat grandmasters.” Mid-1988: “Computers will never beat strong grandmasters.” End of 1988: “Okay, yes, Bent [Larsen] is a strong grandmaster. But a computer will never beat Karpov or me.” Kasparov played Deep Thought a bit later, in October 1989, at the New York Academy of Art. He won both games easily, which was only the start of IBM’s journey. Murray Campbell had joined the company in September, and Hsu joined a month later after defending his thesis at Carnegie Mellon. Hsu worked as a system architect and chip designer at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in Westchester County until 1999. How he and Campbell ended up at IBM is a great story. Peter Brown, who had earned his PhD in computer science at Carnegie Mellon, was working at IBM’s speech group, developing computer software to transcribe spoken text. Brown had heard about Hsu’s team and project. In his 2002 book Behind Deep Blue, Hsu wrote: Peter happened to be in the men’s room with Abe Peled, the IBM Research Vice President of Computer Science. They started talking about how expensive the Super Bowl TV commercial spots were. Peter suggested that he knew a way to gain much greater publicity at a far lower cost. He knew this group of graduate students working on computer chess at Carnegie Mellon, and he believed that this team would create the first chess machine to beat the world champion. Given the historical significance of the quest and the latent public interest, IBM could stand to gain huge advertising value from the endeavor. Oh, yes, members of the team were world-class people that IBM would be interested in hiring anyway. Abe got interested and asked Peter to look into it. In early 1996, the time had come for the biggest man versus machine clash in history. Finally, the world chess champion himself would sit down at the board facing a silicon opponent with, literally, nerves of steel. Kasparov had agreed to play IBM’s latest iteration, now named Deep Blue (after IBM’s nickname Big Blue), in a six-game match that would celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was played February 10–17 at the Philadelphia Convention Center for a $500,000 prize fund, with $400,000 going to the winner. Deep Blue was running on an IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer. Located in a lab in Yorktown Heights, New York, the 36-way machine consisted of 16-CPU frames plus four workstations, with 216 chess chips working together, and using an opening book developed by the American grandmaster Joel Benjamin. This meant that during the opening phase, the machine didn’t need to think but could rely on pre-programmed moves that were known to be good from human grandmaster practice. Six and a half years after its younger brother Deep Thought lost without a chance against Kasparov, Deep Blue proved up to the task: it won the first game (see annotated game on pages 389–90). It was a historic first victory for the computer against the strongest human player in a long time control game. Apart from the incredible search speed of 100 million positions per second, there was another reason why this computer was so strong. Hsu explained that the special chess chips evaluated the game positions more thoroughly than any other chess program: “Almost all the evaluation function terms were computed directly on chip.” As the computer scored its first win, the match was instantly front-page news, covered by outlets such as the New York Times and USA Today, and on television by The Tonight Show, Late Night with David Letterman, and Saturday Night Live. The interest in the match exceeded all expectations. “The IBM match website quickly turned into the most popular website up to that point in time, exceeding even the Super Bowl website and the Swimsuit Edition website of Sports Illustrated,” wrote Hsu. Chess fans had trouble accessing the site, and IBM dedicated another IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer, identical to the one running Deep Blue, to handle the server load. During a walk with Friedel on the streets of Philadelphia on the evening of that first game, Kasparov asked his friend: “Frederic, what if this thing is invincible?” It wasn’t yet. In the second game, Kasparov immediately took revenge, after which two draws followed. The score was equal, but Kasparov finished with two wins to win the match convincingly—not knowing this would be the last time a human ever won a multi-game match against a computer. The 1997 Match: The Holy Grail With all the media attention the match had attracted, it didn’t take long for IBM to suggest a return match the following year, and Kasparov agreed. This historic encounter for chess and AI was held May 3–11, 1997, in the Equitable Center in New York City, then headquarters of the Equitable Insurance firm. All over Manhattan there were posters on billboards with a portrait of Kasparov watching over chess pieces, and the tagline: “How do you make a computer blink?” The spectators watched from a 480-seat auditorium in the basement, with grandmaster Yasser Seirawan, then international master (now grandmaster) Maurice Ashley, and computer expert and international master Mike Valvo as commentators. Incidentally, they had access to Fritz 4, so they could pick another silicon brain whenever they wanted. There were three huge projection screens at the front. The left screen showed live footage from a studio on the 35th floor, where the games were played. For this rematch, IBM developed a new RS/6000 SP supercomputer with double the CPU speed, 480 new chess chips and a new evaluation function based on training games with grandmasters. Its calculation speed had also doubled to a staggering 200 million positions per second. The machine weighed over 1.5 tons and cost $10 million to construct. The prize fund was $1.1 million, with $700,000 for the winner, but both sides knew much more was at stake. Unlike the first match, this time the media attention was huge from the very start. Two hundred journalists showed up for the opening press conference, including the crews of TV networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox, and the BBC. As the match progressed, more and more reporters arrived, and the press conferences had to be moved to a bigger room. The media labeled the match as a clash between man and machine, with Newsweek’s cover calling it “The Brain’s Last Stand.” Six years later, Hsu wrote in his book that he saw it differently: as a match between “man as a performer and man as a toolmaker.” Kasparov playing the black pieces in one of the games of his 1997 rematch with Deep Blue, this day operated by IBM system architect Feng-Hsiung Hsu, right. Over the first four games, the match score completely mirrored the year before. This time, the 34-year-old Kasparov started with a win but then lost the second game, followed by two draws. His victory in the first game went surprisingly easily, but the Deep Blue team was quite content afterward. They were happy with the overall level of play they had seen and knew they only needed slight adjustments to fix the issues from game one, mostly related to the correct evaluation of king safety. Then came the second game—in hindsight, the key game for the whole match (see annotated game on pages 390–91). Deep Blue played remarkably well in a fairly “closed” middlegame, meaning a position with a blocked pawn formation in the center. Normally speaking, humans were better in those types of positions that required long-term maneuvering. Kasparov didn’t know that Joel Benjamin had trained the machine for months, especially for such positions. The computer had more space and skillfully used a potential open file, doubling its rooks before opening it. This reminded me of a famous maneuver by Kasparov’s nemesis Anatoly Karpov, who once used a bishop to “close off” a file before taking control of it. The programmers were happy that a recent update to their evaluation function of Deep Blue, which appreciated open files more, came to fruition. Unexpectedly, the computer opened a new front on the kingside (a move that felt strangely human!) before entering with its pieces on the queenside. Kasparov decided to sacrifice a pawn, but Deep Blue surprised everyone again by not accepting the sacrifice. It played a quiet bishop move instead—another move reminiscent of the chess played by Kasparov’s greatest human rival. “Maybe they gave Karpov a call in Moscow,” joked one of the commentators during the game. The move was subtle but lethal, and, a few moves later, Kasparov threw in the towel. It was the best game ever played by a computer: real chess, played in human style. It had passed the Turing Test gloriously! But there was one issue: Deep Blue’s last move wasn’t good at all. You could even call it a blunder. Later that evening, the English journalist and organizer Malcolm Pein, who was in close contact with both IBM and the Kasparov team, received a phone call from the Norwegian American grandmaster and reporter Jonathan Tisdall. “I think I have a story, but nobody wants to use it,” Tisdall said. “Did you see Ferret’s analysis? It gives zeros!” Tisdall was referring to the analysis engine of the Internet Chess Club (more on that in Chapter 8), which also suggested the final position to be equal. “I thought that was a mistake, but after Tisdall’s call, I gave it a closer look,” said Pein. “And then I broke the story in the Daily Telegraph: ‘Kasparov Resigns in Drawn Position.’ ” As it turned out, Kasparov could have entered White’s position with his queen and played for perpetual check (endless checks, out of which there is no escape, leading to a move repetition). Friedel came to the same conclusion after analyzing the position with his chess engine Fritz, and the next morning he told the Russian grandmaster Yury Dokhoian, Kasparov’s main chess assistant. Dokhoian was shocked to realize that it could be true. Of course, he had discussed that final position with Kasparov the night before, but they had overlooked an important possibility that was part of Friedel’s analysis. When the team went for a walk to have lunch, Dokhoian told Kasparov the bad news. Friedel wrote, “Garry clutched his head and froze in the middle of Fifth Avenue. There were no expletives, no cursing, just stunned silence.” It was a combination of disbelief and confusion. How could a computer that strong, from a position with an overwhelming advantage, suddenly allow a draw? According to Hsu, Deep Blue’s strange choice resulted from some kind of bug, but this crucial piece of information was only revealed six years later. To Kasparov, the difference between Deep Blue’s level of play in games one and two was night and day, which further fueled his suspicions that something was off. Two draws followed, and the mirrored score with the 1996 match ended when the fifth game was also drawn. With a tied score, the sixth and last game would decide everything. Minutes before the start of that final game, fans were still trying to get into the Equitable Center. Hsu wrote, “The official price for a place in the 500-seat auditorium was $25, but spare tickets are changing hands for as much as $100. It’s the hottest gig in town.” In the opening, a Caro–Kann defense, Kasparov played a risky move order, which allowed White to play a promising piece sacrifice based on long-term compensation. If the computer decided against it, Kasparov would have an easy game—the expected scenario. The sacrifice was supposed to be too long-term for a computer to evaluate properly and something only humans would play unless it were part of the machine’s opening book (Deep Blue’s “homework” created by IBM’s grandmasters’ team). Kasparov must have estimated the odds of that almost zero since he rarely played the Caro–Kann. Without spending time on the clock, Deep Blue gave up its knight instantly, shocking Kasparov and viewers across the globe. Kasparov’s king was soon deprived of the right to castle and had to run for safety. Deep Blue continued the game with simple developing moves to fully mobilize its army and threw in some powerful pawn pushes on the queenside to reach a winning position as early as move 19. It was suddenly all over: Kasparov was blown off the board. He had lost the match (see annotated game on pages 391–92). How could Deep Blue know it had to sacrifice its knight? In his 2002 book, Hsu wrote that the move was indeed part of the opening book: “The position on the playing board had actually shown up in our lab about a month earlier when the other grandmasters were working on Deep Blue’s opening book. At the time, the grandmasters did not bother to play out the position either; they just looked at Deep Blue’s evaluation of the position and moved to other work.” In a controversial interview in 2009, one of the team members, the Spanish grandmaster Miguel Illescas, shared a different version of what happened: White’s crucial eighth move had been included in the opening book the morning before the game was played. According to Kasparov, who wrote down his thoughts on the match in his 2017 book Deep Thinking, that was too much of a coincidence: “The odds of winning the lottery are quite attractive in comparison to those of the Deep Blue team entering a specific variation I had never played before in my life into the computer’s book on the very same day it appeared on the board in the final game.” It should be noted that another Deep Blue team member, Joel Benjamin, later said that Illescas’s statement was simply not true; White’s eighth move had been part of the computer’s opening book for a long time. I decided to double-check with Illescas for this book. He replied in an email, saying he agreed with Joel, who “knew better about the Caro–Kann.” Malcolm Pein has his own theory about what happened. “It still annoys me to this day,” he told me in December 2023. “They [Kasparov’s team] were convinced that Deep Blue was taking its opening moves from Richard Lang’s ChessGenius program, a popular engine at the time, and asked me to buy a copy. I told them I was a hundred percent certain it wasn’t using that, but they were convinced. I spent quite a sum of money at the chess shop near Huntington Station and gave them the program. They were misled. They misled themselves.” After his resignation, Kasparov’s mother convinced her son to take the elevator to the 50th floor for the post-match press conference, where he faced hundreds of photographers and reporters. Hsu: “He stared into the middle-distance, over everyone’s head, avoiding eye contact and scarcely blinking, looking like he might spontaneously combust. There was only mild applause when the winning Deep Blue team arrived; it was as though everyone was slightly embarrassed or perhaps afraid to cheer for fear of offending the mighty Garry.” People applauded when he took the microphone, though, and as soon as he started talking, Kasparov started to dominate the conversation. He wasn’t happy. “I’m sorry, I haven’t deserved that, and I have to apologize for today’s performance, but I don’t think it has anything to do with chess or the match. I had no real strength to fight, and I think the result of the so-called ‘game’ today was justified,” he stated. Standing among the reporters, the members of the Deep Blue team had been told by the company’s PR people not to smile. As Kasparov continued, they didn’t have much reason to anyway. “I think it’s time for Deep Blue to start playing real chess, and I personally assure you, everybody here, that if Deep Blue will start playing competitive chess, I personally guarantee you I’ll tear it into pieces, with no question,” Kasparov said fiercely. He then pointed his arrows to the several grandmasters who had helped the Deep Blue programmers: “How many players they will hire, they have to put more players, of course, on the bench because some of them are probably too shy to show up; they can hire the entire [grandmaster] force of the United States of America, it will not help because we know how a machine plays.” He wasn’t holding back: Kasparov thought the match had been unfair. “Put it in competitive chess, put it in a fair contest, not that one, make IBM a player, not a sponsor at the same time. I will see what’s going to happen, and I think it’s just the beginning,” he said. But within days, IBM announced there wouldn’t be a third match. And why would there be? For them, there was hardly anything to gain. Their match victory led to incredible global media coverage and did only good for the company’s value. Some have suggested it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars in PR. IBM claimed that the entire Deep Blue project had cost them $20 million, and after the second match their market capitalization increased by billions overnight. Remember IBM’s Peter Brown complaining about the cost of a Super Bowl advertisement in the men’s room and realizing the potential of those chess developers to create something of bigger value? Well, that kind of came about, didn’t it? In another funny twist, during the 2001 Super Bowl television broadcast, Pepsi ran a spot featuring Kasparov, clearly inspired by the match. This time, Kasparov defeated the computer (modeled on HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation of 2001: A Space Odyssey) but then got troubled by an elevator and a Pepsi vending machine, the machines taking revenge. The price for a 30-second Super Bowl ad was roughly $2.2 million at the time. Most experts believe Kasparov was still stronger than Deep Blue in 1997—so why did he lose the match? Because he was human. Already during the match, Kasparov admitted that he got carried away, in an interview with the English grandmaster Daniel King that was included in King’s 1997 book on the match. The day after the fourth game, Kasparov told King: “Game 2 took a lot of energy out of me; afterward I was really furious. I couldn’t prepare normally. I played games 3 and 4 in a big crisis.” One of the things Kasparov was not happy about was that IBM had declined his request to see the logs of the played games. Some of Deep Blue’s moves seemed overly human (such as not accepting his pawn sacrifice in the second game), so he wanted to see the exact lines of what it had been thinking about. In his 2002 book, Hsu would call this “a request for an unfair advantage,” adding that the match “would have been a sham if he were given free access.” In any case, Kasparov’s psychological state wasn’t where it should have been. In hindsight, he forecasted his demise in that conversation with King before the fifth game: “Whatever happens in this match, I know Deep Blue can be beaten unless the man—in this case me—is not in the right mental condition. It can only win because of human weakness.” Those turned out to be prophetic words. One of Kasparov’s strategies in the match was that he played more quiet openings than usual because he felt Deep Blue would struggle more against those. It has been suggested that Kasparov would have fared better if he had used his normal openings, but I feel that his mindset was a much more decisive factor. Kasparov is a rather emotional human being. There’s nothing wrong with that, but as soon as all the suspicions about human interference and other negative thoughts started to dominate his mind, he could no longer play his best chess. I also think Kasparov could have beaten Deep Blue in that second match if only he had played his best chess. After winning the first match in 1996, Kasparov had estimated the computer’s strength at roughly 2700, and it had taken IBM six years to reach that, being rated roughly 2550 in 1990. “I had trouble believing they could get it up to my 2800 level without a few more years of development,” was Kasparov’s position then. Besides the fact that IBM was going to invest millions—having seen what this match did in PR terms and what potential a possible victory had—what Kasparov underestimated was that there was also a chance for him not to perform at 2800 level the next year. Because of the enormous pressure, because of this particular opponent, one which lacked emotion, and because the match was only six games, a psychological disturbance could change a lot—and that’s what happened. Kasparov self-destructed. Was Deep Blue Intelligent? With each new product of AI research—from IBM’s Deep Blue to their Watson, which defeated human opponents at Jeopardy!, to ChatGPT—the same old question pops up: “Is it intelligent?” After winning his first match against Deep Blue in 1996, Kasparov wrote an article in TIME magazine titled “The Day I Sensed a New Kind of Intelligence,” where he reflected on the fact that, for the first time, he felt that a computer had played in a rather human manner. However, the way it figured out those human moves was not the same. Kasparov wondered: “So the question is, if the computer makes the same move that I would make for completely different reasons, has it made an ‘intelligent’ move? Is the intelligence of an action dependent on who (or what) takes it?” At that point, he felt he might have a few more years left before a computer would beat him, but it turned out to be only 15 months more. In his 2017 book Deep Thinking, Kasparov firmly said no to the notion that he had lost to an intelligent entity: “Deep Blue was intelligent the way your programmable alarm clock is intelligent. Not that losing to a $10 million alarm clock made me feel any better.” Deep Blue’s main programmer, Feng-Hsiung Hsu, agreed here, noting subtly, “It is only a finely crafted tool that exhibits intelligent behavior in a limited domain. Garry lost the match, but he was the player with the real intelligence—Deep Blue would never be able to come up with the imaginative accusations.” Two decades after losing the match, Kasparov elaborated on his point about losing to an alarm clock. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman in 2019, the 13th World Chess Champion said: Considering chess as the sort of pinnacle of intellectual activities was our mistake because we just thought, “Oh, it’s a game of the highest intellect, you have to be intelligent, and you could see things that the ordinary mortals could not see …” It’s a game. All machines had to do with this game was to make fewer mistakes, not to solve the game. Because the game cannot be solved … I think that is what we have to learn from the 1997 experience and from further encounters with computers and sort of the current state of affairs with AlphaZero beating other machines. The idea that we can compete with computers in so-called intellectual fields: it was wrong from the very beginning. Kasparov already knew in 1997 that computers would soon take over from humans, but he played the match anyway because he felt (and rightly so) that he was still capable of postponing the inevitable a little longer. The insight he had gained two decades later was that in the long run, computers will always be better than humans at avoiding mistakes in closed games with perfect information, which forms only a small subcategory of what we call intelligence. Game six of the 1997 match was Deep Blue’s last official game. After dismantling, it was separated into two halves, with one sent to the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC. IBM held onto the other half for a few years before donating it to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Deep Blue’s victory over Kasparov didn’t stop humans from playing chess against computers right away. In fact, it would take almost a decade for everyone to agree that computers were better chess players than humans, as we will see in the next chapter. There, we will also learn about another pivotal moment for AI and chess—the appearance of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, and what it meant for the game.",

      "content": "Chapter 6Beyond Deep Blue: Age of the Neural Networks “The current top 100 would completely annihilate the top 100 from 50 years ago. They are extremely tougher, tactically more adept, and understand more positions, thanks to computers but also in general terms.” —Erwin l’Ami, grandmaster, 2023 One afternoon in the spring of 2000, the Dutch grandmaster Paul van der Sterren’s phone rang. On the other end of the line was Sytze Faber, a member of the board of the Dutch Chess Federation. Shortly before the call, Van der Sterren had received his official invitation to the upcoming Dutch championship, which would take place in May of that year and, for the fourth time in a row, in Rotterdam. But this time, everything would be different. Faber notified him of a remarkable plan: he wanted to have a computer participate in the tournament. “I still remember exactly where I was standing in my living room when I got that phone call,” Van der Sterren told me during a conversation for this book. “He informed me about this plan, and I felt the floor below me crumbling away. ‘What the hell is this? This cannot be true,’ I thought. But soon, I realized he was serious.” Van der Sterren protested, but Faber had already decided: “Sorry, Paul, but it’s going to happen.” Although Deep Blue retired after the 1997 match, programmers of other chess engines, running on ordinary machines instead of $10 million supercomputers, still tried their luck for a few more years against human opponents. Or was it the humans who were trying their luck? As long as they could still put up a fight, man versus machine chess remained exciting and provided opportunities for publicity. At least, that was what Faber must have thought when he arranged for one of the 12 participants of the Dutch championship to be a special edition of ChessBase’s program Fritz, called Fritz SSS*. It was the first and only time in the long history of chess that a computer had participated in an official national championship. The whole situation was highly controversial, if not bizarre, and was covered in international chess magazines. Two local journalists gave the same verdict independently of one another in their newspaper columns: “out of their minds” and “everyone has gone mad.” But it all went according to Faber’s plan. Except for Van der Sterren, the participants were persuaded to participate and play the computer in one of the rounds thanks to a sizeable increase in the prize fund from 100,000 to 170,000 guilders (equivalent to roughly €77,000 or $70,000 today; this was two years before the Netherlands adopted the euro). The money came from multiple sponsors, many related to the computer world, while ChessBase had somehow managed to set up an excellent deal as it only had to pay 12,000 guilders ($5,500). Meanwhile, several angry chess fans set up a website under the name Chess Protest, where the name of the computer program was changed to “Fritz $$$” and which received many statements of support against Fritz’s participation. Wasn’t a Dutch championship supposed to determine who was the country’s best human player? Van der Sterren said, “I found it absolutely unethical to have a computer playing in a human championship, which would then be a disrupting factor. It just wasn’t fair, a kind of distortion of competition. I wanted to keep the tournament pure.” Paul van der Sterren in action during the 1986 Dutch Championship. The organizers had decided that if one player didn’t want to play against Fritz, they would receive zero points for that game and not share in the 70 percent extra prize money. If two players didn’t want to play, the whole thing would be put off, and Fritz wouldn’t participate. Besides Van der Sterren, two other players expressed unhappiness about the situation but played anyway. One participant, international master Manuel Bosboom, did sit down at the board against Fritz but resigned after four moves. It was not that he wanted to make his point without losing his money; he realized that if he didn’t play either, none of the participants would earn the extra money. Van der Sterren, who lived in Amsterdam, didn’t even bother to make the trip to Rotterdam. His clock was started, and, after an hour, his game was declared a win for Fritz (following regulations) without a single move being played. Van der Sterren was praised by chess journalists and received many messages of support from all over the country. Several media requested interviews, including the popular talk show Barend en Van Dorp, but Van der Sterren refused. He didn’t want to join the hype and give the sponsors their desired publicity. Fritz SSS* beat four players (besides Van der Sterren), drew with four others, and lost two games. Many Dutch Chess Federation officials were unhappy with the situation and, after the tournament ended, they decided that this computer stunt was a case of “once but never again.” Within a few weeks, Van der Sterren noticed financial compensation of a few thousand guilders in his bank account. End of an Era: The Last Man vs. Machine Matches Humans played against computers for only a few more years. Vladimir Kramnik, the Russian player who dethroned Kasparov in 2000 to become the 14th World Chess Champion, tied a match with Deep Fritz 7 in Bahrain in 2002. Kasparov tied two matches against the programs X3D Fritz and Deep Junior in 2003. Three years later, the writing was on the wall when Kramnik lost a match to Deep Fritz 4–2, one that went down in history after witnessing the biggest blunder ever committed by a reigning world champion. Kramnik allowed a checkmate in one move in game two; an incredible oversight (see annotated game on pages 395–96). Soon afterward, ChessBase started advertising their latest program, Fritz 10, with the tagline: “Ask Kramnik how it feels!” As if Kramnik’s loss wasn’t enough, humanity had suffered another, even bigger loss a year earlier. Playing from the Wembley Conference Center in London, the top English grandmaster Michael Adams didn’t stand a chance against a computer called Hydra, backed by Abu Dhabi money. It ran on a 64-way cluster computer: basically, 64 computers connected and operating like a single machine. Hydra was a true monster, aptly named after the multiheaded serpent-like creature from Greek mythology. It won the match with a devastating 5½–½ score. Adams had barely scraped a single draw and lost five games. Looking back at the history of man versus machine matches, I feel Adams–Hydra signaled the moment when computers truly conquered mankind. In those years, the top engines Fritz, Junior, and Shredder were probably already stronger than Deep Blue, but with the appearance of Hydra, all doubt disappeared. At the time, the English grandmaster David Norwood reached the same conclusion: “Last week saw the end of humanity. When Deep Blue beat Kasparov eight years ago, there was still a great deal of doubt. If a top human grandmaster focused on the weaknesses of their artificial opponents, they could still win. The Wembley match between Britain’s Michael Adams and Hydra finally buried that notion. The Terminators have won.” Organizing further man versus machine matches became entirely pointless as the years went by. To borrow Kasparov’s comparison, who would want to see Usain Bolt try his luck against a Ferrari? Occasionally, odds matches have been held, where the computer is handicapped in different ways to see what it does to its level and whether a grandmaster would have a chance. Like taking one of the wheels off that Ferrari, the computer would play without one or two pawns, or start without its queen’s rook, while the human played without its queen’s knight. In most cases, the human grandmasters would still struggle against the computer. Where humans had to throw in the towel long ago, computers still compete against computers. Unlike those early tournaments in the 1970s, today’s programs run in the cloud and compete on online servers. The TCEC (Top Chess Engine Championship) is a well-known competition, while Chess.com runs its own Computer Chess Championship. Such computer versus computer games are the highest-level chess you’ll encounter on this planet. Still, most fans can’t be bothered with it, just as they wouldn’t watch two soccer teams with perfect defenses who therefore almost always played out 0–0 draws against each other. They prefer watching humans play other humans. Beauty lies in imperfection. There are, for example, many theoretical endgames where it wouldn’t make sense to watch computers play it out since the result would already be known because of their flawless play. The same endgames played among humans are often still fascinating to watch. “Do they know this position? Do they remember all the details? Can they find the narrow path to the win with just a few minutes left on the clock?” Identifying with that struggle as a viewer while the grandmasters are sweating at the board is what sport is about. Early Computer Preparation These days, Kasparov is much more interested in working with AI instead of against it. Soon after his last match with Deep Blue, he was already wondering: “What if the combination of a human and machine would play chess? Wouldn’t that lead to the highest possible level of play?” Kasparov tried it out in 1998 when he played an unusual match with the top Bulgarian player Veselin Topalov in León, Spain. He called it “Advanced Chess.” During the game, alongside the chess set and clock, both players had a PC available at their table, running on Pentium II 333 MHz processors and using the chess program of their choice. It was the complete opposite of what is allowed in serious tournaments or online chess. Two conclusions were drawn from this match, which ended in a tie. First, the games were far from the perfection the organizers and participants sought, as the time to choose the moves was limited to an hour per player. Also, Kasparov’s superiority in tactical play over Topalov was nullified as the assistance of the computer likely benefited Topalov more. The Advanced Chess experiment was only organized five times. Still, the co-operation between humans and computers has changed chess as a sport dramatically, but in a different way. I am talking about an essential aspect of chess here: preparation for the opening phase. As soon as the computer started beating grandmasters, it became a powerful tool for analyzing games and positions. Amateurs and grandmasters affectionately began to refer to their chess program as “my silicon friend.” An early adopter, Kasparov remained ahead of his peers in computer preparation for years. At one point, he called himself “the best-prepared player in the history of chess.” Even strong opponents sometimes avoided playing their favorite openings against him, fearing a powerful “novelty,” a home-cooked new move that would push them into unexplored territories where only Kasparov knew the way. In 1999 he said, “There is a computer, and you should not ignore that fact but adjust to it. It’s something you must do, whether you like it or not.” This is true indeed, especially nowadays, so in that sense, Kasparov was a pioneer. A famous example of Kasparov’s domination in the opening came in game ten of his world championship match against Viswanathan Anand in 1995 (see annotated game on pages 388–89). On move 14, Kasparov played a stunning theoretical novelty in the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez opening. He sacrificed a pawn, followed by a rook. Although Anand defended admirably, he couldn’t avoid a loss. Afterward, Kasparov revealed that he had analyzed the rook sacrifice extensively with the engine Fritz. It was the first time the computer had helped a player win a chess game at the highest level. But working with the computer might have harmed Kasparov five years later. He lost his world title to Vladimir Kramnik in 2000 after the latter continuously played the infamous Berlin defense against his Ruy Lopez. It is a variation where the queens are traded early; play kind of skips the middlegame and moves straight into the endgame. White game after White game, Kasparov kept trying to tear down his opponent’s “Berlin Wall” but he failed to win this endgame even once. (In world championship matches, players alternate playing as White and Black. The advantage of being White is somewhat similar to being the player to serve in tennis. Following this analogy, Kasparov could only tie his service games.) “Kasparov has never been open about it, but I believe one of the reasons he was so obsessed with this endgame was because the computer was giving him an advantage,” the top Dutch grandmaster Anish Giri told me. In other words, Kasparov put too much faith in the computer’s positive evaluation of the endgame. Giri: “He kept thinking, ‘I must be better.’ And kept digging through that endgame. He kept going for it, and then he would offer a draw very early because he would realize during the game, ‘Okay, I don’t understand why I’m better.’ I think a massive issue was that the computer wrongly said that White is better.” Nowadays, top grandmasters consider the move suggestions made by modern chess programs to be something rather close to the Ultimate Truth. During that Kasparov–Kramnik match, and for a few years afterward, computers were considered helpful tools, but ones that couldn’t be fully trusted yet. It was Kramnik’s turn to end up on the wrong side in his 2004 world championship match when he faced a bright talent of the new generation: the Hungarian Peter Leko. The match was played in Brissago, Switzerland, for a $1.2 million prize fund. After seven games, the score was equal. The day before his fourth turn with the white pieces, Kramnik told his team that he was ready to fight Leko’s Marshall Gambit, another variation in the Ruy Lopez where Black sacrifices a pawn for activity. His team wasn’t fully ready yet, and one of his helpers, the Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler, stayed up all night analyzing with a computer engine. He shared his work with Kramnik the next morning. Eighteen moves into the game, Leko had only 17 minutes left on the clock to reach move 40, meaning he had less than one minute on average for his next 19 moves. Having made prepared moves only, Kramnik had a hundred minutes left for his next 19 moves. But something was wrong. Vladimir Kramnik, left, and Peter Leko, right, during Game 2 of their 2004 world championship match in Brissago, Switzerland. Back in his hotel room, Svidler was following the game on his laptop. The more it progressed, the more worried he became for his boss. “I lay down and, for some reason, couldn’t get to sleep, although we hadn’t slept all night. Something was nagging inside me …” Svidler was quoted in the 2007 book From London to Elista by Ilia Levitov and Evgeny Bareev, and soon it would become clear what it was: a glaring error. A small but crucial part of the analysis that he had provided in the morning contained a big hole. And, now that the game was underway, the only person who could save Kramnik from falling into the ditch was Kramnik himself—but that day, he was too optimistic. For his 19th move, Kramnik made the rational decision to do something … irrational. “I understood that if I wanted to win this game, then a move—no matter how different—needed to be made quickly,” Kramnik said in From London to Elista. He had a choice of more or less forcing the game to end in a draw or playing a dangerous move, and, backed by Svidler’s computer prep, he confidently went for the latter. He explained his decision with gambling terminology: “And I took the decision to play for a win, enlisting the support of the computer. I played va banque, it’s hard to blame anyone here, even myself. I didn’t make a mistake, one could say that I placed ‘everything on zero.’ ” Kramnik went for a risky line that involved the sacrifice of his queen. He would then promote one of his pawns to get a new queen, and Leko’s counterplay would come too late—was the idea. As it turned out, Kramnik put too much faith in the computer. Sitting at the board and using his human brain, Leko refuted his opponent’s computer homework and demonstrated that his counterplay was on time. While Kramnik’s pawn was on its way to becoming a queen, his king was getting checkmated. Leko won in 32 moves (see annotated game on pages 394–95) and took the lead in the match, which he maintained for five more games. The computer accident could have had historic implications. It was only in game 14, the last game of the match, that Kramnik beat Leko in a must-win game, leveling the score to 7–7 and retaining his world title. (It would be the last time a world championship match was played without a tiebreak.) What went wrong exactly? Was Leko a better calculator than the computer? Not really, unless the computer wasn’t given enough time to calculate. Because of the enormous number of positions that had to be checked overnight, Svidler had given the engine perhaps only a minute or two to calculate what turned out to be the critical position in the game—much less than Leko had at his disposal behind the board. It was later discovered that if Svidler had given the computer about 30 seconds more to look at that critical position, the engine would have changed its evaluation in favor of Black, and Kramnik would not have lost the game. Modern Preparation An indication of how strong chess engines have become over the last two decades can be gleaned once you realize that, in 2024, an engine like Stockfish will tell you the correct evaluation of the Kramnik–Leko position in less than a second. Modern-day engines are simply too strong to allow such accidents to occur. As a result, the quality of grandmaster preparation is exceptionally high these days. At the same time, preparation is not as enjoyable as it used to be, at least according to two world-class “preparation experts”: both the Dutch grandmaster Erwin l’Ami (who was part of Veselin Topalov’s team of seconds before and during the 2010 World Chess Championship, and who now works for Anish Giri), and also Peter Heine Nielsen (a second to both Viswanathan Anand, between 2005 and 2013, and Magnus Carlsen, from 2013 till present). “Back in the early 2000s, chess computers would be okay tactically, but positionally there was still much left to be desired,” explained l’Ami. “This meant that the human part of the work was more significant, and analyzing was more interesting. It is less enjoyable these days because your own input is not so important any more. Especially in major openings like the Ruy Lopez or the Catalan, you can hardly make headway.” In the early days, developing new ideas in complicated positions and catching opponents off-guard was still possible. L’Ami once won a game entirely thanks to preparation when he played the Ukrainian grandmaster Vadim Malakhatko in 2003 (see annotated game on pages 393–94). He had devised a new idea, analyzed it with an engine, and memorized it all in his head. Because Malakhatko played exactly as predicted, l’Ami got to play his idea and didn’t need to think at all. The time control was 90 minutes for the whole game and a 30-second “Fischer bonus” per move. At the start of the game, l’Ami’s clock showed 1:30; at the end it was 1:41. He had made so many moves without thinking that he had gained 11 minutes on the clock by the time Malakhatko resigned. Nielsen told me, “Back then, computers were quite weak, so if you used them properly you had a massive advantage over your opponent. You would try to dominate your opponent with preparation, and you could do it successfully.” Strong preparation meant checking the opponent’s games, having more knowledge than them, having more ideas, and finding holes in the opponent’s opening repertoire. “When I play in the Bundesliga [the German chess league] these days,” continued Nielsen, “I feel I no longer have an advantage over weaker players because preparation has become too easy. Twenty years ago, I felt I had a massive advantage simply because the technology was weaker. You could still use it, but you had to use it very intelligently and aggressively, while nowadays it’s almost automatic. The tool has become too good, becoming a big equalizer.” According to Nielsen, chess preparation used to be closer to science, where you could put a human hypothesis to the empirical “computer test.” It was much more of a cooperation between man and machine, similar to Kasparov’s Advanced Chess idea. These days, it’s much more practical; it’s about finding which moves are the most unpleasant for the opponent. “The practical component is always to try to win a chess game. I now fully look at it from a sports perspective,” said Nielsen. The higher levels of opening preparation these days have led to a higher level and perhaps even more interesting type of play, according to grandmaster and chess commentator Maurice Ashley: The players have benefited enormously from what AI has done, showing how to defend better, knowing when you can actually sacrifice a pawn for the initiative. Before, people were just doing it cavalierly. But now you have to really have super-refined judgment around this sort of thing. And now they are even entering worlds that no one would enter before, positions that are almost impossible for humans to play. It’s so chaotic. But people can study it carefully and enter complicated openings. So I think the level of chess is elevated dramatically as a result, and we’re seeing more and more interesting positions, far beyond what we could have seen before. There is one caveat, though. Everyone has access to the same super-strong computer engines, so if you find a remarkable tactical idea, you can be sure your opponent has found the same idea. You must find other areas to make life difficult for your opponent. Two common methods are trying to surprise your opponent or test their memory. Almost all top players play a wide range of openings, so there are always opportunities to play something the opponent doesn’t fully expect. As White, players can play the pawn in front of their queenside bishop, their queen’s pawn, or their king’s pawn, while moving the king’s knight toward the center is another good first move. You just cannot predict any more what they will do. This is entirely different from, for example, the times of Bobby Fischer, who spent almost his entire career only playing his king’s pawn on the first move. Today, players can play a lot more openings and variations than in the old days because the computer has shown them to be playable, as Anish Giri explained to me: “The stronger the engine gets, the more it shows that variations that were considered bad before are no longer bad because the engine is able to defend them. Even what used to be a dubious opening turns out to be playable if you defend accurately and the engine shows how to defend. The King’s Gambit is an extreme example, but it doesn’t lose. Nothing loses.” While playing many different opening systems, players tend to go for long and complicated variations regularly, hoping their opponent doesn’t remember all the details. Both at the top and at amateur level, chess has become a bit of a memory game in the opening phase. There are many examples to be found in top-level chess. In a game Giri played against the US grandmaster Fabiano Caruana at the Superbet Chess Classic, held in May 2023 in Bucharest, Romania, the players agreed to a draw after 26 moves. The opening was the popular Italian Game but became highly complex early on, with Giri having to calculate a queen sacrifice that would eventually lead to a draw by move repetition. The Dutchman spent about an hour and ten minutes calculating (or rather, digging up from his memory) the moves, while Caruana, like l’Ami in the above example, ended the game with more time on his clock than he started with. He had done his homework, and Giri had passed the memory test (see annotated game on page 400). Another reason why players have to memorize so much more than they used to is down to the internet, which we’ll talk about much more in the third part of the book. Because of the enormous increase in online tournaments, players are playing hundreds of games a year more (at faster time controls) than they used to. “I play like 700 games a year now,” said Giri. “In many of those games, I play something that is an opening that I looked at, so relevant things, and my colleagues also did that. So now the database is flooded with games and all sorts of different openings, and you’re not even able to digest all the games.” At my chess club, many young players study chess openings fanatically. Amateur players tend to exaggerate the importance of memory, says Giri: “You have to realize that memory is only relevant between two players of approximately equal strength. If you are an amateur and memorize everything, but you are bad at chess, then you might not be good enough to hold it, and you will lose any final position you managed to recall. But if you have two top players, they’re so good that by the time they reach the final position of their analysis, they might be able to play it out well. So it’s just a memory game among top players, but not elsewhere; you cannot replace top level with memory.” In 2010, when l’Ami and Nielsen were part of the opposing teams in the Anand–Topalov world championship match, the memory aspect played a role from the get-go. A difficult middlegame position came on the board that both teams had looked at before the match, where Topalov sacrificed a pawn in return for an attack on Anand’s king. The Indian, who was defending his title in this match, knew that, at some point, he had to make a king move toward the direction of the center of the board, but he couldn’t remember at which exact moment. He played it one move too early and lost the game instead of drawing it. Anand had failed the memory test, but would end up winning the match (see annotated game on pages 396–97). Because of the tsunami of available information on chess openings, the most recent development is that top players tend to avoid playing variations that require deep memory. “It seems that there isn’t a memory savant in top chess right now,” said Giri. “None of the top players have an insane memory, even for people with the so-called best memory, like Magnus. I can show you countless examples of him misremembering things. So they started changing strategies and you see that players are not all playing the same forcing lines any more. People change strategy.” The Arrival of AlphaZero On December 5, 2017, a watershed moment in the history of computer chess occurred. It was the day Google DeepMind released a preprint paper introducing their chess-playing computer AlphaZero. At that time, the strongest chess engine was Stockfish, an open-source program originally developed by Tord Romstad from Norway and Marco Costalba from Italy. Costalba had come up with the name Stockfish. It refers to the unsalted fish dried on wooden racks in Norway by cold air and wind, which is also exported in large amounts to the Veneto region of northern Italy, where Costalba lives. His explanation: like the fish, the chess engine is an original Norwegian product further developed in Italy. The DeepMind paper revealed that this little fish had experienced a close encounter with a giant chess-playing shark—a hundred-game match between AlphaZero and Stockfish 8—which had not even been close. The shark had beaten—no, obliterated—Stockfish by scoring 28 wins, 72 draws, and not a single loss. AlphaZero was ridiculously strong. The other thing was how it got so strong. Without being fed any knowledge except for the chess rules, AlphaZero had reached a superhuman level in just four hours of playing games against itself. My colleague and friend Mike Klein found a good metaphor in his story for Chess.com at the time: “This would be akin to a robot being given access to thousands of metal bits and parts, but no knowledge of a combustion engine. Then it experiments numerous times with every combination possible until it builds a Ferrari. All that in less [than half the] time than it takes to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The program had four hours to play itself many, many times, thereby becoming its own teacher.” When I spoke to him for this book, Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad added a little nuance: “This four-hour claim is kind of true, but at the same time also kind of ridiculous, because they were using an immense amount of hardware, like thousands of machines training in parallel. If you wanted to do this at home, it would take about 40 years.” Even so, the news about AlphaZero was just mind-blowing, and over the next few weeks the chess world was talking about nothing else. I attended the London Chess Classic as a journalist that first week of December 2017, with Mike, which allowed us to interview a few strong players and get their first reactions to the news. Magnus Carlsen’s assistant Peter Heine Nielsen said: “After reading the paper but especially seeing the games, I thought … well, I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they play chess. I feel now I know.” Garry Kasparov, who had quite a bit of experience with computers himself, already saw broader implications: “We have always assumed that chess required too much empirical knowledge for a machine to play so well from scratch, with no human knowledge added at all. Of course, I’ll be fascinated to see what we can learn about chess from AlphaZero since that is the great promise of machine learning in general—machines figuring out rules that humans cannot detect. But, obviously, the implications are wonderful, far beyond chess and other games. The ability of a machine to replicate and surpass centuries of human knowledge in complex closed systems is a world-changing tool.” Hassabis and DeepMind Google DeepMind’s CEO, Demis Hassabis, was a fanatic chess player in his youth and nothing less than a child prodigy. As a teenager, he used some of his prize money to buy himself his first computer, and soon he was creating his own programs. He cofounded DeepMind in 2010. From the start, DeepMind has focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence, combining it with neuroscientific insights and new computer hardware developments. In his introduction to the 2019 book Game Changer, a fascinating, chess-technical exploration of the style of AlphaZero, Hassabis formulated his company’s ambition: “To build intelligent systems that can learn to solve any complex task by themselves, and then use this technology to help find solutions to some of society’s biggest challenges and unanswered questions.” Hassabis has stated in many interviews that he wants to “solve intelligence” and then use intelligence “to solve everything else.” Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis at the 2018 London Chess Classic. DeepMind’s first notable success came in December 2013 when its learning algorithm Deep Q-Network (DQN) achieved expert-level scores in Atari games by teaching itself using only the raw pixels on the screen as inputs. A year after Google (now Alphabet) purchased DeepMind for a reported £400 million ($650 million) in 2014, Hassabis’s company pulled off something more significant. Their neural network algorithm AlphaGo became the first machine to beat a world champion in the board game Go, an achievement that, according to experts, came decades ahead of its time. As Go is even more complex than chess (see page 32), creating an engine that plays on the level of strong human players is even more difficult. An evaluation function is hard to build because the many possible moves on each turn make it harder to use brute-force calculation, the type that looks at every possible move in the tree of possibilities. For humans, Go is a rather intuitive game. Computers can do a lot, but they lack intuition, right? DeepMind approached this challenge differently from existing Go-playing programs (and AlphaGo quickly defeated those programs before taking on humans). AlphaGo utilized deep neural networks, a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. Like the brain, it uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure. The mathematical relationships between those layers are constantly updated during data training. In this case, AlphaGo was trained on a large dataset of expert Go games, enabling it to learn from human knowledge and patterns. Another aspect involved reinforcement learning: AlphaGo played numerous games against different versions of itself, thus gathering data and refining its strategies over time. (Neural networks are very versatile, and by training them they can learn to perform many different tasks, such as recognizing cats and dogs by looking at thousands of labeled examples.) Yet another innovative technique was the use of a value network (reducing the depth of the tree search) and a policy network (reducing the breadth of the search) to efficiently evaluate positions and make decisions based on what it had learned previously. It also ran on powerful hardware infrastructure, including multiple high-performance GPUs, to process all possible moves and positions quickly. One factor behind AlphaGo’s success wasn’t new: the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic search algorithm that simulates random sequences of moves that are part of the search tree. As it goes with artificial intelligence, at some point, the moment comes when the best humans need to be challenged and defeated. Go experienced its Kasparov–Deep Blue moment in May 2016, when a five-game match was played in Seoul, South Korea, between AlphaGo and the South Korean top Go player Lee Sedol, one of the few on the planet who had reached the highest level there is, 9 dan. Before the match, Sedol had shown confidence, expressing that he expected to win without losing a single game. It went quite differently: he lost the first three games, then won one, but also lost the last game to go down 1–4. Three and a half years later, Lee announced his retirement from playing Go: “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated.” Apart from crushing a world-class player, which was a complete sensation, the style in which AlphaGo played was highly remarkable—to the extent that several books were subsequently written on the topic (something that would happen with AlphaZero too). In particular, AlphaGo’s 37th move in the second match game went down in history as truly special. “It was a move so unthinkable that some of the world’s top Go players who were live commentating thought there must have been some sort of mistake, and yet more than a hundred moves later, this stone turned out to be in the perfect strategic place to decide the outcome of the game,” wrote Hassabis. After their resounding success at Go, the next step for the DeepMind researchers was to work on the notion of generality: they wanted to create a single system that was able to perform well in any type of two-player, perfect information game. DeepMind’s December 2017 draft research paper demonstrated that their latest algorithm AlphaZero could reach a superhuman level without receiving human knowledge but just by playing against itself in three different board games: chess, shogi (Japanese chess), and Go. Like with AlphaGo two years earlier, AlphaZero’s chess style was applauded. It played aggressively, sacrificing pieces and pawns to enter super-complicated positions, demonstrating the style of former world champions such as Mikhail Tal or Garry Kasparov. The latter wrote: “I was quite happy to see AlphaZero’s dynamic sacrificial style. Not only because it mirrored my own, but because it could play like this and win against a fearsomely accurate elite program.” Interestingly, AlphaZero searched roughly 80,000 positions per second, a far cry from the 200 million positions per second that Deep Blue was capable of in 1997. AlphaZero’s search, therefore, had to be more efficient. How exactly AlphaZero was “thinking” was something even the people at DeepMind found hard to explain. The program did have an evaluation function, but not based on human input, only on “personal” chess experience. How it valued aspects of chess positions “remains a bit of a mystery,” said one of the developers. Another one described it as “developing something akin to ‘intuition.’ ” What is clear, though, is that the general approach to chess computers has come full circle. Turing and Shannon knew that the computers of their time could not be successful with a brute-force, look-at-all-moves-all-the-time approach, so they suggested selective (“Type B”) search that focuses on the most relevant moves. They couldn’t know how quickly computers would grow faster. For them, it was impossible to predict that brute-force calculation would remain a successful approach for so long, used in all the major chess computers, including Ken Thompson’s Belle, IBM’s Deep Blue, and other programs that followed. And now, although it does run on highly sophisticated hardware, AlphaZero looks for its moves in a way that is smarter than ever before, in a way Turing and Shannon had in mind. There is another parallel with those early days of AI. Turing and Shannon were the first to admit that developing a well-playing chess program was not a goal but a means to solve problems of “greater significance.” It is precisely this approach that we see with Demis Hassabis and his colleagues at DeepMind, who, step by step, move from game-specific algorithms based on imitation learning to general, fully self-supervised learning systems. AlphaGo learned to play Go by looking at human games, and then AlphaGo Zero learned by just playing against itself. AlphaZero became more generic as it taught itself to play, only by playing against itself, multiple board games. The next step was MuZero, a computer program DeepMind launched in 2019 that can learn games without knowing the rules. Apart from managing to (once again) become super-strong in chess, shogi, and Go, MuZero also taught itself 57 Atari games from scratch. Another step followed in late 2022 when DeepNash was launched. DeepMind’s latest AI agent could play Stratego at a human expert level, winning nearly all the matches it played against other AIs and scoring an 84 percent overall win rate when competing against human players in online games. What was new this time was that AI was doing well in a game with imperfect information: in Stratego, the players are hiding which pieces are placed where. DeepMind have applied their experience with board and computer games, and their increasingly abstract, self-supervised learning systems, in many different areas of society. For instance, ideas similar to AlphaZero have been used to control the cooling systems in Google’s enormous data centers, saving a lot of energy. The best example, in terms of helping to solve problems of “greater significance,” however, is AlphaFold, DeepMind’s AI program, which performs predictions of 3D protein structures. Described by Hassabis as “Fermat’s Last Theorem applied to biology,” the computational algorithm analyzes the amino-acid sequence of a protein. It uses a deep-learning neural network to predict how that sequence folds into a 3D shape. As a result, AlphaFold has pro-vided biologists with invaluable insights into the functions and interactions of proteins, which is beneficial to the discovery and development of new drugs, can assist in things like pandemic preparedness, and helps in understanding how the human body works. While Hassabis feels that AlphaFold is the most complex and meaningful system DeepMind has built, his ambition is unlimited. He says he is thinking about some of the biggest challenges in science today, such as a room-temperature superconductor, virtual cells, and quantum simulation. DeepMind’s ultimate goal? To create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that learns to perform any intellectual task humans can. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT was the first to reach global fame, major companies like Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are all developing their own large-language models that are seen as a big step toward AGI. DeepMind’s AI system, called “Gemini,” was first released in December 2023. It uses techniques from AlphaGo. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman, recorded in July 2022, Hassabis told the story of his last meeting with Stephen Hawking not long before the theoretical physicist passed away. Hawking was interested in DeepMind’s work, and the two spoke for hours. Hawking said goodbye to Hassabis with the words: “I wish you the best of luck, but not too much.” Fruit Fly We have seen that chess has played a key role in developing AI research from its infancy to the present day. From Turing to Hassabis, important researchers used the game of chess as a stepping stone toward more important areas—but, it should be noted, sometimes in the face of opposition. If a professor and their team of students are using their valuable time and resources to create a machine that can play chess, you can imagine there will be people thinking: “Are these guys just having fun?” AI’s “founding father,” John McCarthy, addressed this issue during a presentation he delivered in 1989 to the Conference of the Canadian Information Processing Society in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He noted that the famous comparison (also mentioned in Chapter 3) between chess and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), often attributed to McCarthy himself, is not his but was first made by the Soviet mathematician and computer scientist Aleksandr Kronrod. In the 1950s and 1960s, Kronrod was the director of the mathematics division at the Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Kronrod was interested in artificial intelligence and indirectly involved in his laboratory’s chess research. McCarthy suggested that Kronrod might have used the comparison between chess and the fruit fly “as a defense against physicists when they complained that he used so much of their precious computer time in a mere chess match.” Alas, the defense didn’t hold up for long, and in 1968 Kronrod lost his directorship as higher functionaries were indeed skeptical of the research group’s focus on chess and other games. Kronrod’s analogy was prophetic, as chess would become highly important for developing the AI research area, similar to the fruit fly dominating the history of genetic sciences. Both chess and the fruit fly formed an experimental platform that provided a consistent and controlled environment for investigating different hypotheses. The analogy didn’t hold up for long either. From that similar starting point, chess and the fruit fly went different ways in their respective fields. Whereas Drosophila research “matured” over the decades—starting from chromosome mapping, then expanding with the investigation of new wild varieties of flies, to eventually become an important area for the study of patterns of inheritance and population genetics—chess research remained a somewhat limited field of AI. Because brute-force techniques (Shannon’s Type-A thinking) kept being so successful, there was no need for research into Type-B thinking, which would have developed AI more broadly at an earlier stage. McCarthy was a good sport after losing his bet to David Levy in 1978. When he sent his check, he wrote in his letter that he wasn’t too unhappy about losing the bet. He had hoped that Levy would lose to an intelligent program, but the progress made so far was mostly in computer programs relying on the brute-force calculation approach. After Kasparov’s loss to Deep Blue, McCarthy wrote in an article in Science in the same year: “Computer chess has developed much as genetics might have if the geneticists had concentrated their efforts starting in 1910 on breeding racing drosophila. We would have some science, but mainly we would have very fast fruit flies.” Nathan Ensmenger, an associate professor at Indiana University, Bloomington, wrote a paper in 2012 where he pointed out: “Unlike Drosophila, however, and despite its apparent productivity as an experimental technology, computer chess ultimately produced little in terms of fundamental theoretical insights.” That was three years before AlphaGo arrived; five before AlphaZero. I spoke to Ensmenger for this book, and he agreed that the latest developments in computer chess are fundamentally different and have resulted in much more useful ideas (some of which will be discussed in this chapter). If McCarthy were still alive, he would probably have changed his mind too. Chess and Neural Networks Seven years after AlphaZero arrived on the scene, the chess world is heavily influenced by this new type of chess computer based on neural networks and reinforcement learning. While DeepMind did not develop AlphaZero further, the open-source community, spearheaded by programmer Gary Linscott, continued to work on its own neural network-based engine, Leela Chess Zero (Lc0)—announced in January 2018, just one month after DeepMind had published its first preprint paper on AlphaZero. AlphaZero was never made available to the public, but Lc0 quickly became an invaluable tool for professional players. Well, the ones who knew about it. Peter Heine Nielsen told me about his early experience with Leela that year, admitting he was late to the party. He’d checked it out a few months before Magnus Carlsen’s world championship match against Fabiano Caruana, which took place in November 2018 in London. He was not impressed. “I thought it was too weird. It wasn’t developed enough yet and seemed quite weak tactically,” said Nielsen. “Caruana was using it, but we were not. That was probably a mistake but not a real disaster.” A few months into 2019, Nielsen could appreciate Leela’s uniqueness: “Its understanding of chess is just amazing. In early 2019 it was my impression that some of us were using it—for example, Anish Giri—and some of us were not. Those who were not using it were getting completely trashed in the opening.” Giri’s second, Erwin l’Ami, said, “Leela somehow understands chess as we do. By playing these millions of games against itself, it knows what space is, what a ‘bad bishop’ is. It can evaluate a position properly in a fraction of a second.” To be among the early adopters of Leela was like having inside information on the stock market. Nielsen: “For half a year, nobody would talk about this until it became clear that everybody knew about it.” The edge given to players who used both Leela and Stockfish probably deserves some explanation. Say you had two top players, Carlsen and Giri, who had to play each other the next day in a big tournament. Both were using the latest version of Stockfish, but only Carlsen’s team was running Leela simultaneously. This meant that team Carlsen knew exactly what Giri’s team were looking at (accessing the same Stockfish analysis), as well as having the extra information from Leela. Each time Leela’s evaluation would be more accurate than Stockfish’s, Carlsen would have a big edge in the analysis because Leela knew Giri’s weak spots and how to tackle them. Stockfish and Leela together form a strong tandem for analysts, with Stockfish being super-strong in pure calculation and Leela coming up with “human” ideas regarding long-term positional play. The Stockfish developers were paying close attention. In the summer of 2020 they announced that they would incorporate an efficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) into a new version of their program. Stockfish 12, or Stockfish NNUE, was released in September 2020 and combined the brute-force computing approach of the traditional Stockfish with the advanced evaluation capabilities of neural network chess engines such as AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero. The evaluation function of the traditional Stockfish was stripped out and replaced with a neural network evaluation function. The result was spectacular: according to the developers, Stockfish 12 was a whopping 100 Elo points stronger than Stockfish 11. At the time of writing, Stockfish has won the last nine seasons of the Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC) main league event and dominated most of the Computer Chess Championships on Chess.com. As of June 2024, Stockfish tops the Computer Chess Rating List (CCRL) with a stratospheric 3641 rating. What does it mean for a human to analyze chess with a computer that strong? Are these engines now finally telling the absolute truth about chess positions? Nielsen thinks so: “We have said that before in the past, and we were wrong. But now I think we are right. If you had asked me in 2017, I would have said that technology is near-perfect. I mean, Stockfish was already incredibly strong. But then it got completely crushed by AlphaZero. I cannot imagine today’s Stockfish getting crushed that way.” Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad still isn’t certain his engine has plateaued: “That’s a very good question, and I’m not confident about my reply because I keep getting surprised. When I started, I thought the chess engines were playing very close to perfectly, but much later, around the Stockfish 8 times, I thought, ‘Surely you couldn’t make something much better?’ so it had to be close to perfect now. But I keep getting surprised. There never seems to be a ceiling.” The English grandmaster Matthew Sadler, co-author of several books about neural network chess engines, has a hard time believing that we’ll see another huge jump in strength due to new technology. “It’s hard to imagine,” he told me. “But that’s what we said about the classic Stockfish as well, some years back. But it is hard to think that there is much more space in chess to find something absolutely amazing.” Asked if he feels that the modern engines understand the game of chess, Sadler replied negatively: “They don’t understand any-thing; they don’t even know they’re playing chess, really. Still, it feels that way. Their pieces are going on great squares. The thing about neural nets is that they maximize mobility. They’re never letting themselves get into positions where their mobility is restricted, and [they] take actions from miles ahead to avoid that. When they’re playing, their pieces are glowing with power, somehow.” I agree with Sadler that the chess played by these modern programs is truly something special. For instance, when analyzing chess openings, they suggest the strangest moves as early as move three, as if they are playing chess from another galaxy. It feels like the chess we have played as humans for centuries is being reinvented almost from scratch. I can hardly imagine that I will encounter such an experience again in my lifetime, but you never know. A New Style of Playing Chess Apart from reaping the benefits from analyzing and preparing with them, top chess players have also been influenced in their playing style by neural-network chess computers. As noted before, AlphaZero’s style was quite attractive, and its open-source offspring Lc0 and the new Stockfish have inherited similar traits. They taught human players lessons unknown in the 1,500 years that the game had existed, and modern-day grandmasters are using those lessons in their tournament play. A clear case is Magnus Carlsen himself. In January 2019, the Norwegian star—still the classical world champion then—got hold of the book Game Changer. Few chess players have read as many chess books as Carlsen, and few chess books have directly impacted Carlsen’s play more than this book. The authors, Sadler and Natasha Regan, investigated more than 2,000 previously unpublished AlphaZero games and revealed its revolutionary thinking process. They presented stunning discoveries in areas like opening play, piece mobility, initiative, attacking techniques, and long-term sacrifices. The book’s title was not an exaggeration but prophetic: AlphaZero changed how chess is played at the top level. Carlsen has claimed he became a different player, inspired by the remarkable AlphaZero games. His second, Nielsen, wrote an article for New in Chess magazine where he demonstrated how Carlsen had adopted themes from AlphaZero, such as running up the board with a pawn on the outer edge, sacrificing pawns, and being more flexible with the concept of king safety—a truly inspiring story for any chess fan. As always, new generations are adapting more quickly to new technologies. In chess, the young, rising stars use computers better than older players. This became all the more clear when I interviewed the Bosnian-Dutch grandmaster Ivan Sokolov in the summer of 2022, shortly after he had captained the young Uzbekistan team to victory at the Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India. Born in 1968, Sokolov is a classical player and trainer who gained knowledge from reading books, studying top grandmaster games, and, of course, from his experience as a top player in the 1990s and early 2000s. But working with, for example, the Iranian-French prodigy Alireza Firouzja (born in 2003), opened his eyes regarding computers: What I faced, not only with Alireza but also with some other young players that I worked with, is that, for example, they come up with a proposal that is very unconventional for a known type of position—unconventional based on old knowledge. I would usually say, “If this works, I need to quote my friend Jan Timman, who said, ‘If it works, I need to learn chess again!’ ” But then I would get a comment like, “Yes, but the computer loves it.” Then we would do some analysis, and sometimes it would turn out that the computer was wrong, in the sense that the evaluation only works if computers are playing. For humans, the assessment can be different. Top-level chess has also become more concrete. Where, in the old days, grandmasters would dismiss certain moves because they would “look ugly” or “cannot be right in this type of structure,” young players think more in terms of, “If it works, it works.” Sokolov: You can have two approaches. First, you can have a mindset that you try to evaluate a position based on common knowledge, so pawn structure, space, bishop pair, king safety, potential of pawn breaks, possible trade of pieces—do I get a better ending, do I get a worse ending? Once you are done with all these elements, you calculate to try to find the best move and justify your judgment. But, of course, it can also go vice versa: that you calculate, and based on the variations that you calculate, you try to come up with an assessment of the position. I belong to the first school of thought, and I still believe this way is more justified, and it makes it easier for you in practical play to handle the position. But the direct element has become much more important than it ever was, and for this, we can thank computers. My understanding of this is that in the classical method a player judges a position based on their pattern recognition and intuition, and then tries to back up their evaluation by calculation. In the modern method, calculation comes first and dictates judgement, which allows for a more liberal, flexible way of looking at chess, without prejudice toward what has been common belief about how the game should be played. Matthew Sadler also feels strongly that modern chess engines are great teachers and are making the new generation of players stronger than ever before. In our conversation, he boldly stated that humans can break the 3000 Elo rating barrier, a gap of more than a hundred points with Carlsen’s peak rating. Sadler’s reasoning? All previous generations have been educated with books written by humans, and he has realized that most of those aren’t that good. “Take me, a 50-year-old grandmaster,” he explained. “I’ve been brought up with pretty crappy material. There were lots of books that were just wrong, where they said, ‘This is the theme in the position,’ but it wasn’t. Modern engines are showing that a lot of the time, the emphasis is all wrong. What you see is said to be the main theme, but it’s not. There’s some extra inner logic that’s important. If you train youngsters on really good material from the beginning and get their evaluation function really strong, you can certainly add another hundred Elo points to the current players’ level.” Where Hassabis hopes to have AI eventually explain us humans and the universe, Sadler sees AI helping humans to reach a higher understanding of their beloved game. Once again, chess is at the beginning of the next stages of AI development. Do We Need to Worry? In the November 1964 edition of USSR, a monthly illustrated magazine, the Latvian grandmaster Mikhail Tal, arguably the most “artistic” of all the world chess champions, spoke about the possibility of a “chess robot.” Tal wasn’t very optimistic: “I don’t think chess players need one. Chess would soon die if a robot turned up that could play better than anybody else, could play so well, in fact, as to be theoretically incapable of making a mistake. Poetry would die if a machine should suddenly appear that wrote better verses than humans. Chess not only implies creativity but performance too, and the most skillful performance would lose all meaning in such an event.” Tal’s remarks are similar to a quote I came across in January 2023, when the Bad Seeds frontman Nick Cave responded to a fan who had sent him a song that ChatGPT had generated “in the style of Nick Cave.” I can understand his reaction: The apocalypse is well on its way. What ChatGPT is, in this instance, is replication as travesty. It could perhaps in time create a song that is, on the surface, indistinguishable from an original, but it will always be a replication, a kind of burlesque.… Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don’t feel. Data doesn’t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn’t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. We cannot deny that there are also downsides to artificial intelligence’s effects on chess. The most obvious one will be discussed in the next chapter: computers have made it much easier to cheat. But even the legitimate use of chess engines has indirectly led to a negative development at the top level. The 2021 world championship match in Dubai between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi was Carlsen’s last world championship. On the podcast The Magnus Effect, on July 19, 2022, he had shocked the chess world by stating that he would no longer defend his world title. The main reason was that he wasn’t happy with the format any more. Due to the intense computer preparation with the top engines, his opponents could maintain a high level just by memory for 15 to 20 moves. With a lot of thinking time on the clock, they were becoming hard to beat in the remainder of the game. Carlsen felt that classical chess, with games that last several hours, was not the best way to determine the best player any more. At the same time, just as our society will need to adapt to even smarter versions of ChatGPT and the possible emergence of AGI, chess players and organizers will need to adapt to the new reality these super-strong chess engines bring to the table nowadays. Chess grandmasters have started playing many different openings with both colors, so that the surprise effect can nullify some of their opponent’s preparation. Amateurs like myself, who are also increasingly relying on engine-based preparation, are starting to do the same, and we might become better players because of it. Overall, I think most of what artificial intelligence has brought has been positive for chess. If we look at what’s happening with generative AI in the world of music or art, or the impact ChatGPT is having on society in general, it seems that chess stands out favorably compared to those other areas. In the chess world, we have learned to adapt to how AI has developed in our field, and, if we treat it well, the benefit from AI will outweigh any fear. More than a quarter of a century since man lost the battle to the machine, humans still play and enjoy chess games—even those played between computers. AI did not make chess irrelevant. On the contrary, chess still entertains and teaches us. The human aspect is still fully alive, and AI does not stop us from enjoying chess but helps us to appreciate it more—and so, in a way, it helps us in what it means to be human.",

      "title": "Chapter 7The Dark Side: Cheating in Chess",
      "content": "Chapter 7The Dark Side: Cheating in Chess “Chess must be established as a thoroughly straightforward and honest game first of all before it can be made a real gentlemanly one, and unscrupulous trickery, deception and fraud must be ‘warned off the track.’ But it requires a strong arm to accomplish that, and war on dishonest chessists cannot be made with rose water.” —Wilhelm Steinitz, International Chess Magazine, 1887 Holding a hotel key card in one hand and a pack of chewing gum in the other, American grandmaster Hans Niemann raises his arms as the tournament arbiter moves a Garrett handheld metal detector across his body. As it gets close to the chewing gum, the detector blinks a red light. Niemann smiles and opens the packet, which the arbiter puts aside for a moment as he continues his search. He then switches the Garrett for a smaller radio-frequency scanner and meticulously moves down Niemann’s dark blazer and trousers, carefully checking his tanned leather shoes before going up again. This is not an airport but the entrance to a chess tournament. A pre-game check for electronic devices such as mobile phones or smartwatches—not allowed on a player’s body during gameplay—is becoming standard in top chess. This particular check, however, is taking longer than usual. The clock on the TV screen shows 12:59 p.m. in St. Louis on Monday, September 5, 2022. The fourth round of the Sinquefield Cup is about to start. The annual ten-player super-tournament, among the most prestigious on the chess calendar and backed by Missouri-based billionaire Rex Sinquefield, is being held for the ninth time. The 19-year-old Niemann, from Connecticut, is a highly talented junior chess player who made a big jump in the world rankings during the COVID-19 pandemic. But he isn’t even among the world’s top 40 players. He has no business winning this one. None-theless, Niemann is the sole leader three rounds into the event after a spectacular result the day before, when he beat none other than Magnus Carlsen (see annotated game on pages 399–400), the world champion, the 31-year-old superstar from Norway. The GOAT? Carlsen the Mighty went unbeaten for 125 games between 2019 and 2020. In 2022 he had built another impressive streak: he hadn’t suffered a single loss in his previous 53 games. Until St. Louis. With his typical, unfiltered voice, Niemann commented after their game, “It must be embarrassing for the world champion to lose to me.” At the exact moment when the arbiter finishes his security check and Niemann walks into the playing hall, Carlsen sends out a tweet that shocks the chess world. “I’ve withdrawn from the tournament. I’ve always enjoyed playing in the @STLChessClub, and hope to be back in the future,” he wrote. Wait, what? Carlsen had once prematurely left a press conference, but never before had he stepped out of a tournament. The number of times a top grandmaster has deliberately withdrawn from an ongoing tournament can be counted on the fingers of one hand. In 1967, the erratic American and future world champion Bobby Fischer left the Sousse Interzonal Tournament after a dispute with the organizers over the scheduling of his games. In 2018 the Chinese number-one player and future world champion Ding Liren was forced to withdraw from the Norway Chess tournament after he broke his hip during a fateful bicycle ride. Carlsen’s decision was something the chess world had rarely seen before. “I am sitting here in a bit of a stunned silence; I don’t really know how to react to this,” said the popular commentator and top grandmaster Peter Svidler, perplexed about this unique moment for chess. “There will be some developments, I assume,” he added. It was the understatement of the year, considering what would happen in the months ahead. Carlsen’s tweet opened a Pandora’s box of speculation, primarily because of a video clip that he had attached to it. In it, soccer manager José Mourinho said, “I prefer, really, not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble.” The clip was a well-known soccer meme from 2014, when the Portuguese trainer, then the coach of Chelsea, was interviewed following his team’s loss to Aston Villa in the English Premier League. Mourinho was furious about some of the decisions by the referee but preferred not to speak for fear of retroactive punishment from the Football Association. What Mourinho wanted to say wasn’t immediately clear at the time (although he seemed to be suggesting mistakes from the referee), so what did Carlsen, a big soccer fan himself, mean by using this meme? Speculation started instantly on social media and wouldn’t stop for weeks. Mainstream media worldwide would report on what was to become the biggest scandal chess had ever seen. Chess had hit the fan. The Chess Speaks for Itself The narrative kind of started three weeks before the Sinquefield Cup when Carlsen and Niemann played each other four times in faster games at a tournament in Miami. Niemann, the lowest seed and an outspoken and confident newcomer, had started with a surprising win against the favorite before losing the next three games and their mini-match 1–3. Asked for a summary of that first game, the American teenager replied, “The chess speaks for itself.” He walked away from the camera, ignoring the follow-up question and perplexing the interviewer. It was the chess version of dropping the mic. The phrase “speaks for itself” became a meme, instantly added to the vocabulary of chess players and fans on social media. Niemann had quickly positioned himself off the board as the Conor McGregor of chess as he spoke with a bravado that evoked both cringe and delight. He was brimming with confidence, supported by his quick rise to the top. Less than two years after earning the grandmaster title at the age of 17, he had recently entered the world’s top hundred. Niemann’s ascent was aided by the fact that he was one of the most active grandmasters in the world, having played a string of tournaments almost back-to-back in Spain, Serbia, Italy, Montenegro, the US (Las Vegas, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cherry Hill), Portugal, Serbia again, the United Arab Emirates, Latvia, Uzbekistan, and Spain again. He was a one-man band on tour, his computer was his roadie, and his Uber Eats account his stage manager. In March 2022, Niemann was a guest on the popular Perpetual Chess Podcast, where he explained his regimen: “The time that I’m investing is a minimum of ten to 12 hours a day. I’m working very hard; I don’t have much of a social life, you could say. I don’t indulge in any distractions other than chess.” He didn’t hide his ambition and confidence: “The goal is to be the best in the world. I think it’s absolutely impossible for me to fail at this point because I am really just doing everything that I need to do, and I am investing every second of every day into improving my chess.” How important chess had become for him was revealed when he said, “If I do not reach the top ten, I think I will assess my chess career as a failure. I think [then] my life is a failure as well, if you wanna get deep.” He spoke with the same intensity as that other legendary American prodigy who famously became the chess world champion in 1972. “Just look at how Fischer lived his life before insanity,” said Niemann. “That’s the right way to do it, right? Before things went haywire, the way that he approached the game was absolutely inspiring. He was working entirely alone, he had a set regimen, and he was in great physical shape. He had no romance, no distractions. He was totally focused. And it paid dividends.” This 19-year-old brat: could he be the new Bobby Fischer? Carlsen, for one, didn’t think so. He hadn’t accused Niemann of wrongdoing by tweeting his goodbye to the Sinquefield Cup with that José Mourinho clip. At the same time, it was clear that he was implying it. But what point was Carlsen making, exactly? That Niemann had beaten him thanks to cheating? In a live stream on Twitch, the American top grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura was the first to say what Carlsen had only suggested while discussing the tournament’s fourth round, particularly Carlsen’s withdrawal. Nakamura had been streaming chess for four years (more about that in Chapter 10), was one of the biggest chess streamers in the world, with more than a million followers on Twitch and a million and a half subscribers on YouTube. When he talks—whether it’s about his games, a brewing scandal, or sushi—the world listens. Nakamura said, “I think Magnus believes that Hans probably is cheating.” Magnus Carlsen, left, and Hans Niemann, right, during their fateful game in the third round of the 2022 Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. While the scandal was getting bigger by the day inside the chess world, it soon became clear that it was rippling out into the mainstream media too. On Tuesday, September 20, 15 days after Carlsen’s tweet, one of the editors of the Dutch comedy radio show Spijkers met Koppen contacted me via a DM on Twitter (now called X). Would I be interested in talking about the chess cheating scandal in their next show? Four days later, I found myself in the studio in front of a live audience. More media would reach out to me in the days to come, something that hadn’t happened to me in over 16 years of covering chess. I realized how big this story was. Poker player Robbi Jade Lew was suspected of foul play after winning a $269,000 hand against poker pro Garrett Adelstein on an episode of the popular YouTube show Hustler Casino Live. She denied the allegations and an investigation into the matter concluded with no findings of wrongdoing. Two fishermen seeking a $29,000 first prize were disqualified from the Lake Erie Walleye Trail tournament after their fish turned out to be stuffed with lead weights. Both of these events happened in the fall of 2022 but neither got nearly as much media coverage as the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Why was that? One reason was because it was chess—the ancient, intelligent and highly respected board game had suddenly been connected to something as shady as cheating. Apart from that, there was the often thought-provoking communication (or lack thereof) by the main protagonists, and the endless speculation by fans, experts, and so-called experts. Oh, and then there was Elon Musk. Elon Musk and the Anal Beads The 30-year-old Canadian grandmaster and streamer Eric Hansen involuntarily played a crucial role in the story. In one of his streams in September 2022, viewers asked the question on everyone’s mind: how do you cheat over the board at a top tournament? Hansen said he didn’t know and mentioned the strict anti-cheating measures at the Saint Louis Chess Club. And then, it happened. A question popped up in the chat that would ultimately be the primary catalyst for this brewing scandal to explode into a global media frenzy. The subscriber asked: “What if he was hiding something in his butt?” Without hesitating, Hansen responded in his stream: “That’s probably a good one. An anal bead would probably beat the thing, the engine. I don’t know.” Later, Hansen would say he was joking, but the genie was out of the bottle. A theory was born: Niemann could have hidden something up his rectum, a device small enough to fit in that place where the sun doesn’t shine, but sophisticated enough to be connected to a chess engine and vibrate the information needed to make very strong chess moves. Really? Hansen’s theory would probably have been quickly forgotten if it hadn’t been picked up by none other than Elon Musk, the world-famous business magnate. Musk came across the anal bead theory and retweeted it to his 110 million followers on Twitter. With his retweet, Musk commented: “Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one sees (cause it’s in ur butt):—Schopenhauer.” He then also tweeted a screenshot from a lengthy comment on Reddit with the bizarre claim that Carlsen(!) had played with anal beads for years, and wrote in that tweet: “My version of Occam’s Razor: most entertaining outcome is most likely …” Musk followed up: “You can almost hear that snap of the rubber glove before chess match cavity searches.” It was thanks to these tweets (which were deleted a few weeks later, around the time Musk was completing his takeover of Twitter) that just about every single mainstream newspaper, magazine, TV and radio show, blog, or podcast in almost the entire Western world would, at one point or another, cover the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Popular non-chess streamers were picking up the story, such as Charlie White Jr., a.k.a. penguinz0, who at the time had over 11 million subscribers on YouTube. It was also discussed on The Joe Rogan Experience, the most popular podcast worldwide in 2022. Everyone was talking about it. Trevor Noah joked on The Daily Show: “I get why someone would use vibrating anal beads to cheat. Because, even if you lose, you still kind of win, you know?” In the same week, The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert briefly covered the story as well, and, in December, it featured on Saturday Night Live. On January 23, 2023, Niemann appeared as an answer on Jeopardy!—to “His name signifies ‘newcomer,’ and this relative newcomer sparked accusations of cheating after a 2022 upset of champ Magnus Carlsen.” In June 2023 an episode of the sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia starring Danny DeVito was entirely inspired by the saga. And in May 2024, the American film industry’s news website Hollywood Reporter announced plans for a movie titled Checkmate about Carlsen–Niemann with Nathan Fielder as director and Emma Stone as co-producer. It will be based on a 12-page book proposal from Ben Mezrich, the author of books adapted into films such as The Social Network and Dumb Money. Meanwhile, the chess world remained divided into two camps. While many held up the presumption of innocence and believed Niemann should be left alone until proven guilty, a majority was willing to give Carlsen the benefit of the doubt. The world champion had a flawless record of sportsmanship throughout his career and was known to be brutally honest and often self-critical. The army of Carlsen believers grew fast due to interviews Niemann gave in the official Sinquefield Cup broadcast. It seemed he had expected Carlsen to play a defense he hadn’t used in years, and Niemann’s explanation wasn’t all too convincing: “By some miracle, I had checked this today. It was such a ridiculous miracle that I don’t even remember why I checked it.” The French top grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave gave a very sensible comment after round five of the St. Louis tournament: “[Given] the information I have until now, I would say: no cheating. But then, of course, Magnus is also not known for going on witch-hunts and stuff like that. Maybe he has solid arguments, but I would like to see them.” Garry Kasparov, a member of the board of the Grand Chess Tour, of which the Sinquefield Cup was part, chimed in on Twitter: “Carlsen’s withdrawal was a blow to chess fans, his colleagues at the tournament, the organizers, and, as the rumors and negative publicity swirl in a vacuum, to the game. The world title has its responsibilities, and a public statement is the least of them here.” In an interview conducted a few weeks later, Kasparov was even more critical of his successor: “I think his behaviour was unacceptable.” Niemann Admits to Online Cheating It was after the fifth round when Niemann first commented about Carlsen’s hidden allegation. He gave a long monologue in defense of himself, addressing all the topics discussed on social media and elsewhere, one by one. It was one of the most extraordinary interviews given by a chess player. Why? Because he suddenly admitted to cheating, live, on camera. “When I was 12 years old, I was with a friend, and I was playing Titled Tuesday,” Niemann started, referring to a well-known weekly blitz tournament on Chess.com, where only players with a title (such as grandmasters or international masters) can play. He revealed that, while playing, his friend was feeding him moves based on a chess engine running on an iPad. “I was a child; I had no idea what happened,” he said. “This happened once in an online tournament. I was just a child, and nothing happened then. Now, four years later, when I was 16 years old during my streaming career, in an absolutely ridiculous mistake, in an unrated game.… Other than that, after I was 12, I have never, ever in my life cheated in an over-the-board game, in an online tournament. They were unrated games, and I’m admitting this.” Although he was emphasizing the insignificance of his cheating as a minor, his revelation showed what, for many, was a key aspect of the story: that Niemann had been willing to cheat. Suddenly it was easier to believe he could have done it again, perhaps even over the board—which was the opposite of what he wanted to achieve. After apologizing several times, saying he was “deeply ashamed” about his online cheating, Niemann launched a direct attack on Chess.com, the biggest among several online chess platforms. He revealed that he had received an email saying that the company had privately removed access to his account and that he had been uninvited from Chess.com’s Global Chess Championship (GCC). This $1 million series of online top events had started earlier in the year with online qualifiers and had reached the stage where top grandmasters were added to the field on an invitation basis. Niemann had personally been invited by Chess.com’s “Chief Chess Officer” (CCO) Danny Rensch a month earlier, so being removed shocked Niemann: “Right when I beat Magnus, they decide to remove my account and not let me play in the tournaments. This is absolutely ridiculous, and they’ve only done this because of what Magnus has said, what Hikaru says, and the entire social media and chess world is completely attacking me and undermining me.” In the end, Niemann said that the whole affair fueled him. He now wanted to win the tournament even more, even if demonstrating he was not using a device meant he had to play without clothes: “If they want me to strip fully naked, I’ll do it. I don’t care because I know that I’m clean, and I’m willing to subject myself.’ As there was a certain charm in the way Niemann expressed himself, the chess world still wasn’t sure what to believe. Perhaps there was only one way to find out, as the top American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana jokingly tweeted: “New chess format concept in light of recent controversy: The Speedo Speed Chess Championship. Thoughts?” Shortly after Niemann’s interviews, Chess.com came out with a statement signed by CCO Danny Rensch. It said the company had privately contacted Niemann to explain their decision to remove him from Chess.com and their events. The key part of the statement read: “We have shared detailed evidence with him concerning our decision, including information that contradicts his statements regarding the amount and seriousness of his cheating on Chess.com.” Did that mean Niemann had cheated more often than he had admitted to, and perhaps in more important games than he suggested? These questions remained unanswered for a while, and things calmed down somewhat during the second half of the tournament, where Niemann finished with three draws and two losses in the remaining rounds. Niemann wasn’t without supporters during this time. At the start of the eighth round, four young ladies were seen outside the Saint Louis Chess Club entrance on Maryland Avenue. They had come to cheer for Niemann and were holding up signs that said: “We LOVE Hans!,” “Gen Z’s LOVE Hans!,” “Hans Has Cool Hair” and “Hans Has an Awesome Accent.” More authoritative support came from Kenneth Regan in the Wall Street Journal. As an associate professor at the University at Buffalo, Regan has advised FIDE on anti-cheating matters for two decades, using an algorithm for statistical tests to identify computer-assisted chess cheating. Regan had looked at Niemann’s games and found nothing unusual. After the tournament ended, the debate continued on social media, where all kinds of theories were suggested regarding Niemann’s potential cheating in over-the-board play. Among these, some people claimed to have found strong evidence in some of Niemann’s games of him playing a suspiciously high number of moves approved by computer engines. Others pointed out methodological flaws in the research of these armchair statisticians. However, one analysis of Niemann’s games came with an authority that was hard to ignore. When a former world number two and the 2018 world championship challenger says something about chess, you take it seriously. In his newly launched C-Squared Podcast, Caruana commented on one game Niemann had played in 2022: “This game, to me, is quite extraordinary. It’s either the game of a genius or something fishy.” Carlsen Resigns It’s Monday, September 19, 2022, 10:00 a.m. on the West Coast of America; 7:00 p.m. in central Europe. The sixth round of the Julius Baer Generation Cup is about to start. The online tournament involves 16 strong grandmasters of different generations and is the seventh event in the $1.6 million Meltwater Champions Chess Tour. Fate has it that Carlsen is paired with Niemann on this day, and fans are on the edge of their seats. The online broadcast shows a big chessboard on the left of the screen and the faces of Niemann and Carlsen through their webcams. The renowned Hungarian commentator and former top grandmaster Peter Leko starts providing energetic commentary from the get-go: “D4. Because this is his main move. Knight f6, c4. Yeah, definitely. And … WHAT? No …” Co-commentator and international master Tania Sachdev of India quietly says, “What happened?” before she utters a loud “WHAT?” With the commentators still in disbelief, Carlsen turns off his webcam. It turns out he has resigned the game after making his first move, making it clear that he doesn’t want to play a game of chess against Hans Niemann. It’s a matter of principle. For the second time in a month, the world champion has shocked the chess world. This time, the reactions were less sympathetic toward the world champion. While some pointed out that he was affecting other players in the tournament by giving his opponent a free point, others demanded that Carlsen issue a statement. “It looks like he is clearly insinuating something, but until you catch someone, you cannot do anything,” said the Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, who was also competing in the tournament. “It just looks very odd now. Clearly, it all makes sense if, supposedly, Hans is cheating and he doesn’t want to play him. But if he isn’t, then it is really very wrong.” While FIDE refrained from commenting publicly, its president Arkady Dvorkovich issued a “personal statement” (though he used the first person plural) on September 23. It was openly critical of Carlsen’s decisions to withdraw from one tournament and resign after one move in another: “We strongly believe that the world champion has a moral responsibility attached to his status since he is viewed as a global ambassador of the game,” wrote Dvorkovich. “His actions impact the reputation of his colleagues, sportive results, and eventually can be damaging to our game. We strongly believe that there were better ways to handle this situation.” The president also noted that FIDE shared Carlsen’s “deep concerns about the damage that cheating brings to chess” and announced that it would task its Fair Play Commission with a thorough investigation. About a week later FIDE announced on its website that an investigatory panel had been formed to investigate the Carlsen–Niemann situation. On September 27, three weeks into the affair, Carlsen finally published a much-anticipated statement. He said he was as “frustrated” about the situation as the chess community. For the first time, he used the c-word, finally becoming more concrete after that mysterious Mourinho tweet he sent on September 5: “I believe that Niemann has cheated more—and more recently—than he has publicly admitted. His over-the-board progress has been unusual, and throughout our game in the Sinquefield Cup I had the impression that he wasn’t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as Black in a way I think only a handful of players can do. This game contributed to changing my perspective.” Carlsen’s remarks about Niemann’s demeanor during their game didn’t seem convincing, if only because, according to the experts, he hadn’t played his best chess himself in the encounter. At the same time, the biggest question remained unanswered: did the world champion possess hard evidence that showed Niemann had cheated? Carlsen’s use of language was obviously restricted for legal reasons when he wrote: “Unfortunately, at this time, I am limited in what I can say without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly.” Did Niemann need to give permission to get himself buried completely? The next big moment in the saga happened on October 5 when Chess.com published a 72-page document titled “Hans Niemann Report” on its website, signed off by CEO Erik Allebest, CCO Danny Rensch, and the company’s Fair Play team. The report had been shared with the Wall Street Journal shortly before publication and, on the face of it, dealt Niemann a heavy blow as the revelations seemed quite damaging. The company claimed he had “likely cheated in more than 100 online chess games, including several prize money events.” Chess.com listed 11 events between 2015 and 2020, including multiple Titled Tuesday events, Speed Chess Championship Qualifiers, the PRO Chess League, and several individual matches against highly rated, well-known figures in the chess community, each pointing to multiple games where Niemann “likely cheated.” Importantly, the report noted that, contrary to Niemann’s claims in his interviews, several of the games in which he was alleged to have cheated on Chess.com were rated and played in tournaments. In Niemann’s lawsuit this claim was described as “false.” Whereas anti-cheating expert Kenneth Regan hadn’t found suspicious data in Niemann’s over-the-board games, he agreed with Chess.com on their conclusions of Niemann’s online play. Chess.com’s tools to detect cheating are specifically intended for looking at online chess with fast time controls, so it was somewhat surprising that their report also discussed Niemann’s sharp increase in playing strength in over-the-board chess. This part of their report was mostly criticized afterward (for instance, it was pointed out that the Armenian American grandmaster Levon Aronian had shown similar progress as a teenager) and did not always coincide with Ken Regan’s conclusions regarding Niemann’s over-the-board play. But the Chess.com report was applauded almost universally for one thing: for the first time, the company allowed a peek into their anti-cheating kitchen. In order not to make it easier for future cheaters, the company couldn’t go into detail, but they did enlighten the chess world: The basic concept of cheat detection, particularly at the top level of chess, is both statistical and manual, involving: comparing the moves made to engine recommended moves, removing some moves (opening, some endgame), focusing on key/critical moves, discussing with a panel of trained analysts and strong players, comparing player past performance and known strength profile, comparing a player’s performance to performances of comparable peers, looking at the statistical significance of the results (ex. “one in a million chance of happening naturally”), looking at if there are behavioral factors at play (ex. “browser behavior”), and reviewing time usage when compared to the difficulty of the moves on the board. Other chess platforms also use some of these methods, but there are differences. Lichess, Chess.com’s biggest rival in the online chess market, published a blog post in August 2022 pointing out that they use different kinds of AI, including a neural network that detects “suspicious patterns in online play, and crucially doesn’t need to do an engine analysis on a sample of games to spot those patterns.” In suspicious but not clear-cut cases, games are sent for further review by human moderators. Online cheating is becoming increasingly problematic. In 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, over-the-board chess was impossible but online chess grew enormously, and so did cheating. In their report, Chess.com noted that over the course of more than 15 years of their existence, they had “closed the accounts of many non-professional online players, hundreds of titled players, dozens of GMs.” They had elicited cheating confessions from over 300 players, four of whom were in the FIDE top 100. In blog posts from September 2020 and February 2024, Chess.com revealed more numbers. Where, monthly, between five and six thousand players were banned from Chess.com in 2019, about 17,000 were banned in August 2020 alone. By the end of 2022 roughly 600,000 accounts had been closed. Lichess, back then about eight times smaller than Chess.com, had flagged more than 61,000 accounts around that time for using illegal external assistance, as noted in their “End of Year Update 2022.” In 2023 alone, after it had witnessed a significant growth in members, Chess.com closed just over a million of its 60 million active accounts. The company averaged more than 2,700 closures per day for engine use and another 258 closures per day for other types of fair play violations. Of these closed accounts, 89 belonged to titled players, including 11 grandmasters. Early in the pandemic, Chess.com hired three new employees to their Fair Play team that now consisted of a total of nine full-time employees: three statisticians, four cheat detectives, and two titled-player manual review experts. Three and a half years later, the team had grown to 17 members. The Australian grandmaster and scientist David Smerdon, whom we met in Chapter 3, conducted an online survey in 2020 with about a thousand respondents: anonymous chess players of different levels who provided information about cheating. One of the most striking results was that about one-fifth of the respondents admitted that they had cheated at some point in their lives. Two-thirds of those who admitted to cheating had used chess engines; the others found help in books or friends. The good news was that it only happened once in most cases, as most of them felt awful afterward. Also, if Chess.com caught them and gave them a second chance, the incidence of reoffending was very low. From this survey, the number of elite professional players who repeatedly cheated was just a fraction of 1 percent. While the methods used today to cheat are new (and even newer methods are likely to appear), cheating itself has a long and sorry history in chess. Before we wrap up the Carlsen–Niemann case, let’s first dive into this fascinating history. A Brief History of Cheating in Chess In the spring of 1770, the 36-year-old Austrian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen made a special appearance at Maria Theresa’s court in Vienna. The Habsburg empress and her entourage were eagerly awaiting a spectacle they had been promised six months earlier, and they were not disappointed. What Von Kempelen showed them that day would make an indelible impression and amaze audiences for decades to come. Tom Standage set the scene in his 2002 book The Turk: “When Maria Theresa indicated that he could begin, Kempelen brought his automaton in from a side room and wheeled it forward for closer scrutiny. It consisted of a wooden cabinet, behind which was seated a life-size figure of a man, made of carved wood, wearing an ermine-trimmed robe, loose trousers, and a turban—the traditional costume of an oriental sorcerer.” The cabinet was about four feet (1.2 meters) long, two and a half feet (76 centimeters) deep, and three feet (91 centimeters) high, and had a large chessboard screwed on its tabletop. Von Kempelen announced that he had created the first automaton that could … play chess. Before embarking on the first game, Von Kempelen opened several doors in front of and on the side of the cabinet, which revealed all sorts of wheels, cogs, levers, and clockwork-like machinery. He also made sure that the spectators could see right through the cabinet. After this inspection, he placed a set of chess pieces on the board and found a volunteer, a courtier called Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, who would be the Mechanical Turk’s first-ever opponent. Adding to the spectacle, Von Kempelen wound up the clockwork mechanism “with a loud ratcheting sound” (Standage), something he would repeat a few times during games. The figure behind the cabinet suddenly came to life, moved its head, and made the first move with its left hand. When it attacked the opponent’s queen, it would nod its head twice, and if it put the king in check, it nodded three times. If the opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, put back the piece, and make a move of its own. This automaton could not only play chess, it could play rather well. Cobenzl was easily defeated, and so were the other opponents that day. And the Turk could do even more. At the end of the show, it entertained the crowds by solving what is known as the Knight’s Tour, a mathematical puzzle where one single knight has to make a full circuit of the whole board, visiting all 64 squares just once. Von Kempelen gave more performances at the court for many distinguished international guests and toured through Europe with his Mechanical Turk in the mid-1780s. One of its opponents in Paris was Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman. As we know, Franklin was a passionate chess player, but he stood no chance against the machine. Eventually, the Turk played and lost to Philidor, the strongest player in the world at the time. It wasn’t an easy victory for Philidor, who believed his opponent to be genuine. After Von Kempelen died in 1804, his son sold the Turk to the German musician, inventor, and showman Johann Nepomuk Maelzel. It was the start of a second career for the chess-playing automaton that would eclipse the first. The most famous opponent of the Turk under Maelzel’s care was Napoleon Bonaparte (see annotated game on page 381). The French emperor also didn’t stand much of a chance. After Maelzel died in 1838, the Turk eventually ended up in the possession of John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, who repaired it and was the last to perform public shows. The Turk was then donated to the Chinese Museum in Baltimore, where it was destroyed in a fire on July 5, 1854. How did the Turk play chess? During its lifespan of more than 80 years, many reports appeared in newspapers and magazines with both simple suggestions and elaborate theories. One of those contributions came from 27-year-old writer Edgar Allan Poe in his essay “Maelzel’s Chess Player,” published in April 1836 in Richmond’s Southern Literary Messenger. Poe had seen the Turk in action in December of the previous year in Richmond, Virginia. He was not wrong when he declared that “It is quite certain that the operations of the automaton are regulated by mind, and by nothing else.… The only question is of the manner by which human agency is brought to bear.” The secret was that a human operator had always been in control, hidden inside the cabinet, and responsible for all those strong chess moves executed by the mechanical left arm of the Turk. The machinery and clockwork behind the cabinet’s doors were fake and intended to distract the audience, and the operator could easily hide thanks to a sliding seat. Over the years, several strong players acted as operators. The strongest was probably the Viennese chess master and theoretician Johann Baptist Allgaier, who happened to be operating when the Turk faced Napoleon. An image from a 1789 book by German baron Joseph Friedrich zu Racknitz that supposedly revealed the secret behind the Mechanical Turk. All this was revealed only in 1857, when the son of the Turk’s last owner, Silas Weir Mitchell, published a series of articles titled “Last of a Veteran Chess Player” in the New York magazine Chess Monthly. More than a century later, in 1989, the accuracy of Mitchell’s account was mostly confirmed when John Gaughan, aprop builder for professional magicians and an automata collector, finished a complete reconstruction of the Turk in Los Angeles. The case of the chess-cheating automaton was finally solved. Cheating is as old as the game of chess. One of the earliest examples had deadly consequences. The story goes that the eleventh-century rulers Cnut, King of the North Sea Empire, and Ulf Jarl, the regent of Denmark and Cnut’s brother-in-law, played a game of chess. The king made a losing move and insisted on taking it back, whereupon a quarrel followed until Cnut angrily overturned the chessboard. The next morning, on Christmas Day 1026, the king ordered Ulf to be killed. A drawing from Eleanor Means Hull’s 1913 book The Northmen in Britain depicting the game of chess played between eleventh-century Danish rulers Cnut and Ulf Jarl—likely the latter’s last game. Luis Ramírez de Lucena (c. 1465–c. 1530), a Spanish player who published the oldest surviving printed book on chess, suggested a mild form of, let’s say, influencing the game to your advantage. He recommended placing your opponent with the sun in their eyes if you play by day and with the candle at their right hand if you play by night (presumably to make it harder for right-handed players to execute their moves). He added that it would be even worse for your opponent if they had just eaten and drunk freely. Before the computer became a factor, cheating in chess usually meant that a player could obtain illegal access to other forms of assistance during a game. Even at the highest level, there have been allegations that players were somehow given information during play. For instance, during the Fischer–Spassky world championship match in 1972 in Reykjavík, the Russian delegation accused the Americans of using chemical and electronic means to try to beat Spassky unfairly. In a statement prepared independently from Spassky, they inquired about the lighting in the playing hall and Fischer’s chair. The organizers brought in a chemist and an electronics engineer and had the chairs of both players X-rayed, but found nothing. Inside the lamps, all that could be found were two dead flies. Writing for the New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg noted that some people suggested dissecting the flies: “Did they die a natural death? Or had an American death ray put an end to them? Or was their death a result of tasting the Poisoned Pawn Sicilian?” In the next World Chess Championship match, which took place in 1978 in Baguio City in the Philippines, cheating allegations went a step further. The backdrop of the Cold War played a role once again. Soviet representative Anatoly Karpov, who ultimately won the match, faced Viktor Korchnoi, an enemy of the Soviet state since he had defected in 1976 to become a Swiss citizen. This title match is mainly remembered for the many scandals surrounding it, which is a pity because the chess played was fantastic. But we must stay true to our theme, so there’s no way not to talk about Dr. Zukhar and a cup of blueberry yogurt. Viktor Korchnoi, left, and Anatoly Karpov, right, playing their world championship match in July 1978 in Baguio, Philippines. After the first game, Korchnoi filed an official complaint that members of Karpov’s team had handed the 12th World Chess Champion yogurt during play. According to the rules, contact between Karpov and anyone in the auditorium was forbidden during games. The Soviet press officer called it “a storm in a yogurt cup.” Still, the chief arbiter took a measure: from now on, the yogurt could only be handed to Karpov at a specific time to avoid any suggestions that it could be a means of communication. Korchnoi was never wholly reassured. After the match, he wrote, “I noticed that after this ‘yogurt,’ Karpov would often start playing like a machine gun! It wouldn’t have been a bad thing to take away this ‘yogurt’ for chemical analysis.” I am not sure if Karpov ever bothered to respond to this bizarre suggestion of doping. And then there was the infamous psychologist Vladimir Zukhar, part of Karpov’s team. Zukhar suddenly appeared in the playing hall in Baguio during the fourth game, where he sat still near the stage for hours, staring directly at Korchnoi. The Korchnoi team imagined him a parapsychologist attempting hypnosis but failed to have Zukhar removed. Korchnoi then brought his own psychologist, but only for a few days before reaching a compromise: Zukhar would sit elsewhere in the hall while Korchnoi would get rid of the reflective sunglasses he had been wearing. A few days later, Korchnoi brought two volunteer assistants, yoga practitioners who sat down in the playing hall in lotus postures, to counter any influence Zukhar might still radiate. Of course, the Soviet team protested, and soon the two yogis were barred from the playing hall. Cheating in chess reached a whole new level after the appearance of the chess computer—the actual Mechanical Turk without a hidden human being inside. The first example occurred in August 1980, in the Alsterdorfer Sports Hall in Hamburg, Germany. The German grandmaster Dr. Helmut Pfleger, a popular commentator on national television, gave a simultaneous exhibition but wasn’t aware that, in this simul, not all of his 26 opponents were human. Three participants were “simultaneously” participating in a scientific experiment, where they were helped by computers that could play chess—a fairly new development at the time. Someone holding binoculars observed the boards and pieces from a vantage point above the tournament hall. The moves were fed to three chess computers, and they were communicated back to the accomplices in the simul (two women, one man), who all had hair long enough to hide microphones and wireless receivers. As they kept their poker faces while making their moves, Pfleger had no idea what was happening. One of the three computers managed to beat the grandmaster. It was actually thousands of miles away, because that particular game was being communicated by telephone to Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, where Ken Thompson was feeding his chess program Belle the moves and sending its answers back to Hamburg. After the event was over and Pfleger was informed of the trickery, he laughed and said, “I’m really surprised. These things are now playing quite well!” We know from Chapter 5 that Kasparov considered his loss to Deep Blue in 1997 as less than fair and square. When speaking to the press about the infamous second game, Kasparov did something quite similar to what Magnus Carlsen would do a quarter of a century later: he accused his opponent of cheating without accusing it of cheating. In this case, it was also the exact opposite of what happened in the Carlsen–Niemann case. Instead of suspecting the help of a computer, Kasparov suggested the computer had received human intervention. In his opinion, Deep Blue had made moves that were too “uncomputerlike.” Kasparov used a soccer reference 25 years before Carlsen would do the same: “It reminds me of the famous goal which Maradona scored against England in 1986. He said it was the ‘hand of God.’ ” As chess computer programs became stronger and stronger, it was only a matter of time before we saw players who couldn’t resist the temptation of a little help from my silicon friend—especially once the advent of the Pocket PC and the smartphone allowed them to have a chess computer in their trousers. An early case occurred in 2006 when an amateur player was caught playing with a device called a Phonito, a wireless receiver used for undetected communication, at the World Open in Philadelphia. As he refused to be searched, the organizers banned him from the tournament. Actual proof of cheating did not surface, but the circumstances were enough for the organizers to take measures. An interesting side story is that the manufacturer of the Phonito was the Swiss hearing aid producer Phonak, which was sponsoring Floyd Landis and his cycling team at the time. By coincidence, Phonak was unwittingly caught up in a similar scandal when the American cyclist, who won the Tour de France that year, was disqualified after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Landis had been a former teammate of the even more famous Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist who was stripped of seven consecutive Tour de France victories when an investigation found that he had doped throughout his career. Cheating with a chess engine during a game has been compared with doping countless times. A better comparison unfolded in early 2016 at the Cyclo-cross World Championships in Zolder, Belgium. A concealed motor was discovered inside the frame of Belgian racer Femke van den Driessche’s bike. “It wasn’t my bike—it was that of a friend and was identical to mine,” Van den Driessche said in tears, but that didn’t prevent her from becoming the first cyclist to be officially charged with mechanical doping. The year 2006 witnessed a more famous cheating story, even though it never went beyond accusations and actual proof never surfaced. After he was accused himself a year before, the Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov, through his manager Silvio Danailov, accused Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during their world championship match. Why? Because Kramnik went to the restroom literally dozens of times during games. The Bulgarians felt that was suspicious, while Kramnik categorically denied any wrongdoing. The scandal rocked the chess world, where it was quickly named “Toiletgate.” Years later, I heard a sensible explanation: Kramnik probably visited the restroom to smoke. He had promised his soon-to-be wife that he would quit smoking, but wasn’t succeeding yet. Over the years, I must have written at least a dozen articles about players, from amateurs to grandmasters, who were caught cheating by using a phone during a game. Most stories stayed within the chess scene, but one was different: large mainstream media coverage went to the story about the 58-year-old Latvian-Czech grandmaster Igors Rausis. That was in 2019, when the chess world learned two things. First, there was a new, high-profile cheating case. Second, a picture is worth a thousand words. Rausis, who had raised suspicion for years after scoring unnaturally good results for a player his age, was caught cheating in July 2019 at a tournament in Strasbourg, France. The whole world got to see how, as one of the participants followed him to the restroom and took a photo from above, over the edge of Rausis’s cubicle. The photo was then posted to social media and went viral. Soon, the story was everywhere, from the Washington Post to the Daily Mail and China Daily. The photo showed Rausis sat on the toilet seat with the lid closed, his pants on (making it slightly less embarrassing), holding a smartphone in his hands. His left leg rested on his right knee, with his trousers rolled up above the knee, revealing a large cloth bandage circling his lower leg. You could imagine it being used to hold a small device, and Rausis looking at his phone said it all. There can’t possibly be a clearer case of being caught red-handed. At the end of 2019, the FIDE Ethics and Disciplinary Commission dished out the strongest cheating punishment to date: Rausis was banned for six years and stripped of his grandmaster title. I did not publish my news report before contacting Rausis. I spoke to him the day after he got caught, and he informed me of the end of his chess career: “I simply lost my mind yesterday.… At least what I committed yesterday is a good lesson, not for me—I played my last game of chess already.” However, he couldn’t resist returning to the arena. In October 2020, Rausis appeared at a small rapid tournament in Latvia, playing under a new name. You couldn’t make this up. Rausis told me that he hadn’t changed his name so that he could play chess again but because he was embarrassed over the widely published and unflattering picture (the internet doesn’t forget). Apart from his old name being forever linked to the photo, he said he’d also changed his name because he felt ashamed for his family. He was now using the surname of his ex-wife, with whom he was still on good terms. Rausis died at the end of March 2024, after struggling with a serious illness for two decades. In the reactions to his death, statements such as “great chess player” and “friendly personality” predominated. Cheaters are human beings too. My Lawsuit Speaks for Itself On October 20, 2022, the Carlsen–Niemann saga entered a new chapter when Niemann started a major counterattack. On Twitter (now X), he shared a link to a 44-page legal document and wrote, “My lawsuit speaks for itself.” He was going to court. Niemann filed a defamation lawsuit in the Eastern Missouri District Court against five entities: the players Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the companies Chess.com and Play Magnus Group, and Chess.com’s CCO Danny Rensch. The Play Magnus Group, a conglomerate of several small chess companies co-owned by the Carlsen family, would be acquired by Chess.com just two months later, while the lawsuit was still underway. Niemann demanded $100 million in damages from each party as he was claiming slander, libel, unlawful group boycott under the Sherman Act, tortious interference with contract and business expectancies, and civil conspiracy. Niemann stated that Carlsen, Nakamura, Chess.com, Play Magnus Group, and Rensch had been “egregiously defaming him and unlawfully colluding to blacklist him from the profession to which he has dedicated his life,” and that the whole situation had caused “devastating damages.” Regarding the alleged collusion, Niemann’s lawyers pointed for instance at Carlsen and Chess.com, referencing Chess.com’s planned takeover of Play Magnus. Their legal document noted that Chess.com’s decision to ban Niemann from their site right after Carlsen had accused Niemann of cheating “added instant credibility to Carlsen’s false allegations and suggested that they were true.” However, when I spoke to him for this book, Rensch told me personally that he had advised Carlsen not to withdraw from the Sinquefield Cup, and while Carlsen’s father and manager Henrik thanked him for the message, they decided to go down that path anyway. On June 27, 2023, a federal judge dismissed Niemann’s lawsuit. Initially, his attorneys intended to pursue the defamation claim, among others, in state court. However, by August 28 it became clear that the hatchet had been buried: Chess.com issued a statement that noted the legal dispute was concluded, and Niemann’s account on the site was reinstated. Without giving details of the settlement, the site noted: “Since June, both sides have negotiated privately in a good-faith effort to resolve their issues and allow the chess world to move forward without further litigation. We are happy to share that all sides have reached an agreement.” The text included statements from the two main characters. Carlsen admitted that “there is no determinative evidence that Niemann cheated in his game against me at the Sinquefield Cup.” Niemann said, “I look forward to competing against Magnus in chess rather than in court.” “We are literally not allowed to talk about it,” Danny Rensch told me. “We prefer to call it ‘an agreement to move on.’ Basically, Hans wanted back on Chess.com. Magnus wanted the whole thing to get behind him, and he knew the only way to do that was to agree to move forward. Chess.com acknowledged that it no longer had any evidence to justify a continued closure other than what we had already acted on, and so we all agreed to take our marbles and go home.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal directly affected the chess world in that some of the top tournaments in 2023, both online and over-the-board, increased their anti-cheating measures. It has since become standard almost everywhere that players are scanned with a metal detector before games. As well as being forbidden from carrying phones, they are also no longer allowed to wear a watch, whether it’s analog, digital, or a smartwatch. Spectators are no longer allowed to use phones in the playing hall either. In online events, players need to provide signals from multiple webcams, while there can also be audio monitoring, computer task manager review, and sometimes in-person on-site proctors. Not all tournaments take enough measures, though, which can lead to unpleasant situations. On October 12, 2023, the relatively unknown Kazakh player Alisher Suleymenov, who had earned the grandmaster title earlier in the year, defeated Magnus Carlsen in a spectacular game at the Qatar Masters in Doha. “I was completely crushed in my game today,” Carlsen tweeted. “This is not to accuse my opponent of anything, who played an amazing game and deserved to win, but, honestly, as soon as I saw my opponent was wearing a watch early in the game, I lost my ability to concentrate. I obviously take responsibility for my inability to deal with those thoughts properly, but it’s also incredibly frustrating to see organizers still not taking anti-cheating seriously at all (no transmission delay, spectators walking around the playing hall with smartphones).” Suleymenov did not respond to the tweet, and when asked about the game he said Carlsen lost due to a blunder on the board. Two months later, the other main character of the 2022 cheating scandal again attracted attention, but this time more positively. Niemann scored a career-best result by clinching the Tournament of Peace in Zagreb, Croatia, winning seven games and drawing two. His performance rating was 2956, among the best shown by any player in recent decades. On X, Niemann compared himself to Bobby Fischer, who had won the same tournament 53 years earlier. Suspicions started spreading when the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten came up with a story that included a rather vague quote from one of the organizers. Kresimir Podravec, the secretary of the Zagreb Chess Federation, reportedly said, “Niemann’s result is out of this world, but we have no definite proof that he cheated.” I don’t know if Niemann ever responded to this. Meanwhile, some of his opponents in the tournament complained about the lack of sufficient anti-cheating measures in the playing hall, but a week or two later, the chess world had moved on. But paranoia continued to exist in chess circles, particularly regarding online matches. When Vladimir Kramnik lost an online game to Niemann in September 2023, the 14th World Chess Champion uploaded a video expressing his surprise about some of his opponent’s moves. In subsequent months, Kramnik launched a personal campaign about the issue of cheating online, claiming it occurs much more often than we realize and that Chess.com isn’t doing enough to fight it. In late November, Chess.com responded in a blog post: “With the deepest respect for former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, in our opinion, his accusations lack statistical merit.” When Kramnik continued to express doubts about what he considered to be suspicious players’ performances, including those of a 12-year-old prodigy, Chess.com decided he had gone too far and closed the former world champion’s account on the site for violating its terms of service. It did not stop Kramnik from continuing to share his “statistics” on X. Chess.com’s Head of Cheat Detection Gerard Le-Marechal pointed out to me some larger implications of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal and how it has recently fed paranoia at the top level. He argued that it may have emboldened people to accuse others more openly—which is not a good thing. “There’s an interesting statistic we noticed,” Le-Marechal said. “Which is that during the time of the Niemann scandal, the rate at which people reported others increased across the site, then returned to normal after it died down, potentially suggesting that the scandal encouraged people to treat their fellow chessers with more suspicion as a whole where this did not reflect in the number of cheating cases detected.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal’s final chapter arrived on December 12, 2023. Fourteen and a half months after FIDE started its investigation into the matter, its Ethics and Disciplinary Commission finally posted its long-awaited verdict on the FIDE website. Rumor had it that Carlsen might be banned from FIDE-rated tournaments for his allegations without proof, but he was ultimately found not guilty of the most important charges. The only penalty he received was a fine of €10,000 ($10,800) for “withdrawing without a valid reason” from the Sinquefield Cup. Could It Be Done? One question remains, and for that, we’re returning once more to those damn anal beads. Is it possible to cheat at chess using a vibrating device? Could it be done? The short answer is: probably, yes. But don’t take my word for it. You can find more than one video on the internet where people attempt to verify the theory by actually creating a vibrating device connected to a computer and hidden in a sex toy. The biggest among them is YouTuber Mike Boyd. His channel, which had three million subscribers in June 2024, documents the learning process of new challenges he gives himself. In a video from November 14, 2022, titled “Actually Making THAT Chess Cheat Device,” which has been viewed 2.3 million times, he did exactly the thing Elon Musk and others had joked about—a computer transmitted moves suggested by Stockfish to a vibrating anal toy connected to a receiver and transmitter. Boyd used the device (strapped on his right ankle, hidden by his trousers) to beat a friend who was a much stronger chess player—but also received many comments from viewers pointing out that his device would never get past a metal detector like those used at top-level chess tournaments. In a video posted a week later, Boyd showed that his device wasn’t so easily traceable. A metal detector started beeping when it hovered close to his watch, his smartphone in his pocket, a pocket knife, and even a two-gram scalpel blade, but remained silent when slid over the cheat device in his pocket. Only when the detector hit the spot quite fast would it produce a brief beep. Boyd’s conclusion: handheld metal detectors suck, and the thin silicon layer surrounding the electronic components was enough to bypass the detector. The fact that an anal bead could work wasn’t the biggest problem for the chess world. Boyd’s demonstration of it passing the metal detector was arguably much more damaging. That had also been demonstrated a month before in a real-life situation. That was in October 2022, at a prestigious chess event in Reykjavík. To figure out what is spotted by a metal detector and what isn’t, a Norwegian journalist arrived at the tournament with several devices attached to her body and let herself be examined. She had an earplug the size of a small grain placed right up to the eardrum. It was connected to a receiver hidden in her clothes, which could communicate with a smartwatch attached to the inside of her belt buckle. She also brought a walkie-talkie, a power bracelet, and a pair of sunglasses with earplugs. The result was alarming: while the walkie-talkie and the bracelet were revealed in the security check, the earplugs, smartwatch, and sunglasses were not. The Norwegian organizer Jøran Aulin-Jansson wasn’t too worried that players could get through the check with an electronic device, stating, “It is quite possible that they do it, but they don’t get to use it.” Ian Nepomniachtchi, one of the participants, was less comfortable: “I still don’t feel that it is safe. I heard that an NRK reporter got through. The criminals are always one step ahead.” I feel that over the last decade or so, more cheating might have occurred than we realize, especially at smaller open tournaments where organizers lack the means to enforce proper anti-cheating measures and where it’s relatively easy to bring your smartphone to the restroom. I would like to believe that I am wrong and that all chess players are good people, but, at the same time, I think FIDE has a task to help those organizers of smaller tournaments to level up their game. I also witnessed the paranoia firsthand at a tournament in Liechtenstein back in 2014, where I scored my second international master (IM) norm. In one of my games, I drew with a titled player and after the tournament, he accused me of cheating in a personal conversation: I couldn’t have played at 2400+ level with a rating of 2215. When I told him I had done it before, in a tournament in 2004, he only saw that as further proof that I wasn’t kosher. It is clear how much computers have impacted chess. The man versus machine matches, culminating in Kasparov–Deep Blue, raised the game’s profile. Ever since, computers have helped humans become stronger players. And we continued playing, even though the chess engines on our smartphones are now stronger than Deep Blue. While cheating continues to be an issue the chess world needs to deal with, my conclusion is that artificial intelligence has done more good than bad for chess overall. Plus there’s one big factor to explore, which I haven’t even mentioned yet. These days, most chess games are played between people who don’t know their opponents or where they are located. Millions of games are played daily between people across the globe, from their homes, the office, the train, or even the restroom. All this is possible thanks to the internet, an invention that seems like it was made for chess. We’ll explore the strong bond between chess and the internet next.",

      "content": "Chapter 8The Early Days: Chess at 28.8 Kbps “The first time I connected to the ICC in 1996 was with a 28K modem. My ping times were 2 or 3 seconds. It was very slow. But you could still play like a 5-minute game. You couldn’t play bullet of course, that wasn’t possible. The popularity of bullet started a couple of years later, when the speed of the Internet got fast enough for that.” —Sandro Leonori, long-time admin of the Internet Chess Club, 2023 In 1989, a 20-year-old student named Brian Karen from Long Island, New York, was working at a computer shop. He was responsible for the shipping department and phone sales, and, as it turned out, his interest in computers would soon be connected to his growing love for chess. When we spoke for this book, he revealed that he was one of the very first people ever to play an international game of chess in real-time on the internet: At college, the chess player on my floor in the dorm was one of my friends, and he said: “You’ve got to see this. You can play chess online!” This was at Syracuse University, and they had this big mainframe computer there. So I went with him. I had to go through the snow. We went to the computer center, and I played some guy, I think he was in Chile. And the way it would be, you type in like e2-e4 and hit return, and then the dot matrix printer would print out the board, like in text format, and you’d see his move, you know, e7-e5, or whatever it was. And we played the game. And I was like, wow, this is amazing. Back then, you had to pay a lot of money for long-distance calls, so to play someone in Chile was like, What? The first network of linked computers at different physical locations was set up in the mid-1960s at the American government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This network, named ARPANET, would later be connected to other networks from which the internet emerged. To play online chess in the late 1980s, you basically had to be living in the US where you could connect either via a university or by subscribing to one of the commercial networks, such as CompuServe, Prodigy, or the Sierra Network, that typically charged $2 to $7 an hour. Karen’s game with his Chilean opponent used a rudimentary form of what would soon see the light: the first dedicated server to play chess. It was born on January 15, 1992. Online Chess Emerges: ICS, FICS, ICC Created by Michael Moore and Richard Nash, the Internet Chess Server (ICS) was the first online chess server of many to come. It could be reached on the University of Utah’s server address lark.utah.edu via Telnet (short for “teletype network”), a protocol originally developed in 1969 allowing users to access and interact with another computer or device over a network. Users could log into a remote computer and execute commands as if they were physically at that computer’s terminal, or they could log into the ICS and play a game of chess. In July 1992, the ICS was moved to a host machine at Carnegie Mellon University, where a couple of undergraduate students ran it. Daniel Sleator, a professor of computer science at the university, started managing the project by the end of 1992. He improved the system, fixed bugs, added new features (most notably the “time-stamp” feature, a system that compensated for internet lag), copyrighted the code, and had a bit of fun now and then. On April 1, 1994, as an April Fools’ joke, he set the server code to “bogomode,” a setting that made the ratings go crazy. Suddenly, winning or losing games would result in gaining or dropping hundreds of rating points. After the settings were restored, one member emailed Sleator: “Why can’t I keep my rating of -11609? April Fools’ or not, I had the worst record.” As the number of accounts grew rapidly from roughly 2,000 in 1993 to 10,000 in early 1995, Sleator started to receive purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialize the server. With his wife, Lylia, and ICS administrators Marty Grund and Eric Peterson, he created a company himself instead. (Today, it is likely one of the ten oldest e-commerce sites that remains active at the time of writing, founded eight months after Amazon and six months before eBay.) On March 1, 1995, Sleator shared his decision with the members. Anyone who telnetted into the ICS saw the following message on their screen: “Important announcement for all members: Today, ICS has become the Internet Chess Club (ICC). Please type ‘help announce’ for all the details.” The most important of those details was the introduction of a fee. From now on, members would be charged $49 a year. The measure came as a shock to most as people were used to playing chess on the internet for free. Sleator’s announcement caused quite the uproar, leading to heated debates on the server and elsewhere. A quick follow-up announcement saying that students would only need to pay $24.50 a year didn’t help much to calm the waters. As tech journalist Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store, wrote in that summer of 1995, “Players lost their tempers and were exiled from the server, opposition groups were formed, lawsuits were threatened, ICC administrators were harassed, and plans to erect alternative servers were formed.” A small group of former ICS programmers decided to create a new, free club: the Free Internet Chess Server. FICS launched on the address fics.onenet.net in the first week of March 1995, just days after Sleator’s announcement. A few months later it had about 1,500 members, while the ICC had 11,000. Throughout the years, FICS remained the smaller sibling of the two, while many of the original naysayers eventually joined and paid for an ICC membership. Around 2009, ICC reached its peak of around 72,000 paying members, with many more using free trials or playing as guests. Asked if FICS was ever a true rival, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer Ruy Mora told me, “That’s tough to say because we couldn’t really measure. But I’m sure there was an impact. There’s a lot of people who don’t want to pay.” Even in 2024, both playing servers continue to exist, keeping a small but loyal user base in the shadow of two giants that occupy the current online landscape. In a way, the relationship between FICS and ICC is similar to the two dominant chess platforms today: Lichess, which is free to play, and the paid-for Chess.com. Starting in the mid-nineties, the “commercial” versus the “internet-should-be-free” vibe is still manifest today as a bit of an ideological rivalry between the two communities. John Fernandez, who was an admin for ICC in the late nineties, told me the analogy does work to some extent: “To some people, ICC were the evil capitalists out there to make money, and FICS was like, ‘We’re free, we’re open source, we’re all volunteers.’ You would use that as a shield, you know. ‘We’re the good guys, the self-proclaimed good guys.’ Lichess is certainly doing that as well.” The Intergalactic Chess Café What was it like to play chess online in those early days? The Dutch novelist and chess player Tim Krabbé described it wonderfully in an article in New in Chess magazine in 1995: It was a fateful night in February when I first saw that posting on the internet, in the newsgroup rec.games.chess. It suggested that I try telnet chess.lm.com 5000 and see how I would like it there. Before I knew what had happened, I had a screenful of names like turbopragma, CarbonNitride, Sartre, DEATH, GrandJaap, Hoho, toto, Barendregt, zigzag, CapedCrusader, Roman, gutterface; all chessplayers I understood—some of them, judging from the ratings next to their names, quite good, and all ready to play chess with me. When I had mastered my first few commands, and was able to read their personal files, I saw they were from all over the world, from the US, Iceland, New Zealand, Brazil, Turkey, Chile, India, even from Leiden [in the Netherlands], but regrettably few from Eastern Europe. DEATH was a student from Puerto Rico, HUS an IM from Singapore, Belsebub a blitz-only player, TheKiller a mathematician from Sweden, Galileo a father of four from San Diego, Pawngrubber a girl, Candide a Texan who turned out never to have heard of Pangloss and indeed, Roman was Roman Dzindzichashvili. He had already played over 1,500 blitz games there, and his rating was over 2800. The global village suddenly seemed like something from the past—this was a global living room; an Intergalactic Chess Cafe. Playing from Amsterdam, Krabbé tried out his first game and was paired against someone in Atlanta, Georgia. The distance between the two players was more than 7,000 kilometers (4,385 miles) but the experience was as exciting as Brian Karen’s: “Even so, those moves appeared on my screen instantly, bleep onto bleep, as if he were sitting across the table. It was overwhelming, mindboggling—the old dream of omnipresence come true.” I had a similar experience around that time. I had just moved to Amsterdam, where I studied for my master’s degree in Dutch Language and Literature at the University of Amsterdam while devoting much of my spare time to chess. A friend of mine, a student at the city’s other university (Vrije Universiteit), had access to the computer department where machines were connected to the internet. All you needed was a login, and he allowed me to use his. I created an account on FICS, logged in via Telnet, and played my first online games. I wasn’t playing on a normal-looking chessboard. Students couldn’t download and install software on the university computer, so Telnet was the only option. Because of that, I had to play on an ASCII board created by text characters. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a character-encoding standard for electronic communication limited to 95 printable characters. Since it was text only, the chessboard was built from vertical (|) and horizontal (—) lines creating a grid with 64 squares (but no distinction between light or dark!) and pieces in capital letters (P, N, B, R, Q, K), together with asterisks for the black pieces (*P, *N, *B, *R, *Q, *K). Each move had to be typed in by keyboard. The whole experience made it hard to focus on the actual chess, but I kept returning anyway, as the experience was indeed overwhelming and mindboggling. It looked like this, after White had played their first move: Soon, I got myself a computer and a 28.8 Kbps dial-up modem that allowed me to hook up to the internet from home. A modem was a piece of external hardware that converted data into a format suitable for an analog transmission medium, in this case, your telephone line. Older readers will remember the typical sound such a modem would make when the connection was initialized, something akin to the shrieking of an old tavern’s wooden door, leading to a digital world full of instantly accessible information—and crazy chess players. In Europe, most of the chess was played in the evening or during the night, for two reasons. This was when the Americans, and therefore most of the stronger players, would be online. But it was also cheaper because, in those days, making phone calls in the evening was charged at a lower rate than during the day. Still, there have been stories about chess players who faced a phone bill of over a thousand dollars after “clicking” chess moves for a month. Internet chess would never have exploded like it did if everyone was still playing with those impossible ASCII-based chessboards. Like the chess world’s Wright brothers, developers created chess server interfaces to play the game, and that’s when things took off. Dozens of such interfaces were developed. You had to pick one, download it from the anonymous file transfer site ftp://chess.onenet.net, unpack it, install it on your local machine, brew a nice cup of coffee, and enter the arena. This is what playing chess online (on the Free Internet Chess Server) looked like in the 1990s. One of the most popular was ZIICS, developed by Andy McFarland from Owensboro, Kentucky. It ran on MS-DOS, Microsoft’s operating system used in most personal computers. It co-existed for many years with Windows, launched in late 1985. ZIICS also required a graphics adapter, but then you could choose from several styles of piece sets from 32 pixels per square to 56 pixels per square, and you could configure the buttons’ colors and functions by editing a text file. If Vincent van Gogh had been into chess, he would have loved it. On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95, reportedly spending as much as $200 million on advertising. A year later, the program BlitzIn, which worked on Windows, became the most popular chess interface. It helped boost the success of ICC, and so did the massive influx of new members thanks to the live relay of the Kasparov–Deep Blue matches. Word spread quickly that there was a place where you could play chess and meet grandmasters 24/7. On the day Kasparov and Deep Blue played their second match game, the ICC set a record with 2,266 people online and 307 simultaneous games—a small step in hindsight but a giant leap at the time. On August 25, 1997, the ICC launched The King’s Messenger, an email newsletter for online chess. In its first issue, Danny Sleator wrote, “This newsletter was necessitated by the staggering growth of the ICC: now over 25,000 games are played every day, and the population reaches over 800 on an average night. The ICC has become one of the more significant organizations in world chess.” In early January 1998, about 40,000 games were played daily on the platform. A year later, this had grown to over 70,000. A large tournament for prize money in the year 2000 attracted 310 FIDE-rated players, among them 64 grandmasters. By 2002, the ICC had over 25,000 paying members; two years later that number had crossed 30,000. These numbers might seem tiny—incomparable to the numbers we’re seeing today—but at the time the growth was remarkable. Mouse Skills and Bullet Chess In 1964, Douglas Engelbart and Bill English built the first prototype of a device that moved a cursor on a computer screen. For decades, these devices were wired and therefore resembled the shape and size of a mouse—hence the name. As soon as online chess emerged, the mouse became indispensable. As the tool to execute the moves on the board, it was the chess player’s Nintendo game controller. Chess knowledge and the ability to calculate moves weren’t enough any more; developing mouse skills became critical to having success. One of the strongest players on the ICC in the mid-to-late nineties was the German grandmaster Roland Schmaltz, who played under the handle Hawkeye. In his 2004 book The Complete Chess Server Guide, he wrote a small segment titled “The Art of Mouse Mastery,” where he gave technical tips such as “adjusting the sample rate” in the computer settings and choosing “the right board size and mouse speed.” Schmaltz’s tips and tricks were mostly relevant to a special form of chess called bullet. It’s one of the fastest formats in chess, with players usually getting just one minute for a whole game. With a game averaging about 35 moves, you can think only for about two seconds per move. If you think longer early on, you will have even less time later in the game. This absolutely crazy (but very popular) way of playing chess often leads to insane time scrambles where players can make multiple moves in only a fraction of a second. In fact, most bullet games are decided by one player running out of time or “getting flagged,” in chess lingo. This phrase originates from over-the-board chess before the 2000s, when analog clocks would have a small lever, called a flag, that would drop if the large hand reached the hour. When I was in touch with ICC founder Danny Sleator for this book, he forwarded me an email he sent to some of the administrators in 1995, with “bullet chess” in the subject field. It describes how the name for this spectacular format came about, and that a separate rating system was needed on the server. (Below are only the first two paragraphs of a longer email.) To: sleator+icc-admins@CS.CMU.EDU Subject: bullet chess Date: Wed, 23 Aug 1995 14:14:21 -0400 Message-ID: <6304.809201661@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> From: Daniel Sleator <Daniel_Sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> Sender: sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU I’m going to introduce a new rating. I’m proposing to call it a “bullet” rating. (Alternative would be “lightening” [sic] but that’s too long and awkward. I would entertain other ideas for names.) I talked to several people about where the boundary between bullet and blitz should be. (POTZY, Surf, Broncept have all given me their opinions.) I’d like to solicit your opinions on this matter. You could also play one-minute chess on FICS, where it was not called bullet but lightning (the alternative name Sleator had suggested!). My good friend Arne Moll, a very active online player at the time, noted that this was an example of the rivalry between the two servers: “On FICS, there was some kind of hatred against the word. They would say: ‘Bullet,’ that’s ICC, that’s a shitty, commercial name. We call this ‘lightning.’ ” Whatever it was called, the new format caught on. The American grandmaster Larry Christiansen wrote, in the late 1990s, “Bullet chess is to tournament chess as slapstick comedy is to high drama, or tabloid journalism is to literature. Maybe that is why it is so popular.” Some players had more talent (or taste) for it than others. There’s no denying that bullet chess involves a lot of “dirty tricks” that can help to gain valuable time in the final phases of the game, when it’s all about avoiding getting flagged. One of them is to voluntarily give up a piece simply because of the surprise value and the extra half-second it will take for the opponent to execute their move. Also, in bullet chess, players often continue playing positions where they would normally agree to a draw to try to flag the opponent—opinions are divided on whether this is unsports-manlike behavior. And then there’s the infamous premove: the possibility of, after having made your move, making your next move before your opponent makes one—something unthinkable in over-the-board chess—if you’re certain of your next turn. While the opponent thinks, you can drag your mouse and move one of your pieces to another square. As soon as it’s your move, the server executes your “premoved” move, and you don’t lose any time on your clock. It is a gamble, though, as the success of a premove depends heavily on an expected reply from the opponent. Roland Schmaltz agreed that particularly those final seconds of a game do not have much to do with chess, but stressed that chess skills are still important in bullet: “You are no longer focused on finding the best move. You are focused on finding the most unpleasant move for your opponent to make him lose more time. To achieve your goal, you still have to think in chess terms, but, more importantly, like in a normal chess game, you must think ahead!” And, indeed, to this day the strongest bullet players are also the strongest players in general. As I write this, Chess.com’s 2023 Bullet Chess Championship has just finished, with Hikaru Nakamura beating Magnus Carlsen in the final—the world number one and number two in classical chess, then. A fun moment during the 2023 Bullet Chess Championship on Chess.com in the game between Magnus Carlsen and Daniel Naroditsky. Addiction On August 30, 1999, Loek van Wely from the Netherlands and Alexander Rustemov from Russia played well over a hundred blitz games on the ICC, with a time control of five minutes for a whole game. It turned into a heroic match, a hard-fought and long battle that attracted a lot of online spectators who logged in from many different time zones—because, in the end, the two grandmasters played for 20 hours straight. My compatriot Van Wely won by a score of 64–60 wins, with 13 draws over a total of 137 games. Now, that’s dedication. Or is it something else? The 1895 essay “Concerning Chess” by H. G. Wells opens with the following famous passage: “The passion for playing chess is one of the most unaccountable in the world. It slaps the theory of natural selection in the face. It is the most absorbing of occupations. The least satisfying of desires. A nameless excrescence upon life. It annihilates a man. You have, let us say, a promising politician, a rising artist that you wish to destroy. Dagger or bomb are archaic and unreliable—but teach him, inoculate him with chess.” Although chess addiction is probably as old as the game itself, I believe it’s much easier to get addicted to online chess. The English grandmaster Danny Gormally did not shy away from the truth when he published an article in New in Chess magazine in 2008 titled “Diary of an ICC Addict.” He compared playing online to drugs: “[T]he user experiences a serotonin cascade in the pre-frontal lobe of his brain similar to a drug which could be described as psychotropic. This leads to more and more use, as the addict chases his high, which he finds increasingly difficult to replicate in his humdrum everyday existence.” A comparison to avid casino visitors comes to mind when you realize that chess players sometimes reach for the last resort: asking for a self-ban. Don’t let me in anymore. The same Gormally wrote in his 2016 book A Year Inside the Chess World: “Eventually it dawned on me that playing blitz online all day was a complete waste of my life so I asked them to ban me, being seemingly incapable of stopping playing myself. I was just playing all day, every day.” It’s not a watertight solution because sometimes people create a new account to circumvent their ban. Is blitz chess a drug? In a more recent article in New in Chess magazine, Jennifer Vallens has pointed out that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has added Internet Gaming Addiction as one of the potential disorders that need to be treated: “The APA explains that internet gaming activates reward systems similarly to using drugs. The euphoric feeling when you win a match or unlock an achievement is the same as getting high, as both activities trigger dopamine releases in the brain. When addicts get engrossed playing online games, certain pathways in their brains are triggered in the same direct and intense way that a drug addict’s brain is affected by a particular substance.” Some people just cannot stop playing. They really play a lot. But how much is a lot? One Chess.com account played 436,770 games between April 2014 and June 2021, an average of 167 games per day. Among the titled players, one grandmaster played more games than anyone: 180,000 since 2009. On ICC, one of the members played over 740,000 games between 1996 and 2024, an average of 72 games a day for 28 years straight. A note in his profile says that ICC is “the best chess club in the world.” The American writer and podcaster James Altucher was one of the early users of ICC’s precursor ICS, as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon under Danny Sleator. He told me: I was an addict. I was working a job I didn’t like. I was in a relationship I was unhappy with. One time, it was around 6:00 p.m., I was at work. My girlfriend called me and said, “Don’t forget we have guests coming for dinner at 6:30.” So I was going to play one more game. At midnight she banged on my office door, which was locked. I was in a one-minute match that went on for hours with this guy from Israel. I was just an addict, I couldn’t stop. Then I got home around 7 a.m., and she was just leaving to go to classes. I remember she was so upset with me that she threw a bag filled with textbooks at me and left. It wasn’t the end of the relationship, but it was close. Probably the most addictive aspect of online chess is the time-trouble phase, which occurs late in the game when adrenaline sets in, and every decision feels decisive. It’s basically life or death, killing a wild animal before it gets to you, move after move. No wonder chess has often been compared to boxing. “The emotional impulse behind chess, and the pain it inflicts, is comparable but just takes a different form,” according to the Scottish grandmaster and philosopher Jonathan Rowson. Because most games are played at a quick time control of ten, five, or three minutes—or even one minute—per game, just about every game will see such a time-trouble phase. Among my friends, the most popular format is three-minute chess, which means that during a longer session, that thrilling moment when everything is on the line and the seconds are ticking away occurs roughly every five minutes, again and again: a rush of blood to the head. A quick trip to where the action happens. A brief, intense sense of living—on repeat. Another reason for online addiction is the ratings. Every online server works with its own application of Arpad Elo’s rating system. Because almost all players use a handle (nickname) when playing online, they’re defined by their rating, which is constantly visible alongside their virtual name and updated after every game. A good day’s results in a higher rating, and you feel great, but if the number goes down, it can completely ruin your day (or night). As Krabbé put it, “The ego has its needs too.” The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler told me a story about reaching the highest-ever rating on the platform: I was a very heavy ICC user, and then I just basically quit cold turkey and stopped playing online chess for, like, 15 years. One day, I played a very long match and won by a small margin. Then I beat another player in a ten-game match, and, by the end of it, I got the record. I got to 3318. It got badly broken by Hikaru Nakamura and others later, but at that point, for a brief moment, that was the highest-ever blitz rating. So I got the record. I was still kind of high, still feeling the buzz, and I got challenged by Hawkeye. I thought, “Why not?” But in that match, I didn’t play well. It was 5–5. And while you’re playing, you’re not paying much attention to anything but playing the game. When I finished, I looked up, and I was, like, 3092. Because [Roland Schmaltz] wasn’t very high rated, but he was much better than his rating, obviously. And I just looked at this and thought: “What am I doing here? Why am I spending hours and hours doing this?” I realized that the gains I had made over months and months—climbing further when you’re already 3250 is not very easy—were all gone. It would take me another three months to return to whatever it was an hour ago. And I thought, “No, I should maybe just stop.” Now I only play in tournaments and when I stream. In November 2023, Hikaru Nakamura set a new all-time high record blitz rating on Chess.com: 3336. It took just a few weeks for the always competitive Magnus Carlsen to top it, getting to 3340 on December 6 (only to reach even higher numbers before the end of the year). He commented to Norwegian media: I was on a sponsor event in the Bahamas this week and played some games online on Monday. On Tuesday I played Titled Tuesday and was planning to go to bed, but then I found out that I was close to Hikaru’s rating record. Then I thought I could play a few games and take the record. I was pretty close five times. But then it pissed me off so much that I kept going for hours and finally at 3 a.m. I had the record. I was actually pretty chill before that. But afterward I was so excited and struggled to sleep. It was fun, but then I thought, “I can’t be going on like this!” My friend Arne Moll has noted another aspect of online chess addiction, which he calls “the hate.” Sometimes we play badly, and losing sucks. Losing to bad players sucks even more, as it leads to a rating drop into regions that are just embarrassing. On such nights, you tend to play for too long with the idle hope of turning the tide. But it only gets worse. There is nothing new about this. This extract from an article titled “The Hate” by FICS member pdeck reads as if it could have been written yesterday instead of in 1998: I have the hate. I hate my opponent. I hate the spectators that goaded me into playing an extended series with someone who often gets my rating points. I hate the guys in the Lightning Channel for teasing me about my blunders and then logging off at midnight, leaving me to fester in a death spiral of worthless, repetitive chess punctuated only by one or two mad dashes to the men’s room or poorly stocked vending machines. More than anything, I hate myself. I spend too much god-damned time playing lightning, giving up both work and sleep. And what do I have to show for it? A shitty rating. The silliness about online ratings is mostly revealed by what I call the round-number idiocy. All chess players are prone to it, but they can take comfort in realizing they’re not unique. It is typical human behavior. Studies have shown that those who wear fitness trackers, professional baseball players, and high school SAT takers exert more effort when their performance falls just short of a round number rather than just above. And it goes even further, as shown in research from 2020 undertaken at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. The study determined that people have a preference for round numbers over specific numbers—that, for instance, people informed by health officials that a newly developed COVID-19 vaccine was 91.27 percent effective would likely think it was a less effective vaccine than if they were told it was 90 percent effective. Chess players, from total beginners to world champions, are obsessed with round-numbered ratings. Magnus Carlsen peaked at 2882 (twice) and, for a while, attempted to break 2900. Those 18 points mattered. It was big news when the French-Iranian prodigy Alireza Firouzja broke the 2800 rating barrier in December 2021 at 18 years and 166 days (breaking Carlsen’s previous record of 18 years and 336 days). For club players, making it to 2000 is a big deal. And then 2100—and then 2200. My own peak rating was 2292 in October 2004, and it still annoys me that I didn’t get to 2300. This leads to nonsensical, but familiar, behavior online. You play a few games in the evening, your rating has dropped to 1950, and you decide: “I’ll play until my rating is over 2000 again.” You win some, you lose some. Before you know it, it’s after midnight, and you suddenly notice your rating is 1998. Just one more win and you can call it a day. But you don’t win. In fact, you somehow never win that last game. At four in the morning, with a rating of 1911, you give up, frustrated and exhausted. You’ll have to find your way to your bed knowing you’re a terrible chess player because you don’t belong in that group of players above 2000. Often, you log on the next morning, fresh again, win a bunch of games in a row, break 2000, and don’t understand why that went so easy. You promise you will never play late in the evening again. But you will, maybe even on that same day. I’ve experienced many such evenings of online blitz silliness, but I’m cured now. The only way to avoid them is to play unrated games, the equivalent of zero-alcohol beer. It’s not the real thing. But many others can’t stop. Those heavy users with over a hundred games per day on average might have a serious problem. I feel worried sometimes about those heavy users, and I wonder if Chess.com and Lichess could do more to help the real addicts. Everyone Played. Everyone? The Internet Chess Club is a true pioneer of online chess. It can boast several milestones: the first online chess lecture in April 1995; the first internet simultaneous exhibition by a world champion (Garry Kasparov), in November 1995; the first intercollegiate online chess tournament, a month later; and the first top grandmasters playing online for prize money in November 1999. Around then, John Fernandez was hired as the public relations director tasked with growing the ICC further. He started working on sponsorships, banner advertising, and building relationships with organizers. For the next decade, the ICC was the place to be. In the early 2000s, the British newspaper the Sunday Telegraph wrote: “There are more than 300 places to play chess on the Internet but, as with nightclubs, there is only one place the ‘A list’ gravitates to: the Internet Chess Club.” The absolute top players of the time became active on the site: people like Veselin Topalov, Alexei Shirov, Nigel Short, and even Garry Kasparov, but also a young Hikaru Nakamura and an even younger Magnus Carlsen. It helped that grandmasters got free accounts, and Fernandez put a lot of effort into getting them to play on the site. During the 1999 FIDE World Chess Championship—a knockout event with a hundred participants held in Las Vegas—Fernandez gave all of the entrants a gift bag with a personal letter and a floppy disk that had the BlitzIn interface pre-installed to make it easier for the grandmasters to start playing. And it worked. All players logged in at least once, except one: the 68-year-old Viktor Korchnoi, a living legend but also a bit of a grumpy old man. Fernandez recalls: “He mumbled something and threw the envelope in the nearest bin.” Especially after Vegas 1999, just about all the big names joined the ICC. Nakamura had started playing as early as 1997, when he was nine years old, on an account he shared with his brother and stepfather. In 1999 he created a new one named YearoftheRabbit and used it until most strong players knew who he was. Starting from 2001, he played under Smallville, after the American superhero TV series that ran between 2001 and 2011. “I wanted an anonymous account, and, at the time, I was a big fan of the TV show,” Nakamura told me. Between 2001 and 2011 he played 15,306 blitz games and 13,967 bullet games on this account. He was also one of the first grandmasters to seriously benefit from online chess as a youngster because he would download his games and look for mistakes he’d made with the computer. But mostly, he would just play—a lot. I remember that around 2008–9 Nakamura stayed at my place in Amsterdam for one night as he had mistakenly booked a connecting flight on the wrong date. The next morning, I started working in the living room as quietly as I could, hiding behind a big computer screen while he slept on the couch. Eventually, he woke up and got out of the sleeping bag. Only then did I notice he was still wearing his clothes. We exchanged good mornings, and he sat down behind his laptop. Soon, I heard the type of mouse-clicking that could mean only one thing: he was playing blitz. That’s how you get good: when something is on your mind first thing in the morning, before breakfast, before anything else. Magnus Carlsen joined the ICC around 2001 and created the account imtobesoon. After becoming an IM, he ambitiously continued with the account gmtobesoon, and when that title was in the bag, he changed it to Magnus. Later on, the Norwegian prodigy used multiple anonymous accounts. He and Nakamura likely first played each other online in 2004. What would turn out to become a rivalry lasting over two decades all started with a friendly match between Magnus and Smallville on July 18, 2004. Over 12 games with a time control of three minutes per person (and no increment), 13-year-old Carlsen beat 16-year-old Nakamura 9–3, with no draws. The ICC made it a lot easier for people to play a game of chess against someone. You no longer had to follow the annoying social code of taking a shower and getting dressed before moving your king’s pawn. In the late 1990s, founder Danny Sleator noted that his online club encouraged people to play chess who normally wouldn’t bother going out to a club: “I’ve heard a lot of people say that. I am an example of this.” Just about everyone was trying their luck with online chess, although, as with all new technological developments, there were skeptics too. John Saunders, a very nice English fellow whom I met at many tournaments where he was working as a journalist and photographer, is one such person. He said in an interview in 1999: “Chess is like sex—it is only healthy when it involves two consenting humans in the same room. It is a social game. How can people enjoy playing chess when they masquerade under names like ‘Kingkicker’ and exchange no more dialogue than the perennial ‘thanx?’ Okay, I’m a hypocrite because I HAVE played Internet chess, am no good at it, and have a ‘handle’ which is an ancient Greek word meaning ‘I thrust a radish up the fundament.’ But I do not find it addictive or attractive.” Apart from the few critics, just about everyone who played chess played on the ICC. For a brief time that may have included a certain Bobby Fischer. On September 9, 2001, the English grandmaster Nigel Short wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph in which he claimed to be “99 percent sure” that he had faced the American former world champion in almost 50 online games. It was tremendously exciting news for chess fans; even those who didn’t believe it wanted to believe it. Any news related to Fischer, who had completely disappeared from the chess scene once again after beating Spassky in 1992, was fascinating. The thought of him playing chess again was just wonderful. Short revealed that in his first encounter, he lost 8–0, despite his mysterious opponent playing “some highly irregular if not totally absurd opening moves.” He would shift all his pawns forward by one square or play his king toward the center of the board as early as move two. “From this deliberately unpromising position emerged moves of extraordinary power,” said Short. “In this first game, I was totally crushed.” While chatting with his opponent, Short noticed that he knew a great deal about the major chess players of the 1960s, which happened to be Fischer’s most active period. Short decided to test him and asked his opponent if he knew of Armando Acevedo, an obscure Mexican player. He got an instant reply: “Siegen, 1970.” Because Fischer had played Acevedo at the Siegen Chess Olympiad in West Germany in 1970, Short felt “the guy was trying to tell me something.” The games were not recorded because Short had used a guest account (respecting his opponent’s wishes). ICC’s Danny Sleator, therefore, could not investigate Short’s claim that it was Fischer. However, soon it was revealed—somewhat sadly, I may add—who the mysterious opponent was: a Canadian network expert who used a chess engine. On January 28, 2002, Fischer himself said in an interview on Icelandic television that he never played on the internet. Alas, the mystery had been more enticing while still unsolved. Most grandmasters playing on the site didn’t keep their identity a secret. In fact, many of them would provide some extra details in their profile. I especially liked the notes from the English grandmaster David Norwood, who used the handle DaveNoGood for playing: Dave Norwood Retired grandmaster … ashamed to keep the title I only play 1 g3 and 1 … g6 4.If my play gets a bit funny it may have something to do with what I’m drinking … One of the many stories from those early days of internet chess is about a man whose life was saved while playing online. In September 1997, 48-year-old Charles Drafts started to feel a shortness of breath and dizziness during a game and sent a message to all members, saying, “I’m having physical illness problems and need help.” Drafts was a double amputee who lived in Boston’s housing projects in Mission Hill and who typed using a stick in his mouth. Some chess fans thought his message was a joke, but, luckily, others took it seriously. They asked Drafts to type his address and asked about his symptoms. Andy McFarland, one of the ICC admins, called Boston’s emergency medical services, and, eventually, firefighters broke down the door and rushed Drafts to Beth Israel hospital, where he was stabilized. The Charles Drafts story is an example of something that should not be underestimated about those early years of online chess: the social aspect. People came online not only to play a game of chess but also to meet people. Because, back then, there were so many fewer people online at the same time than we’ve grown accustomed to nowadays (3,000 concurrent players would push the server to its limits), and because of how things were structured, everyone could fairly easily talk to each other, and amateurs regularly conversed with top players. For most chess fans who didn’t travel internationally to tournaments, it was the first time in their lives that they could communicate with chess players from abroad. International master Greg Shahade, who started playing online in 1995, told me, “Girls approached me on FICS. I made a lot of friends.” For others, it went further: there are several stories of people getting married after first speaking to each other on the ICC. A Dutch chess player named his son after the handle he used online: Jaap. The chess servers had special chat channels, technically the same as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), to serve these social needs: you could start a private channel among your friends, or join one of the open channels with specific subjects. There was, for instance, a music channel, and a trivia channel where a bot would throw in trivia questions all day, and everyone providing answers would automatically be included in the daily rankings. ICC’s most popular channel was 97, dedicated to (mostly American) politics and more liberal than other channels when it came to foul language. “I also tried regular chat rooms in those days, but these would be meaningless,” Arne Moll told me. “You would sit there with random Americans. What should you talk about? Chess connects, and that’s the great thing. An ICC chat room was like a local pub full of international people who loved chess. It was quite special.” These days, we have individual chess communities active on social media platforms like Discord, X, Reddit, and Telegram, but they are somewhat scattered. Sites like Chess.com or Lichess don’t have chat channels, but maybe they should. Mark Crowther: Unsung Hero As desktop computers and other workstations became more connected globally in the late 1970s, there was a growing interest in sharing information. This led to a particular type of network called the Bulletin Board System (BBS), which allowed users to post messages like they would on a physical thumbtack bulletin board. USENET launched in 1978 as a global bulletin board that established the concept of newsgroups, where like-minded users could exchange messages on their topics of interest. It was estimated that in 1990 there were 265,000 users on five continents. One of these newsgroups was rec.games.chess, launched in 1987. People started sharing anything related to chess, and some even took up the task of typing out the full notation of recently played tournament games. This particular newsgroup kick-started the incredible acceleration of the availability of chess information, which would have enormous consequences for the game. One avid chess fan from Clayton, a suburb of Bradford in northern England, would play a vital role in this development and, as most chess fans are unaware, still does. Born in 1966, Mark Crowther learned the rules of chess in 1972, the year of the famous Fischer–Spassky match. He played chess at school and joined a local club. After studying information sciences in Leeds, Crowther found a job as a librarian/technician at Bradford University’s Modern Languages Center in the late 1980s. Crowther had a desire to collect and a love to share. He got a computer account in the library, joined the rec.games.chess newsgroup, and soon became one of the most active users, sharing recent chess games he found in newspaper chess columns and other media available in his library. Using a Linux system, he manually typed them in almost daily until he decided to turn it into a weekly thing. On September 17, 1994, he launched the first issue of The Week in Chess (TWIC). After seven weeks, he had learned enough HTML to set up his first website and post links to all TWIC issues. A legendary online magazine was born. Initially, Crowther combined collecting games with his day job. “I used to work at the university, finish on Friday, go to the computer center and do it on Friday night and Saturday, and go back to work on Monday,” he said. That went on for about a year and a half until it became too much: “Very quickly, I got pushed into publishing more and more games. It got out of control very quickly. And then it became: either I give up or go pro. That was the choice.” In 1996, Crowther briefly worked for the Canadian enterprise Thoth Communications Corporation. Between 1997 and 2012, he was sponsored by journalist and entrepreneur Malcolm Pein. As the owner of London’s Chess & Bridge shop, Pein used TWIC to send its readers to his online shop. Crowther got paid, and Pein got his online book sales. In 2012 the collaboration ended, and since then Crowther has relied on advertising, subscriptions, and donations. To me, Crowther is a legend, one of the unsung heroes of the chess world who deserves more credit than he gets. When I interviewed him in 2019 on the occasion of TWIC’s 25th anniversary, he told me that he was doing well, though he had some slight worries about his pension: “It’s a fun business to be in, but it’s not very secure. I’m going to have to work for another 20 years. But I enjoy doing it. I never go to bed on a Monday without finishing TWIC. It’s unthinkable. It’s how you get it done.” As I type this, TWIC is still going strong, a stunning 30 years after its inception. It appears on Mondays and summarizes the results of international chess tournaments. More importantly, Crowther provides a file with all the games played over the last week that anyone can download for free. These days, a single file can easily contain a few thousand games. Since 1994, the TWIC database has grown to over three and a half million games. Crowther doesn’t keep track of the figures, but chess fans who click the download button each week—from seasoned grandmasters to aspiring youngsters—must number in their thousands. Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand told me, “I remember, I think it was some time in 1995 that I first heard about The Week in Chess. I downloaded my first one then, and I cannot think of too many [other] routines that I’ve stuck to every single week for the last 25 years. [TWIC is] just really an institution in chess.” The Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, of a younger generation, expressed a similar sentiment in a tweet in August 2015: “When more than two TWICs are missing on your laptop, you know that something has gone wrong with your chess routine.” Why was TWIC so revolutionary? Well, having information about your opponent is vital. Before the internet, that wasn’t easy to get. One of the people who helped provide games for Crowther in the early years was Australia’s number-one player, Ian Rogers. Becoming a world-class grandmaster himself in the 1980s, while combining his successful playing career with chess journalism, Rogers witnessed firsthand how the internet changed the sport. “Before TWIC, you had Murray Chandler’s Tournament Chess,” said Rogers. “This magazine was not much more than printouts of games, with the occasional diagram, but it was invaluable. You traveled with it. If you were playing a tournament and had games from tournaments where your opponent had played before, it was very useful to have info on that.” Rogers toured Europe in those years with his wife Cathy, due to the lack of tournaments in Australia. Along with Tournament Chess, he and his colleagues would pack recent copies of Chess Informant or New in Chess Yearbooks in their suitcases: thick manuals containing hundreds of recent top-level games and analyses printed on thin paper, resembling phonebooks, another relic of the past. Other sources of information were periodicals such as British Chess Magazine, the German Schach 64, the Swiss weekly Die Schachwoche, and specialized books on chess openings. There was always a limit to the amount of material you could bring to a tournament, so books and clothes would be fighting for luggage space. With TWIC, preparing for a game was suddenly child’s play as it became much easier to find games played by your opponent, even as recently as the previous week. Moreover, you could now store thousands of games on a single floppy disk, which saved a huge amount of space. TWIC was particularly useful for chess players working with one of the chess database programs that were starting to become popular in those years as well. KasparovChess and the Dotcom Bubble While TWIC had the chess information and the ICC was the place to play, the internet landscape was changing rapidly. Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web was all the rage, and the first browsers started to appear: first Mosaic in 1993, then Netscape Navigator in 1994, followed by Internet Explorer in 1995. Just 16 months after Marc Andreessen and James Clark formed Netscape, the company had a historic initial public offering, or IPO, on August 9, 1995. On the first trading day, the stock opened at $28 per share and closed at $58.25 per share, giving the company a market value of about $2.9 billion. Andreessen became a multimillionaire, and Clark moved toward being the first internet billionaire. Netscape went public without previously having made a profit, a groundbreaking move at the time that contributed to a surge in interest in making money on the internet. A speculative mania, dubbed the “dot-com bubble,” led to a collapse in the early 2000s of many companies. KasparovChess was one of the failed start-ups. World champion since 1985, Garry Kasparov had launched a “Club Kasparov” website in early 1999, mainly written in Russian. The same year, the location of the site was changed to kasparovchess.com with the launch of a new business backed by mostly Israeli investors. Offices in the US, UK, Russia, and Israel opened as the international content team grew to about 30 members. Kasparov Chess Online (KCO), as it was officially named, was intended to be the dominant chess platform for both strong and casual players, parents, and kids. The site ambitiously advertised itself as “the home of chess on the web.” It offered everything: a playing zone, a news section, a forum, an event calendar, a shop, a magazine, downloadable multimedia lessons, and regular contributions from Kasparov himself, who often sent “express commentary” on the same day he played in a tournament. One of the key assets of KCO, which was fairly new at the time, was that users could play chess in a browser via an HTML interface. The main business model was both typical of those days and hardly viable: trying to build a huge base of free users who would be exposed to advertising. By 2002 a total of $13 million of investment was burned, including Kasparov’s personal injection of $110,000. The company was hardly making money. In September 2002 the board of directors decided to pull the plug. According to New in Chess magazine, Kasparov blamed the demise of his platform on “disputes between the minority Israeli stockholders who controlled the business and administrative functions of the company, and the majority stockholders associated with him.” Mig Greengard, who worked on content for KCO, wrote at the time: “The Israeli money-men thought it was more important to employ a group of Israeli programmers costing over $100,000 per month than have grandmasters, writers, and other chess people costing a fraction of that. Instead of cutting back, they went down with the ship over Kasparov’s protests.” I don’t know if the Israeli team ever responded to Greengard’s version of how things went down, but they likely saw it differently. This was not the end of the story. On Christmas Eve 2002, the First International Bank of Israel (FIBI), which had lent $1.6 million to KCO demanded the site be reopened and sought unspecified damages in a court in Delaware, where the company was registered. Effectively, the bank attempted to seize permanent control of the world-class asset of Kasparov’s name and likeness as compensation for their failed loan. On December 27, a US chancery judge ruled against the bank, calling the case “far too thin.” From a historical perspective, it’s interesting to note that Jay Severson, one of the future cofounders of Chess.com, had a rendezvous with KasparovChess somewhere between 1999 and 2000. Severson was working at Case’s Ladder, a Seattle-based online solutions provider for tournaments, leagues, brackets, and ladders. As the market leader in that area, the company was approached by KasparovChess for the rather ambitious plan to run a worldwide tournament for kids in schools, which would end up with a live final somewhere. They needed logistical support, arbiters, the whole shebang. “I remember laughing at the email, going, like, ‘These guys are nuts,’ ” Severson told me. Even for Chess.com in 2024, with all its resources, it would be hard to pull off a tournament involving millions of players. But KasparovChess wanted it and flew Severson out to New York City. “When I reached their floor, I was, like, ‘Wow!’ ” he said. “It was a humongous floor, first off. I remember there were a lot of cubicles, and I thought: This company is huge. I was blown away that they could afford such nice, high-rise office space in Manhattan.” Severson presented his calculations and estimates and showed the total sum of what it would cost. “It was a ridiculous number; it was in the millions,” he said. “I was supposed to be in New York for two days. The meeting lasted maybe an hour or two at the most, and they were just, like, ‘All right, thanks for coming, but we’re not going to continue with your services.’ So I basically had a two-day paid vacation in Manhattan. I went sightseeing and still remember having a Midori sour in the Windows on the World bar on the top floor of the World Trade Center’s North Tower.” KasparovChess suddenly resurfaced in April 2021, described as “a new multimedia content platform for chess lovers of all skill levels.” The platform hosted puzzles, online matches, tutorials, articles, documentaries, and an exclusive master class by Kasparov for premium members. Like with the first iteration of the site, there was an emphasis on multimedia lessons. Hundreds of videos had been pre-recorded, often featuring some of the world’s most famous grandmasters. In short, the site looked slick and promising. Would it work this time around? For the relaunch Kasparov partnered with global media company Vivendi. The company, the owner of businesses like Canal+ and Dailymotion, was also an early sponsor of the Grand Chess Tour, an annual circuit of chess tournaments to which Kasparov was a special advisor. Vivendi’s subsidiary Keysquare provided a starting capital of $3.5 million. The business model was quite different from the one in 1999–2000, this time going for freemium: some content was free, but the best material was available for a $13.99 monthly fee or $119.99 for a yearly subscription—for comparison, an annual Diamond membership on Chess.com, providing all the premium features, went for $99 that year. For a few months in 2021, KasparovChess gained quite a bit of traction as top grandmasters promoted their videos on social media. Two years later, nobody was talking about the company any more. It’s not easy to explain why Kasparov’s online enterprises failed twice. I believe that, in the early 2000s, it was a combination of perhaps naive management and bad timing: the market of chess players wishing to spend money on the internet just wasn’t big enough yet. Two decades later, it might have been too saturated: KasparovChess couldn’t claim a sizeable market share from the existing and successful commercial platforms, most notably Chess.com. Meanwhile, in those early 2000s, the ICC went from strength to strength, although not without facing competition. Several others tried to set up playing servers as a business, including Yahoo!Chess, Chess.net, the World Chess Network, Chesslive, Chesspark, and Chesscube. In the market for club-level players, the ICC’s biggest rival was Playchess, a playing server developed by ChessBase and launched in October 2001. Many serious amateurs, as well as grandmasters, would have accounts on both ICC and Playchess, and the two companies presided over a roughly equal market share for a few years. The next chapter will explore how they were relegated to marginal players, losing the battle to Lichess and Chess.com. With the incredible rise in popularity of online chess since the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, it’s easy to forget that playing chess over the internet is basically as old as the internet itself. Thanks to technology, playing a game in real time with someone at the other end of the world has been possible since the late 1980s. Chess was already a game without limitations, as it could be played between opponents of any age, gender, ethnic group, political affiliation, or religion. Now, distance was not a problem either. It took a few decades before the true global revolution would take place, but the seeds had been sown.",

We will have to somehow convince all these people who play for free to come over to our site and then pay us money. Like, at what point is that business model ever gonna work?” —Jay Severson, to Erik Allebest, in 2005 It is September 1995, the first week of freshman year for Erik Allebest, who has just turned 18. He wakes up and walks to the shared bathroom at the Brigham Young University (BYU) campus in Provo, Utah. He sees a young man of the same age, wearing glasses and brushing his teeth. Allebest uses the bathroom for a couple of minutes, comes back, and the fellow is still brushing. “It just seemed like a really long time,” Allebest told me. “So I said, ‘What, is your dad a dentist, or something?’ ” It is the first thing Allebest ever says to Jarom (Jay) Severson, his future friend and cofounder of Chess.com. Later that day, Severson walks along the third floor of Merrill Hall and notices two students inside one of the dormitories. One is Allebest, the other is Ryan Miller, and they are playing chess. “Can I get the winner?” Severson asks. He beats them both. No, he destroys them. Allebest recalled, “When he came in and saw me playing chess, I felt like he wanted to kick my ass because I’d made this snarky comment in the morning.” Born in 1977 in Silverton, Oregon, Severson grew up in a small town a few miles south called Lebanon. He and his five siblings were raised as Mormons. (These days, the preferred term is “Latter-day Saints.”) Severson told me that when he was 11 years old, the family-owned pizzeria went bankrupt and his father lost his job as a police officer. The family eventually relocated to San José when Severson was in sixth grade. He learned about chess when his father, who enjoyed carpentry as a hobby, made a large, heavy chessboard all by himself, using thick, solid wood. At first, he watched his older brothers play, until they allowed him to join in. Severson told me he got hooked on the game in high school, which had a chess club and played team matches with other schools: “I got sucked in real big.” He started buying chess books and even entered individual tournaments. When he joined BYU, Severson was the obvious person to run the chess club. Allebest, also born in 1977, came from a family of Latter-day Saints too, but he grew up in upper-class Laguna Hills, Orange County, in Southern California. His mother taught him chess when he was eight years old. His father was a lawyer with an entrepreneurial mindset, which Allebest inherited. On Monday mornings he went where the kids drank beers on the weekends, collected the cans and recycled them for $20. After graduating from high school, Allebest went to BYU and deliberately chose something that was not too challenging. In an interview in 2021, he said, “I was an English major, but only so I could get through classes as quickly as possible. I didn’t feel like I was learning a lot in school. I would literally put my Shakespeare book on my desk. Inside of that, I would have a Computers for Dummies or HTML for Beginners. I was teaching myself about computers and technology.” In that BYU dorm in September 1995, Allebest was impressed by Severson’s chess skills and asked, “How did you do that? Hey, can you give me some chess lessons? I’ll pay you $7 an hour.” And that’s what they agreed on. The two met about once a week, and while Severson started teaching Allebest chess openings, their friendship blossomed. Erik Allebest, left, and Jay Severson, right, the founders of Chess.com, as students on a trip (year unknown). Things were different in sophomore year when Severson continued college, but most of his friends, including Allebest, started their two-year missionary service abroad, a typical interruption from college for young Latter-day Saints. The two of them lost touch for a few years. Meanwhile, Severson became a successful video game player who won the 1998 StarCraft World Championship, a 3,000-player competition hosted as part of the Professional Gamers League’s third season. Gaining the first prize of $8,500 and a new computer was nice, but much more lucrative was the sponsorship deal Severson signed with Logitech, worth about $50,000 after he was featured in magazines like Newsweek and Wired. Not bad for a 20-year-old student coming from a family that used to live on welfare. Severson: “I felt I could retire.” But he didn’t. In fact, his professional gaming career only lasted a year or two as Severson decided to enter San José State University (SJSU) instead, ultimately going for a computer science major. He learned about HTML and built his very first two websites: one about winning strategies for the board game Axis and Allies and one about chess openings. After graduating, he worked at different companies as a developer, including Case’s Ladder, which brought him to KasparovChess in New York, and, later, a company called Myers, where he built real-estate and mortgage-related websites. On the other hand, Allebest became an entrepreneur early on. After returning from his mission in Argentina, he created two chess-related companies during his years at BYU. One was Schoolhouse Chess, a chess tutoring program he implemented in dozens of elementary schools across Utah. Out of that company came his e-commerce business, wholesalechess.com, which Severson helped code. Allebest would import chess sets from China (before Alibaba made that easy), store them in his garage, sell them online, and ship them all over the country (before Amazon made running such a business hard). After a few years, Allebest sold the two companies and entered Stanford Business School to get his master’s degree. He interned at Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, Google, and Palantir but turned down full-time positions. In the spring of 2005 he called Severson and said, “Hey, I met the guys that own the chess.com domain. What do you think about doing another chess business together?” Severson wasn’t excited at all. At that point, he had a job at Myers that paid him a pretty good salary, and he had seen many businesses fail in the chess space, including Kasparov Chess Online. The Internet Chess Club was doing okay but wasn’t growing much any more. The only really big chess platform at the time was Yahoo!Chess, but people there were playing for free. Severson told Allebest, “I would love to work with you but, dude, there’s no money in chess.” But Allebest had a plan. He said, “Well, we’ll do it this way. We’ll create profiles for players and make other content, and we’ll have ads for revenue. It will be a MySpace for chess. Just come with me and meet these guys and see how it goes.” Severson agreed, and soon they met with the original chess.com domain owners in the Japanese restaurant Fuki Sushi in Palo Alto, a famous spot in Silicon Valley where many tech companies have started. “So we walk into this meeting, and they were all mid-sixties and older; they were an older group of guys that just generationally did not understand the internet,” Severson said. “They didn’t understand where the internet was going; they didn’t have the technological background to do what they wanted. They were still mailing people DVDs.” The owners had been using the chess.com domain since 1995 to sell Chess Mentor, an educational tool they were trying to get into all California schools as part of the curriculum. They were working with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a chess fan and California’s governor at the time. However, the company had raised $5 million and wasn’t seeing enough sales or growth, so the owners were looking for ways to pay off debt. Bringing in two young tech guys with a track record of building chess sites to do something better with the domain seemed like a good plan. Severson told me, “Erik turns to me and goes, ‘Jay, why don’t you tell these guys why you’re so excited to work on Chess.com?’ And I totally BS for the next 15 minutes about what we would do with the platform and how it would be super-awesome. In my mind, I was thinking: ‘I don’t even wanna do this; this is not what I want to be doing with my time right now. I have a real job.’ ” Even so, Severson convinced the Chess Mentor people to join forces with them. They agreed to lease the domain but keep the property, while Allebest and Severson could put real estate on it and try to generate traffic. And so the brainstorming started: what should that property look like? On July 28, 2005, all Chess Mentor content was removed from the chess.com domain and replaced by the following placeholder text, which revealed some of the early plans: “Chess.com is currently under development to become the #1 online chess portal! The new Chess.com will help you find the best chess stores, places to play chess, where to learn chess, and more. There will be chess community forums to discuss chess openings, a directory of all chess websites, and other features.” In an email from October 21, 2005, Allebest outlined to Severson for the first time what Chess.com should have at launch, listing a place to register, an About page, a directory, a blog, forums, other resources, a search bar, a Learn page, a Play page, and a Shop page. And then, just a few months later, when Allebest and Severson had barely started working on actual code, the Chess Mentor company suddenly filed for bankruptcy. The owners intended to liquidate all assets to the highest bidder at a bankruptcy auction and thus get rid of their debts. Allebest was especially interested in the chess.com domain name, and he decided to try his luck together with his friend Zach Stout. The auction occurred on December 21, 2005, and all bidders joined by phone. Stout joined the auction and, with a winning bid of $55,000, he obtained that lovely domain name alongside all other company assets, including the Chess Mentor lesson material. On January 1, 2006, Allebest bought everything from Stout (who, in return, got a small percentage of the company). For an entrepreneur married with two young kids, it was a big investment. It was also the best investment ever made in the history of chess. How to Build a Chess Website Owning the top domain for a keyword like “chess” had immense value, especially thanks to the introduction of the auto-complete feature first included in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 5, as well as other browsers like Firefox. This feature meant that if you typed “chess” in the search bar and hit enter, the browser would add “.com” itself and go there. Even if you just intended to search for chess, you would end up on chess.com immediately. The site received thousands of free visitors daily, and it was time to do something about it. Two years of hard work followed. While Severson was still employed at Myers, he worked as a contractor for several other companies doing side work as a developer. At night, he worked on Chess.com. Allebest visited him almost daily as they worked from Severson’s room on the third floor in San José, coding until the early hours of the morning before Allebest drove back to Mountain View, only to return the next evening, rinse and repeat. In a podcast in November 2021, Severson said about this period, “The first few years of Chess.com, I felt like I was working 20-hour days. There were some days I couldn’t sleep at all. My wife remembers those days. Sometimes I would just go out in the garage and literally scream, just to let out how angry I was. It was exhausting.” Allebest conceptualized the whole site with 150 pages of wireframes in Microsoft Word. They started in September 2006, with Severson doing the back end (for the tech-minded: he used the Qcodo framework) and Allebest the front end. While making more and more progress on the code, at some point, they needed someone to “take that code and run it”—in other words, a server guy. Severson’s good friend and colleague at Myers, Igor Grinchenko, had the perfect skill set. Born in Kyrgyzstan, Grinchenko had come to the United States as a student in the late 1990s and was now the main IT guy at Myers. “The first time I saw him, he looked like the scariest, meanest Russian dude you have ever seen in your life,” Severson remembered. “He had this long mullet in the back and a small scar on his face, and just looked super-intimidating. But he said, ‘Dude, you’re the only programmer that knows what you’re doing.’ And I was like, ‘Dude, you’re the only IT guy that knows what you’re doing.’ And so we became really good friends. The most badass part about Igor was that every time he would drive in and out of the parking lot, I would laugh at his license plate that said: ‘UNIXRLZ.’ [Unix rules.] I mean, you can’t get any more hardcore than that.” Grinchenko decided to help them, and the team purchased their first server, a $3,000 Dell PowerEdge 1950. “We bought a two-unit machine from the Dell website, and it came to my apartment,” Grinchenko told me. “I called it ‘Igor 1.’ ” (Today, Chess.com has hundreds of servers spread across multiple locations throughout the US and in the cloud.) If you build a member site for chess fans, you need one thing that other social platforms don’t: a chessboard. Chess fans who read, populate forums, and write blogs need to be able to share their chess games and positions using a digital, 2D chessboard, similar to a chess diagram in a book or newspaper, but interactive. For that, too, Allebest and Severson found the right person: the Argentinean developer Matias José, who had created an account and soon after started bugging Erik with lots of feedback, basically, until he got hired. After a short beta testing period, Chess.com was launched publicly on May 18, 2007 (time of birth: 2:30 p.m. Pacific). The site had forums, blogs, articles, the option to play against the computer—and not much else. For the first few months it was all about content, as the articles posted by some of the early members started to generate traffic. The Chess.com home page in August 2007, three months after site launch. Meanwhile, Allebest finished his business degree at Stanford and could fully dedicate himself to his chess project, which, to him, still felt temporary. In a podcast in 2019 he described his attitude at the time: “I’m going to spend one year doing this at most, and then I’m going to go take one of those job offers from the big tech companies. And that just never happened. It just kept growing and growing.” Part of that growth came from being featured in July 2007 on the influential Mashable and TechCrunch websites, leading blogs for news about technology and start-ups. An important next step came when José rebuilt his chessboard into an application that allowed members to play chess against each other. Called “Daily Chess,” it was slow chess without a clock, but it was a start. Allebest himself played the first-ever game on the site on July 8, 2007. He beat member nyarlathotep in 19 moves. By the end of that month, and less than 60 days after its launch, Chess.com reached 10,000 members. Five weeks later, that was 20,000—at the end of October, 50,000. The site grew 10 percent per week for most of its metrics: unique visitors, unique member logins, and page views. Even so, Chess.com was more or less what Allebest and Severson had in mind and were satisfied with if it would stay like this: a content and members platform that produced ad revenue thanks to its excellent domain name. They didn’t believe it would generate much more money. Years later, Allebest and Severson would admit they were a bit under the “Silicon Valley pressure” of raising money, going big, and making a bunch of money at once. And chess, with its tiny market, wouldn’t do that for them. “We used to call it a lifestyle business,” Severson said. “We thought, maybe one day, it will be worth $5 million, if we’re lucky.” It took another half year or so for the early developers to launch what would become the single most important part of the website: the live server. It was the place where members could play real-time chess, with a clock, against each other. The leading developer behind this project was the Polish programmer Piotr Dachtera, who had built a small but slick chess server a few years before that ran on the URL 64pola.pl, Polish for “64 squares.” It had an elegant chessboard based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dachtera joined the company in February 2006, and “Live Chess” went live in early 2008. In May of that year, a Facebook app was launched, allowing members to play with friends who weren’t on Chess.com yet. It would be Chess.com’s biggest external driver of new members in the coming years. Paid memberships were introduced in 2008 as well: for a small monthly fee, premium members could access a web version of the old Chess Mentor software. And it worked. “When we launched it on one of the evenings, and Erik got home, he texted me that he wasn’t going to go to bed before the first member made a payment,” said Severson. “It took five minutes.” The company became profitable soon after and remains so to this day. On January 14, 2009, the word beta was removed from the logo, signifying that the site was fully grown and ready to storm the world even more. That logo has always been quite different from logos of other chess companies, which often use a king, knight, or rook. Allebest and Severson deliberately chose a pawn instead to emphasize that the site was not just for strong players or amateurs but for everyone. Enter Danny and David Chess.com kept growing but remained the small kid on the block. ICC and Playchess, the German platform mentioned in the previous chapter, dominated the chess landscape as the two places where the grandmasters played and, consequently, where all the serious amateurs could be found. If Chess.com was grabbing any market share, it was from Yahoo!Chess, which served the larger group of casual players. In mid-December 2008, Chess.com had 390,000 members, tons of content and features, and a live server with about 2,000 players online all the time. However, one thing was missing: strong players. “We knew that we were not high-enough-rated chess professionals, [for those] in the know in the community, to be able to go after that market,” Severson said. “I was probably rated around 1850 at the time, Erik was about 1500. We didn’t know the right people and were not taken seriously. People would say: “Oh, you’re those guys from Chess.com trying to do that stupid chess idea. Who do you think you are? Kasparov couldn’t even build a chess site, and you guys think you can do it?’ ” And so, in late 2008, Allebest and Severson, both 31 years old at the time, decided to visit the Berkeley Masters, a big chess tournament in Berkeley, California, with one idea in mind: to meet some strong players who might be willing to help them. One of the participants they would meet during the seventh round on December 20 was a 23-year-old player named Danny Rensch, who would score his second international master norm in this tournament. “I was playing this game against the Mongolian grandmaster Dashzeveg Sharavdorj and in walk these two guys,” Rensch remembered. “I was quickly wrapping up my game as I was super-excited to meet them.” On one of the final days of the tournament, Allebest and Severson joined Rensch and other strong players for a dinner arranged by the tournament organizer, the 27-year-old international master David Pruess. “I was all over them,” said Rensch. “I was telling them that I wanted to launch a chess teaching business of my own, that I brought all this value, and that I knew everything about the chess community.” Allebest and Severson, however, were mostly looking for strong players who could write instructional articles and other types of content, which initially clashed with Rensch’s bigger plans. As a result, it was Pruess who got hired as the director of professional relations in February 2009. He was in charge of contacting top players, recruiting titled players to become columnists or lecturers on the site, and coordinating Chess.com’s sponsorship of events. “He had the respect of the titled community because he was a titled player,” said Severson. “People would return his emails, whereas they wouldn’t return our emails.” Titled players got free premium accounts, and Chess.com started to organize tournaments for them with modest prize money. Meanwhile, Rensch was still pursuing his own business but also started providing content for Chess.com. A few months later, in May 2009, the site celebrated its second anniversary. There were now 600,000 users on the site and another 400,000 on the Facebook app, so the one-million barrier had been broken. The company employed ten full-timers and several part-timers, including Rensch, who would only become an official employee in April 2010. The videos that he made were big hits. With his energy and humor, it all clicked for the members. One of them sent an email saying, “Danny Rensch is worth the price of the diamond membership alone.” Echos of ICC and FICS: Chess.com versus Lichess “Should we do another game?” Allebest asked Severson. By the summer of 2009, Chess.com had become a self-sustainable and profitable website. That nice little chess project, that lifestyle business, was doing all right. Perhaps still feeling some of the Silicon Valley pressure, Allebest suggested taking their concept to another level. Dominoes? Backgammon? Take what they’ve learned with search engine optimization (SEO) and what it means to have a great domain name and do it in a much bigger industry. An opportunity came up in August to buy the domain exercise.com for half a million dollars, and the two chess entrepreneurs stopped working full-time on Chess.com. Joined by their friend Dan Rosenthal, they were off to a fresh start and even rented an office on Castro Street in Mountain View, California. For the new site, they used a different PHP technology stack called Symfony. They reached out to one of the top Symfony developers in the world, who was an important contributor to the open-source framework. His name was Thibault Duplessis. Born in France in 1984, Duplessis was already programming with QBasic on Casio calculators in high school. He studied computer science and worked for a few years as a software engineer while contributing to open-source projects. In early 2010 he was working as a developer at a French agency, making websites and experimenting with different technologies, when Allebest and Severson approached him. Duplessis accepted the offer to work for Exercise.com and came to California in the fall, where he initially stayed with Severson’s family. He started coding, and everyone was impressed. He was incredibly productive, capable of doing something in an hour which would take others half a day. Severson: “I remember that every time I would ask, ‘Hey, Thibault, do you wanna go see a movie tonight? You wanna go hang out with friends? You wanna go out drinking and go to a bar?’ he was like, ‘No, I think I just want to stay in the room tonight and write code.’ It was very clear to me that he loved programming on a different level than anybody else I’d ever met in my life. He would easily code 14 hours a day and just love every minute of it.” Meanwhile, like Piotr Dachtera, Duplessis had created a chessboard in the programming language AJAX as a hobby project. He decided to push his creation online and make it open source. “I moved on to the next project, but someday I noticed that someone was actually playing chess on this very simple, very silly website,” Duplessis said, during a presentation in June 2017 in Munich, Germany. “I was like, what the hell, there were requests in the Apache [server] logs. So, I added a chat to the page in order to communicate with this user, and there was a user indeed. The guy started to yell at me because it was full of bugs. I wasn’t even validating if the moves were illegal! So I fixed the bugs. He asked for features, and I added features and bugs. A few more players arrived, some offered to help, and it became Lichess.” The first game on Lichess was played on June 20, 2010, about two months before Duplessis traveled to California. Until November of that year, people logged in anonymously before the option came to create an account. To his surprise, the community on the site kept growing organically. When Allebest and Severson finally found out about his chess site, they were not amused. Duplessis told them it wasn’t a serious project but that he built it to learn and practice with new programming languages. In the summer of 2011 everyone joined for lunch at their favorite Mongolian restaurant in Mountain View. The whole team was there: about eight or nine people, including the three founders, Allebest, Rosenthal, and Severson. Colleagues shared stories about their weekend, but Duplessis’s story was different. “I’ve been reading these books and found this new language,” Severson quoted him. “It’s unbelievable. It’s like the most beautiful programming language I’ve ever seen. I don’t like PHP any more; I don’t like Symfony. I just want to write Scala all day.” Severson: “We were looking at him and thinking, ‘You don’t fall in love with a language over the weekend, right? And you have to write PHP because that’s what you’re doing for us.’ We all had this confused look on our faces.” Rosenthal asked, “Are you quitting Exercise.com?” Duplessis replied, “Yes, I think I am.” He left Exercise.com in September 2011 and started rewriting Lichess completely using Scala. Duplessis is a big believer in open source, the concept that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance your source code. Important parts of the internet run on open-source code, including operating systems (for example, Unix), web servers (Apache), content management systems (WordPress), databases (MySQL), and languages (JavaScript). The Lichess code has been used to create the most popular playing server for draughts, which you can find at lidraughts.org, and there’s one for shogi at lishogi.org. Looking back at it years later, the Lichess founder said he was the right person at the right time to come up with the idea of a free chess platform. “One that would treat players as people and not cattle,” as he put it. He meant that the users would not be bothered with ads or requests for paid memberships. It is a concept diametrically opposed to Chess.com’s, a company that, at the end of the day, needs to bring money to the table. And so, three decades later, the chess world has a new “FICS versus ICC” situation, although it’s not as simple as a clash between socialist and capitalist mindsets. “Money isn’t everything, but it is the resource and the tool that gives you the ability to actually build really cool things and grow the game,” said Severson. “I admit that I am money-driven. But it’s okay, as long as you keep in mind that you’re not just making money so you can buy a yacht. You’re making money as a company to further the cause of the game. I think we’ve stayed true to that mission.” A term that wouldn’t come to mind to describe Duplessis is money-driven. Keeping Lichess completely free has become an important mission. In an interview in July 2023 he explained: “The chess community is made of very smart people, who will not be satisfied with corporations using their hobby for profit, with mediocre proprietary software. Instead, the chess players of the world want to take matters into their own hands: build their own tools, and publish the code and the data to strengthen the chess ecosystem.” This philosophy also explains the site’s name: Lichess (pronounced lee-chess) combines live, light, libre, and chess. “Live, because games are played and watched in real-time 24/7; light and libre for the fact that Lichess is open-source and unencumbered by proprietary junk that plagues other websites,” the site itself explains. Duplessis funded the site’s running costs for about five years until it became clear that this wasn’t sustainable, with server costs getting as high as thousands of dollars per month. In June 2016 Lichess officially gained a nonprofit legal status as an association governed by the French Law of Associations of July 1, 1901. The registry noted that the site’s goal is “to promote and encourage the teaching and practice of the game of chess and its variants.” The association status gave Lichess, which is fully funded by donations from patrons, access to banking services and the ability to employ staff and rent property. Lichess stopped being a one-man show a long time ago. Duplessis credits a large community of volunteers with a shared belief in open source and a free internet. In 2023 the total number of people contributing to translations, to the code or otherwise, was in the high thousands. The “core team,” active daily, was numbered in the hundreds, while about 20 people were paid or eligible to be paid—equivalent to about seven full-time positions. They were working on the second most popular chess platform in the world. According to SimilarWeb—a digital market intelligence company that provides data and insights related to website traffic, user engagement, and online market share—Lichess had about 85 million total visits in June 2023. In comparison, Chess.com had just over 200 million. The numbers can differ quite strongly in different countries though: the traffic share in the US was 83 percent and 17 percent respectively, and similar in India with 82 percent and 18 percent. But in Germany, say, it was 59 percent for Chess.com versus 41 percent for Lichess. From a business perspective, you could even call it “unfair competition” because Chess.com is not dealing with another company but a nonprofit offering a similar product without charging for it. The core product, however—playing a game of chess—is 100 percent free on both Chess.com and Lichess. Many features on the two platforms are virtually identical (such as puzzles, analysis tools, and AI-generated game reviews), but each site also has its own unique features and community. Meanwhile, Allebest and Severson haven’t been in touch with Duplessis for years. “I would say we’re on non-speaking terms,” said Severson. Bringing Video into the Chess World I am a weak chess player and a strong chess player. I belong to the group of players who can effortlessly checkmate most random people in the street but hardly stand a chance against a grandmaster. I say “hardly” because I beat one once in my life. It was in a tournament in July 1996. I was 20 and had played serious chess for about seven years. Somehow, I defeated the Polish American grandmaster Alexander Wojtkiewicz, the world’s 276th player at the time. Since then, I have scored two international master norms (meaning I played nine-round tournaments at the IM level twice). Although few club players can say that, I still consider myself more a writer than a player. I might have influenced the chess world somewhat with my video journalism, which I should be talking about as well. Let’s wind back the clock a bit. On February 6, 2006, I created an account on blogspot.com and published my first blog post. Blogging was a popular internet activity in the early 2000s. It was about sharing thoughts, experiences or hobbies on a blog, short for weblog. Platforms like Blogger, LiveJournal, Moveable Type, and, later, WordPress made it easy for people to create their own sites and post articles, which readers could comment on. Before social media took over, many people blogged about politics, perhaps even more about food, and some about chess. My initial idea for the blog was to publish and discuss chess games, including those I played myself. I soon started writing about all kinds of chess-related topics: the 80th birthday of a famous Russian grandmaster; talented young players at a tournament in Mexico; a book review; a report on the local Amsterdam city championship, where I participated and wrote a complete tournament report. A pivotal moment came in October 2006 when I was playing a tournament in Hoogeveen, a small city in the north of my country. The organizers allowed me to enter the press room each day after I finished my game, where I would meet players and other reporters, including Macauley Peterson, an American chess fan who was spending a year studying film theory in Amsterdam. Soon, we would be colleagues and friends, and Peterson would play a big role in my early years in chess video journalism. One day, I went to the press room where I saw two participants of the main event, Judit Polgár and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, behind a chessboard. They were analyzing their game—something you hardly see today but was quite common then, as the opponent’s opinions were still valued higher than the computer’s. I switched roles from player to reporter and started filming them with my Nikon Coolpix camera. I had experimented with video before and knew my readers enjoyed watching top players analyzing. In a way, they were getting a sort of a free masterclass, and I enjoyed providing a service for the chess world. Two weeks later, the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree mentioned my name in his chess column in the national newspaper NRC. His article “Spied Everywhere” suggested that watching YouTube should perhaps become part of grandmaster preparation. Why? Two weeks after Hoogeveen, in a tournament in Moscow, Mamedyarov had played a quick draw against the Latvian grandmaster Alexei Shirov without using any time on the clock; the Azerbaijani player only needed to remember his prepared homework, including an important new move in a key position. As it turned out, Shirov could have known about that important new move because Mamedyarov had shown it to Polgár in my video! “The Dutch chess player Peter Doggers filmed that analysis and posted the video on his chess website and later also on YouTube,” Ree wrote. “He did not know that he was revealing an important opening novelty; otherwise, he might have had conscientious objections.” When I met Shirov two months later in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, we shook hands, but he also exclaimed, “I am not talking to you!” I still don’t know if he was joking or not. In January 2007, at the annual chess festival in Wijk aan Zee, I was allowed for the first time to enter the stage where the top grandmasters played—a closed-off and sacred segment of the tournament hall. I made new videos, which could be as basic as players arriving at their board, shaking hands and making their first moves, but even that was special then. In a way, I started a new era for chess: the video age. Never before did chess fans have free access to behind-the-scenes activity at top chess events, and never before were interviews with players recorded on video and made available just hours later to enjoy. I did something else that my website visitors appreciated immensely. Each day in Wijk aan Zee, it was common to have a grandmaster—usually someone who’d scored a nice victory—come to the press room and explain their game to the press using a large wooden demonstration board. Tournament director Jeroen van den Berg gave the green light for an idea I had: why didn’t I put up a camera on a tripod, film these analysis sessions by grandmasters, and post them online so that not only the media but all the chess fans in the world could enjoy them? I borrowed a JVC MiniDV digital video camera that recorded on tape and took it to Wijk aan Zee for two weeks. You can still find those videos on the YouTube account Chesscomcommunity. They are basically free lectures by famous players such as Viswanathan Anand, Vladimir Kramnik, and a very young Magnus Carlsen. People loved it. Where before it had about a thousand visitors daily prior to the tournament, my website was getting 15,000 visitors a day a week into the tournament. My site was now located at chessvibes.com. I launched the new URL on January 1, 2007, inspired by the French content aggregator Netvibes I was using. Looking back, I still like the name ChessVibes, which has a positive ring to it, like a chess version of “Good Vibrations” by the Beach Boys. Although when I met the 12th World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov a few years later in Wijk aan Zee, he told me he was reading my articles (yes!) but didn’t know what the word “vibes” meant (oops). Still, the new name was much better than what I had used between February and December 2006: doggers-schaak.nl. My surname likely refers to ancestors who used a “dogger,” a two-masted trawling ship used for fishing in the North Sea. However, as I discovered sometime in late 2006, with a mixture of horror and amusement, “dogging” is also British slang for “engaging in public sex while others watch.” Maybe I didn’t need my surname in that URL anymore … That 2007 edition of Wijk aan Zee was a true breakthrough moment for me: the start of a fascinating journey in the chess world that is not over yet. In September 2007 Peterson and I joined for our first big event: the FIDE World Chess Championship tournament in Mexico City. We provided daily coverage in text and video, mixing player quotes from the press conferences with shots from the playing hall. Soon, tournament organizers wanted us to make video content for them. One of the first was Joop van Oosterom, a Dutch billionaire and chess fanatic who had been organizing an annual chess tournament since 1993 named after his daughter Melody Amber. Peterson and I worked at the last four editions between 2008 and 2011, unforgettable tournaments held in five-star hotels on the French Riviera, where the weather was lovely, the food exquisite, and the service impeccable. As we continued to produce videos, others followed suit. For instance, a team representing the French magazine Europe Échecs was suddenly going to all the tournaments, making videos similar to ours. The chess world had embraced the video format. Meanwhile, I started to focus on writing more and more, and my stories became just as important for my website as the videos. I added more contributors to my site, launched digital magazines, and hired a programmer to rebuild the backend to prepare it for bigger growth. Despite all this, I was having doubts about the future of ChessVibes. Five years after quitting my job, I was making only about half of what I’d been earning previously. I was 37 years old and wondering how long I wanted to go on with this lovely business that looked brilliant from the outside but was tough to grow without attracting investors. Talks with ICC and New in Chess to form a joint company led nowhere, and then, on December 21, 2012, I received an email that would change everything: Hi! This is Erik from Chess.com. I’d love to discuss ways we might be able to work together! Who is the right person to speak with? Thanks! Erik CEO, Chess.com I joined Chess.com in September 2013 and continued doing my reporting, often with Chess.com’s Mike Klein, and producing videos for my new employers, who gave me the journalistic freedom to continue in the same fashion as before. Meanwhile, Exercise.com lasted only two years for Allebest and Severson, as it never turned into the endeavor they had in mind. “We didn’t feel the passion for it,” said Allebest. “And part of the problem was that the whole time we were trying to work on Exercise, we saw this little annoying thing over here. It was just growing and growing and growing.” A big moment for Chess.com came when the company closed a deal with Hikaru Nakamura to play on the site. Until then, Nakamura had been loyal to the Internet Chess Club, even owning shares. It helped, however, that he had known Rensch since he was small. “I stayed with his family two summers in a row, playing baseball and basketball,” said Rensch. It was Allebest who called Nakamura, offering $16,000 a year for just three things: Nakamura had to wear a Chess.com wristband at over-the-board tournaments, play a minimum of 150 games per month on Chess.com, and regularly participate in Titled Tuesdays. Note that he was never asked to play on Chess.com exclusively. “It seemed fresh, something new,” Nakamura told me. “I think I just had the feeling that Danny and Erik were on the right path, even back then.” He accepted the deal and started making some extra money on top of the agreement as he won prizes in Titled Tuesdays more often than not. He also played much more than 150 games a month. “He borderline became exclusive because he appreciated the love we were giving him by making him kind of our guy,” said Rensch. “At the end of the day, Hikaru is a very loyal person, and when he felt like we genuinely loved him and wanted him, I think that was a game changer for him.” As the years went by, Chess.com broke record after record. On December 5, 2014, the one billionth game was played on the server. It took only a further two and a half years to break two billion, and soon, that became a problem: the “32-bit bug” led Chess.com to feature on Hacker News and other tech sites. Late one Saturday evening, on June 10, 2017, Chess.com started to receive messages from members claiming the site was broken. It was the start of the weekend for many developers, so the worst time for a major bug to surface. More and more people were complaining over the weekend, and only on Monday morning did the iOS development team suddenly realize they were dealing with an overflow problem. In other words, the devices used by the members couldn’t handle the number of games. The problem was limited to pre-2013 iOS devices, since the live server worked everywhere except on 32-bit iPhones and iPads. The reason was that 2,147,483,648 games had been played on Chess.com, and new games, with a higher game ID, were breaking the 32-bit integer limit of those older iOS devices, which simply didn’t support interpretation for numbers higher than 231. It was a comical result of yet another amazing milestone reached by the site. The same thing had happened a few years before on YouTube when PSY’s smash-hit song “Gangnam Style” exceeded 2,147,483,647 views. Like Google, Chess.com quickly fixed the bug. An update to the iOS app was submitted to the App Store, which Apple accepted within two hours. As the CEO, Allebest explained the slightly embarrassing but funny bug in a blog post: “Likely, the developer didn’t expect two billion games at the time that code was written long ago. But, on the other hand, two billion games!!! The moral of the story, I guess, is: when you have an idea, always plan BIG. That’s why when I retire and open my donut shop, I’m going to have seating for THREE billion customers.” Beating the ICC The 32-bit bug was a funny episode that could only have happened to Chess.com, now the biggest chess company. It became clear that Chess.com, which started as an underdog, had become a giant that was outgrowing the other chess platforms out there—most notably, the long-term market leader for serious players, the Internet Chess Club. How did this happen? For starters, none of the ICC’s cofounders were of the true entrepreneurial type. The original initiator, Daniel Sleator, is a computer scientist from St. Louis; Marty Grund, a stained glass craftsman from Des Moines; and Eric Peterson, a research geophysicist from Dallas. When a buyout by another company failed in the fall of 2001 due to the 9/11 terrorist attack, it was Sleator’s wife who took over the daily running of the company. “We were a ship without a clear captain. It was like a soap opera, like Dallas or Dynasty,” said Ruy Mora, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer. “I think we had at least four or five people who were CEO for a year.” For two decades, the ICC had made a profit, shareholders received their dividends, and little to no new investment was made. Things remained the same for the users, who only got to play from the browser at a very late stage. “As long as our members were playing with a downloadable client like BlitzIn, we felt in control in our fight against cheating,” Mora explained. “The program would register their mouse-handling, whether they would switch to another program, and if they were running an engine. We thought we would lose that control if we [went] web-based.” By the time the ICC realized that playing from the browser was the future, Chess.com already had a head start, a gap that soon became impossible to bridge. The same happened to ChessBase’s Playchess, said Mora: “They started strongly, but it wasn’t clear what they wanted to do with the platform. It was tightly knit into their ChessBase product. They wanted to make it a seamless experience, but ChessBase was also complicated to use. It didn’t help to popularize the platform.” Rensch gave me three reasons why Chess.com ended up beating the ICC. First, Hikaru Nakamura. Second, Chess.com’s superior analysis board—“the analysis tool was critical for coaching online. And when coaches teach their students on your site, they bring them over.” Third, product. “There’s no debate that for the first five or six years, ICC was just a better play experience,” admitted Rensch. “It was faster, it was cleaner, it was less laggy. Browser technology was not up to snuff with app technology.” Players were happy to go through the hassle of downloading the needed software for playing games as long as it was clearly faster. When Mozilla and Google Chrome’s browser technology and Chess.com’s technology improved, everything turned around. “It’s one of those funny things, because to everyone outside the chess world now, it looks like Chess.com winning was a foregone conclusion—but, for us, we were the underdogs, and this was a huge moment,” said Rensch. “ICC, at one point, had laughed us out of the building.” Chess24 and Live Broadcasts That same summer of 2017, Chess.com broke two round numbers: over 20 million members and over 100 full-time employees. Both figures surpassed any other chess company out there—although one had been growing steadily and was starting to look like Chess.com’s new big rival in the market. This was Chess24, owned in majority by the Bolivian businessman Enrique Guzman and co-run by the German grandmaster Jan Gustafsson. Guzman had made millions from cofounding and selling PokerStrategy.com, a successful portal for poker fans to improve their game with lots of articles and video lessons. He was now trying to do the same for chess by providing an educational and international platform that focused on instructional videos for chess fans who wanted to improve their game. Chess24 launched on February 24, 2014, with content and a play server. The new platform instantly became the most popular place for chess fans to watch their favorite players in action because of its shiny new HTML page for live games with a user interface that blew away any other site on the market. The only one that came close was ChessBomb, a Bulgarian website that had existed for about six years, but its interface offered fewer features and was also aesthetically lagging behind. (In November 2018, ChessBomb would be acquired by Chess.com and turned into its events page chess.com/events.) It’s fair to say that ChessBomb and Chess24 have radically changed how chess fans watch chess. For starters, they provided a home on the web to find all major chess events in one place. Chess events are being played around the globe pretty much 24/7, 365 days a year—from major events to local weekenders. Most clubs and tournaments broadcast the games on their websites, but it’s much more convenient for the chess fan to have one site to fall back on. The other important aspect that made watching chess on Chess24 and ChessBomb so popular was that the two sites integrated a running chess engine alongside the chess moves and the board, which suddenly made it much easier for viewers to understand what was going on. During the game, you could now see what would be the best move to play, according to the engine, and what evaluation belonged to it (e.g., “White is clearly better” or “the game is equal”). To show where the players made a mistake (according to the computer), ChessBomb used a system based on colors: an orange move would be dubious, and a red move a blunder. This became part of chess culture. Often, a grandmaster would ask after finishing a game, “Did I play any red moves?” Chess24 displayed a different system to evaluate positions—one which has subsequently become extremely common in chess: the eval bar. This vertical, thermometer-like bar is placed next to the chessboard with its bottom half white and the top half black at the start of a game. If White gains the advantage, the white segment in the bar goes up; conversely, if Black is doing well, more of the bar will be colored black. The eval bar is quite responsive, so when mistakes are made in quick succession, the bar can go up or down suddenly, adding a fantastic visual element to the experience of watching chess. Suddenly, many more fans could better understand what was going on, which is important for a game like chess. You can put anyone in front of a television that shows a soccer game, and in no time, they will understand that the idea is to get the ball into the goal. To enjoy watching chess, you need to know the rules at least and preferably have some experience playing the game yourself. Thanks to the eval bar, chess has become much more accessible to a wider audience. Although the eval bar has improved the viewing experience for many fans, thereby contributing to popularizing chess in general, it should be noted that there is also a downside to this new development: top players tend to be respected much less than in the old days, and wrongly so. Nowadays, complete patzers, “armchair analysts” who have access to computer analysis while watching the game live, know better about the mistakes made than the grandmasters themselves. Too many times, those fans leave derogatory comments in the chat or the comments section of news articles, saying that players are “bad” or “weak” or “terrible” because they made a move that the computer didn’t like. They completely forget what it’s like to be in the playing hall, with all the pressure and the clock ticking, as well as all the other moves in the game that were played on a level they could only dream about. Occasionally I play in a tournament myself, and I am always reminded of how tough chess really is. Another important aspect of the Chess24 platform was the embedded video player showing a tournament’s live video feed. Suddenly, it became extremely convenient to watch chess events. Because that was the thing now: chess tournaments had started to provide video shows with commentary. A pioneer in that area was my old friend Macauley Peterson. Working as a freelance video producer, Peterson’s broadcast production of the 2010 US championship in St. Louis was the first video broadcast of a top-level chess tournament on the internet. Small cameras showed footage from the playing hall; another cam was recording the commentators; and a 2D chessboard for analysis completed the frame—the basic elements of a chess broadcast that are still used today. The director of the London Chess Classic, Malcolm Pein, invited Peterson to do the same for his tournament in December of that year. After that, more and more tournaments wanted in, such as the annual festival in Gibraltar. In the years to come, I got involved in broadcasting myself on behalf of Chess.com, together with my Dutch friend Lennart Ootes. We made shows in Gibraltar, Reykjavík, Wijk aan Zee, Doha, Jerusalem, Skopje, Oslo, and Douglas (Isle of Man). In early 2024, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament demonstrated that online chess broadcasting had come a long way, as more than 50 cameras were placed in the playing hall, some of them as tiny as the one in your smartphone. By the end of 2021, Chess.com had grown about five times as big as in 2016 (partly thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic; see next chapter). The success didn’t go unnoticed, and the company was looking at multiple takeover bids. Some were not very serious, and others failed to materialize, but things were different when the American growth equity firm General Atlantic (GA) approached the company. GA had a good track record of helping companies like Airbnb, Duolingo, Slack, and Uber toward their IPOs, and Allebest liked their community-driven approach. A deal was signed just before the new year, and GA invested heavily in the company. The deal was unprecedented in size and volume for the chess world. It came, however, after a period of multiple other takeovers by Chess.com’s main rival. It’s about time to start talking about Play Magnus. For that, we have to go back to January 2014. Play Magnus and the Takeover A month before Chess24 went live, the Norwegian company Play Magnus launched its eponymous app with a beautifully simple idea: you could play against an AI version of Magnus Carlsen at different ages. A beginner could beat the five-year-old Magnus, but even the real Magnus struggled against the higher ages. The company, partly owned by the Carlsen family, later added a Magnus Trainer app for chess improvement, and an app for kids called Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess. In that same month of January 2014, Carlsen traveled to the US with his manager Espen Agdestein for several sponsor and promotional events. One of these was a dinner party thrown by billionaire investor Yuri Milner, a famous Israeli entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Carlsen played chess against several tech CEOs, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, a few days before he also met Bill Gates. Gaining these Silicon Valley contacts would prove to be of great value down the road. Approximately five years on, Play Magnus changed its game plan when the business chose a growth strategy based on multiple rounds of venture capital investments. In February 2019 Play Magnus acquired Chess24 at a value of $12.6 million. Chess24 had nearly 850,000 registered users at the time, with 600,000 monthly active users coming to the site. Half a year later, Chessable was also acquired, valued at $6.7 million. Between December 2020 and August 2021 PlayMagnus took over several more small chess companies, with Chessable becoming a key asset. This platform alone has changed chess significantly, especially for amateur players like me. Cofounded in November 2015 by the American international master John Bartholomew and the English player David Kramaley, Chessable was launched on February 22, 2016. The unique selling point of Chessable is its innovative approach to chess learning and training through its use of spaced repetition technology. In practice, this comes down to going through lessons, with videos and text, and then repeating the learned moves regularly on the website or in the app. Especially after the takeover by Play Magnus, Chessable started to add to its library the best content available, sourced from famous instructional books and new material from top-notch authors. Because these included some of the best grandmasters in the world, the material was valuable for both amateurs and strong players. When the American chess prodigy Abhimanyu Mishra became the world’s youngest grandmaster at age 12 in July 2021, it was no secret that he was an avid Chessable user. Eight months after Chess.com’s deal with General Atlantic, on August 24, 2022, a press release shocked the chess world: “Chess.com Makes Offer to Play Magnus Group.” Wait, what? Among many smaller commercial entities, there were two absolute kings in the chess world: Chess.com and Play Magnus. One king was about to eat the other to become the absolute, sovereign ruler. It was the chess equivalent of Microsoft merging with Apple. On December 16, 2022, the deal was closed. The chess world reacted with mixed feelings: some feared that Chess.com’s apparent monopoly was not a good thing, while others noted the benefits of merging two separate communities of online chess players. An important benefit for the fans was that Magnus Carlsen had signed on as a Chess.com ambassador. This meant he would likely compete even more in online events as he could now return to playing on Chess.com, as he had done before his affiliation with former rival Chess24 in 2019. Two days later, on December 18, 2022, Carlsen contested the 2022 Speed Chess Championship Final, where he lost to Hikaru Nakamura in a thrilling, down-to-the-wire battle watched by more than 200,000 viewers. In spring 2024, Chess.com had a total of 714 employees and 167 million registered users (of which 40 million were monthly active users), making it the ninth largest “country” in the world by population, just below Bangladesh and just above Russia. Its value is currently estimated to be over a billion dollars. If, as we’ll see in the next chapter, Levy Rozman is the personification of the chess revolution, Chess.com is the driving force behind it, the organization perhaps most responsible for accelerating the old board game’s popularity to new heights in the modern era.",

      "content": "Chapter 10The Streaming Revolution “Ladies and gentlemen, this video is being recorded on 24 January 2023, and the game of chess has literally never been more popular than it is right now. It is so popular, in fact, that it is crashing Chess.com servers on a daily basis.” —Levy Rozman, YouTube, January 2023 On July 14, 2017, one of America’s top grandmasters, Hikaru Nakamura, tried out his first-ever stream on Twitch. It attracted 900 viewers, a large amount for a first stream, but Nakamura wasn’t convinced. He streamed only 11 more times in 2017 and another 11 times the next year, for a few hundred concurrent viewers at most. “It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it, but, first of all, there was no financial gain from it, and, secondly, the community was extremely small,” he told me. But on one October evening in 2018 his perspective changed. Everything changed. Nakamura was playing in a tournament in Douglas, Isle of Man. Chess.com’s Danny Rensch was there too, assisting with the Chess.com live broadcast. He took Nakamura out for dinner to a fish restaurant with Hikaru’s stepfather Sunil Weeramantry, (now ex-) girlfriend Maria De Rosa, and second, Kris Littlejohn. “During that meal, Danny effectively told me that he felt there was real potential for live streaming to become something much bigger for chess,” said Nakamura. “It wasn’t so much that he was trying to tell me that it would overtake my chess career, and I’d make tons of money, but something where he felt there were a lot of fans that were untapped potential.” One of the last things Rensch said to Nakamura at that fateful dinner was, “The chess category on Twitch needs a Ninja.” Nakamura asked, “Who’s Ninja?” Rensch explained to him that Ninja was the face of the esport Fortnite, and what made him special was that he was also one of the best players in the world: “Chess needs a Ninja, and you can be him.” Nakamura chose to give it one more try. It was a decision that would prove life-changing for him and would impact the future of online chess. The Pandemic, Carlsen’s Tournaments, PogChamps In March 2020, Chess.com had 34 million members, up from 27 million members a year earlier. The site was growing by just over half a million monthly registrations. If we look at the whole period since May 2007, the growth was 20–50 percent yearly. But now, the numbers started to look a bit different for the biggest chess platform. As the global COVID-19 lockdowns started, everyone had to stay inside, people needed to work from home, and health workers worked overtime. It was a worldwide health and economic disaster and, frankly, a scary time. Certain companies, however, were on the lucky side of things. Amazon and Netflix come to mind, but Chess.com is also among them. Besides watching more streaming TV, people turned to the internet for distraction. Many decided to pick up chess. “You could track it by country,” said CEO Erik Allebest when talking to the New York Times in 2022. “India locked down, registrations from India went through the roof. Italy locked down, registrations went through the roof.” By the end of March 2020, Chess.com was looking at a projected growth for the next three months that wasn’t supposed to happen in the next ten years. The general consensus was that such a craze would never happen again, but we were wrong. It was only the first wave. In that single month of March 2020 the playing server crashed several times. In two weeks, the number of people playing games at the same time doubled from about 40,000 to 80,000. The live server developers regularly noticed spikes in server activity that led to instability, but soon managed to fix it. Over-the-board chess events were canceled worldwide due to the pandemic. The prestigious Candidates Tournament in Yekaterinburg, Russia, was halted halfway and would resume only a year later. Just about the only over-the-board chess you could witness occurred when the chess hustlers, now wearing facemasks, returned to J. Hood Wright Park in Washington Heights in Manhattan in April 2020—just as they did to Manhattan’s Washington Square Park, London’s Holland Park, or Paris’s Jardin du Luxembourg. No matter what disaster strikes the planet, people want to play chess. And that includes Magnus Carlsen. In that same month of April 2020, just into the first of the COVID-19 lockdowns, Carlsen took the initiative to create an online tournament with seven of his biggest rivals (and an impressive $250,000 prize fund) called the Magnus Carlsen Invitational. This event, the richest online chess tournament thus far that could be watched online on Chess24 (and on Norwegian television), would change top-level chess significantly. Its name-giver, Carlsen, commented: “Chess is unique in the sports world as the moves are the same whether played on a wooden board or a computer screen. This is a historic moment for chess, and given that it’s possible to continue top professional play in an online environment, we have not only the opportunity but the responsibility to players and fans around the world who need a distraction when no other live, competitive sport is being played.” Carlsen’s initiative was a great success. Fittingly, this first of many online top tournaments to come saw Carlsen clashing with and beating Hikaru Nakamura in the final as both played from their homes. As it ended, commentator/grandmaster Jan Gustafsson thanked the viewers for watching, before adding, “Not that you guys have any other choices. Let’s face it, there’s no other sports going on.” Carlsen was nothing less than a visionary here. Almost right after his event was over, a big online team event, the Online Nations Cup, was co-organized by Chess.com and FIDE. It was broadcast in 12 languages and exceeded the viewership of traditional tournaments. That is not even considering the numbers in China, where China Sport & Leisure TV and CCTV channels peaked at over 900,000 concurrent viewers during the tournament’s final between Team USA and Team China. As several more online tournaments followed, alongside Chess.com’s weekly Titled Tuesday events, the calendar was suddenly filling up nicely again for many of the world’s best players. Meanwhile, chess fans had something to enjoy while stuck at home. Things got even better when Carlsen announced bigger plans in May: the launch of the Magnus Carlsen Tour, consisting of four online super tournaments culminating in a Grand Final in August, for a $1 million prize fund. Mainstream media started to notice. “Chess Thrives Online Despite Pandemic,” headlined the New York Times, while the Wall Street Journal proclaimed, “Chess Is the New King of the Pandemic.” The newspaper noted that aside from playing chess, watching chess had become a much more popular pastime as well: “Aficionados tuned in just to watch—and not even play—more than ten million games in April, a jump of 97 percent from February.” Talking to Forbes, the American grandmaster and popular commentator Maurice Ashley explained how special this was when just about every other sport in the world was halted: “The good news for chess is at least chess can actually do it. Major sports can’t. LeBron (James) can’t play against Steph Curry, or the Lakers can’t play against the Bucks with everybody in their living room. In chess, the best of the best can play each other without missing a beat.” In the fall of 2020, Play Magnus announced a second string of tournaments for the new year. This time it was called the Champions Chess Tour, which ran from November to September for a $1.5 million prize fund and included ten tournaments. Carlsen himself won and would repeat that in 2022, when Chess.com held its own series, the Chess.com Global Championship, for a $1 million prize fund. The Filipino-American top grandmaster Wesley So won that one but lost to Carlsen in the 2023 Tour final. I spoke to So, then ranked tenth in the world, in September 2023 during a tournament in Amsterdam. He and his adoptive mother, Lotis Key, gave me a fascinating perspective on what the legacy of the pandemic meant for top players. “Before 2020, I used to play one tournament a month, and now it’s at least two,” said So. “The schedule is like a jigsaw puzzle,” added Key. The thing is: many lucrative online tournaments continue to be organized alongside the traditional over-the-board tournaments that resurfaced after the COVID restrictions were removed. And even some new physical events have appeared. Not only has the general interest in chess exploded, but so have the opportunities for top players to play in money tournaments. Looking at what So played in the full year of 2023, on- and offline, I counted 35 tournaments, meaning almost three tournaments a month. So told me his earnings compared to pre-pandemic had doubled toward roughly $700,000 a year, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s more now. One chess tournament that emerged during the pandemic wasn’t suitable for So—or his grandmaster colleagues—but stood out nonetheless: PogChamps. First held in June 2020, it was an event the chess world had never seen before. Having been trained by experts like Hikaru Nakamura, Daniel Naroditsky, and Alexandra Botez, 16 of Twitch’s most followed esports streamers competed for their share of $50,000 in prizes. Among the participants were Boxbox (Albert Sun Zheng, a League of Legends player), Nate Hill (a Fortnite player) and Yassuo (Mohammad Abdalrhman, also League of Legends). It was the first time that amateur players, often close to absolute beginners, were playing a tournament that Chess.com broadcast live on Twitch. This aspect of PogChamps also raised eyebrows: the level of play was a fair bit lower than what the average fan was used to when watching a chess broadcast. A schism was visible in the chess world. On one side, you had serious players who were quite critical of this new phenomenon. Having invested years or even decades into the game, educated with the knowledge of the great masters from the past—for whom the Lucena position or the Sveshnikov Sicilian was standard knowledge—these strong amateurs deemed the likes of PogChamps a superficial form of entertainment. Wasn’t our beautiful ancient game, with its numerous expressions of a deeper meaning in art, literature and science, being turned into fast food here? One chess journalist compared the event to the British reality TV series I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, which he described as “the emblematic format of trash TV,” and claimed that letting beginners play for an audience was “something one should never do.” The Russian top grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi was initially critical as well, tweeting that the show was “popcorn stuff” that was “replacing and displacing any real chess content”—a prospect he found “just terrifying.” Later, he toned it down by saying, “I’m obviously happy more and more people are getting involved [in] chess.” And, indeed, those serious chess fans didn’t need to watch it, did they? As long as PogChamps wasn’t replacing any of the traditional tournaments but added something for a new audience, what was wrong with it? Sure, but Chess.com was advertising the event as loudly as any serious tournament. All broadcasts were placed on the home page; chess fans couldn’t miss or avoid it, even if you wanted to. The naysayers saw it as a type of landscape pollution, arguing that it was similar to putting a modern, ugly concrete building next to a thirteenth-century temple. A Reddit member signaled another potential PogChamps issue: the prize money. This person wrote, “I’ve had some time to think about the Twitch chess boom and PogChamps tournament specifically. I think it’s bizarre that a handful of people, who are already well off in their own field, are making quite a bit of money playing chess in a tournament sponsored by the largest chess company in the world, making literally thousands and thousands of dollars to win games in five moves, while many chess professionals struggle to make a living.” Others welcomed this remarkable new event, arguing it was fun to watch. Besides, it did bring in a lot of new fans to the game of chess—fans who were watching these Twitch celebrities playing esports like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, or Hearthstone, and were truly enjoying that their heroes were now trying their luck in the royal game. After the first edition of PogChamps, Chess.com announced that 140,000 new chess fans started following their Twitch channel, which had a record 85,000 concurrent viewers at one point. It says a lot that even three years later, Chess.com’s most-watched video on YouTube, with over 18 million views, is “xQc Gets Check-mated by MoistCr1tikal in 6 Moves!” from that first PogChamps. (The channel’s second most-watched video, about a young Russian grandmaster beating Magnus Carlsen in an over-the-board tournament, has 7.8 million views.) David Llada, FIDE’s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at the time, was among the early fans of PogChamps, and said, “Is it silly? Yes! Are we making a show out of absolute beginners blundering pieces? Yes! So what?” Chess.com’s Vice President of Esports, Michael Brancato, told me, “The whole internet was talking about it because it was a novel, fun thing. Everyone plays chess, or knows about chess, but it was the first time that it had any kind of mainstream exposure. All the big people are playing, and they’re all bad at it, and it’s funny because everyone is bad at chess. It was a very relatable thing for a lot of people.” At the time of writing, PogChamps has been held five times. The second edition took place in the fall of 2020. In the third edition, held in early 2021 for an increased prize fund of $100,000, even bigger celebrities participated. YouTuber MrBeast, rapper Logic, actor Rainn Wilson, and poker player Daniel Negreanu helped attract over 375,000 concurrent viewers. PogChamps 4 was officially sponsored by cryptocurrency marketplace Coinbase, whose $100,000 prize pool was matched by an additional $100,000 from Chess.com for charity. PogChamps 5 was held in the summer of 2023 in partnership with Ludwig, a popular online content creator who had attracted more than 1.3 billion views to his channels. For the first time, the tournament ended with a live finals event in Los Angeles. It is worth noting that PogChamps has helped some amateur-level streamers to become quite decent chess players in a short time. In her 2022 book Chess Queens, Jennifer Shahade offered the example of PogChamps 2 winner Rumay Wang, known online as Hafu, a Hearthstone champion and streamer with over one million Twitch followers: “Hafu took the competition so seriously, she played hundreds of games and solved thousands of puzzles on an anonymous burner account. After her win she said, ‘I think if you added everyone’s practice it still would be less than what I played. It’s sickening.’ ” Especially impressive was Tyler1’s rapid progress after participating in PogChamps 5. The League of Legends streamer broke a 1500 rating in just three months. The Queen’s Gambit and the Three Waves When discussing chess’s big surge in popularity in 2020, we usually point to the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, while perhaps PogChamps deserves a place in the same sentence. What do the numbers say? Let’s look at two periods: before The Queen’s Gambit and after. On October 22, 2020, a day before The Queen’s Gambit was launched, Chess.com had 44 million members. Since March of that year, the figure had grown by 12 million in less than eight months, an average pace of about 1.3 million a month. This “pandemic growth” was almost three times as fast as before COVID. On March 23, 2021, when Beth Harmon had spent five months inspiring people to pick up a chess set, Chess.com boasted 61 million members, an increase of 17 million, or 3.4 million a month. This growth was more than six times faster than before the pandemic. By June 2021 the effect of The Queen’s Gambit was fading. While global lockdowns were lifted Chess.com continued to grow, adding roughly 1.7 million members per month until the end of the summer of 2022. If we view the first months of the pandemic as the first wave, The Queen’s Gambit was the second, leading to the biggest surge in chess popularity since Fischer–Spassky in 1972. By then we had seen the peak of the chess mania, right? Wrong. A completely unexpected third wave started in December 2022—a month that broke the previous record of January 2021 for new registrations. As 4.6 million new followers joined in that single month, the site broke the magic barrier of 100 million registered members, only 14 months after reaching 50 million. (Ten months later, in October 2023, the site would reach 150 million.) January and February 2023 smashed that single-month record, with 8.9 million new registrations for both. After that, things started slowing down again, but March (7.5 million) and April (5.7 million) were still higher than any month during the Queen’s Gambit period. “Honestly, the first two weeks, in late November 2022, I didn’t think it was legitimate traffic,” said Chess.com Systems Architect Igor Grinchenko. “I thought it was malicious; it had to be. Traffic went up 10 percent every day, and the same for incoming web requests, bandwidth, load on the server, and everything else. I said, ‘Guys, someone is attacking us.’ Because I know our flows, I know our ups and downs, off-peaks and on-peaks, and I can trace them. There is also seasonality and stuff. Then I started looking at deeper metrics that cannot be affected by malicious traffic—let’s say the number of games played, the number of users online. And then I realized: this is legitimate. And we have to do something about it.” At its peak, Chess.com was accommodating over ten million active users on a single day. That spiked on January 20, 2023, when traffic on Chess.com had nearly doubled since the beginning of December 2022. On February 3, a record 403,000 members joined in 24 hours, over 200,000 more than at the peak of The Queen’s Gambit. Over a billion games were played for the first time in a month. A stunning 42.4 million games were played on a single day on March 2, 2023 (including games against bots). Meanwhile, the Chess.com app briefly occupied #1 in many countries’ Top Free Games section of the iOS app store. The boom was not just happening online. In April 2023, the Washington Post ran a story headlined “Teachers Nationwide are Flummoxed By Students’ New Chess Obsession.” A month later, CBS Bay Area wrote that chess was “sweeping classrooms across the country.” It wasn’t limited to the US either: the Dutch newspaper Het Parool ran a similar story noting that children were suddenly playing chess fanatically in school cafeterias and that Amsterdam chess clubs were facing waiting lists for teenage members. The American entertainment website Polygon, which focuses on video games and popular culture, noted that the chess mania was happening suddenly: “Schools that don’t have chess clubs are rushing to start them. Teachers are confused but pleased to see a wholesome new hobby. Administrators are struggling with how chess is disrupting classrooms at times, and are blaming it for attention issues and drama in classrooms and hallways. Can you ban chess? Some schools have reportedly had to.” The sudden rise in popularity, particularly among teens, was reflected by Chess.com’s age metrics. The site experienced the biggest growth from players aged between 13 and 17 years old: 549,000 of them visited Chess.com in January and February 2023, more than twice as many as in the two months prior. The second-fastest-growing age group in the same period was 18-to-24-year-olds. Chess was booming, and the Chess.com servers were struggling. More often than not, members were getting served a disappointing 503 error when visiting the site: database overload. “It’s hard to explain how painful it was for me as CEO,” Allebest said. “One of our developers would always talk about underwater stones, meaning you can’t see the problems until it’s too late.… There was a moment when somebody crashed our server because they pasted the entire script of the Bee Movie in the chat window of a game. When it came into the server and was sent back to everybody watching this particular game, it crashed the whole site because of too much data. We didn’t think someone was going to paste in that much text. You know, things like that, over and over and over again.” Chess.com purchased $2 million of new hardware—web servers, database servers, a new live chess server, load balancers, and additional service machines. After a few weeks of setting up, separating database tables, sharding databases (a way to spread the load), and other ways of optimizing, things were under control again. A graph of Chess.com’s membership growth between September 2016 and December 2023 clearly shows the three waves of popularity. The first two waves of popularity in 2020 were easy to explain: the pandemic (with PogChamps) and The Queen’s Gambit. But where did that third, and by far biggest wave, come from? Well, in this case, it was a combination of multiple individual events happening in a short period that all helped boost the popularity of chess to stratospheric heights. Some happened in late 2022 and have already been mentioned in this book, such as the Carlsen–Niemann affair, the Instagram picture with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and the Chessboxing event. And then, in January 2023, a furry, meowing phenomenon contributed even more. When Chess.com launched, on May 18, 2007, the only possibility to play chess on the site had been against the computer. Many years later, that remains one of the most popular activities for its members, partly because of some added fun elements. After Chess.com acquired one of the world’s strongest chess engines, Komodo, in May 2018, the company started using it to create computer “characters” to play against. Among those fun bots you could challenge were the “holiday bots” (Santa, Holly, Dash, Eve, and Powder), the “zombie bots” (Zombaru, Zombiachtchi, Zombiano, and Zombanny), and the “fake billionaire bots” (Gill Bates, Melon Husk, Zark Muckerberg, Biff Jezos, and Barron Wuffet). On January 1, 2023, new bots were introduced, and one of them instantly became the biggest star in chess (well, for a few weeks at least). That was Mittens, the strongest among five cat bots—the others were Scaredy Cat, Angry Cat, Mr. Grumpers, and Catspurrov. Right from the start, Mittens—an avatar of a big-eyed, kind of sad-looking kitten boasting a silly rating of just one point—took all the attention, as streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Levy Rozman, and the Botez sisters started playing against it. Mittens’s viral fame didn’t just come from its prowess on the chessboard, where it revealed itself as a ruthless killer, but also from the nasty, sadistic comments it provided during games: “I am become Mittens, the destroyer of kings. I exist at this chess board through all times and realities … hehehe. Meow.” According to a story in the Independent, Chess.com users described Mittens as a “chess nightmare,” “a psycho,” and a “terrible, terrible cat.” Chess.com’s famed catbot Mittens, a cuddly pet turned ruthless killer on the chessboard. It was Will Whalen, a student at Hamilton College (majoring in world politics) and a part-time contributor to Chess.com’s social media team, who came up with the idea. In an interview in April 2023 he said, “Mittens was originally a pitched joke that ended up getting very out of hand.” Whalen noted that his colleague Sean Becker, who was leading the bots project, wrote Mittens’s interactions with help from other content team members. They ensured that the cat would always start very calm and cuddly but then would “devolve into madness,” even quoting Nietzsche. Not your everyday cat-on-the-internet experience. The Rise of the Streamers The decade between 2004 and 2014 saw many battles in the technology industry. There was the social media arms race with MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, but also the vertical distribution arms race: who would win the live streaming battle? While YouTube initially remained limited to video on demand, several live-streaming video websites started popping up: Ustream (acquired by IBM in 2016), Livestream.com (acquired by Vimeo in 2017), and Justin.tv, all launched in 2007. The latter won the battle with its spin-off Twitch, which started in 2011 and was dedicated to gaming. These were the years when the video gaming industry started to blow up with games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Dota. In August 2014, when Twitch had gathered over 50 million users, it was acquired by Amazon for $970 million. Around 2013, Rensch got in touch with Twitch’s Director of Creator Development at the time, Markus “djWHEAT” Graham, who had a long history of providing commentary at video game tournaments since the late 1990s. More importantly, Graham saw the potential for chess. Previously, Chess.com had been using Livestream.com, but Twitch had an altogether different vibe. “Rather than just viewing these broadcasting tools as an opportunity to serve the community, we actually could grow the community because we were reaching the gaming audience, which was a larger community than ours,” said Rensch. Rensch himself had had plenty of experience as a streamer before chess streaming became a thing. One of the first examples of something resembling chess streaming occurred when Rensch created his first weekly “Bullet Brawl” video in 2012, which consisted of a chessboard, the Chess.com logo, and Rensch’s voice. It was a concept that originated from Chess.com’s “Live Sessions” that had existed for three years, but this time, it was all about fun. As Rensch was playing bullet, he provided humorous commentary. In that first video, he noted, “The whole idea of a Bullet Brawl Thursday is we’re going to play two to three bullet games and focus more on the excitement of the game than on the analysis afterward and whether it was a perfect thing. The perfection of it is that it’s flawed.” The idea of making jokes and talking crap while playing a game of chess was born. “What Hikaru and Levy and the others are doing right now is basically Bullet Brawls,” said Rensch. “Despite the name, the Live Sessions were actually pre-recorded. Bullet Brawls was the first time we did it for a live audience, with chat running. And, for me, this was probably the first product on the perfect intersection of what chess was always missing. Over-the-board chess was always going to be a quiet, serious game. You can’t talk; it would distract your opponent. But online streaming, with your own conscious thoughts, was born for this, changing the way people perceived chess. It was like, ‘Oh, I’m inside the head of a titled player!’ ” Around the same time, the first chess-focused channels appeared on Twitch: Gerard Bailleau’s ChessNetwork, Tryfon Gavriel’s Kingscrusher, and, most prominently, Chessbrah, the account run by the Canadian players Eric Hansen (the grandmaster we met in Chapter 7 who first discussed the anal beads theory during a stream) and master Aman Hambleton, who would become a grandmaster a few years later. Both were born in 1992. The Chessbrahs were, and still are, a group of friends living in the same house in Toronto, Canada, who basically just love to hang out and play chess online—something they managed to turn into a business before anyone else. In the spring of 2024, Chessbrah had 325,000 followers on Twitch, 332,000 subscribers on YouTube, and another 9,470 followers on Kick, a Twitch rival platform that launched in 2022 and where the Chessbrahs started an account in June 2023. They had several part-time editors and one full-time operations manager running the merch store and channels. “I started streaming because [I] just wanted to show my screen to friends,” Hansen told me. “There wasn’t share screen back then on MSN Messenger, and Skype was a bit annoying and too formal anyway.” He and his friends were already playing a lot of blitz and bullet chess on different chess platforms, and streaming made it easier to follow and chat with each other. “It was just a community feel, to stay in touch.” Like many of the streaming video pioneers, Hansen started somewhere in 2010 on Livestream.com before moving to Justin.tv and then Twitch. “There wasn’t yet a chess community there, but I created an account because I was into video computer games, and this way, I could watch Starcraft, Age of Vampires, the strategy games, the shooter games. But sometimes we would stream our-selves, playing casual chess and just chatting.” In the fall of 2014, Hansen decided to take streaming more seriously. He bought a desktop computer and two screens, creating a proper setup. He took up the name “Chessbrah,” which he was already using as an online alias, and started streaming in 2015. He was averaging 300 viewers six months later. He streamed over eight hours daily, 60 to 70 hours weekly. “I was really grinding,” he said. “I already played so much bullet and blitz, I was basically addicted. But I was good at it too. So I thought, ‘Why not share that perspective?’ ” Chapter 8 showed that chess addiction is a thing, particularly for online chess. It’s interesting to note that, in the modern era, Hansen and others have shown that streaming can be an outlet, a way of dealing with it, and even a way to monetize it: you can turn your love for chess into a business. Making money from streaming chess would become even easier thanks to cooperation between Twitch and Chess.com a few years later. Chess.com was providing fun live sessions and, on top of that, there were broadcasts of over-the-board events (which I co-produced), Titled Tuesdays, Death Matches, and other events with a growing audience. And then, in 2016, the site organized its biggest event to date: the GM Blitz Battle Championship, a knockout event with only world-class grandmasters. It resulted in a much-anticipated final between Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, won by Carlsen. With a peak concurrent viewership of 36,000, Chess.com’s show was the third most-watched Twitch broadcast that year, behind Hearthstone and Call of Duty, but ahead of all the other major esports. “I always joke that that’s the event where Danny took chess out of the closet,” said Rensch. “Chess came out of the closet on that event because I commented and produced that show by myself from a closet we had made in our studio in Payson, Arizona.” Chess.com launched the PRO Chess League in January 2017, a global team championship with all the games played on the site and live broadcasts on twitch.tv/chess. It was an excellent kickstarter for the new Twitch channel, as some of the best grand-masters were playing, including Nakamura and Carlsen. The Twitch leadership took notice and started new talks with Chess.com. Rensch: “I spoke with Nick Allen, their VP of Esports, who reported directly to Mike Aragon, the Chief Content Officer, who reported to Emmett Shear, the CEO. They were all, like: ‘You guys are crushing it!’ ” Everyone was on the same page: chess had massive potential while hardly anyone was making content typical of Twitch—live, more spontaneous, and less serious. The overwhelming majority of chess video content was either pre-recorded educational material or live broadcasts of top events with commentators targeting club-level players. There was no real chess ecosystem for streaming fun stuff at the time. And so, in November 2017, Chess.com closed a two-year deal with Twitch, which would provide the site a monthly fee intended for orchestrating and fostering the growing chess community. Twitch was now a sponsor for Chess.com’s entire lineup of chess events and was going to help grow the global brand of chess as an online spectator sport. The Chess.com–Twitch arrangement fared better than anyone’s wildest expectations. “Chess has seen some of the most substantial growth in the same period of time than any other esport in the world,” Twitch’s VP of Global Esports, Justin Dellario, told NBC News in February 2020. The Chessbrah channel was one of the earliest to join Chess.com’s Partner Streamers Program, and they did the early heavy lifting for Twitch’s chess category. “They were the backbone, the ones that carried chess through back then,” said Rensch. Soon, streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Alexandra Botez, and Levy Rozman followed the Chessbrahs, among many others. The program’s benefits included accelerated partnership status to streamers and being embedded on Chess.com’s integrated broadcast page www.chess.com/tv for more exposure. The only thing the streamers needed to do was play on Chess.com and not elsewhere, and have Chess.com’s green pawn visible somewhere in the video. “I gotta say, Danny was really good at picking people,” said Chess.com’s esports expert Michael Brancato. “He pretty much knew about Alexandra and Hikaru and encouraged them to stream.” At the time, Chess.com was paying these streamers, and Rensch told them: “We think you can make this much money in the future, so keep up with this.” As noted, during the early days of the pandemic, streaming became an alternative way for chess professionals to earn money as the demand for chess content suddenly increased. Between March and August of 2020, fans watched 41.2 million hours of chess on Twitch, four times as many hours as in the previous six months, according to the analytics website SullyGnome. Even a top grandmaster like Peter Svidler, stuck in his home in St. Petersburg, started broadcasting his chess on Twitch. “Streaming during the pandemic was what kept me sane,” he told me. “I would do three or four streams a week, not very long. But it was just self-care. I earned some money over 2021, which would pay for utility bills, which is good, but I wasn’t doing it for the money. I was doing it because, like many other people, I was going a bit crazy. It was incredibly therapeutic in my case. And I’ve spoken to many people who said exactly the same.” Once Twitch got hacked in October 2021, it also became public knowledge that the biggest chess streamers were making decent money, when details of creator payouts were posted on Reddit. It was suddenly out in the open that, from August 2019 until October 2021, Nakamura earned $773,831.12, the Chessbrahs $767,384.56, Levy Rozman $424,505.01, and the Botez sisters $416,813.43. These earnings did not include revenue from merch, sponsorships, or other channels such as YouTube. “Large creators are incredibly well compensated,” Chess.com’s Influencer Relations Manager Christopher Schroth told me in late 2023. “It’s not uncommon to hear creators earning beyond five, six figures a month, if not more.” Right from the start, in early 2017, Brancato and Rensch worked closely together and created a lot of new events and broadcasts. Aside from the PRO Chess League, there was the Speed Chess Championship (the successor of the Blitz Battle Championship), the Junior Speed Chess Championship for young talents, the Women’s Speed Chess Championship, Arena Kings, and more. On top of that, many new chess streamers started to create channels on Twitch, but something was still missing. What this young community of chess streamers needed was somebody carrying the torch. That person became Hikaru Nakamura. From Top GM to the Ninja of Chess—and Back Again Hikaru Nakamura was born in 1987 in Japan to an American mother and a Japanese father. The family moved to White Plains, New York, when he was two. A year later, his parents divorced. He started playing chess at the age of seven and, with his brother, was coached by his Sri Lankan stepfather, FIDE Master and chess author Sunil Weeramantry. Nakamura was a true chess prodigy. In 2003, at the age of 15 years and 79 days, he became the youngest American to earn the grandmaster title, three months sooner than Bobby Fischer had. He has won the US championship five times, taken first prize at the prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Grand Chess Tour, and won an Olympic gold medal. All this was before he decided to take up streaming on that October evening in 2018 in a fish restaurant on the Isle of Man. “It is very important to note that my result in that tournament in the Isle of Man also played a massive role in terms of me starting to stream,” Nakamura told me. “I was actually doing quite well, but then, in the eighth round, I lost this very heartbreaking game. I was not really in a great frame of mind, I was going from tournament to tournament, and I felt a little bit aimless—I think, in large part, because I lost that game. That was one of the biggest things that spurred me to start trying out streaming.” This time around, it was the perfect moment. Only a few weeks later, the world championship between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana took place in London, and Nakamura’s coverage attracted thousands of viewers daily. During that match, Chess.com launched its popular new product Puzzle Rush, and Nakamura embraced it. “He became obsessed with it. He was breaking records, and before you knew it, chess on Twitch would never be the same,” said Rensch. The following year, 2019, was the first that Nakamura became more of a streamer than a chess player, and it was not an easy year. “I do have to give myself a lot of credit because there are many people who were very pessimistic about it,” he told me. His results at the board got worse, and there were a lot of naysayers. Some of my own friends couldn’t understand why, as they put it, he “wasn’t trying to become world champion any more.” Responding to his critics, Nakamura said, “They just thought it was fairly stupid to be doing this streaming in the first place, and because of that, I kept sticking with it.” After bad results at tournaments in India and Germany, he took a five-month break from playing chess, something he hadn’t done for at least a decade. The plan was to take it up again with the US championship in April 2020, but he never reached that point because of the pandemic. Hikaru Nakamura in a recording studio in St. Louis, August 2021. In the buildup to the first PogChamps, Nakamura did a few streams with the Canadian streamer xQc (real name: Félix Lengyel). The former professional Overwatch player is one of several esports streamers who like chess, and the broadcasts where Nakamura taught him the basics were extremely popular. “I think that was the first time I crossed 10,000 viewers on a live stream,” said Nakamura. “That was sort of the moment I realized it was actually a very big deal, that it was something very serious and in a different kind of way.” Then PogChamps happened. Nakamura was one of the commentators, and his viewership increased even more. At some point, he streamed for 70 days in a row, essentially without a break, grinding like the Chessbrahs. In August of 2020 his channel surpassed the 500,000-follower mark. By that point, he was by far the biggest chess streamer. At the end of that month, he signed with TSM, making him the first professional chess player to sign with an esports organization. (He would represent TSM until June 2022, when he signed with Misfits Gaming.) “You just ride that wave,” he told me. “And afterward I kind of realized that I was quite good at it.” I guessed that it had something to do with his ICC past, and Nakamura agreed: “There were many times when I would actually kibitz with people—not the other player, but with the people who were watching the games while I was playing—and that was something that nobody at the time was doing. In fact, I think even now, nobody does that. When I look back, I think that played a very pivotal role in terms of where I am today. It’s a little bit different, obviously, communicating your thoughts verbally versus in written form, but, for me, I think that having that whole process where I was communicating in some form during the games was like destiny—that I ended up doing what I’m doing now.” Streaming chess does indeed seem to be the perfect way of communicating for Nakamura, who doesn’t always come across as a great communicator away from the computer. The American top grandmaster is generally considered a brilliant player who also has his share of haters. Starting from his early days on the ICC, where he was super-strong at an early age, many disliked him for being caustic, as he sometimes left derogatory comments after suffering occasional losses. Nakamura admitted this to me, saying it was his way of finding motivation: “Back then, I hated losing. Not that I don’t still hate losing, but I did not accept losing. I always felt my loss was a horrible thing. So, you know, I would get very angry over losing games online. And, in some cases, I would actually get mad at opponents and things like that. And so, for me, the motivation was, like, getting really angry, using sort of the unhappiness, the anger, all those different things. And so I didn’t necessarily have a lot of fans wanting to talk to me the same way; in fact, a lot of people disliked me back then.” It is remarkable that such a fantastic chess player turned out to be a natural behind the screen and the microphone as well. Brandon Benton, a physics researcher at Cornell University, put it as follows when speaking to the New York Times in September 2020: “He draws people because he’s so good, but also, there are other top players on Twitch that are not as engaging as he is, not as funny, not as in tune with the sort of Twitch culture.” Brenton called Nakamura a “down-to-earth memer and jokester.” Not many—certainly not the naysayers—expected what happened next with Nakamura’s over-the-board career, in 2019. While he was on his way to becoming the best-paid grandmaster in the world through Twitch, easily surpassing Carlsen’s career earnings, Nakamura also started to play some of his best chess in years. Through the FIDE Grand Prix, he qualified for the 2022 Candidates Tournament, and then he won the 2022 Fischer Random World Championship. In 2023 he came first at the super-strong Norway Chess tournament (climbing back to second place in the world rankings), and thanks to another excellent second place in the FIDE Grand Swiss in October, he qualified for the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, his second in a row. It was a growing list of impressive achievements for any chess player—but an out-of-this-world performance for a streamer. How did he do that? “There’s a couple of reasons,” he told me. “First of all, the financial strain of playing chess professionally. You’re always thinking about supporting people: your family and your partner. And I think that definitely played a huge role in terms of my performance. There were many situations where I would just make quick boring draws rather than try to fight. Rather than trying to win, rather than trying to enjoy the game. Now, I don’t have the financial worries or concerns, which plays a huge role.” Not unimportant was that, since October 2020, Nakamura had been with the Iranian American chess player Atousa Pourkashiyan, and in the summer of 2023 they got married: “It’s also about having the right people in your life. I’m very fortunate that I have someone who is extremely supportive, who’s nothing but positive and very helpful.” In October 2022, while talking to The Guardian, the experienced chess commentator and English grandmaster Daniel King explained Nakamura’s success: “Nakamura was noted for being fantastically strong at bullet chess long before it was sort of hip to play online, and he has turned into the perfect chess streamer, making millions. He’s gobby. He’s opinionated. He doesn’t care about upsetting people. He’s basically just hacked an online algorithm that means you’re going to be successful.” By early 2024 Nakamura had 1.9 million followers on Twitch. Since March of that year, his main channel has been on Kick. He has 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube and 551,000 followers on X. All the “GMHikaru” channels combined are run by a team of six or seven people. Nakamura told me that he is making about four to five times as much money as when he was still a professional chess player. In 2020 and 2021 alone he earned more than during his entire playing career. It’s an incredible story. That player who once slept on my couch and started playing on the ICC right after waking up is indeed nothing less than the Ninja of chess. The Biggest Chess YouTuber of All Born in 1995 in Brooklyn, New York, Levy Rozman is eight years younger than Nakamura. He was among the earliest Twitch streamers, and even helped Nakamura in the early days, providing commentary on the GMHikaru channel when Nakamura was playing an over-the-board tournament. Rozman, however, is most famous for running the biggest chess channel on YouTube. He started playing chess when he was six years old. “I was a very hyper child, and my parents needed to put me in after-school, like, after 3 p.m.,” Rozman told me. “They wanted to put me into art class or chess, but chess was $5 more expensive than art, and my dad said, ‘He is too hyper for chess; he’s gonna get kicked out of chess class.’ But it turned out I really liked chess, for some reason, and I stuck to it like a magnet. I never went to art class because I wasn’t very good, and I found chess so fascinating, and I became obsessed with it.” Rozman started as a scholastic chess coach in 2014 and earned the international master title in 2018. He completed a bachelor’s degree in statistics and quantitative modeling in 2017 at New York’s Baruch College. After that, “It was going to be something corporate, consulting, investment banking, actuary, or data science,” he said. “I was going to a lot of networking events on college campuses to meet people. And I was trying to talk to the parents of my chess students, who worked at Barclays Bank, Deloitte, to try to get interviews, because referrals are really powerful. But none of it ever worked.” Rozman’s story is slightly different from other streamers because he soon began focusing on YouTube after starting on Twitch. He created his channel on August 7, 2018, and, being a New Yorker, he called it GothamChess. It was only on April 19, 2020, about a month and a half into the pandemic, that he uploaded his first video. Duly named “GothamChess 1st Video,” he showed and explained a beautiful three-minute blitz game between the American grandmasters Daniel Naroditsky and Hikaru Nakamura. In this video, you could already see Rozman’s inspiring presentational style and his talent for explaining chess to lower-level players. Levy Rozman, a.k.a. GothamChess, the biggest chess YouTuber—with over five million subscribers. In hindsight, the choice of YouTube was a smart move. “After The Queen’s Gambit came out in late 2020, everything started to change, and YouTube started to become more important than Twitch,” Nakamura explained. “The Twitch boom was when all the chess content creators laid the foundation, but, thanks to The Queen’s Gambit, you had all these people that were naturally driven to chess; they go on the internet and search for content, and it’s much more natural for them to go to YouTube.” Right from the get-go, Rozman started creating YouTube tutorials. He made two videos a day for about six months. And then, when The Queen’s Gambit came out—or rather, in the weeks before—he noticed something interesting: his video about the chess opening called the Queen’s Gambit suddenly surged to 700,000 views. He realized this was because YouTube would serve viewers with this video in the sidebar after they’d watched a trailer for the Netflix show. If anyone talks about “cracking the algorithm,” it’s this kind of thing. Rozman started to understand how YouTube works. From then on, he chose his topics based on what he knew the chess fans were looking for: videos about the most famous players, the most-searched openings, and bots. This new strategy worked, and on June 1, 2021, he broke the magical barrier of a million subscribers to his YouTube channel. GothamChess is one of the streamers originally convinced by Danny Rensch to take streaming seriously. Also, at the start of what I have called “the third wave,” it was Rensch who inspired Rozman during a phone call in the fall of 2022. Rensch was at an anniversary dinner with his wife but picked up the phone anyway, telling her, “I think I’m talking with one of the future stars of chess.” Rozman told me about this moment: “ ‘We need to talk about a really serious topic,’ Danny said, and I was, like, ‘Oh, shit! What did I say? What joke did I make? Did I mention Lichess somewhere?’ And he said, ‘I don’t mean to overstep, but I think you’re making a huge mistake. You’re not focusing enough on short-form content.’ I said, ‘But there’s no money, why would I? It’s so stupid.’ And then I did it, and it’s unbelievable.” Rozman started creating lots of short-form video content where he covered trending topics, funny moments from the chess world, or showed quick ways to checkmate your opponent. “He turns it into something incredibly entertaining in 60 or 30 seconds or less,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “It’s highly repeatable, highly watchable.” On December 24, 2022, Rozman broke two million subscribers on YouTube, and the third wave pushed him to three million just 59 days later, on February 20, 2023. He got 25–30 percent of his lifetime views in that period. On November 21, 2023, Rozman tweeted: “One year ago, I uploaded my first-ever short-form video content. Since then: Tiktok: 616 million views; IG Reels: 293 million views; YT Shorts: 878 million views; total: 1.787 BILLION views. And, most importantly: these users stick around to watch longer videos and feel more connected to chess in some way.” Since the start of the pandemic, Rozman hardly had a day when he didn’t create a video. If Hans Niemann says or does something, he will make a piece of content about it. If Magnus wins a nice game, he will make some content about it. “It’s like routine,” he said. “It’s one of the only routines I think I’ve successfully been able to implement. You know, everybody wants to sleep better, eat better, go to the gym—and we all stop. Even when I’m on vacation, I take my microphone and my webcam, and in the hotel room I make a video, and then I go enjoy my day.” Apart from his persistence, his intelligent use of YouTube and the short-form content, what was it that made Levy by far the biggest chess YouTuber? “I use humor and am good at explaining things,” he told the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant in January 2023. Half a year later, he elaborated to the site Tubefilter: “Maybe I’m funny. Maybe there’s jokes intertwined. Maybe I explain concepts better, I don’t know. I’ve always been good at talking about chess to an audience that would want to listen because I had to teach kids. It’s very tough. As a 19-year-old, when I started teaching chess, I was put in front of a group of five-year-olds, and I could just do it. That’s like a nightmare. But I was able to do it, so I don’t know.” Chess.com’s Michael Brancato explained Levy’s success to me: “I think it’s his genuine excitement for what’s going on. ‘And he sacrifices … the roooook!’ Stuff like that. People resonate with that energy, and he makes it seem really epic and cool. And he comes off as a very relaxed guy; very energetic but a very approachable guy. He’s easy to understand, he seems cool, but he’s also very good at chess and at explaining advanced concepts.” “I would call him an innovator,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “In the same way that the Chessbrahs paved the way for becoming successful on Twitch, Levy did a lot of innovating on the YouTube side.” Aside from the educational content, Schroth pointed out that, like no one else, Rozman has been successful with content related to playing bots, like Mittens, on Chess.com: “I’m screaming to the heavens every day to our creators about how many people play our bots and why they need to be making videos about them.” Rozman is a perfect example of why: five of his six most-watched videos, all with more than five million views, are about playing bots. In June 2024, the GothamChess channel had 5 million subscribers and had broken two billion total views, more than any other chess-focused channel on YouTube. Meanwhile, Rozman had published his first book in October 2023 titled How to Win at Chess, which he described as “a road map from beginner to intermediate.” The book, a New York Times bestseller, is directly linked to his YouTube work through QR codes at the end of chapters, for extra practice. In November 2023, he was included in the Games category of the Forbes Under-30 list as “the internet’s unofficial chess teacher.” The title of his next book could well be How to Win on YouTube. The Holy Grail These days there are hundreds of streamers making daily chess content in dozens of languages. After Rozman and Nakamura, the biggest English-speaking chess channel is BotezLive—Alexandra and Andrea Botez—with 1.3 million followers on Twitch and 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2022 their channel won Best Chess Streamer at the Streamer Awards. The Botez sisters—Alexandra, center, and Andrea, right—in November 2023 at the Saint Louis Chess Club. As the first female streamers who became successful, the Botez sisters have paved the way for other women to make a living through chess. Anna Cramling, Dina Belenkaya, Tallulah Roberts, Alessia Santeramo, Qiyu “Nemo” Zhou, Anna Rudolf, and Anna-Maja Kazarian are among the many female streamers who have demonstrated that the world of chess streaming isn’t as male dominated as the traditional chess world. In fact, sometimes these two worlds become “merged.” Cramling, the Botez sisters, Belenkaya, and Kazarian have sometimes taken a camera with them to play over-the-board tournaments. In cooperation with the organizers, live footage of them at the board has then been live-streamed to their Twitch channels, sometimes accompanied with commentary by a friend. Chess and online streaming cannot be discussed without mentioning Antonio Radić, the Croatian amateur chess player behind the YouTube channel Agadmator. Radić’s was the first chess channel to break one million subscribers, on February 7, 2021. Levy Rozman, who would achieve the same four months later, tweeted: “Congrats, man. Pioneer of the YouTube game and inspiration to a lot of chess players and creators.” Radić makes one video daily in which he shares his knowledge and ideas about chess history and games played in today’s tournaments. It is his positivity that shines through and makes people come back. “There are those who say my daily videos light up their day; some watch it while enjoying a meal, and some fall asleep to it and tell me that I have an incredibly soothing voice,” he told ESPN in August 2020. “There are others who write in to tell me that my videos help them cope with depression, or to let me know that their children are watching chess now instead of Fortnite. Nothing makes me happier.” Meanwhile, the current chess boom in India has been reflected in big success on YouTube as well. The stand-up comedian Samay Raina, and the married couple Sagar Shah and Amruta Mokal, who run the ChessBase India channel, have played an important role in the online video revolution. They have been tirelessly covering the careers of multiple prodigies of a single generation: the siblings Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali Rameshbabu, Arjun Erigaisi, Vidit Gujrathi, Nihal Sarin and, last but not least, Dommaraju Gukesh. The 2024 Candidates winner will play for the world title against Ding Liren shortly after this book comes out. After Rozman surpassed Agadmator, ten more channels broke a million subscribers on YouTube: GMHikaru, ReyEnigma, Chess Talk, Chesscom, BotezLive, ChessBase India, Alencuatro, Samay Raina, Magnus Carlsen, and Anna Cramling. “I felt that I had something to do with chess being popular in the world, and it makes me very happy,” Radić told me. “It’s something that I can always look back on, and it will still make me happy that I was, you know, even a little part of that.” There’s another major reason, though, for the success of the chess streamers: Magnus Carlsen. Even though he is not the world champion any more, the Norwegian is still the number-one ranked player and continues to be the biggest star in chess, and the streamers (and the YouTube algorithm!) know it. A disproportionate amount of videos are about Carlsen, have thumbnails with Carlsen, and scream titles that include Carlsen. When tweeting about something else in October 2023, Carlsen casually noted that Nakamura was “constantly using my name for clicks.” Although Carlsen has been a national celebrity since 2004, when he held Kasparov to a draw in Reykjavík, his father Henrik told me that it is only since the streaming revolution that Carlsen can no longer walk in peace on the streets in Norway. And even though he knows there’s no use in complaining about others making money with his name, Carlsen does have a point when he expresses a slight annoyance. It is similar to the question of whether there can be copyright on chess games, which has been a topic of discussion for over a hundred years. As early as the nineteenth century, top players like Wilhelm Steinitz and Emanuel Lasker complained that others were making money from publishing books that contained their games. When I started filming top players analyzing their games in tournament press rooms in 2007, I also benefited from the performance of others. It is how our society works, but it sometimes feels unfair. It is a big part of the chess revolution that chess is not just something you do any more, but also something you can watch, even if you’re not that good at it yourself. For me, as a chess journalist and early contributor to live broadcasts of chess tournaments in the years 2014–19, it was always the holy grail: how to create a chess show online or on TV that can be enjoyed by people who only know the basic rules of the game? Isn’t chess too complicated to ever be successful? As a player, the true beauty in chess only started to reveal itself after a few years of playing, when I had learned all the basic tactics, concepts and famous players from chess history and their brilliant games. How could you deliver that beauty, that immense culture that belongs to the game, to beginners who are unfamiliar with terms like “Carlsbad Structure” or even something as basic as the en passant rule? Speaking to grandmaster and veteran chess commentator Daniel King gave me the insight that this holy grail wasn’t always out of reach. Even before the internet, a chess broadcast could be successful if it incorporated two important aspects: the players’ personalities and enjoyable commentary set at a low level so that the average TV viewer could follow it with a bit of effort. In 1993 in the UK, Channel 4 television ran an extensive broadcast of the PCA World Chess Championship in London between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. There was an hour-long program at the start of the game, another half-hour broadcast around move 40, followed by a half-hour roundup after the game. King was one of the commentators, alongside grandmasters Jon Speelman and Raymond Keene and the three-time British women’s champion Cathy Forbes. The show’s host was Carol Vorderman, who didn’t know much about chess—and that was perfect. King told me that when he was interviewed for the commentary job, the Channel 4 people wanted to know how he would cover chess. “Look, I want to be a journalist here,” he told them. “If there’s a Wimbledon final, I want to know how the players got there. I want to know about their personalities. I want to know about their style of play. You might not understand exactly what’s going on in a game of chess, but I can tell you about the emotion, and I can tell you about the person playing.” As soon as King told them that, the producers were happy. You could treat chess like any other sport. King had a great talent for providing exciting commentary while keeping the target audience in mind. “We took it from the absolute basics, and if we sometimes delved into something a bit too sophisticated, then Vorderman would say, ‘Hang on! You’ve got to explain that.’ So it was a very natural kind of relationship.” King noted that the longer the match went on (it lasted 20 games, running from September 7 to October 21), the commentary could up their level as the British TV audience started to grasp more and more of the chess concepts—along with Vorderman. She would start saying things like: “I recognize that now; we’ve had this kind of thing before.” Or, “Oh yeah, they castle. They’re always castling, aren’t they?” That 1993 show was a massive success. King continued to provide commentary for both TV and the internet, where his own YouTube channel is called PowerPlayChess. He enjoys the interactive aspect of online broadcasts these days because of the existence of chat: “This provides an extra layer so that you can spark off people. I think this is a fantastic improvement.” Yet still, it seems that what he did back in 1993 had the biggest impact: “I still get people today saying, ‘Oh, yeah, I started chess when I saw you on Channel 4.’ I mean, all the time.” In a way, the streaming revolution is a return to those early days of commentary. The streamers are once again showing that it’s possible to explain concepts entertainingly to newcomers and that it’s possible to have fun chess streams. Watching chess can be fun! This was also reflected in the 2023 end-of-year report of streamcharts.com, which had Chess.com’s channel as the most-viewed English-language Twitch channel (and fifth channel overall) with 11.18 million hours watched. At the same time, the streamers are showing that chess is for everyone. In that sense, it’s not much different from Alfonso X’s Libro de los juegos from the thirteenth century, which included images of nobility and vagrants, young and old, men and women, and Christian, Muslim, and Jewish characters playing chess. The new phenomenon of chess streaming might not be to everyone’s taste, but it stands in a long tradition of democratizing the game and making it more popular across the planet. As it stands, the history is long, and the future is bright for the 1,500-year-old, evergreen board game that continues to reinvent itself while remaining the same. It might well be that the chess revolution has only just started.",

      "title": "Epilogue",
      "content": "Epilogue It has often been claimed that there are 600 million chess players worldwide. I’ve seen the number quoted by world-famous institutions such as the New York Times, CNN, the BBC, and even the United Nations. But where does that number come from and what does it mean? In 2012, a chess events company called Agon undertook some market research in conjunction with the authoritative British polling organization YouGov. The results from polls in the UK, US, Russia, and India, where respondents claimed that they had played chess at least once in the previous week, month, or year, were then extrapolated for the global population, ignoring that the samples were hardly representative of the populations of other counties. Agon triumphantly sent out a press release claiming 605 million chess players globally. When a writer for the Streatham & Brixton Chess Blog asked YouGov about it, their reply was: “I am afraid that we do not have any further information about this and about how that figure was arrived at. The client wasn’t very good at sending through press releases for us to check before they were released into the public domain.” The 600 million figure seemed rather questionable but, 12 years later, I feel it might actually be setting the bar a bit low. In his 2017 book Hit Makers, Derek Thompson explores why certain songs, products, or internet memes become popular and others don’t. One key idea he put forward is that people are drawn to objects that are both new and familiar. For instance, the Star Wars movies became a hit because they followed a classical theme (a hero’s journey) from a known genre (e.g., Westerns) in a different setting (in space). Something similar could be the reason for the chess revolution we experienced in the early 2020s. The ancient chess game is familiar and well respected, but can now be enjoyed in different ways. You can play against anyone anywhere on your phone or watch your favorite chess event or streamer. Enjoying chess is no longer limited to those who have invested hundreds or thousands of hours to learn about all its intricacies. Especially among teenagers, there has been a perception change, where watching and playing chess is considered fun. Chess.com and content creators have played a large role in this. At the same time, I’d like to believe that a major reason behind its recent peak in popularity is chess itself. With its perfect balance between simplicity and complexity, it has demonstrated its power for 1,500 years, so why not in the modern era? As chess is such an evergreen game, all generations have always played it—even against each other. In September 2023 at the Moratalaz Open in Madrid, Spain, 101-year-old Manuel Álvarez Escudaro was paired against eight-year-old Martín Courrieu. They were born 93 years apart. (Manuel won the game.) And while the English grandmaster Michael Adams won the London Chess Classic at age 52 in December 2023, an eight-year-old girl was also making headlines. The incredibly talented Bodhana Sivanandan from Harrow, northwest London, scored 8½ out of 13 at the European Blitz Championship against a field of highly rated grandmasters, international masters, and experts. I am unsure if Fischer, Kasparov, or Carlsen were already as good at that age. She has the potential to go beyond what Judit Polgár achieved. Truly inspiring! Even this author, who has prioritized writing over playing for almost two decades now, still has hopes at times for some sort of a comeback. But the way the game has changed doesn’t make that any easier. Among my friends, just about everyone uses engines and/or Chessable these days, and most amateurs prepare their openings at chess tournaments with them. I believe it is one of the reasons why today’s amateur chess players are much better in the opening phase of the game than, say, a decade ago, when that area used to be my forte. After finishing this book, there’s something in me that screams, “Now you can return to play tournaments again!” But it seems like a bigger challenge than ever because of the amount of opening knowledge I feel I need to catch up with. There are more opportunities than ever to learn the game, but that also seems to make it tougher than ever to get back to. I might give it a try anyway. As I hope to have demonstrated in this book, chess is everywhere, has been around for centuries, and has undergone major changes. Now, the question is, where is it going? At the top level, over-the-board chess suffered a bit of a blow when Carlsen announced in the summer of 2022 that he would no longer defend his classical title. Just like between 1993 and 2006, we are unsure of the FIDE world champion’s status. The Chinese player Ding Liren took over Carlsen’s title in April 2023 after beating Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi, but Carlsen is still the clear number one on the rating list. Not having the sport’s biggest star in its most important event is far from ideal, so the question is whether we should adopt significant changes to bring him back. I am not sure. The long tradition of world championship matches is part of the wonderful chess culture we have, going back to 1886. We have seen quite an exciting Ding–Nepomniachtchi match, with six decisive games in the classical portion. As the Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri told me, “The problem is Magnus’s personal problem, and he makes it sound like it’s a chess problem.” Carlsen’s colleagues still want to fight for the world title and FIDE doesn’t seem inclined to make big changes, so the classical World Chess Championship cycle won’t be going away any time soon. Classical tournament chess, however, might take more of a back seat to other formats and faster time controls, catering to the new generations of fans. In line with this was the inaugural Tech Mahindra’s Global Chess League (GCL) in June 2023, which had a lot of top players participating. With a time control of ten minutes for the whole game and a five-second increment, it was the first official “franchise league” in chess. The same system has revolutionized cricket in the last 15 years with, most notably, the Indian Premier League (IPL). Another new top event in 2023, with an even faster time control (three minutes for the game and a two-second increment), was the World Chess Armageddon Championship Series. According to the organizers, highlights of these knockout events were broadcast on 30 online and TV platforms globally, including CNBC, Channel 4, beIN, and Fox Australia. And there is more to come. In April 2024, a new chess program was announced, to be broadcast next year on BBC2. Produced by Curve Media and commissioned by BBC’s Factual Entertainment, Chess Masters will see eight episodes aired in which highly skilled players from different age groups and backgrounds battle it out across a series of rapid games before one is crowned with the title of Chess Master. Camilla Lewis, executive producer for Curve Media, said, “We are delighted to be making this warm, inclusive and clever series, where the emotional as well as strategic stakes are high. There is untapped talent out there and the audience will get unique insights into the psychological and practical gameplay of this age-old but highly accessible game played by all cultures and by people of all kinds.” After Fischer–Spassky in 1972 in the US, Kasparov–Short in 1993 in the UK, and Carlsen–Anand in 2013 in Norway, we’re witnessing once again that chess can be exciting to watch on TV—especially when there is fast action involved. We have seen the same with online events for a number of years now, and those will surely continue to be organized and enjoyed. In fact, I think there’s potential for chess to grow even more. Events like the Speed Chess Championship and the Champions Chess Tour—with their increased production quality, the use of the eval bar, and the focus on players, personalities, and drama—have shown that chess has the opportunity to become a mainstream spectator experience like any sport or competitive game. Two recent tournaments revealed that a format change can be exciting too. Both featured Magnus Carlsen, whose ideas about where chess should be going were tested. To lessen the impact of computer preparation, Carlsen either wants faster time controls in regular chess, or longer time controls in Chess960 (mentioned in Chapter 4). In February 2024 the first Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge was held at Weissenhaus in north Germany. It was the first Chess960 tournament at a long time control, and due to its great success initiator and sponsor Jan Henric Buettner plans to hold more events in the future. A month later, classical chess was played at the Grenke tournament in Karlsruhe (also Germany) but with two games of 45 minutes on the clock per day, instead of one long game. Also here, the fans embraced Carlsen’s idea. In my opinion, these new developments can and should exist alongside our classical tradition. For that, we should perhaps treat chess more like athletics, where different disciplines attract different audiences. An old idea of mine is to treat rapid and blitz chess even more like separate disciplines, with their own world championship qualification cycles. Even though the 100 meters will be the most exciting race to watch for most people, our “marathon” classical world championship matches will always have their loyal fanbase too—potentially, also on TV. Meanwhile, it’s wonderful to see chess keep up with its time, even in a world where social media has become a dominant part of how we spend our days. Content creators produce engaging content daily, some of it cringeworthy but often quite entertaining. While chess remains a cultural icon associated with positive features like intelligence, strategy, and cleverness, the influencers remind people how much they like the game and encourage people to pick it up for the first time, or for the fifth time. From King Alfonso X’s Libro de los juegos and many stories from the Middle Ages, we know that women used to play chess just as much as men. A positive development caused by The Queen’s Gambit is that chess is now getting more popular among girls and women again, and not just among streamers. In December 2020, two months after the Netflix series came out, Chess.com saw an increase of 15 percent among new female registrations, while demand for chess lessons among girls and women also went up. Hopefully, new initiatives such as the Women in Chess Foundation and FIDE’s Gender Equality in Chess Index (see page 95) can help create a safer environment for players of all genders and backgrounds. In the commercial society that we live in, the success of a sport can be measured by which global brands are connected to it. Sponsorship for individual players exists, from Intel’s partnership with Fabiano Caruana to Puma’s with Carlsen. However, the chess world still hasn’t seen big global Western brands affiliated with over-the-board chess events. FIDE’s strong ties with Russia and its problematic leadership over the past decades, as mentioned in the first chapter, didn’t help. For many years now a simple Google search into the FIDE president, whether it was Kirsan Ilyumzhinov or Arkady Dvorkovich, will have chased away a Western brand potentially interested in connecting with the game. Online chess has been more successful in this area. In 2023, Chess.com had partnerships with brands such as Supercell and Duolingo, and more are expected in the future. In December 2023, Chess.com signed an agreement with entertainment agency WME, a subsidiary of global sports and entertainment company Endeavor. “WME will work with Chess.com to amplify the game of chess by developing non-scripted content, including documentaries, building celebrity-centric moments, creating crossover content to attract new audiences, and fueling the game’s growth by elevating its profile in mainstream media,” said the press release. Alongside FIDE, Chess.com is likely to play an even bigger role in the world of chess. Especially after its merger with Play Magnus, the platform has a position close to a monopoly on online chess and a lot of influence. That also brings much responsibility, as Chess.com will have a large say in where chess is heading. As I have worked for the company for over a decade, I am far from neutral here, but I think the game is in good hands. Internally, Chess.com employees often use the slogan “Let’s go chess, let’s grow chess.” It represents the company’s main business strategy: growing the game. Instead of going for a bigger piece of the pie, it is trying to bake a bigger pie. As more and more people are playing and watching chess—likely many more than 600 million now—the future does look bright for chess.",

      "title": "Acknowledgments",
      "content": "Acknowledgments I have often been asked: “When will you write a book?” I must admit that the thought of it had always excited me, but I never embarked on a book project because I didn’t know what it should be about. What could I add to my online articles, videos, news reports, and interviews? No, I felt there should be a compelling reason for such a book to exist, and that I didn’t have—until October 2022. That’s why I’d like to start my acknowledgments with the Dutch publisher Casper Luckerhof, who pitched the original idea after seeing me on Dutch television talking about the Carlsen–Niemann case. Remmelt Otten, the publisher of New in Chess, referred me to my agent, Paul Sebes. With Rik Kleuver, Paul provided invaluable help and support throughout the process, and Matthew Keeley provided suggestions and improvements for the initial chapters. After that, it was Robinson’s editorial director Tom Asker, project editor Peter Jacobs and copy editor Ian Preece who helped me finalize the work. I would also like to thank the team at Union Square & Co.: executive editor Barbara Berger; executive editor of Puzzlewright Press, Francis Heaney; project editor Kristin Mandaglio; managing editor Chris Stambaugh; interior designer Rich Hazelton; cover designer Patrick Sullivan; and photo editor Linda Liang. A special thanks goes out to my good friend Arne Moll, who, of everyone, was the most involved in my writing process. He read along and provided feedback on all the chapters but also came by my house regularly to brainstorm more general ideas about where the book should be going. My friend and colleague Mike Klein also provided feedback on almost the whole book and came up with corrections and lots of fun sentence ideas. The book is dedicated to my wife, Míria, who also read along and basically supported me better than I could have wished. Whenever I skipped cooking a meal after I had promised to do so because I needed to finish something, whenever I didn’t join meetings with friends or family because I felt research had to come first, or whenever I was insecure about the whole thing, she never complained and always helped me further. Behind every man who writes his first book—well, at least in my case—stands a great woman. My first job after university, now 25 years ago, was at the publisher of New in Chess. Over four decades, the internationally renowned magazine has consistently signaled the many links between chess and (popular) culture and without it I couldn’t have presented the overview from the first two chapters. In a similar way, the websites ChessBase.com and Chesshistory.com were indispensable during my research.

      "content": "Appendix: Key Annotated Games Throughout the book I have mentioned particular chess games, many quite famous, some lesser known, but always relevant to the story of how the game has developed over the centuries. For those chess fans eager to play through the moves on a chessboard, you will find them below with my annotations. If you prefer to play through them online, you can find the games also at peterdoggers.com/annotated-games. The games are given in algebraic notation; for an explanation I refer to chess.com/terms/chess-notation. Dilaram Problem 1.♖h8+! ♔×h8 2.♗f5+ Note that at the time this problem was composed, bishops could jump over pieces but moved only two squares diagonally. 2 … ♔g8 3.♖h8+! ♔×h8 4.g7+ ♔g8 5.♘h6# Napoleon—Mechanical Turk Vienna, 1809 1.e4 e5 2.♕f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 Napoleon is going for a quick victory on the battlefield. 3 … ♘f6 The Turk is not falling for this beginner’s trick. It would be Scholar’s Mate after something like 3…d6 4.♕×f7#. 4.♘e2 ♗c5 5.a3 d6 6.0-0 Napoleon develops some pieces and castles, showing that he is not a total beginner. 6 … ♗g4 7.♕d3 ♘h5!? 8.h3?! A loss of time. It was high time to develop a new piece; after 8.♘bc3 White is not much worse actually. 8 … ♗×e2 9.♕×e2 ♘f4 10.♕e1? A terrible square for the queen, after which White is dead lost. 10 … ♘d4 After 10 … ♕g5! 11.g4 (11.g3 allows 11 … ♕×g3+! 12.♔h1 ♕g2#) 11…♘×h3+ 12.♔h2 ♕h4 it’s checkmate soon. 11.♗b3?! 11 … ♘×h3+! Here, Napoleon must have realized things weren’t going très bien for him. 12.♔h2 Black’s trick was 12.g×h3 ♘f3+, a “family check” that wins the queen. 12 … ♕h4! A devastating blow. 13.g3 ♘f3+ 14.♔g2 ♘×e1+ The Turk wasn’t a perfect player either. Here, 14 … ♘f4+! would have forced checkmate: 15.g×f4 (15.♔×f3 ♕h5+ 16.g4 ♕h3#) 15 … ♕g4+ 16.♔h1 ♕h3#. 15.♖×e1 ♕g4 16.d3 ♗×f2 17.♖h1 ♕×g3+ 18.♔f1 ♗d4 19.♔e2 ♕g2+ 20.♔d1 ♕×h1+ 21.♔d2 ♕g2+ 22.♔e1 ♘g1 23.♘c3 ♗×c3+ 24.b×c3 ♕e2# It’s safe to say that Napoleon wasn’t too thrilled when this game ended. 0-1 Anderssen-Kieseritzky London, 1851 1.e4 e5 2.f4 The King’s Gambit, arguably the most romantic of openings. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4!? Much more common is 3.♘f3. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔f1 Of course not 4.g3?? f×g3 and White cannot take back the pawn. 4 … b5 A countergambit Kieseritzky had used to beat Anderssen in an earlier game. The idea is to chase the bishop away from the diagonal that attacks f7, and also, Black might be able to attack that bishop more easily. 5.♗×b5 ♘f6 6.♘f3 ♕h6 7.d3 ♘h5 Black now threatens 8 … ♘g3+. 8.♘h4 ♕g5 9.♘f5 c6 On 9 … g6 10.h4 ♕f6 Anderssen was no doubt planning 11.♘c3 after which Black shouldn’t go 11 … g×f5 12.♕×h5 but 11 … ♗b7 would give him a good position. 10.g4?! This attempt to trap Black’s queen is a mistake. Better was 10.♗a4. 10 … ♘f6 11.♖g1 c×b5? 11 … h5! would be in Black’s favor: 12.h4 ♕g6 13.♗a4 (13.g5 ♘g4 shows the main idea behind 11 … h5) 13 … h×g4 14.♗×f4 d5! Black is doing well. 12.h4 ♕g6 13.h5 ♕g5 14.♕f3 White will take the f-pawn with his bishop next, after which Black’s queen would indeed be trapped, so he needs a desperate measure. 14 … ♘g8?! 14 … ♗b7!? was a remarkable option to Black: 15.♗×f4 ♘×g4! 16.♗×g5 ♘h2+ 17.♔f2 ♘×f3 18.♔×f3 but White is close to winning, thanks to his better development and structure. 15.♗×f4 ♕f6 16.♘c3 ♗c5 17.♘d5!? The logical move 17.d4 is very strong as well, but Anderssen probably already saw the fireworks that will soon appear. A romantic mind! 17 … ♕×b2 18.♗d6!? Offering both rooks! This bishop move is the prelude to a wonderful combination which, however, is not entirely correct. With 18.♖e1 White would keep a winning advantage. 18 … ♗×g1? Now Anderssen gets what he wants. Correct was 18 … ♕×a1+ 19.♔e2 ♕b2! attacking c2, when 20.♗×c5 ♕×c2+ 21.♔f1 ♕×c5 22.♕f4 f6 23.♘d6+ ♔d8 24.♘f7+ ♔e8 25.♘d6+ would be a draw by a repetition of moves (not 25.♘×h8? d6 and Black’s extra piece should win the game). 19.e5! Cutting off the a1-h8 diagonal for the queen, so that g7 is not protected anymore. Even stronger was 19.♖e1. 19 … ♕×a1+ 20.♔e2 ♘a6? Allowing a beautiful mate in three that made this game famous. The best defense was 20 … ♗a6 but after 21.♘c7+ ♔d8 22.♘×a6! White would still be winning: 22 … ♕c3 23.♗c7+ ♕×c7 (23 … ♔c8 24.♘d6#; 23 … ♔e8 24.♘d6+ ♔e7 25.♕×f7#) 24.♘×c7. 21.♘×g7+ ♔d8 And now the key idea: 22.♕f6+!! ♘×f6 23.♗e7# 1-0 Anderssen-Dufresne Berlin, 1852 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 ♗c5 4.b4 The Evans Gambit, named after the Welsh sea captain William Davies Evans. 4 … ♗×b4 5.c3 ♗a5 6.d4 e×d4 7.0-0 d3!? Black doesn’t play 7 … d×c3 because after 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.♗g5 ♕g6 White can develop his other knight with 10.♘×c3 while after the text move, the white pawn on c3 keeps the knight away from that square. 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.e5 ♕g6 Not 9 … ♘×e5?? 10.♖e1 d6 11.♕b5+ winning a piece. 10.♖e1 ♘ge7 11.♗a3 b5? This was not necessary at all. After 11 … 0-0 12.♘bd2 d5! 13.e×d6 (en passant) 13 … c×d6 Black is better. 12.♕×b5 ♖b8 This was Black’s idea: winning time to activate his rook over the b-file. It wasn’t worth a pawn, though. 13.♕a4 ♗b6 Castling would lose a piece: 13 … 0-0 14.♗×e7! ♘×e7 15.♕×a5. 14.♘bd2 ♗b7?! 15.♘e4 ♕f5? Losing too much time. The last try was 15 … d2 16.♘e×d2 ♘d8. 16.♗×d3 Threatening 17.♘f6+ and 18.♗×f5, which is also possible if Black castles. 16 … ♕h5 17.♘f6+!? Objectively speaking, 17.♖ad1 was stronger. 17 … g×f6 18.e×f6 Because ♘e7 is pinned, White will win the piece back and the e-file is opened up. It looks great, but Black can counter, which he does: 18 … ♖g8! 19.♖ad1 ♕×f3? Falling for Anderssen’s brilliant ploy. A better way to make use of the pinned g-pawn was 19 … ♕h3! threatening mate on g2, since 20.♗f1 (not 20.g3? ♖×g3+! 21.h×g3 ♕×g3+ 22.♔h1 ♕×f3+ 23.♔h2 ♕×f2+ 24.♔h3 ♕f3+ 25.♔h2 ♘e5 and it’s Black who has a winning attack.) 20 … ♕f5 leaves neither player with a clear advantage. What follows is one of the most famous combinations in chess history. 20.♖×e7+! ♘×e7 21.♕×d7+!! Just brilliant. 21 … ♔×d7 22.♗f5+ ♔e8 23.♗d7+ ♔f8 24.♗×e7# 1-0 Levitsky-Marshall Breslau, 1912 1.e4 e6 The French Defense. 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 c5 4.♘f3 ♘c6 5.e×d5 e×d5 6.♗e2 ♘f6 7.0-0 ♗e7 8.♗g5 0-0 9.d×c5 ♗e6 10.♘d4 ♗×c5 11.♘×e6 f×e6 12.♗g4 ♕d6 13.♗h3 ♖ae8 14.♕d2 ♗b4 15.♗×f6 ♖×f6 16.♖ad1 ♕c5 17.♕e2 ♗×c3 18.b×c3 ♕×c3 19.♖×d5 ♘d4 20.♕h5 ♖ef8 21.♖e5 ♖h6 22.♕g5 ♖×h3 23.♖c5 On 23.g×h3 comes ♘f3+. Black is winning and can go to almost any square with the queen now, since he has already won a piece, but the spot he chooses is the most spectacular. 23 … ♕g3!! White resigned. The black queen can be taken in three ways after 23 … ♕g3 but they all lose: 24.h×g3 ♘e2#; 24.f×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♖×f1#; 24.♕×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♘×g3+ 26.♔g1 (26.f×g3 ♖×f1#) 26 … ♘e2+ 27.♔h1 ♖c3. 0-1 D. Byrne-Fischer New York, 1956 1.♘f3 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 ♗g7 4.d4 0-0 5.♗f4 d5 6.♕b3 d×c4 7.♕×c4 c6 8.e4 ♘bd7 9.♖d1 ♘b6 10.♕c5 ♗g4 11.♗g5? This allows a brilliant shot. Better was 11.♗e2 when 11 … ♘fd7 12.♕a3 ♗×f3 13.♗×f3 e5! 14.d×e5 ♖e8 is close to equal. 11…♘a4!! 12.♕a3 12.♘×a4 ♘×e4 wins for Black in all lines: 13.♕b4 ♘×g5; 13.♕×e7 ♕a5+ 14.b4 ♕×a4 15.♕×e4 ♖fe8 16.♗e7 ♗×f3 17.g×f3 ♗f8; 13.♗×e7 ♘×c5 14.♗×d8 ♖e8+ 15.♗e2 ♘×a4; 13.♕c1 ♗×f3 14.g×f3 ♕a5+ 15.♗d2 ♘×d2 16.♕×d2 ♕×a4 and d4 will drop. 12…♘×c3 13.b×c3 ♘×e4! Another surprising knight move that involves an exchange sacrifice. It’s all possible thanks to White’s lack in development. 14.♗×e7 ♕b6 15.♗c4 After 15.♗×f8 ♗×f8 White is in big trouble: 16.♕c1 ♘×c3 17.♖d2 ♖e8+ 18.♗e2 ♘×e2 19.♖×e2 ♖×e2+ 20.♔×e2 ♕b5+ 21.♔d1 (21.♔d2 ♗h6+; 21.♔e1 ♗b4+) 21…♕d3+ 22.♕d2 ♗×f3+ 23.g×f3 ♕×f3+ or 16.♕b3 ♘×c3! 17.♕×b6 a×b6 18.♖d2 ♗b4! and also here White will lose material. 15…♘×c3! 16.♗c5 16.♕×c3 is met by 16 … ♖ae8 and 16.♗×f8 ♗×f8 17.♕×c3? ♗b4 is another idea. 16…♖fe8+ 17.♔f1 17.♔d2 ♘e4+ and 17.♘e5 ♗×e5 18.♗×b6 ♗d6+ win for Black. 17…♗e6!! The beautiful point behind the whole combination. 18.♗×b6 18.♗×e6 leads to a pretty mate: ♕b5+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘g3+ 21.♔g1 ♕f1+ 22.♖×f1 ♘e2#. After 18.♕×c3 ♕×c5 19.d×c5 ♗×c3 20.♗×e6 ♖×e6 Black has a winning endgame. 18…♗×c4+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘×d4+ 21.♔g1 ♘e2+ 22.♔f1 ♘c3+ 23.♔g1 a×b6!

Fischer-Mac Hack (Greenblatt) Cambridge, MA (2), 1977 1.e4 e5 2.f4 Like the Romantics in the 19th century, Fischer plays the King’s Gambit. At that time, computers were very materialistic and could not see deep enough to understand White’s compensation. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4 In the footsteps of Anderssen and others. 3 … d5!? 4.♗×d5 ♘f6 5.♘c3 ♗b4 6.♘f3 0-0 7.0-0 ♘×d5 8.♘×d5 ♗d6?! So far, Black’s play wasn’t actually that bad, but only if it was followed up by 8 … f5! 9.♘×b4 f×e4 winning back a piece, since if White removes ♘f3, Black has ♕d4+ and the knight on b4 drops. 9.d4 Now White is much better, in fact close to winning already, thanks to his strong pawn center. 9 … g5?! Trying to hang on to the pawn on f4 only makes matters worse. 10.♘×g5! An easy sacrifice for Fischer. 10 … ♕×g5 11.e5 ♗h3 12.♖f2 ♗×e5 The bishop is also lost after 12 … ♗e7 13.♗×f4 ♕h4 14.g3. 13.d×e5 c6 14.♗×f4 ♕g7 15.♘f6+ ♔h8 16.♕h5♖d8 16 … ♗e6 allows 17.♗h6. 17.♕×h3 ♘a6 18.♖f3 ♕g6 19.♖c1 ♔g7 20.♖g3 ♖h8 Now White can take the queen, but thanks to the pin over the g-file it’s actually mate in one. 21.♕h6#! 1-0 Chess 4.7-Levy Toronto, 1978 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 f5 The Latvian Gambit. 3.e×f5 A fine move while 3.♘×e5 is considered to be even stronger. 3 … e4 4.♘e5 ♘f6 5.♘g4?! d5 6.♘×f6+ ♕×f6 7.♕h5+? ♕f7?! Levy misses the idea 7 … g6! 8.f×g6 h×g6 9.♕×d5 ♖h5! and after for example 10.♕c4 ♘c6 Black will have very quick development.

It was beyond Chess 4.7’s horizon to see the line 37.g5! ♖×d4 38.♖e6 ♗×f4+ 39.♔f3 and the black rook keeps getting attacked so that it cannot stay on the fourth rank after which ♗f4 will hang: 39 … ♖c4 40.b3 ♖b4 41.a3. 37 … c×d4 38.♖×a7+ 38 … ♔f8?

A mistake, but the reason why was hard to foresee. 47.♘g2!! A fantastic move. White sacrifices a pawn to create an entry point for his king along the h-file. After 47.g×h4 ♗g6 48.♔g3 ♔e6 49.♔f4 ♗h7 White cannot make progress. 47 … h×g3+ 48.♔×g3 ♔e6 Giving up the h-pawn right away, since Black cannot keep it. 48 … ♗g6 49.♘f4 ♗f7 50.♔h4 ♔e7 51.♘×h5 is similar to the game and 51 … ♗×h5 52.♔×h5 loses quickly: 52 … ♔f7 53.♔h6 ♔e6 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.f4 ♔e6 56.f5+ ♔e7 57.♔g7. 49.♘f4+ ♔f5 50.♘×h5 Threatening ♘g7-e8-c7, therefore the king must retreat. 50 … ♔e6 50 … ♗c2 51.♘f4 ♗b3 52.♘d3 and the a6-pawn will drop soon. 51.♘f4+ ♔d6 52.♔g4 ♗c2 53.♔h5 ♗d1 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.♘×d5+?

Now White is winning again. This famous endgame has been analyzed by many grandmasters.

This remarkable move was first played by Kasparov’s long-time nemesis Anatoly Karpov, also in the 10th game of his 1978 match against Viktor Korchnoi. 11 … d×c3 11 … ♕×g5 is also playable when White wins back the piece with 12.♕f3. 12.♘×e6 f×e6 13.b×c3 ♕d3 Both players had played without thinking so far because the same moves had also appeared in the sixth match game. Here, Kasparov deviates. 14.♗c2!! This move had been suggested by the former world champion Mikhail Tal and carefully checked by Kasparov’s team with the help of the computer. 14 … ♕×c3 15.♘b3 ♘×b3 Played by Anand after 45 minutes of thought. 16.♗×b3 16 … ♘d4 White was offering his rook on a1 but Anand saw that it’s dangerous to take it straight away: 16 … ♕×a1 17.♕h5+ g6 (17 … ♔d8 18.♗g5+ wins the queen on a1 while 17 … ♔d7 18.♗×e6+! ♔×e6 19.♕g4+ ♔f7 20.♕f3+ ♔e6 21.♕×c6+ ♗d6 22.e×d6 also wins for White) 18.♕f3 ♘d8 19.♕f6 ♖g8 20.♗×e6 ♖g7 21.♗a3! ♕×f1+ 22.♔×f1 ♘×e6 23.♕×e6+ ♗e7 24.♕c6+ and White will be up too much material. 17.♕g4! Kasparov insists. Take my rook! 17 … ♕×a1 17 … ♘×b3 18.♕×e6+ ♗e7 19.♗g5 is a simple win. 18.♗×e6 ♖d8! The best move. 19.♗h6! Kasparov was still playing his moves almost instantly as he had analyzed all this before with the computer. 19 … ♕c3 The best defense. 19 … ♕×f1+ 20.♔×f1 g×h6 21.♕h5+ ♔e7 22.♕f7#. 20.♗×g7 ♕d3 21.♗×h8 ♕g6 22.♗f6 ♗e7 23.♗×e7 ♕×g4 24.♗×g4 ♔×e7 Anand has managed to reach the endgame only a pawn down, and he would have chances for survival if he could run his c-pawn up the board, but Kasparov prevents that with an important move. 25.♖c1! c6 26.f4 a5 27.♔f2 a4 28.♔e3 b4 29.♗d1!

An excellent pawn sacrifice that computers in the 1970s likely wouldn’t have played. 23 … ♖×d5 24.♖×d5 e×d5 25.b3! Before taking on b6, Deep Blue first removes a pawn that was hanging. 25 … ♔h8 26.♕×b6 ♖g8 27.♕c5 27 … d4? Better was 27 … ♕g5 28.g3 f4 29.♘d6 ♕f6 30.g4 ♖g6! 31.♘f5 h5 32.♔f1 h×g4 33.h×g4 ♖×g4 34.♕c3 ♖g6 with equality. 28.♘d6 f4 29.♘×b7! A human playing against Kasparov would consider this too risky, since the knight is so far away from defending its king. Deep Blue, however, has calculated everything. 29 … ♘e5 30.♕d5! f3 31.g3 ♘d3 32.♖c7 ♖e8 33.♘d6! ♖e1+ 34.♔h2 ♘×f2 35.♘×f7+ ♔g7 36.♘g5+ ♔h6 37.♖×h7+ Kasparov resigned because he saw 37 … ♔g6 38.♕g8+ ♔f5 39.♘×f3 (not 39.♖f7?? ♖h1#) 39 … ♖h1+ 40.♔g2 and now both the knight on f2 hangs and a quick checkmate starting with 41. ♖h5+ is threatened. This was a computer’s first victory against the world champion in a classical time control. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (2), 1997 1.e4 e5 Kasparov usually played the Sicilian, but apparently he figured this to be a more solid choice against a strong computer. 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 The Closed Ruy Lopez (Spanish). 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 h6 10.d4 ♖e8 11.♘bd2 ♗f8 12.♘f1 ♗d7 13.♘g3 ♘a5 14.♗c2 c5 15.b3 ♘c6 16.d5 Closing the center. In the old days, humans would be clearly stronger in closed positions than computers but this game kind of changed that idea. 16 … ♘e7 17.♗e3 ♘g6 18.♕d2 ♘h7 19.a4 ♘h4 20.♘×h4 ♕×h4 21.♕e2 ♕d8 22.b4 ♕c7 23.♖ec1 c4 24.♖a3! Preparing to double rooks on the a-file before taking on b5. 24 … ♖ec8 25.♖ca1 ♕d8 26.f4!? At the time, this was considered to be a stunning move because opening a second front on the kingside was considered a very “human-like” concept. As a result, most commentators overerstimated this pawn move a bit. Modern engines prefer the maneuver 26.♗d1! ♘f6 27.♕a2 g6 28.a×b5 ♗×b5 (White’s three heavy pieces on the a-file prevented 28 … a×b5 as 29.♖×a8 wins a full rook) and, after this small positional victory of isolating Black’s pawns on the queenside, to continue maneuvering with 29.♕d2 h5 30.♗c2 ♗g7 31.♘f1. 26 … ♘f6 Better was 26 … e×f4 27.♗×f4 g6. 27.f×e5 d×e5 28.♕f1?! ♘e8?! Kasparov missed a chance to equalize the game with 28 … a5! 29.a×b5 a×b4 30.♖×a8 ♖×a8 31.♖×a8 ♕×a8 32.♕×c4 ♕a1+ 33.♔h2 ♕e1! attacking ♗e3 and c3. 29.♕f2 ♘d6 30.♗b6 ♕e8 31.♖3a2 ♗e7 32.♗c5 ♗f8? Apparently, Kasparov had a blind spot for the move 32 … a5 during this game. After 33.a×b5 a×b4 34.♗×b4 ♖×a2 35.♖×a2 ♘×b5 Black is OK. 33.♘f5! ♗×f5 33 … ♘×f5 34.e×f5 is not better. 34.e×f5 f6 35.♗×d6 ♗×d6 36.a×b5 a×b5 37.♗e4! Another “human-like” move by Deep Blue, depriving Kasparov of the hope to push his e-pawn and bring his bishop to life. 37 … ♖×a2 38.♕×a2 Black has lost the battle over the a-file, and soon White’s heavy pieces will enter his position. 38 … ♕d7 39.♕a7 ♖c7 39 … ♕×a7+ 40.♖×a7 ♖d8 41.♖a5 ♖b8 42.♖a6 ♖d8 43.♖b6 wins a pawn. 40.♕b6 ♖b7 41.♖a8+ ♔f7 42.♕a6 ♕c7 43.♕c6 ♕b6+ 44.♔f1 ♖b8 45.♖a6? A big mistake, due to a bug in the system. Here, Kasparov resigned, not realizing that 45 … ♕e3! saves the draw: 46.♕×d6 and now the key move 46 … ♖e8! when Black’s queen, deeply entered into the enemy position, will pester the white king with endless checks. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (6), 1997 1.e4 c6 The last time Kasparov had played the Caro-Kann in an official tournament game was in 1982. Nevertheless, Deep Blue was fully ready for it … 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 d×e4 4.♘×e4 ♘d7 5.♘g5 ♘gf6 6.♗d3 e6 7.♘1f3 h6? The move that made history, as it was the reason Kasparov would lose this game, and the match. He had gambled that his computer opponent wouldn’t take on e6, but it did, instantly. 8.♘×e6! A piece sacrifice with the intention to keep the enemy king in the center. 8 … ♕e7?! After this, Black is dead lost. Kasparov wants to run with his king to the queenside, but it won’t find safety there. The best continuation was 8 … f×e6 9.♗g6+ ♔e7 10.♗f4 ♘d5 11.♗g3 h5 12.0-0 ♖h6 13.♘h4 and now 13 … ♖×g6! (a return sacrifice to improve the king’s safety) 14.♘×g6+ ♔f7 15.♕×h5 ♘7f6 when Black is clearly worse, but not lost yet. 9.0-0! f×e6 10.♗g6+ ♔d8 11.♗f4 b5 12.a4! ♗b7 13.♖e1 ♘d5 14.♗g3 ♔c8 15.a×b5 c×b5 16.♕d3 ♗c6 17.♗f5 White simply picks up the e6-pawn, so Kasparov decides to give up his queen, but it’s hopeless. 17 … e×f5 18.♖×e7 ♗×e7 19.c4 Crashing through. Kasparov resigned, losing his first match ever. For Deep Blue, which got dismantled after this contest, it was the finest and final victory. 1-0 Topalov-Shirov Linares, 1998 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense.

White simply wanted to remove a defender of the knight on c4. Not 23.♗×a4? ♘b6 24.♗b3 a4. 23 … ♗e8 24.e5 ♘b6 25.f5 ♘d5 26.♗d2? A blunder. Topalov could have won with 26.♕f2! ♕×c3 27.♗b2 ♕b4 28.♗a1! and White is now ready to play 29.f6 and 30.e6 next, leading to a crushing attack, but then we would never have seen Shirov’s beautiful endgame play. 26 … ♘b4! 27.♕×a4 After 27.c×b4 Topalov might’ve hoped for 27 … ♕×d4 28.f×g6 h×g6 29.e6 giving a win for White, but instead, Black counters with 27 … ♕×c2 28.♘×c2 ♖×d2 29.♗b1 a×b4 to win. 27 … ♘×a2 28.♕×a2 ♗×e5 29.f×g6 h×g6 30.♗g5 ♖d5 31.♖e3 ♕d6 32.♕e2 ♗d7 33.c4 ♗×d4 34.c×d5 ♗×e3 35.♕×e3 ♖e8 36.♕c3 ♕×d5 37.♗h6? The only move was 37.♗f6! ♖e2 38.♕g3 when White has enough play against the enemy king to hold the game to a draw. 37 … ♖e5?! Close to winning was 37 … ♕e5! 38.♕f3 ♗e6 39.♕×c6 ♗d5 40.♕a4 ♖b8. 38.♖f3 ♕c5 39.♕a1 ♗f5 40.♖e3 f6 41.♖×e5 ♕×e5 42.♕a2+? After 42.♕a3!

L’Ami had prepared this sacrifice. 20 … ♗×a3 21.♖e3 While attacking ♗a3, the rook shifts to an attacking position. He does leave another bishop hanging, though. 21 … ♕×c2 22.♖g3+ ♘g6 23.♖h3 23 … ♖fc8?! Later, stronger engines found that after 23 … ♖fd8! 24.e×f5 ♘e5 it’s Black who is winning: 25.♕g5+ (25.♖×a3 ♕d2 26.♖g3+ ♔f8 27.f6 ♖dc8! or 25.♕×h7+ ♔f8 26.♖×a3 ♕d2 27.♕h8+ ♔e7 28.f6+ ♔d7 29.♕h3+ ♔c7) 25 … ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ ♔c8. 24.e×f5 ♘e5? Now Black loses after all. Here, it was important to return a piece with 24 … ♘f4! 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♕×f4 and then improve the bishop’s position with 26 … ♗b2! when White should take the draw with 27.♕×d6+ ♔g8 28.♕g3+ ♔f8 (not 28 … ♔h8 29.♕h4) 29.♕d6+ or continue the fight with 29.f6!? ♕e2! 30.♕g7+ ♔e8 31.♖hf3. 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ Now we see why c8 was an unfortunate square to put the rook on. 29 … ♔d8 30.♖e1! L’Ami had analyzed this with the computer till the last move. 1-0 Carlsen-Kasparov Reykjavík (rapid), 2004 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.♘f3 ♘f6 4.♘c3 e6 5.♗g5 ♘bd7 6.e3 ♕a5 The Cambridge Springs Defense of the Queen’s Gambit, named after a 1904 tournament in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, where it was played several times. 7.♘d2 Stopping Black’s intended move 7 … ♘e4. 7 … ♗b4 8.♕c2 0-0 9.♗e2 e5 10.0-0 e×d4 11.♘b3 ♕b6 12.e×d4 d×c4 13.♗×c4 Black has isolated White’s d-pawn but White’s pieces are much more active. 13 … a5 14.a4 ♕c7 15.♖ae1 h6 16.♗h4 ♗d6 16 … ♘b6 17.♗d3 ♘bd5 with equality. 17.h3 ♘b6 18.♗×f6! ♘×c4 19.♘e4! Perhaps Kasparov had underestimated this idea. 19 … ♗h2+ The main point is that Black cannot take: 19 … g×f6 20.♘×f6+ ♔g7 21. ♕h7+ ♔×f6 22.♕×h6+ ♔f5 23.g4#. 20.♔h1 ♘d6 21.♔×h2 ♘×e4+ 22.♗e5 ♘d6 23.♕c5 ♖d8 24.d5! A 13-year-old Carlsen is putting maximum pressure on his famous opponent and will soon win a pawn. 24 … ♕d7 25.♘d4 ♘f5 26.d×c6 b×c6 27.♘×c6 ♖e8 28.♖d1 ♕e6 29.♖fe1 Strong was 29.♗c7! after which White can safely play 30.♘×a5. 29 … ♗b7 30.♘d4 ♘×d4 31.♕×d4 ♕g6 32. ♕g4 Keeping the queens on the board with 32.f3 was slightly more promising. 32 … ♕×g4 33.h×g4 ♗c6 34.b3 f6 35.♗c3 ♖×e1 36.♖×e1 ♗d5 37.♖b1 ♔f7 38.♔g3 ♖b8 39.b4 a×b4 40.♗×b4 ♗c4 41.a5 ♗a6 42.f3 ♔g6 43.♔f4 h5 44.g×h5+ ♔×h5 45.♖h1+ ♔g6 46.♗c5 ♖b2 47.♔g3 ♖a2 48.♗b6 ♔f7 49.♖c1 g5 50.♖c7+ ♔g6 51.♖c6 ♗f1 52.♗f2 Black’s pieces are working so well that White cannot make progress despite the extra pawn. ½-½ Kramnik-Leko Brissago (8), 2004 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 0-0 8.c3 d5 This move starts the Marshall Attack. Black sacrifices the e-pawn but will get attacking chances on White’s king. 9.e×d5 ♘×d5 10.♘×e5 ♘×e5 11.♖×e5 c6 12.d4 ♗d6 13.♖e1 ♕h4 14.g3 ♕h3 15.♖e4 White threatens to move this rook to h4, which Black prevents with his next move. 15 … g5 16.♕f1 ♕h5 17.♘d2 ♗f5 18.f3! Creating a square on f2 for the queen, since Black cannot really take the rook anyway. 18 … ♘f6 18 … ♗×e4? 19.f×e4 ♘b6 20.e5 followed by 21. ♘e4 would give White a wonderful position. 19.♖e1 ♖ae8 20.♖×e8 ♖×e8 21.a4 ♕g6 22.a×b5?! Played relatively quickly by Kramnik, who would later state that he gambled a bit here, also because Leko was already getting low on time. Better was 22.♘e4 ♘×e4 23.f×e4 ♗×e4 24.♗×g5 ♗f5 when Black has enough compensation for the pawn, but not more. 22 … ♗d3! 23.♕f2? Kramnik had too much faith in his team’s computer preparation and overestimated his position here. He should have played 23.♕d1 instead and accept a draw by repetition: 23 … ♗e2 24.♕e1 ♗d3 25.♕d1. 23 … ♖e2 24.♕×e2 After 24.b×a6 ♖×f2 25.♔×f2 ♕h5 26.♔g1 White’s a-pawn will become a queen, but too late: 26 … ♗×g3! 27.h×g3 ♕h3 28.a7 ♕×g3+ 29.♔h1 g4! 30.a8♕+ ♔g7 31.♕b7 ♕e1+ 32.♔g2 g×f3+ 33.♘×f3 ♕f1+ 34.♔g3 ♘h5+ 35.♔h4 ♕h1+ 36.♔g4 ♕g2+ 37.♔×h5 ♕h3+ 38.♘h4 ♗e2+ 39.♔g5 ♕g4#. 24 … ♗×e2 25.b×a6 Also here White is not in time. Leko now executed the attack flawlessly: 25 … ♕d3! 26.♔f2 The problem of 26.a7 ♕e3+ 27.♔g2 is 27 … ♗×f3+! 28.♘×f3 ♕e2+ 29.♔g1 (29.♔h3 ♕f1#) 29 … ♘g4 30.a8♕+ ♔g7 31.♕×c6 (31.♗×g5 ♕f2+ 32.♔h1 ♕×f3+ 33.♔g1 ♕f2+ 34.♔h1 ♕×h2#) 31 … ♕f2+ 32.♔h1 ♕f1+ 33.♘g1 ♘f2#. 26 … ♗×f3! 27.♘×f3 ♘e4+ 28.♔e1 ♘×c3! 29.b×c3 ♕×c3+ 30.♔f2 ♕×a1 31.a7 h6 32.h4 g4 0-1 Deep Fritz 10-Kramnik Bonn (2), 2006 1.d4 d5 2.c4 d×c4 3.e4 b5 4.a4 c6 5.♘c3 b4 6.♘a2 ♘f6 7.e5 ♘d5 8.♗×c4 e6 9.♘f3 a5 10.♗g5 ♕b6 11.♘c1 ♗a6 12.♕e2 h6 13.♗e3 ♗×c4 14.♕×c4 ♘d7 15.♘b3 ♗e7 16.♖c1 0-0 17.0-0 17.♕×c6 ♕×c6 18.♖×c6 is not so good because with 18 … ♘7b6 Black will win the a4-pawn. 17 … ♖fc8 18.♕e2 c5 19.♘fd2 ♕c6 20.♕h5 ♕×a4 21.♘×c5 ♘×c5 22.d×c5 ♘×e3 23.f×e3 ♗×c5 24.♕×f7+ ♔h8 25.♕f3 ♖f8 26.♕e4 ♕d7 Black has the simple plan of running with the a-pawn and White doesn’t have much to show for it. 27.♘b3 ♗b6 28.♖fd1 ♕f7 29.♖f1 ♕a7 30.♖×f8+ ♖×f8 31.♘d4 a4?! Missing 31 … ♖d8! 32.♖c4 b3! 33.h3 (not 33.♘×b3?? ♗×e3+ 34.♔f1 a4) 33 … ♗×d4 34.e×d4 a4 and Black is virtually winning. 32.♘×e6! ♗×e3+ 33.♔h1 ♗×c1 34.♘×f8 34 … ♕e3?? Two question marks are not enough for what is possibly the biggest blunder in history committed by a (former) world champion. The game should have ended with the following repetition: 34 … ♔g8 35.♘g6 ♗×b2 36.♕d5+ ♔h7 37.♘f8+ ♔h8 38.♘g6+. 35.♕h7# 1-0 Topalov-Anand Sofia (1), 2010 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense, like in Topalov-Shirov. 4.c×d5 ♘×d5 5.e4 ♘×c3 6.b×c3 ♗g7 7.♗c4 c5 8.♘e2 ♘c6 With the knight on e2 instead of f3, 8 … ♗g4 can be answered by 9.f3. 9.♗e3 0-0 10.0-0 ♘a5 11.♗d3 b6 12.♕d2 e5 13.♗h6 c×d4 14.♗×g7 ♔×g7 15.c×d4 e×d4 16.♖ac1 ♕d6 17.f4 f6 18.f5 ♕e5 19.♘f4 g5 20.♘h5+ ♔g8 Against 20 … ♔h8 the Topalov team had prepared the same move as he would play next: 21.h4! ♖g8 and now it’s possible to play 22.♘×f6!? ♕×f6 23.e5 ♕×e5 24.f6 and the f-pawn is quite dangerous. A long computer line goes 24 … ♗e6 25.f7 ♖gf8 26.♖ce1 ♕d5 27.♗e4 ♘c4 28.♕d3 ♕c5 29.♗×a8 ♘e3 30.♖f2 ♔g7 31.♗e4 ♖×f7 32.♖d2 ♖d7 33.♗×h7 ♗f7 34.h×g5 and White is still better. 21.h4 h6 22.h×g5 h×g5 23.♖f3 Also in this position 23.♘×f6+ was interesting. 23 … ♔f7? Anand remembered that this move had to be played, but not in which position. Correct was 23 … ♗d7! 24.♖g3 and only now 24 … ♔f7 25.♗c4+ ♘×c4 26.♖×c4 ♖h8 27.♖×d4 ♗e8 28.♖d7+ ♔f8! (28 … ♗×d7?? 29.♕×d7+ ♕e7 30.♕d5+ loses the rook on a8.) 29.♘×f6 ♕a1+ 30.♔f2 ♕×f6 and White’s attack is only good for a draw: 31.♕b4+ ♔g8 32.♕b3+ ♔f8. 24.♘×f6! A sacrifice that Topalov and his team had prepared with the computer, while Anand’s team was also aware of it. But you can’t remember everything … 24 … ♔×f6 24 … ♕×f6 25.♖h3! ♗d7 26.♖h7+ ♔e8 27.e5! with a winning attack. 25.♖h3! ♖g8 25 … ♕f4 26.e5+! ♔×e5 27.♕e2+ ♔d5 28.♖f1 ♕e5 29.♕f3+ winning ♖a8. 26.♖h6+ ♔f7 27.♖h7+ ♔e8 28.♖cc7 ♔d8 29.♗b5! ♕×e4 29 … ♕×b5 30.♕×d4+ ♔e8 31.♖he7+ ♔f8 32.♕f6#. 30.♖×c8+ Anand resigned because of 30 … ♔×c8 31.♕c1+ ♘c6 32.♗×c6 ♕e3+ 33.♕×e3 d×e3 34.♗×a8. 1-0 Carlsen-Nakamura Stavanger, 2017 1.e4 c5 2.♘f3 d6 3.d4 c×d4 4.♘×d4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 a6 The Najdorf variation of the Sicilian, named after the Polish-Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf. 6.h3 This little pawn move was also played by a young Bobby Fischer. 6 … g6 7.g3 ♘c6 8.♗e3 ♗g7 9.♗g2 0-0 10.0-0 ♘d7 11.b3 ♘×d4 12.♗×d4 ♗×d4 13.♕×d4 b6 14.♘d5 ♗b7 15.c4 e5 Fixing White’s e-pawn on a light square, so that it will keep blocking the bishop on g2.

This move forces a draw by move repetition. 35.h×g4 ♕h4+ 36.♔g1 ♕×g4+ 37.♔h1 ♕h4+ This is the position that Messi and Ronaldo had on their board in the 2022 Louis Vuitton picture on Instagram. 38.♔g1 ♕g4+ 39.♔h1 ♕h4+ 40.♔g1 ♕g4+ ½-½ Kasparov-Karjakin St. Louis, MO (blitz), 2017 1.e4 e5 2.f4 The first and only time Kasparov played the King’s Gambit in an official game, and this author happened to be standing right next to it with his camera running. 2 … e×f4 3.♘c3!? Kasparov chooses a move that James Mason and Paul Keres have tried in the past. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔e2 A remarkable situation: after four moves the white king cannot castle anymore and is blocking his bishop and queen. In return, he hopes to build up a strong pawn center. 4 … ♕d8?! Not the best move, but not terrible either. Karjakin argues his queen soon needed to leave h4 anyway. 5.d4 ♘f6 6.♗×f4 ♗b4 7.♗g5 Better was 7.♘d5! ♘×d5 8.e×d5 0-0 9.♘f3 ♖e8+ 10.♔f2 with a slight edge for White. 7 … ♗×c3 8.b×c3 d6 9.♘f3 0-0 10.♗×f6 Kasparov first takes the knight as the immediate 10.♔f2?? fails to ♘×e4+. 10 … ♕×f6 11.♔f2 c5 12.h3 ♖e8 13.♕d3 b6 14.♖e1 ♗b7 15.g3 ♘c6 16.♗g2 ♖ac8 17.a3 Anticipating Black’s idea of 17 … c×d4 18.c×d4 ♘b4. 17 … ♘b8 18.♖e3 ♘d7 19.♖f1 ♕e7 20.♔g1??

Kasparov goes for his last practical chance. 42 … ♖×g3+ Black could just take the knight: 42 … h×g6 43.♖×g6+ ♔f7 44.♕a2+ ♖c4 and White’s attack is over. 43.♕×g3 ♕d2+??

He could have continued with 60 … ♕c1+ 61.♔h2 ♖f7 but it does look somewhat dangerous: 62.♘h4+ (62.♕b8+ ♔g7 63.♕h8+ ♔h6 64.♘e5 ♕c7) 62 … ♖g7 63.♕b8+ ♔f7 64.♕×a7+ ♔f6 65.♕×b6+ ♔g5 66.♕d8+ ♔h5 67.♘g2.

The main reason is that the Berlin Defense (3 … ♘f6) against the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5) is so strong. 5.c3 d6 6.b4 ♗b6 7.a4 a5 8.b5 ♘e7 9.0-0 0-0 10.♘bd2 ♘g6 11.d4 h6 12.♖e1 ♖e8 13.♗a3 Later the same year, Caruana would try the move 13.h3 in this position. 13 … e×d4 14.♕b3 d5! 14 … ♗e6 15.♗×e6 ♖×e6 16.c×d4 is slightly better for White.

      "content": "Introduction My father taught me chess when I was eight years old. I got more interested in primary school when I played against my teacher during breaks. A few years later, when I was 14, my neighbor and friend Gino asked me, “I’m going to my uncle’s to play chess; do you want to join?” His uncle Gerard, who I still see every now and then at the chess café De Laurierboom in Amsterdam, had a nice chess set and, even more fascinating to my teenage mind, lots of books about chess. He started telling us about his hero Bobby Fischer, and I couldn’t stop listening. Soon, Gino and I were playing regularly, even copying “world championship matches” that we had heard about: we would play one game a day, alternating colors, thus easily filling a two-week school holiday playing for the title of champion of our street. In September 1990 we joined the local club De Eenhoorn (the Unicorn), where I met some of my best friends. We still play for the same club today. The very first chess book I read from cover to cover was Theo Schuster’s Het Grote Schaakspel (The Big Game of Chess) from 1987, a general overview of the game’s history, its rules, its great players from the past and their best games. It included what is still my favorite chess anecdote of all time, about the notion that the threat is stronger than the execution, one of the most well-known theorems in chess. Aron Nimzowitsch, a world-class player in the 1920s, supposedly detested tobacco smoke at a time when it was allowed and customary to smoke during tournaments. Before starting one of his games, Nimzowitsch’s opponent had agreed with him not to smoke, but shortly after the start, he pulled out a cigar from his pocket, followed by a box of matches. Nimzowitsch furiously headed to the arbiter to complain, who pointed out that his opponent hadn’t actually started smoking. “But he threatens to smoke,” said Nimzowitsch, “and any chess player knows that the threat is stronger than the execution.” Schuster’s book revealed that a bigger world was hiding behind the “simple” board game. It had such a fascinating cultural legacy that I wanted to know more about. I discovered that chess is much like the game played in Hermann Hesse’s 1943 novel The Glass Bead Game: an intellectual encounter incorporating elements from mathematics, psychology, art, sports, and even music. Throughout history it has functioned as a metaphor for war, the cerebral battle, the strategic fight, and even for describing our entire society. In its symbolic variety, chess is the richest game of all. Chess has a history of over 1,500 years, and it has always been “popular” in the old Latin sense of the word: prevalent among the general public. But it has been more than that, and this is the part that is hard to describe. It seems that, like no other game, chess has always been an activity with a certain magic, something to enjoy but also something that inspires esteem or awe and should be treated with respect. It is no coincidence that the biggest personalities of their times often connected with the game: from Napoleon playing the Mechanical Turk in 1809 to Elon Musk getting involved with the Carlsen–Niemann scandal in 2022. In February 2006, I started my first chess blog, and by December of the following year I had quit my full-time job, which had provided me with a good and stable income. I wanted to see if I could turn my website ChessVibes into a successful company. I gave myself a year to see where it would go, and felt I could always return to the job market if things didn’t work out. In the eighteen years since, I haven’t looked back. Chess has taken me to beautiful and far-flung corners of the world. I’ve met fascinating people and avid fans, yet I always felt chess had the potential to become bigger, in the same way poker did. In modern times, chess has had different peaks in popularity. The first time was around the Fischer–Spassky match in 1972 in Reykjavík amid the Cold War. As the battle was covered daily in newspapers worldwide, Fischer became a celebrity, hundreds of thousands got hooked on the game, and chess sets ran out of stock everywhere. It is no coincidence that Iceland, where the match took place, now has the highest number of grandmasters per capita: 13 GMs among a population of 375,000. After the thrilling battles between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov in the 1980s, the general public also loved the success story of Judit Polgár and her sisters. A true new peak, however, was the 1997 Kasparov–Deep Blue match, still seen as the turning point in the history of chess, when computers became too strong for humans. (It actually took a bit longer before computers became truly invincible.) In the following decades, Magnus Carlsen drew the most attention, mixing his remarkable dominance on the chessboard with being an avid sports fan, a fashion model, and even a character in The Simpsons and Norway’s Donald Duck comics magazine. It was, however, another young lady who created the third big peak in global chess popularity. This was Beth Harmon, the main character of the Netflix series The Queen’s Gambit, first aired in October 2020, based on the novel by Walter Tevis from 1983. As I write, Chess.com has experienced growth twice as fast as during the period of The Queen’s Gambit—suggesting that chess has never been more popular than it is in 2024. Today there doesn’t seem to be one clear reason for the rise in popularity, but multiple to point at. Maybe it wasn’t hype this time, and chess has finally become a mainstream activity. I want to believe so. Chess has seen a remarkable transformation in the past few decades, mostly influenced by the computer and the internet. Today, chess amateurs and grandmasters alike can’t imagine a world without the computer to analyze their decisions, prepare for their games, or play online. At the same time, the internet has attracted more new fans to the game than ever, and chess has become a popular esport. Chess.com’s channel was the most-watched English-language Twitch channel in 2023 (and fifth channel overall) with over 11 million hours watched. It adds a whole new dimension to the ancient board game and is nothing less than a digital revolution—a story that deserves to be told. It is said that no sport has more books written about it than chess. However, the vast majority are intended for a chess-savvy audience that already knows what 1.d4 f5 is called (the Dutch, an opening I’ve never played myself!) or who Wilhelm Steinitz is (the first official world champion). What is missing is a book serving the contingent of new chess fans who’ve encountered the game as Netflix watchers or YouTube subscribers and are in desperate need of a good introduction to this sport and the world behind it. A book that incorporates many of the (in)famous stories and anecdotes, demonstrates chess’s inextricable links with Western culture, talks about its biggest heroes, and describes the incredible history of changes chess has gone through to arrive where it is today. I hope I have written that book. Insiders of the chess world might recognize many of the stories and anecdotes, but there’s still plenty for them to discover, too. And, since the last book that attempted to cover the full history of chess was published in 1985, perhaps this one can bridge the gap with the modern era, collating chess’s past, present, and future in one place, and charting its relationship with culture and technology. That chess is an art, a science, and a sport is a well-known saying. It is also something of a cliché and rather limited. Behind this seemingly simple board game with 64 squares and 32 pieces, there are direct connections to many more areas of life, as well as an incredible history full of fascinating stories and brilliant personalities. Readers who are new to chess and hold this book in their hands have a unique world to discover that is both fascinating and inspiring. You cannot imagine!",

      "content": "Chapter 11,500 Years of Magic: A History of Chess in Popular Culture “Chess was practically the only game known in which there was any real mental exercise possible. It was also recognized as symbolic of warfare, while the pieces could be made emblematic of the various elements of the society.” —H. J. R. Murray, A History of Chess, 1913 On November 19, 2022, a picture on Instagram quickly became one of the most-liked posts ever. It was the day before the opening of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and the leading fashion house Louis Vuitton shared a photo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess. Accompanied by the text “Victory is a State of Mind,” the photo was shot by the legendary celebrity portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz and posted on Messi’s, Ronaldo’s, and Louis Vuitton’s Instagram channels. The image, which gathered more than 84 million likes, showed the two soccer stars using a Louis Vuitton checkered suitcase as a chessboard. Two years after the release of The Queen’s Gambit, chess witnessed a new outing in popular culture that might have reached even more people than the incredibly successful Netflix series. Incidentally, the picture—which was shot at different moments in time, with Messi and Ronaldo not actually in the studio together—used an actual chess position taken from a real game. The coach of world number one Magnus Carlsen, the Dane Peter Heine Nielsen, tweeted that the position came from a game between Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the two biggest stars in chess, played in Norway in 2017 (see annotated game on pages 397–98). Carlsen retweeted Nielsen’s tweet with the witty line: “Second greatest rivalry of our time mimicking the greatest.” Messi and Ronaldo playing checkers or cards would have been far less likely. And it wouldn’t have worked. The visual possibilities, symbolism, tradition, and complexity of chess give it power. Chess has fascinated emperors, kings, maharajas, shahs, czars, generals, and presidents. It has inspired painters, poets, playwrights, novelists, directors, screenwriters, athletes, and politicians. The magic of chess has enthralled us for 1,500 years. The Origins of Chess Once upon a time, a bright queen in India named Jūshīr faced a rebellion. She sent one of her sons to fight back, but a rebel killed him, distressing the people of her kingdom. Fearing to tell her the news, they gathered before one of their wise men, Qaflān, and told him what had happened. He said, “Give me three days,” and went away to think. Then Qaflān told one of his pupils, “Bring me a carpenter and wood of two different colors, white and black.” The carpenter created chess pieces, instructed by Qaflān, who then said, “Bring me tanned leather.” A chessboard with 64 squares was made, and Qaflān started playing the game with one of his pupils until they understood it and became proficient in it. He told his pupil, “This is a war without loss of lives.” The kingdom’s people realized they were witnessing a piece of wisdom no one else could have arrived at. When Queen Jūshīr heard about the game, she summoned Qaflān to show it to her. He arrived at her palace with his pupil, and the two started playing chess. One defeated the other and said, “Checkmate!” Understanding what he meant, the queen asked Qaflān, “Has my son been killed?” “You have said it,” he replied. She told her chamberlain, “Let the people in, that they may offer me condolence.” She then turned to Qaflān and said to him, “Ask for whatever you need.” His reply will probably ring a bell for many readers. “Your Majesty, I do not seek great wealth or power. Instead, I ask for a simple reward: I request just one grain of wheat for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, eight grains for the fourth square, and so on.” The queen initially laughed off the request as a meager prize for his brilliant game, and readily agreed. However, her advisers soon pointed out the astonishing consequences of Qaflān’s request. The chessboard has 64 squares, and because the number of wheat grains doubles for each square, the total amount of wheat required would be 264-1, an amount not available in the entire world. (A recent calculation suggests it is over 1,600 times the global wheat production.) The legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, which still serves in mathematical education as a cautionary tale about the power of exponential growth, exists in several forms. One involves rice grains and the Indian god Krishna, while the most famous version of the story has the Brahmin mathematician Sissa inventing chess to teach his king a lesson in humility. Just like in the game, his fate is connected to the weakest of his subjects, and, as the king, he is the most powerful entity but still needs all the other pieces for his protection. The version I chose above is the oldest one, “dating back to pre-Muhammadan days,” according to H. J. R. Murray, a renowned and incredibly erudite chess historian who published his monumental A History of Chess in 1913. The legend was told by Ibn Wāḍiḥ al-Ya ‘qūbī, a Muslim imperial official and polymath of the ninth century whose works represent some of the earliest historical and geographical writings to survive in Arabic literature. Interestingly, al-Ya ֜qūbī refers to a queen (Jūshīr) instead of a king, and his story suggests that chess was already used as a metaphor the moment it was invented. From its infancy, chess was larger than chess. Whether it’s a true story is not a serious question. One thing most chess historians agree on is that the game originates in India. It originally sprung out of another board game called chaturanga, first appearing in the Gupta Empire around the sixth century CE. Xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), shogi (Japanese chess), sittuyin (Burmese chess) and makruk (Thai chess) are all believed to share chaturanga as a common ancestor. The Sanskrit word chaturanga means “having four limbs/parts”—from chatur, meaning “four,” and anga, meaning “parts”—and refers to the four divisions of an army: elephantry, chariotry, cavalry, and infantry. The game was played on an eight-by-eight board with 64 squares—note that these were all one color. The types of pieces were similar to chess: there was a king, a ferz (a counselor to the king), a chariot (rook), an elephant (an early form of a bishop), a horse (knight), and a foot soldier (pawn). We are clearly dealing with a board game that mimics the fight between two old-Indian armies. (Note that, a millennium later, some languages still use the same words for certain pieces. For example, a bishop in Russian is cлон, meaning “elephant.”) Chess spread to Asia and Persia (current-day Iran), likely in the sixth century, too. How that happened involves another legend pointing to India as the game’s birthplace. It was told in the Shahnama (Book of Kings), composed by the Persian poet Ferdowsi and completed around the year 1010. Bozorgmehr (bottom row, second from left), minister to sixth-century Persian king Khosrow I, plays chess with an Indian envoy, as depicted in a c. 1330–40 folio from Ferdowsi’s Shahnama (Book of Kings). One day, a richly equipped mission of envoys from the Raja of India arrived at the court of King Khosrow of Anushirvan, the Sāsānian king who ruled Persia from 531 to 579. Among the many treasures they brought was a beautiful, checkered board. A message written on silk described the board and the type of pieces that belonged to it, and noted that if anyone could detect how this game ought to be played, the Raja would happily pay the requested taxes. After a day and night of studying, Khosrow’s minister Bozorgmehr gave a complete description of the rules of chess, to the horror of the Indian envoys. To make matters worse, he went on to invent the game of nard (an early form of backgammon) and sent back a similar challenge to the Indian king—one his advisors failed to solve. 2–0 to the Persians. After the Muslim conquest of Persia in the middle of the seventh century, the Arabs got acquainted with chess, which the Persians had called chatrang and which they changed to shatranj. Chess grew in popularity and spread throughout the Arab-Islamic world. By the ninth or tenth century, chess was widely known in the Arab world, from India all the way to Spain. The first books about chess were written, containing more legends, poems, and expressions. One example described drunkenness: “He came following the path of a rook but left following the path of a knight.” The rich Arab chess literature further described links with mathematics, logical thinking, and even eroticism, while including chess instruction. Also, the manṣūbūt were introduced: chess puzzles from endgame positions with well-defined tasks, such as finding a forced checkmate in a few moves. A famous one is the Dilaram problem (given on page 381), supposedly coming from a chess game played by a nobleman named Murwardi. In financial dire straits, he had wagered his beautiful wife Dilaram on a game and ended up winning it thanks to her. When the position of the puzzle arose, she was the one who found the solution, saying to her husband, “Sacrifice your two rooks, and not me.” Chess in the Middle Ages Arab players brought chess to Europe through the Iberian Peninsula and the Byzantine Empire, probably during the tenth century. It also spread to Northern Europe, often following the routes of victorious armies. When the Normans conquered England, chess came with them. One of the earliest references to European chess is a famous letter from 1061 by Cardinal Bishop Petrus Damiani to the Pope-elect Alexander II and the Archdeacon Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII). In the letter, Damiani suggested that some clergy members had sinned by participating in certain leisure activities, including chess. The bishop of Florence defended himself by pointing out that, unlike other games which involved luck, chess was a game of skill. Until the mid-thirteenth century, the Church regularly prohibited playing chess (thus also demonstrating its popularity) as it did not clearly distinguish between chess and dice games. That is more understandable if you realize that, in those years, chess was often played with dice, with the numbers indicating which piece had to be played. But at some point, the Church’s stance changed. Murray wrote: “By 1250, the early prejudice of the Church against chess had begun to weaken in view of the royal and noble patronage of the game, and the monastic orders were freely accepting chess as a welcome alleviation of the monotony of convent life, while a knowledge of chess had spread downwards from the inmates of castle and monastery to the wealthier burgesses and merchants of the towns.” In other words, attempts to eradicate the game failed miserably, as chess simply could not be stopped. Chess became a regular feature of European nobility and courtly life in the course of just two centuries. Kings, priests, knights, and other members of the feudal nobility liked to play. In his influential work Disciplina Clericalis from the twelfth century, the Spanish physician, astronomer, and writer Peter Alfonsi listed it among the seven skills a good knight must acquire: riding, swimming, archery, boxing, hawking, verse writing, and chess. The game’s fame grew fast, as is shown by the hundreds of allusions to chess in literature from the thirteenth century onward. I quote Murray again: “During the latter part of the Middle Ages, and especially from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, chess attained to a popularity in Western Europe which has never been excelled, and probably never equalled, at any later date.” Well, the book you are reading has something to say about that last claim … A historically essential work is the Libro de los Juegos (Book of Games), commissioned by King Alfonso X of Castile and Léon in 1283. This stunningly beautiful manuscript, kept in the El Escorial monastery library close to Madrid, includes 97 leaves of parchment, many with beautiful color illustrations, and more than a hundred chess puzzles for the reader to solve, mostly taken from earlier Arabic sources (including the Dilaram problem). The puzzles are consistently shown on a chessboard in the middle of the illustration, with both male and female players to the left and right looking at the board. This important book deals with chess and notes, “Since chess is the noblest game, which requires the most skill compared to all the other games, we are going to talk about it first of all.” Chess quickly emerged as the most popular game due to its complexity and resemblance to medieval culture. Two men play chess in this illustration from the historic Spanish illuminated manuscript Libro de los juegos (Book of Games), or Libro de axedrez, dados, e tablas (Book of Chess, Dice, and Tables), 1283. A name change for some pieces helped chess become even more popular. Where chaturanga’s king had the Arabic ferz alongside him, Western chess replaced this piece with a queen. Other pieces were Westernized too: the horse became a knight, the chariot became a castle (or rook), and the elephant became a bishop. We now had pieces seemingly designed to match European social roles. The Birth of Modern Chess As chess spread from India toward Persia, the Arab empire, and into medieval Europe, the way it was played remained essentially the same. Some minor changes occurred, such as coloring the 64 squares to create a checkered board. Also, pawns were allowed to advance two squares instead of one on the first move, to speed up the game. Multiple versions of the game were played in different territories, even within Europe, with specific rules often varying from area to area. But then, around the end of the fifteenth century, chess underwent significant changes and reached a more or less unified form played all over the continent—the way we play it today. Two changes involved the movements of the bishop and the king. Instead of jumping diagonally exactly two squares only, the bishop could now move without jumping to any square on a diagonal. The king was allowed to run to safety by making a joint movement with one of the rooks, known as “castling.” A genuinely groundbreaking change, however, involved the queen. Like the Arabic ferz, hitherto the queen could only move one diagonal square at a time, making her the weakest piece on the board. Yet, by the turn of the fifteenth century, she could move as far as she wanted, following straight lines and diagonals. In what is generally called “modern chess,” she had become more potent than any other piece on the board. How this happened remains a bit of a mystery. One theory, now refuted, is that the newly empowered chess queen had been inspired by Joan of Arc, the peasant girl who claimed to have received divine visions while helping France defeat England at Orleans in 1429 during the Hundred Years’ War. Most chess historians, however, agree that the change for the chess queen was more than likely inspired by the new powers of an actual queen: Queen Isabella I, who reigned over Castile (part of present-day Spain) from 1474 until she died in 1504. Fittingly, she was considered more powerful than her husband, Ferdinand II, the King of Aragon. The first recorded tournament, probably played with the new rules, took place in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1467. Chess was played in many German cities in the late Middle Ages, and Heidelberg already had a chess club. Sponsored by Frederick I, Count Palatine of the Rhine, the conditions included accommodation and prizes for the winners. Chess had a sport element to it, like poetry and fencing had in those days. The new rules made the game faster, more complex, and rather tricky. Still, the popularity of chess hardly declined in the coming centuries, according to the historian Richard Eales in his 1985 book Chess: The History of a Game: “If the technical chess literature preserved in late medieval manuscripts and printed books compared with that in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscripts and printed books, or if the casual references to the game in wills, inventories, letters, and general literature are contrasted for the two periods, there is nothing to suggest a measurable decline in its popularity.” Part of this is explained by the fact that the social status of chess hardly changed either. It remained a respected pursuit among the upper classes (while also widely known among the lower classes), held in high esteem, not in the least due to its ancient history and many interpretations and analogies, which we’ll dive into somewhat deeper in the next chapter. An Increased Market Size By the eighteenth century, chess was in competition with various card games, especially the trendy game of whist. Still, the number of individuals playing chess kept growing. As Eales explained, there was a general increase in prosperity, giving more people the time and money to spend on leisure activities. In economic terms, the market size was increasing. Choosing to play chess became a matter of taste, which started a new phase for the game and how it was treated. Chess started to have a broader appeal than ever before and began to see more organized forms. For instance, it was increasingly becoming a pastime enjoyed at coffeehouses. In London, you had the Old Slaughter’s Coffee House in St. Martin’s Lane, which opened in 1692 and was visited by architects, painters, poets, and politicians. Even more famous was the Café de la Régence in Paris. Opened in 1681, the café welcomed a wide variety of intellectuals and many famous chess masters, including the best player of his time, François-André Danican Philidor (1726–95). In the Régence, Philidor met Voltaire and Robespierre and played chess with Rousseau. Coffeehouse chess soon led to the founding of the first “gentlemen’s” chess clubs in London and Paris in the late eighteenth century. They started to blossom in the early nineteenth century, and clubs soon opened in countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States. While chess was growing at this point, it also became a men’s game. Women rarely attended the coffeehouses and were often not allowed into the chess clubs. Additionally, chess was increasingly becoming a serious leisure activity (some even started considering it a sport), further stimulating the discrimination toward women in chess. Industrial society no doubt played a role here as well. While men shifted from doing paid work in the household to the factory, women remained in the private sphere. The two sexes lived more separate lives, and the women weren’t allowed much time for leisure activities at home. The first half of the nineteenth century also saw the organization of the first major chess events, adding to the game’s prestige. The biggest masters often played matches against each other (series of multiple games between two opponents), such as those between Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais of France and Alexander McDonnell of Ireland, or England’s Howard Staunton versus Frenchman Pierre de Saint-Amant—battles that were published widely and closely followed by chess fans all over Europe. Staunton was also the main organizer behind the first major international chess tournament in London in 1851. The increased interest in chess was reflected in the growing number of published chess-related books and the very first newspaper column (in the Liverpool Mercury in 1813) and magazine (Le Palamède, in 1836). Also, early attempts were made to systematically cover what was known about chess openings, in surveys such as Aaron Alexandre’s Encyclopedia of Chess from 1837. Chess tournaments started being held regularly in many countries, especially England and Germany. At the same time, the game generally became more organized and regulated as official federations were founded, in the same spirit as sports like soccer, track and field, and cricket. The first official World Chess Championship was held in various cities in the United States in 1886, when Wilhelm Steinitz beat Johannes Zukertort to earn the first World Chess Champion title. This particular championship started a long and wonderful tradition that continues today: a growing list of legendary world championship matches, two-player battles for the highest throne and eternal glory. The Fischer–Spassky match in 1972, with the Cold War as the backdrop, is the most famous. Every serious student of the game knows that the tradition goes back much further, and they can name all the world champions (and maybe even in the right order). I give them below followed by the years when they held the title: Wilhelm Steinitz (1886–94) Emanuel Lasker (1894–1921) José Raúl Capablanca (1921–27) Alexander Alekhine (1927–35, 1937–†1946) Max Euwe (1935–37) Mikhail Botvinnik (1948–57, 1958–60, 1961–63) Vasily Smyslov (1957–58) Mikhail Tal (1960–61) Tigran Petrosian (1963–69) Boris Spassky (1969–72) Bobby Fischer (1972–75) Anatoly Karpov (1975–85) Garry Kasparov (1985–2000) Vladimir Kramnik (2000–2007) Viswanathan Anand (2007–13) Magnus Carlsen (2013–23) Ding Liren (2023–) (Note that Alekhine died as world champion in 1946, after which Botvinnik took over the title in 1948 by winning a world championship tournament. Also note, this list doesn’t mention the FIDE world champions Alexander Khalifman, Ruslan Ponomariov, Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and Veselin Topalov, who won their titles between 1999 and 2005 during a messy situation in the chess world, described in Chapter 4.) Alongside the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, the French Chess Federation held an international team chess tournament, with 54 players from 18 countries. On July 20, the day of the last round, 15 participants founded the International Chess Federation under the French acronym Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE). It started to organize official Chess Olympiads modeled on the Olympic Games and, from 1948 onward, became the official body responsible for those world championships, with a separate category for women. The female champions are: Vera Menchik (1927–†1944) Lyudmila Rudenko (1950–53) Elisaveta Bykova (1953–56, 1958–62) Olga Rubtsova (1956–58) Nona Gaprindashvili (1962–78) Maia Chiburdanidze (1978–91) Xie Jun (1991–96, 1999–2001) Susan Polgar (1996–99) Zhu Chen (2001–4) Antoaneta Stefanova (2004–6) Xu Yuhua (2006–8) Alexandra Kosteniuk (2008–10) Hou Yifan (2010–12, 2013–15, 2016–17) Anna Ushenina (2012–13) Mariya Muzychuk (2015–16) Tan Zhongyi (2017–18) Ju Wenjun (2018–) (Note: Menchik died as world champion in 1944, after which Rudenko took over the title in 1950 by winning a world championship tournament.) All these players always brought a special aura whenever they entered a playing hall: a world champion has entered the building. They are the chess equivalent of the ancient residents of Mount Olympus, and it’s only natural that you’ll find many of their names throughout this book. Chess Is Everywhere Phoebe and Joey are playing a fast game of chess. As they move their pieces with one hand, they bang a chess clock with the other. It quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea what they’re doing. Joey says, “We should really learn how to play the real way.” Phoebe answers, “I like our way. Look!” She moves a piece, jumping over several of Joey’s as if they were playing checkers. She removes one of the enemy pieces and shouts triumphantly, “Chess!” Joey looks impressed and says, “Nice move!” Friends aired on NBC between 1994 and 2004 but, two decades later, the series is still watched worldwide via reruns and streaming services. In what is one of the most popular comedy shows of all time, chess made multiple appearances, most prominently in episode 20 of season eight, “The One With Rachel’s Big Kiss.” A deep analysis isn’t necessary to understand that chess was portrayed as a complicated game, while Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly known for their intellectual skills. Jerry Seinfeld, however, the titular character of that other enormously popular nineties sitcom, Seinfeld, was fairly smart. In episode nine of season three, titled “The Nose Job,” he describes a woman he started to date: “Isabel, she is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It’s like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game.” At the end of the episode, we see an actual chess game between two Jerry Seinfelds (through some special effects), one acting as his penis and one as his brain. The latter wins as the former laments a lack of energy. In the same series, Seinfeld’s friend George Costanza is, well, the less clever guy. At the start of “The Engagement,” the first episode of season seven, George plays chess with his current girlfriend, Alice. The opening scene focuses on the chessboard. George makes a move with the black pieces, sits back rather happy with himself, and says, “Well, you got no place to go. I’ll tell you what your problem is: you brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She’s one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? Nah, the queen is old-fashioned, likes to stay home, cook, take care of a man, makes sure he feels good.” With a stern look, Alice moves a piece and says, “Checkmate.” George studies the position closely and says, “I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” From The Big Bang Theory and Frasier to Cheers and The Simpsons, chess scenes appear in many popular shows—in fact, there’s a special cameo appearance in the latter’s season 28 by none other than Magnus Carlsen. It’s almost impossible to watch a TV series these days and not come across chess at some point. It happens so frequently that in my household, we have developed the habit of saying “No escape!” when we’re sitting on the couch and spot a reference to chess. My friend and Chess.com colleague Mike Klein told me a relatable experience: “Around 2008, I wanted to write an exhaustive story for the American magazine Chess Life about chess references in pop culture—movies, songs, advertisements, and the like. But I soon realized that there were far, far too many to write anything at magazine length. So I changed courses. I decided I would chronicle, for one year, all the pop-culture chess references that came to me organically. When watching TV and a chessboard appeared in a commercial, I would break out a pad and paper and jot it down. I gave up after about four weeks. Even when not seeking out the game, it found me far too often, and the many references inundated me.” One very binge-watchable Netflix show from 2020 was different because chess played a major role in every episode. It treated the game of kings most wonderfully and caused an incredible surge in the popularity of chess, this time also among girls and women. You probably already know what I am talking about. The Queen’s Gambit The Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit premiered on October 23, 2020. It helped that it was broadcast right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, but, just four weeks later, 62 million households had watched the show, which reached the top ten in 92 countries and occupied the number-one position in 63 of them. It took less than a month to become Netflix’s most-watched scripted limited series. Walter Tevis’s novel from 1983, on which the show was based, entered the New York Times bestseller list 37 years after its release. The Google search “how to play chess” hit a nine-year peak. Sales of chessboards and pieces rose by more than 1,000 percent and memberships on Chess.com went through the roof. The show created an incredible chess boom. In that sense, the series was the most influential use of chess in popular culture ever, at least in how it boosted the sport. Named after a popular chess opening, the miniseries follows the life of Beth Harmon (played as a young girl by Isla Johnston and as an adult by Anya Taylor-Joy), who discovers a prodigious talent for chess at a young age. Raised in an orphanage, she develops a tranquilizer addiction and hones her chess skills through dedicated practice. As she grows up, Beth enters the competitive world of chess, facing challenges and triumphs while battling her personal demons. That’s all very fascinating but, still, why the huge success? Anya Taylor-Joy as fictional chess prodigy Beth Harmon in a promotional still from the highly successful Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit, 2020. The answer might be that the show is not so much about chess, after all. When I interviewed the screenwriter Scott Frank for Chess.com in October 2020, he told me, “It’s about a child growing up, interrupted by this brilliant talent that she has. It’s very difficult to have a normal life if you have an extra-normal ability in almost any area, so this story is much more about her demons than it is about her obsession with chess. In fact, there’s nothing you need to know about chess.” Frank, who happens to be a Chess.com member and regularly plays on the site, made sure that the Beth Harmon character wouldn’t be another cliché of the troubled mind. He was helped by a famous chess player. “Garry Kasparov and I had many talks about this, and I didn’t wanna just hammer that. It’s mostly about genius in general and how it takes a cost on you. The thing about Beth Harmon is that she’s both the protagonist and antagonist in her own story.” Sir Tim Rice, the lyricist behind musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita and Disney productions Aladdin and The Lion King—and, with ABBA, Chess (see page 62)—told me about the series in a video call in May 2023: “It made clear that people who play chess are not all weirdos or automatons; they’re human beings.” Personally, I think The Queen’s Gambit is great because all the important individual aspects are great. The story is compelling: it combines a character-driven narrative with high-stakes chess games that create a sense of tension and intrigue. (Walter Tevis’s stories tended to do well on the big screen; he also wrote The Hustler, The Color of Money, and The Man Who Fell to Earth, all made into movies.) Apart from being a refreshing choice as a female star in a male-dominated subdomain, the main character is also a complex and relatable protagonist played wonderfully by Taylor-Joy. Furthermore, the excellent cinematic presentation of the actual chess games, the series’ detailed 1960s setting and the beautiful costumes (including lots of chess-themed clothes worn by the main character) contributed to the visual appeal. The Queen’s Gambit won many prizes, including a Golden Globe for limited series and a Golden Globe for Taylor-Joy, who beat Cate Blanchett (Mrs. America) and Nicole Kidman (The Undoing) in 2021. Among other prizes, she won Best Female Actor in the TV Movie or Limited Series category at the 27th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. Taylor-Joy even joined the chess boom herself. When asked, after winning her Golden Globe, if she had had enough chess for a lifetime, she replied, “Oh goodness, I could never say that. I love chess! I’ve had to pick up new skills for the movies that I’ve been doing, so I’m looking forward to having some time off so I can get back to chess.” Chess and Politics Alfonso X, Pope Leo XIII, Ivan the Terrible, King Edward I, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Napoleon, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Ernesto “Che” Guevara, Fidel Castro, Jimmy Carter—all of them enjoyed a game of chess. Yes, I am jumping to the world of politics, an area where the omnipresence of chess is strongly felt. Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was also one of the first politicians to write about chess. In his short essay from 1786 titled “The Morals of Chess,” he noted that chess is more than idle amusement: “Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions.” In one instance, Franklin used chess as an excuse for his political ploys. In December 1774—the period of rebellion by British colonial separatist leaders that would soon spark the American Revolution—he met several times with Caroline Howe, the sister of Admiral Richard Howe and General William Howe. The two brothers would later become commanders of the British naval and land forces during the American Revolutionary War, but they were both still somewhat sympathetic to the American cause at the time. Franklin played chess with Mrs. Howe, but these meetings were also an opportunity for him to meet with her brother Richard and discuss possible ways of reconciling the Continental Congress and the Thirteen Colonies. Franklin was a fanatic, but in politics Che Guevara was the biggest chess lover of them all. As a young boy, his father took him to the Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires in 1939, where Che saw the great José Raúl Capablanca, got interested in Cuba, and caught the chess fever. Later, he would call chess “mi segunda novia” (my second girlfriend). Che and Fidel Castro played chess to kill time while detained in Mexico, and, after the revolution, in his role as industry minister, Che began promoting chess. He ensured Cuba was represented at the 1960 Leipzig Chess Olympiad and launched a local team tournament. This 1853 engraving depicts Benjamin Franklin playing chess with Caroline Howe in December 1774. He had arranged several games as cover for peace talks with her brothers, Admiral Richard Howe (shown at center) and General William Howe. Che’s most significant chess legacy was establishing the annual Capablanca Memorial tournament in Havana, which still runs today. In the early years, many strong Soviet and European grandmasters participated as the prize fund was higher than at many tournaments elsewhere. I guess it helped that Che was both industry minister and director of the National Bank. He and Castro were daily visitors at the inaugural tournament in 1962 in the Habana Libre Hotel, and both participated in simultaneous exhibitions against visiting grandmasters, known as a simul. (In this old tradition, a strong player plays multiple amateur opponents simultaneously. As the expert walks around the boards, the opponent should make their move each time the expert arrives at their board.) Che had a lasting influence on chess in Cuba. For decades, it was the strongest Latin American country in chess, only recently surpassed by Brazil and Peru. When I visited Cuba in February 2016, the love for chess was still recognizable. I was surprised to see one of the leading chess clubs, the Academia de Ajedrez, located in the heart of Santiago de Cuba, in a building right next to the cathedral and Parque Céspedes. And, of course, I played against some of the many street players, facing stiff opposition. An old saying goes that every taxi driver in Russia is a strong player. I think in Cuba, every driver of a vintage classic car knows how to play chess. One of the 1965 Capablanca Memorial tournament participants was 22-year-old Bobby Fischer. The future world champion, however, played without traveling to Cuba. Due to the strained diplomatic relations with the United States, Fischer was not allowed to go there, but the organizers found a solution. Instead, he played from the Marshall Chess Club in New York, his moves transmitted to Havana by telex. Both Fischer and his opponents in Cuba were sitting across from empty chairs, receiving the countermoves from the arbiters. When Castro reportedly called the remarkable construction a “propaganda victory for Cuba,” Fischer sent a telegram demanding the Cuban leader stop using him for political purposes. In his reply, Castro denied he ever made the statement and questioned Fischer’s courage, after which Fischer decided to avoid further turmoil and just play the tournament. After Fischer qualified for the 1972 World Chess Champion-ship, President Richard Nixon wrote a letter saying the country was behind him. However, the match almost didn’t happen. A stubborn Fischer did not accept the initial conditions nor the location (Reykjavík, Iceland) and continued to protest, mainly about the financial arrangements. During the opening ceremony on Saturday, July 1, the front row had one empty seat as Fischer hadn’t arrived in Reykjavík yet. One thing that convinced Fischer to play was when James Slater, a successful British investment banker and chess lover, donated $125,000 to double the prize fund to $250,000. The other thing was an infamous phone call. Twenty-two-year-old Bobby Fischer playing in the Capablanca Memorial chess tournament in Cuba via telex at the Marshall Chess Club in New York, 1965. When Fischer picked up the phone on Monday, July 3, it was none other than Henry Kissinger on the line, Nixon’s national security advisor and future secretary of state. Kissinger’s opening sentence is usually cited as, “This is the worst chess player in the world calling the best chess player in the world.” Kissinger made the point that the match was necessary for the prestige of the United States, and that Fischer should go and play. That evening, Fischer finally boarded a plane to Reykjavík. In his 2011 book On China, Kissinger returned to the game of chess as he explained the differences between Western and Chinese political strategies by comparing them to chess and wéiqí (Go). Invented in China about 2,500 years ago, Go is older than chess and even more complex. Played on a 19×19 grid, players have 180 stones each and take turns to put them on one of the grid’s 361 intersections. After being so placed, stones do not move but can be captured when surrounded by the opponent’s stones. Kissinger noted: “If chess is about the decisive battle, wéiqí is about the protracted campaign. The chess player aims for total victory. The wéiqí player seeks relative advantage. In chess, the player always has the capability of the adversary in front of him; all the pieces are always fully deployed. The wéiqí player needs to assess not only the pieces on the board but the reinforcements the adversary is in a position to deploy.” The location of the Fischer–Spassky duel lay, not insignificantly, right between the US and the Soviet Union. It was the height of the Cold War, and the match could easily be seen as a symbolic fight between the capitalistic West and the Communist East, a point that wasn’t missed by the media. In hindsight, we should take all this with a grain of salt. Spassky wasn’t a strong Soviet patriot like some of his colleagues, while Fischer’s erratic and sometimes plain unpleasant behavior didn’t make him the perfect representative for his country either. Besides, at the highest diplomatic levels, the US and the USSR weren’t exactly rubbing hands for a military clash—perhaps for them, the match was a better, more peaceful way to fight it out, as the wise Qaflān had suggested in ancient India. Politics is the area that supplied several chess expressions to our language. The most common include: keeping an enemy “in check”; a minor entity being described as a mere “pawn” in a larger game; and a political “stalemate.” But there’s more. Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said before the first Republican presidential candidate debate in 2016: “The best politicians play chess, but most candidates play checkers. The chess players know you have to be willing to lose a piece or two to win the game … but if Jeb Bush wants to survive the ‘Trumpnado’ and become the nominee he needs to be, he should play a little chess, get out of Iowa, and get to New Hampshire as soon as possible.” There are numerous further examples, but I particularly like the following by former state counselor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, shortly after her National League for Democracy party won the 2015 elections: “If you look at the democratic process as a game of chess, there have to be many, many moves before you get to checkmate. And simply because you do not make any checkmate in three moves does not mean it’s stalemate. There’s a vast difference between no checkmate and stalemate. This is what the democratic process is.” One politician who shouldn’t be named in the same sentence as chess—at least as far as Garry Kasparov is concerned—is Vladimir Putin. Retired as a chess player since 2005, Kasparov is a fierce opponent of the Russian leader, and in an interview with Der Spiegel in 2015, he proclaimed, “Putin is more of a poker player. In poker, unlike chess, you can effectively compensate for a very weak hand by bluffing. There are fixed rules in chess, and no one knows how the game will end. Things are currently the other way around in Putin’s realm.” Russian politics have been deeply intertwined with chess for a long time. It should be noted that chess was already quite popular in the big Russian empire (that included parts of current-day Poland and the Baltic countries), where big names like Mikhail Chigorin, Alexander Alekhine, Aron Nimzowitsch, and Akiba Rubinstein were from. After the revolution in 1917, the game developed into a means of propaganda for the Bolsheviks, whose leaders Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Nikolai Krylenko were all chess players. Luxurious tournaments were held in Moscow in 1935 and 1936 to show the world that in Russia, grandmasters were treated as kings. When the USSR beat the US with a big margin in a radio match in 1945, Stalin congratulated his team. The Soviet state strongly supported chess education in order to create the best players in the world, thereby demonstrating the intelligence and sophistication of the Soviet people. Between 1995 and 2018, FIDE was led by the eccentric Russian oligarch Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who was also president of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Russian Federation from 1993 to 2010. The chess world mostly remembers him for his friendly ties with dubious leaders like Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, and Bashar al-Assad; his claim to have been abducted by aliens; and his administration’s alleged involvement in the murder of a journalist in 1998, although there was no proof of his involvement. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former deputy prime minister and a former assistant to the president of the Russian Federation, succeeded Ilyumzhinov in 2018. Especially in the eyes of Western chess federations, Dvorkovich’s presidency became problematic when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Dvorkovich was nonetheless re-elected in August 2022 for a second term. In December 2023, FIDE voted to remove the two-term limit for its presidency, a “good-governance” measure Dvorkovich himself had introduced after announcing it during his 2018 campaign. After this remarkable 180-degree turn, the strong Russian (Kremlin?) influence on the chess world is not expected to end soon. Chess and Sports In a promo video produced by Puma in December 2023, Magnus Carlsen and soccer manager Pep Guardiola talked about the similarities between chess and soccer. Carlsen noted the games are comparable, saying: “I think both in chess and soccer, the important thing is to control the middle, so that’s one thing. If you control the middle, you control the pitch or the board. Another thing is that often in chess you attack on one side, force the opponent to overload, and then you switch, and you have an advantage on the other side in terms of space. It’s remarkably similar.” Guardiola shares an interest in chess with fellow managers Quique Setién and Felix Magath and players past and present including Edgar Davids, Fernando Torres, Christian Pulisic, and Mo Salah. Fans of chess from other sports include Steve Davis (snooker), Boris Becker, Daniil Medvedev, Andrey Rublev, Carlos Alcaraz (tennis), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Klay Thompson (basketball), Charles Leclerc, Carlos Sainz, Mick Schumacher (Formula 1), John Urschel, Chidobe Awuzie (football) and Ravichandran Ashwin (cricket). Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the sport with possibly the largest number of chess enthusiasts is said to resemble chess the most: boxing. Three-time heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is a chess fan and taught his corner team to play. The Ukrainian brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, who share 40 world heavyweight title fight wins between them, love to play chess as well, which is also the case for Manny Pacquiao, Anthony Joshua, and the MMA fighters Conor McGregor and Aljamain Sterling. Like his colleagues, Lewis said he used chess to “stay mentally sharp,” for example, when he was preparing for the 2003 “Battle of the Titans” with Vitali Klitschko, who commented before the match, “First I beat Lewis on the chessboard, and then we meet in the ring.” In the end, it was Lewis who won by technical knockout. Speaking of which, did you know that chessboxing is a thing? People have played chess while hanging on a parachute or while bathing in a lake of freezing cold water, so putting a chessboard and pieces inside a boxing ring perhaps isn’t so crazy. After all, we’re dealing with another two-person confrontation where the anticipation of the opponent’s moves is key. It works as follows: the two contestants, reasonably trained in both disciplines, play alternating boxing and blitz-chess rounds until someone wins by either knockout or checkmate (or if the opponent’s clock time runs out). I happened to be present at the first official competition, on November 14, 2003, held by the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO) in Paradiso, Amsterdam, between Luis the Lawyer (Jean Louis Veenstra) and Iepe the Joker (Iepe Rubingh). The latter won after his opponent lost on time in a winning position. Rubingh, the main event organizer, was a Dutch conceptual artist who sadly passed away in 2020 at age 45. The history of chessboxing goes back even further: it featured in the 1979 kung fu film Mystery of Chess Boxing by Joseph Kuo (where Chinese chess, xiangqi, is played), which the band Wu-Tang Clan referred to in their 1993 song “Da Mystery of Chessboxin.’ ” On December 11, 2022, chessboxing found itself under the spotlight again when the popular YouTuber Ludwig Ahgren organized the Mogul Chessboxing Championship. Twelve of the biggest content creators on YouTube and Twitch, all with an interest in chess (more on that in Chapter 10), stepped into the ring in front of 10,000 fans inside the Galen Center in Los Angeles and 558,000 viewers online, who enjoyed commentary by Levy Rozman, chessboxing world champion Matt Thomas, and Ludwig himself. The Canadian grandmaster (GM) Aman Hambleton won the matchup among the chess experts by beating international master (IM) Lawrence Trent with a technical knockout. The highlight of the evening was the fight between two chess content creators, where Dina Belenkaya initially won, as Andrea Botez resigned the chess game. (Both were seasoned chess players who had spent months in the gym training for the boxing part.) However, fans quickly pointed out that the referee had made a mistake. Before that final chess session, Belenkaya had received four eight-second standing counts, which should have been enough for Botez to win on a technical knockout (TKO). Two days after the fight, the organizers adjusted the result, writing on social media: “After discussing with the players, we are not reversing Dina Belenkaya’s win because the fighters played it out in the moment, and she competed valiantly. However, we have decided to award Andrea a belt for her performance and to correct the decision that was made in the ring.” The British philosopher and radio documentary maker David Edmonds described the sport in BBC News Magazine as follows: “Chess and boxing seems as bizarre a pairing as anything, but they do have something in common. One is a duel often characterized by cruelty, ruthlessness, and violence. And boxing is much the same.” Chess Is Everything The oldest tools used to play board games are at least five millennia old. In his landmark 1938 book Homo Ludens, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga analyzed play as a cultural phenomenon: “For many years the conviction has grown upon me that civilization arises and unfolds in and as play.” Elsewhere, he writes that playing games is “older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing.” Chess quickly became the most popular game when it entered Western society. It was prominently depicted in medieval texts and art, and is still firmly embedded in our culture. The big question is: why chess? What is it with chess that “beat” other board games, dice, cards, etc., to become the dominant game in our society? In a conversation for this book, Sir Tim Rice summarized: “The game is in some respects a metaphor for life. You’ve got pawns who don’t have much power. You’ve got kings and queens who’ve got a lot more power. This is all very interesting, and so, obviously, it’s very easy to make those pieces a metaphor for aspects of life. And many great writers have done that.” In his 2023 documentary Through the Mirror of Chess: A Cultural Exploration, the filmmaker and author Howard Burton has suggested that the dominance of chess has to do with the complexity of the game resulting from the different pieces having different values and different movements: “Chess is special because it isn’t just the fact that it uses an array of different types of pieces that need to be coordinated with each other. It’s that each piece is constantly, ever so subtly, changing its value depending on its position with respect to all the others. And it’s precisely this highly nuanced, constantly shifting dance of individual pieces and overall positions that gives chess its unique aesthetic appeal.” My own view on chess comes closest to what Robert Desjarlais wrote in his 2011 book Counterplay: An Anthropologist at the Chessboard: “Chess play entails narrative intrigue. Undertaking a chess game trips a sense of adventure, of venturing into surprises and unanticipated situations.” Although the pieces were initially created as members of a small army, they’ve always felt more like characters in a story to me. I’ve always thought of a game of chess as a tale written by two authors who don’t know yet where things will go. This analogy perhaps works even stronger for me as a serious player who needs to write down his moves on a scoresheet (per official regulations). This means that after the story is over, it is stored forever in the human knowledge database for everyone to pick up and enjoy. For anyone who has read many chess books that discuss master games from the past, the comparison with literature comes naturally. Marcel Duchamp—a key figure in the Dada movement and one of the most influential twentieth-century artists—must have had something similar in mind when he said, in a short speech at a banquet of the New York State Association of Chess in 1952, “Actually, I believe that every chess player experiences a mixture of two aesthetic pleasures: first the abstract image akin to the poetic idea of writing; second the sensuous pleasure of the ideographic execution of that image on the chessboard.” I would like to add another aspect: the element of time. For advanced players, it is common to use a chess clock during a game, but every single move, in itself, is a fundamental element of time. When fully immersed in a complicated game, you get the sense that the longer a player thinks, the more you feel time is frozen. At such moments, you feel inside a separate world, an existence cut off from reality—the same experience as reading a book or watching a movie. This is what chess means to me, but it’s just one personal approach. Chess has meant so many different things to different people, starting from a war game for the Indians and Arabs, a symbol of social hierarchy in medieval times, an art form in itself, “the touchstone of intellect” (Goethe), a social enterprise, an organized sport, and a complex of problems that can be approached scientifically, as we will see in the third chapter. The Dutch grandmaster and author Jan Hein Donner once stated that “chess cannot be compared with anything” while “many things can be compared with chess.” I believe what he actually did was point out that there are apparent similarities between chess and many aspects of life, as long as you also acknowledge that chess is unique in itself. How else can I end this chapter than by quoting my favorite player of all time, Bobby Fischer, who said, “Chess is life.”",

It was also recognized as symbolic of warfare, while the pieces could be made emblematic of the various elements of the society.” —H. J. R. Murray, A History of Chess, 1913 On November 19, 2022, a picture on Instagram quickly became one of the most-liked posts ever. It was the day before the opening of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and the leading fashion house Louis Vuitton shared a photo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess. Accompanied by the text “Victory is a State of Mind,” the photo was shot by the legendary celebrity portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz and posted on Messi’s, Ronaldo’s, and Louis Vuitton’s Instagram channels. The image, which gathered more than 84 million likes, showed the two soccer stars using a Louis Vuitton checkered suitcase as a chessboard. Two years after the release of The Queen’s Gambit, chess witnessed a new outing in popular culture that might have reached even more people than the incredibly successful Netflix series. Incidentally, the picture—which was shot at different moments in time, with Messi and Ronaldo not actually in the studio together—used an actual chess position taken from a real game. The coach of world number one Magnus Carlsen, the Dane Peter Heine Nielsen, tweeted that the position came from a game between Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the two biggest stars in chess, played in Norway in 2017 (see annotated game on pages 397–98). Carlsen retweeted Nielsen’s tweet with the witty line: “Second greatest rivalry of our time mimicking the greatest.” Messi and Ronaldo playing checkers or cards would have been far less likely. And it wouldn’t have worked. The visual possibilities, symbolism, tradition, and complexity of chess give it power. Chess has fascinated emperors, kings, maharajas, shahs, czars, generals, and presidents. It has inspired painters, poets, playwrights, novelists, directors, screenwriters, athletes, and politicians. The magic of chess has enthralled us for 1,500 years. The Origins of Chess Once upon a time, a bright queen in India named Jūshīr faced a rebellion. She sent one of her sons to fight back, but a rebel killed him, distressing the people of her kingdom. Fearing to tell her the news, they gathered before one of their wise men, Qaflān, and told him what had happened. He said, “Give me three days,” and went away to think. Then Qaflān told one of his pupils, “Bring me a carpenter and wood of two different colors, white and black.” The carpenter created chess pieces, instructed by Qaflān, who then said, “Bring me tanned leather.” A chessboard with 64 squares was made, and Qaflān started playing the game with one of his pupils until they understood it and became proficient in it. He told his pupil, “This is a war without loss of lives.” The kingdom’s people realized they were witnessing a piece of wisdom no one else could have arrived at. When Queen Jūshīr heard about the game, she summoned Qaflān to show it to her. He arrived at her palace with his pupil, and the two started playing chess. One defeated the other and said, “Checkmate!” Understanding what he meant, the queen asked Qaflān, “Has my son been killed?” “You have said it,” he replied. She told her chamberlain, “Let the people in, that they may offer me condolence.” She then turned to Qaflān and said to him, “Ask for whatever you need.” His reply will probably ring a bell for many readers. “Your Majesty, I do not seek great wealth or power. Instead, I ask for a simple reward: I request just one grain of wheat for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, eight grains for the fourth square, and so on.” The queen initially laughed off the request as a meager prize for his brilliant game, and readily agreed. However, her advisers soon pointed out the astonishing consequences of Qaflān’s request. The chessboard has 64 squares, and because the number of wheat grains doubles for each square, the total amount of wheat required would be 264-1, an amount not available in the entire world. (A recent calculation suggests it is over 1,600 times the global wheat production.) The legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, which still serves in mathematical education as a cautionary tale about the power of exponential growth, exists in several forms. One involves rice grains and the Indian god Krishna, while the most famous version of the story has the Brahmin mathematician Sissa inventing chess to teach his king a lesson in humility. Just like in the game, his fate is connected to the weakest of his subjects, and, as the king, he is the most powerful entity but still needs all the other pieces for his protection. The version I chose above is the oldest one, “dating back to pre-Muhammadan days,” according to H. J. R. Murray, a renowned and incredibly erudite chess historian who published his monumental A History of Chess in 1913. The legend was told by Ibn Wāḍiḥ al-Ya ‘qūbī, a Muslim imperial official and polymath of the ninth century whose works represent some of the earliest historical and geographical writings to survive in Arabic literature. Interestingly, al-Ya ֜qūbī refers to a queen (Jūshīr) instead of a king, and his story suggests that chess was already used as a metaphor the moment it was invented. From its infancy, chess was larger than chess. Whether it’s a true story is not a serious question. One thing most chess historians agree on is that the game originates in India. It originally sprung out of another board game called chaturanga, first appearing in the Gupta Empire around the sixth century CE. Xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), shogi (Japanese chess), sittuyin (Burmese chess) and makruk (Thai chess) are all believed to share chaturanga as a common ancestor. The Sanskrit word chaturanga means “having four limbs/parts”—from chatur, meaning “four,” and anga, meaning “parts”—and refers to the four divisions of an army: elephantry, chariotry, cavalry, and infantry. The game was played on an eight-by-eight board with 64 squares—note that these were all one color. The types of pieces were similar to chess: there was a king, a ferz (a counselor to the king), a chariot (rook), an elephant (an early form of a bishop), a horse (knight), and a foot soldier (pawn). We are clearly dealing with a board game that mimics the fight between two old-Indian armies. (Note that, a millennium later, some languages still use the same words for certain pieces. For example, a bishop in Russian is cлон, meaning “elephant.”) Chess spread to Asia and Persia (current-day Iran), likely in the sixth century, too. How that happened involves another legend pointing to India as the game’s birthplace. It was told in the Shahnama (Book of Kings), composed by the Persian poet Ferdowsi and completed around the year 1010. Bozorgmehr (bottom row, second from left), minister to sixth-century Persian king Khosrow I, plays chess with an Indian envoy, as depicted in a c. 1330–40 folio from Ferdowsi’s Shahnama (Book of Kings). One day, a richly equipped mission of envoys from the Raja of India arrived at the court of King Khosrow of Anushirvan, the Sāsānian king who ruled Persia from 531 to 579. Among the many treasures they brought was a beautiful, checkered board. A message written on silk described the board and the type of pieces that belonged to it, and noted that if anyone could detect how this game ought to be played, the Raja would happily pay the requested taxes. After a day and night of studying, Khosrow’s minister Bozorgmehr gave a complete description of the rules of chess, to the horror of the Indian envoys. To make matters worse, he went on to invent the game of nard (an early form of backgammon) and sent back a similar challenge to the Indian king—one his advisors failed to solve. 2–0 to the Persians. After the Muslim conquest of Persia in the middle of the seventh century, the Arabs got acquainted with chess, which the Persians had called chatrang and which they changed to shatranj. Chess grew in popularity and spread throughout the Arab-Islamic world. By the ninth or tenth century, chess was widely known in the Arab world, from India all the way to Spain. The first books about chess were written, containing more legends, poems, and expressions. One example described drunkenness: “He came following the path of a rook but left following the path of a knight.” The rich Arab chess literature further described links with mathematics, logical thinking, and even eroticism, while including chess instruction. Also, the manṣūbūt were introduced: chess puzzles from endgame positions with well-defined tasks, such as finding a forced checkmate in a few moves. A famous one is the Dilaram problem (given on page 381), supposedly coming from a chess game played by a nobleman named Murwardi. In financial dire straits, he had wagered his beautiful wife Dilaram on a game and ended up winning it thanks to her. When the position of the puzzle arose, she was the one who found the solution, saying to her husband, “Sacrifice your two rooks, and not me.” Chess in the Middle Ages Arab players brought chess to Europe through the Iberian Peninsula and the Byzantine Empire, probably during the tenth century. It also spread to Northern Europe, often following the routes of victorious armies. When the Normans conquered England, chess came with them. One of the earliest references to European chess is a famous letter from 1061 by Cardinal Bishop Petrus Damiani to the Pope-elect Alexander II and the Archdeacon Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII). In the letter, Damiani suggested that some clergy members had sinned by participating in certain leisure activities, including chess. The bishop of Florence defended himself by pointing out that, unlike other games which involved luck, chess was a game of skill. Until the mid-thirteenth century, the Church regularly prohibited playing chess (thus also demonstrating its popularity) as it did not clearly distinguish between chess and dice games. That is more understandable if you realize that, in those years, chess was often played with dice, with the numbers indicating which piece had to be played. But at some point, the Church’s stance changed. Murray wrote: “By 1250, the early prejudice of the Church against chess had begun to weaken in view of the royal and noble patronage of the game, and the monastic orders were freely accepting chess as a welcome alleviation of the monotony of convent life, while a knowledge of chess had spread downwards from the inmates of castle and monastery to the wealthier burgesses and merchants of the towns.” In other words, attempts to eradicate the game failed miserably, as chess simply could not be stopped. Chess became a regular feature of European nobility and courtly life in the course of just two centuries. Kings, priests, knights, and other members of the feudal nobility liked to play. In his influential work Disciplina Clericalis from the twelfth century, the Spanish physician, astronomer, and writer Peter Alfonsi listed it among the seven skills a good knight must acquire: riding, swimming, archery, boxing, hawking, verse writing, and chess. The game’s fame grew fast, as is shown by the hundreds of allusions to chess in literature from the thirteenth century onward. I quote Murray again: “During the latter part of the Middle Ages, and especially from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, chess attained to a popularity in Western Europe which has never been excelled, and probably never equalled, at any later date.” Well, the book you are reading has something to say about that last claim … A historically essential work is the Libro de los Juegos (Book of Games), commissioned by King Alfonso X of Castile and Léon in 1283. This stunningly beautiful manuscript, kept in the El Escorial monastery library close to Madrid, includes 97 leaves of parchment, many with beautiful color illustrations, and more than a hundred chess puzzles for the reader to solve, mostly taken from earlier Arabic sources (including the Dilaram problem). The puzzles are consistently shown on a chessboard in the middle of the illustration, with both male and female players to the left and right looking at the board. This important book deals with chess and notes, “Since chess is the noblest game, which requires the most skill compared to all the other games, we are going to talk about it first of all.” Chess quickly emerged as the most popular game due to its complexity and resemblance to medieval culture. Two men play chess in this illustration from the historic Spanish illuminated manuscript Libro de los juegos (Book of Games), or Libro de axedrez, dados, e tablas (Book of Chess, Dice, and Tables), 1283. A name change for some pieces helped chess become even more popular. Where chaturanga’s king had the Arabic ferz alongside him, Western chess replaced this piece with a queen. Other pieces were Westernized too: the horse became a knight, the chariot became a castle (or rook), and the elephant became a bishop. We now had pieces seemingly designed to match European social roles. The Birth of Modern Chess As chess spread from India toward Persia, the Arab empire, and into medieval Europe, the way it was played remained essentially the same. Some minor changes occurred, such as coloring the 64 squares to create a checkered board. Also, pawns were allowed to advance two squares instead of one on the first move, to speed up the game. Multiple versions of the game were played in different territories, even within Europe, with specific rules often varying from area to area. But then, around the end of the fifteenth century, chess underwent significant changes and reached a more or less unified form played all over the continent—the way we play it today. Two changes involved the movements of the bishop and the king. Instead of jumping diagonally exactly two squares only, the bishop could now move without jumping to any square on a diagonal. The king was allowed to run to safety by making a joint movement with one of the rooks, known as “castling.” A genuinely groundbreaking change, however, involved the queen. Like the Arabic ferz, hitherto the queen could only move one diagonal square at a time, making her the weakest piece on the board. Yet, by the turn of the fifteenth century, she could move as far as she wanted, following straight lines and diagonals. In what is generally called “modern chess,” she had become more potent than any other piece on the board. How this happened remains a bit of a mystery. One theory, now refuted, is that the newly empowered chess queen had been inspired by Joan of Arc, the peasant girl who claimed to have received divine visions while helping France defeat England at Orleans in 1429 during the Hundred Years’ War. Most chess historians, however, agree that the change for the chess queen was more than likely inspired by the new powers of an actual queen: Queen Isabella I, who reigned over Castile (part of present-day Spain) from 1474 until she died in 1504. Fittingly, she was considered more powerful than her husband, Ferdinand II, the King of Aragon. The first recorded tournament, probably played with the new rules, took place in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1467. Chess was played in many German cities in the late Middle Ages, and Heidelberg already had a chess club. Sponsored by Frederick I, Count Palatine of the Rhine, the conditions included accommodation and prizes for the winners. Chess had a sport element to it, like poetry and fencing had in those days. The new rules made the game faster, more complex, and rather tricky. Still, the popularity of chess hardly declined in the coming centuries, according to the historian Richard Eales in his 1985 book Chess: The History of a Game: “If the technical chess literature preserved in late medieval manuscripts and printed books compared with that in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscripts and printed books, or if the casual references to the game in wills, inventories, letters, and general literature are contrasted for the two periods, there is nothing to suggest a measurable decline in its popularity.” Part of this is explained by the fact that the social status of chess hardly changed either. It remained a respected pursuit among the upper classes (while also widely known among the lower classes), held in high esteem, not in the least due to its ancient history and many interpretations and analogies, which we’ll dive into somewhat deeper in the next chapter. An Increased Market Size By the eighteenth century, chess was in competition with various card games, especially the trendy game of whist. Still, the number of individuals playing chess kept growing. As Eales explained, there was a general increase in prosperity, giving more people the time and money to spend on leisure activities. In economic terms, the market size was increasing. Choosing to play chess became a matter of taste, which started a new phase for the game and how it was treated. Chess started to have a broader appeal than ever before and began to see more organized forms. For instance, it was increasingly becoming a pastime enjoyed at coffeehouses. In London, you had the Old Slaughter’s Coffee House in St. Martin’s Lane, which opened in 1692 and was visited by architects, painters, poets, and politicians. Even more famous was the Café de la Régence in Paris. Opened in 1681, the café welcomed a wide variety of intellectuals and many famous chess masters, including the best player of his time, François-André Danican Philidor (1726–95). In the Régence, Philidor met Voltaire and Robespierre and played chess with Rousseau. Coffeehouse chess soon led to the founding of the first “gentlemen’s” chess clubs in London and Paris in the late eighteenth century. They started to blossom in the early nineteenth century, and clubs soon opened in countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States. While chess was growing at this point, it also became a men’s game. Women rarely attended the coffeehouses and were often not allowed into the chess clubs. Additionally, chess was increasingly becoming a serious leisure activity (some even started considering it a sport), further stimulating the discrimination toward women in chess. Industrial society no doubt played a role here as well. While men shifted from doing paid work in the household to the factory, women remained in the private sphere. The two sexes lived more separate lives, and the women weren’t allowed much time for leisure activities at home. The first half of the nineteenth century also saw the organization of the first major chess events, adding to the game’s prestige. The biggest masters often played matches against each other (series of multiple games between two opponents), such as those between Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais of France and Alexander McDonnell of Ireland, or England’s Howard Staunton versus Frenchman Pierre de Saint-Amant—battles that were published widely and closely followed by chess fans all over Europe. Staunton was also the main organizer behind the first major international chess tournament in London in 1851. The increased interest in chess was reflected in the growing number of published chess-related books and the very first newspaper column (in the Liverpool Mercury in 1813) and magazine (Le Palamède, in 1836). Also, early attempts were made to systematically cover what was known about chess openings, in surveys such as Aaron Alexandre’s Encyclopedia of Chess from 1837. Chess tournaments started being held regularly in many countries, especially England and Germany. At the same time, the game generally became more organized and regulated as official federations were founded, in the same spirit as sports like soccer, track and field, and cricket. The first official World Chess Championship was held in various cities in the United States in 1886, when Wilhelm Steinitz beat Johannes Zukertort to earn the first World Chess Champion title. This particular championship started a long and wonderful tradition that continues today: a growing list of legendary world championship matches, two-player battles for the highest throne and eternal glory. The Fischer–Spassky match in 1972, with the Cold War as the backdrop, is the most famous. Every serious student of the game knows that the tradition goes back much further, and they can name all the world champions (and maybe even in the right order). I give them below followed by the years when they held the title: Wilhelm Steinitz (1886–94) Emanuel Lasker (1894–1921) José Raúl Capablanca (1921–27) Alexander Alekhine (1927–35, 1937–†1946) Max Euwe (1935–37) Mikhail Botvinnik (1948–57, 1958–60, 1961–63) Vasily Smyslov (1957–58) Mikhail Tal (1960–61) Tigran Petrosian (1963–69) Boris Spassky (1969–72) Bobby Fischer (1972–75) Anatoly Karpov (1975–85) Garry Kasparov (1985–2000) Vladimir Kramnik (2000–2007) Viswanathan Anand (2007–13) Magnus Carlsen (2013–23) Ding Liren (2023–) (Note that Alekhine died as world champion in 1946, after which Botvinnik took over the title in 1948 by winning a world championship tournament. Also note, this list doesn’t mention the FIDE world champions Alexander Khalifman, Ruslan Ponomariov, Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and Veselin Topalov, who won their titles between 1999 and 2005 during a messy situation in the chess world, described in Chapter 4.) Alongside the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, the French Chess Federation held an international team chess tournament, with 54 players from 18 countries. On July 20, the day of the last round, 15 participants founded the International Chess Federation under the French acronym Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE). It started to organize official Chess Olympiads modeled on the Olympic Games and, from 1948 onward, became the official body responsible for those world championships, with a separate category for women. The female champions are: Vera Menchik (1927–†1944) Lyudmila Rudenko (1950–53) Elisaveta Bykova (1953–56, 1958–62) Olga Rubtsova (1956–58) Nona Gaprindashvili (1962–78) Maia Chiburdanidze (1978–91) Xie Jun (1991–96, 1999–2001) Susan Polgar (1996–99) Zhu Chen (2001–4) Antoaneta Stefanova (2004–6) Xu Yuhua (2006–8) Alexandra Kosteniuk (2008–10) Hou Yifan (2010–12, 2013–15, 2016–17) Anna Ushenina (2012–13) Mariya Muzychuk (2015–16) Tan Zhongyi (2017–18) Ju Wenjun (2018–) (Note: Menchik died as world champion in 1944, after which Rudenko took over the title in 1950 by winning a world championship tournament.) All these players always brought a special aura whenever they entered a playing hall: a world champion has entered the building. They are the chess equivalent of the ancient residents of Mount Olympus, and it’s only natural that you’ll find many of their names throughout this book. Chess Is Everywhere Phoebe and Joey are playing a fast game of chess. As they move their pieces with one hand, they bang a chess clock with the other. It quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea what they’re doing. Joey says, “We should really learn how to play the real way.” Phoebe answers, “I like our way. Look!” She moves a piece, jumping over several of Joey’s as if they were playing checkers. She removes one of the enemy pieces and shouts triumphantly, “Chess!” Joey looks impressed and says, “Nice move!” Friends aired on NBC between 1994 and 2004 but, two decades later, the series is still watched worldwide via reruns and streaming services. In what is one of the most popular comedy shows of all time, chess made multiple appearances, most prominently in episode 20 of season eight, “The One With Rachel’s Big Kiss.” A deep analysis isn’t necessary to understand that chess was portrayed as a complicated game, while Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly known for their intellectual skills. Jerry Seinfeld, however, the titular character of that other enormously popular nineties sitcom, Seinfeld, was fairly smart. In episode nine of season three, titled “The Nose Job,” he describes a woman he started to date: “Isabel, she is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It’s like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game.” At the end of the episode, we see an actual chess game between two Jerry Seinfelds (through some special effects), one acting as his penis and one as his brain. The latter wins as the former laments a lack of energy. In the same series, Seinfeld’s friend George Costanza is, well, the less clever guy. At the start of “The Engagement,” the first episode of season seven, George plays chess with his current girlfriend, Alice. The opening scene focuses on the chessboard. George makes a move with the black pieces, sits back rather happy with himself, and says, “Well, you got no place to go. I’ll tell you what your problem is: you brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She’s one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? Nah, the queen is old-fashioned, likes to stay home, cook, take care of a man, makes sure he feels good.” With a stern look, Alice moves a piece and says, “Checkmate.” George studies the position closely and says, “I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” From The Big Bang Theory and Frasier to Cheers and The Simpsons, chess scenes appear in many popular shows—in fact, there’s a special cameo appearance in the latter’s season 28 by none other than Magnus Carlsen. It’s almost impossible to watch a TV series these days and not come across chess at some point. It happens so frequently that in my household, we have developed the habit of saying “No escape!” when we’re sitting on the couch and spot a reference to chess. My friend and Chess.com colleague Mike Klein told me a relatable experience: “Around 2008, I wanted to write an exhaustive story for the American magazine Chess Life about chess references in pop culture—movies, songs, advertisements, and the like. But I soon realized that there were far, far too many to write anything at magazine length. So I changed courses. I decided I would chronicle, for one year, all the pop-culture chess references that came to me organically. When watching TV and a chessboard appeared in a commercial, I would break out a pad and paper and jot it down. I gave up after about four weeks. Even when not seeking out the game, it found me far too often, and the many references inundated me.” One very binge-watchable Netflix show from 2020 was different because chess played a major role in every episode. It treated the game of kings most wonderfully and caused an incredible surge in the popularity of chess, this time also among girls and women. You probably already know what I am talking about. The Queen’s Gambit The Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit premiered on October 23, 2020. It helped that it was broadcast right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, but, just four weeks later, 62 million households had watched the show, which reached the top ten in 92 countries and occupied the number-one position in 63 of them. It took less than a month to become Netflix’s most-watched scripted limited series. Walter Tevis’s novel from 1983, on which the show was based, entered the New York Times bestseller list 37 years after its release. The Google search “how to play chess” hit a nine-year peak. Sales of chessboards and pieces rose by more than 1,000 percent and memberships on Chess.com went through the roof. The show created an incredible chess boom. In that sense, the series was the most influential use of chess in popular culture ever, at least in how it boosted the sport. Named after a popular chess opening, the miniseries follows the life of Beth Harmon (played as a young girl by Isla Johnston and as an adult by Anya Taylor-Joy), who discovers a prodigious talent for chess at a young age. Raised in an orphanage, she develops a tranquilizer addiction and hones her chess skills through dedicated practice. As she grows up, Beth enters the competitive world of chess, facing challenges and triumphs while battling her personal demons. That’s all very fascinating but, still, why the huge success? Anya Taylor-Joy as fictional chess prodigy Beth Harmon in a promotional still from the highly successful Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit, 2020. The answer might be that the show is not so much about chess, after all. When I interviewed the screenwriter Scott Frank for Chess.com in October 2020, he told me, “It’s about a child growing up, interrupted by this brilliant talent that she has. It’s very difficult to have a normal life if you have an extra-normal ability in almost any area, so this story is much more about her demons than it is about her obsession with chess. In fact, there’s nothing you need to know about chess.” Frank, who happens to be a Chess.com member and regularly plays on the site, made sure that the Beth Harmon character wouldn’t be another cliché of the troubled mind. He was helped by a famous chess player. “Garry Kasparov and I had many talks about this, and I didn’t wanna just hammer that. It’s mostly about genius in general and how it takes a cost on you. The thing about Beth Harmon is that she’s both the protagonist and antagonist in her own story.” Sir Tim Rice, the lyricist behind musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita and Disney productions Aladdin and The Lion King—and, with ABBA, Chess (see page 62)—told me about the series in a video call in May 2023: “It made clear that people who play chess are not all weirdos or automatons; they’re human beings.” Personally, I think The Queen’s Gambit is great because all the important individual aspects are great. The story is compelling: it combines a character-driven narrative with high-stakes chess games that create a sense of tension and intrigue. (Walter Tevis’s stories tended to do well on the big screen; he also wrote The Hustler, The Color of Money, and The Man Who Fell to Earth, all made into movies.) Apart from being a refreshing choice as a female star in a male-dominated subdomain, the main character is also a complex and relatable protagonist played wonderfully by Taylor-Joy. Furthermore, the excellent cinematic presentation of the actual chess games, the series’ detailed 1960s setting and the beautiful costumes (including lots of chess-themed clothes worn by the main character) contributed to the visual appeal. The Queen’s Gambit won many prizes, including a Golden Globe for limited series and a Golden Globe for Taylor-Joy, who beat Cate Blanchett (Mrs. America) and Nicole Kidman (The Undoing) in 2021. Among other prizes, she won Best Female Actor in the TV Movie or Limited Series category at the 27th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. Taylor-Joy even joined the chess boom herself. When asked, after winning her Golden Globe, if she had had enough chess for a lifetime, she replied, “Oh goodness, I could never say that. I love chess! I’ve had to pick up new skills for the movies that I’ve been doing, so I’m looking forward to having some time off so I can get back to chess.” Chess and Politics Alfonso X, Pope Leo XIII, Ivan the Terrible, King Edward I, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Napoleon, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Ernesto “Che” Guevara, Fidel Castro, Jimmy Carter—all of them enjoyed a game of chess. Yes, I am jumping to the world of politics, an area where the omnipresence of chess is strongly felt. Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was also one of the first politicians to write about chess. In his short essay from 1786 titled “The Morals of Chess,” he noted that chess is more than idle amusement: “Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions.” In one instance, Franklin used chess as an excuse for his political ploys. In December 1774—the period of rebellion by British colonial separatist leaders that would soon spark the American Revolution—he met several times with Caroline Howe, the sister of Admiral Richard Howe and General William Howe. The two brothers would later become commanders of the British naval and land forces during the American Revolutionary War, but they were both still somewhat sympathetic to the American cause at the time. Franklin played chess with Mrs. Howe, but these meetings were also an opportunity for him to meet with her brother Richard and discuss possible ways of reconciling the Continental Congress and the Thirteen Colonies. Franklin was a fanatic, but in politics Che Guevara was the biggest chess lover of them all. As a young boy, his father took him to the Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires in 1939, where Che saw the great José Raúl Capablanca, got interested in Cuba, and caught the chess fever. Later, he would call chess “mi segunda novia” (my second girlfriend). Che and Fidel Castro played chess to kill time while detained in Mexico, and, after the revolution, in his role as industry minister, Che began promoting chess. He ensured Cuba was represented at the 1960 Leipzig Chess Olympiad and launched a local team tournament. This 1853 engraving depicts Benjamin Franklin playing chess with Caroline Howe in December 1774. He had arranged several games as cover for peace talks with her brothers, Admiral Richard Howe (shown at center) and General William Howe. Che’s most significant chess legacy was establishing the annual Capablanca Memorial tournament in Havana, which still runs today. In the early years, many strong Soviet and European grandmasters participated as the prize fund was higher than at many tournaments elsewhere. I guess it helped that Che was both industry minister and director of the National Bank. He and Castro were daily visitors at the inaugural tournament in 1962 in the Habana Libre Hotel, and both participated in simultaneous exhibitions against visiting grandmasters, known as a simul. (In this old tradition, a strong player plays multiple amateur opponents simultaneously. As the expert walks around the boards, the opponent should make their move each time the expert arrives at their board.) Che had a lasting influence on chess in Cuba. For decades, it was the strongest Latin American country in chess, only recently surpassed by Brazil and Peru. When I visited Cuba in February 2016, the love for chess was still recognizable. I was surprised to see one of the leading chess clubs, the Academia de Ajedrez, located in the heart of Santiago de Cuba, in a building right next to the cathedral and Parque Céspedes. And, of course, I played against some of the many street players, facing stiff opposition. An old saying goes that every taxi driver in Russia is a strong player. I think in Cuba, every driver of a vintage classic car knows how to play chess. One of the 1965 Capablanca Memorial tournament participants was 22-year-old Bobby Fischer. The future world champion, however, played without traveling to Cuba. Due to the strained diplomatic relations with the United States, Fischer was not allowed to go there, but the organizers found a solution. Instead, he played from the Marshall Chess Club in New York, his moves transmitted to Havana by telex. Both Fischer and his opponents in Cuba were sitting across from empty chairs, receiving the countermoves from the arbiters. When Castro reportedly called the remarkable construction a “propaganda victory for Cuba,” Fischer sent a telegram demanding the Cuban leader stop using him for political purposes. In his reply, Castro denied he ever made the statement and questioned Fischer’s courage, after which Fischer decided to avoid further turmoil and just play the tournament. After Fischer qualified for the 1972 World Chess Champion-ship, President Richard Nixon wrote a letter saying the country was behind him. However, the match almost didn’t happen. A stubborn Fischer did not accept the initial conditions nor the location (Reykjavík, Iceland) and continued to protest, mainly about the financial arrangements. During the opening ceremony on Saturday, July 1, the front row had one empty seat as Fischer hadn’t arrived in Reykjavík yet. One thing that convinced Fischer to play was when James Slater, a successful British investment banker and chess lover, donated $125,000 to double the prize fund to $250,000. The other thing was an infamous phone call. Twenty-two-year-old Bobby Fischer playing in the Capablanca Memorial chess tournament in Cuba via telex at the Marshall Chess Club in New York, 1965. When Fischer picked up the phone on Monday, July 3, it was none other than Henry Kissinger on the line, Nixon’s national security advisor and future secretary of state. Kissinger’s opening sentence is usually cited as, “This is the worst chess player in the world calling the best chess player in the world.” Kissinger made the point that the match was necessary for the prestige of the United States, and that Fischer should go and play. That evening, Fischer finally boarded a plane to Reykjavík. In his 2011 book On China, Kissinger returned to the game of chess as he explained the differences between Western and Chinese political strategies by comparing them to chess and wéiqí (Go). Invented in China about 2,500 years ago, Go is older than chess and even more complex. Played on a 19×19 grid, players have 180 stones each and take turns to put them on one of the grid’s 361 intersections. After being so placed, stones do not move but can be captured when surrounded by the opponent’s stones. Kissinger noted: “If chess is about the decisive battle, wéiqí is about the protracted campaign. The chess player aims for total victory. The wéiqí player seeks relative advantage. In chess, the player always has the capability of the adversary in front of him; all the pieces are always fully deployed. The wéiqí player needs to assess not only the pieces on the board but the reinforcements the adversary is in a position to deploy.” The location of the Fischer–Spassky duel lay, not insignificantly, right between the US and the Soviet Union. It was the height of the Cold War, and the match could easily be seen as a symbolic fight between the capitalistic West and the Communist East, a point that wasn’t missed by the media. In hindsight, we should take all this with a grain of salt. Spassky wasn’t a strong Soviet patriot like some of his colleagues, while Fischer’s erratic and sometimes plain unpleasant behavior didn’t make him the perfect representative for his country either. Besides, at the highest diplomatic levels, the US and the USSR weren’t exactly rubbing hands for a military clash—perhaps for them, the match was a better, more peaceful way to fight it out, as the wise Qaflān had suggested in ancient India. Politics is the area that supplied several chess expressions to our language. The most common include: keeping an enemy “in check”; a minor entity being described as a mere “pawn” in a larger game; and a political “stalemate.” But there’s more. Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said before the first Republican presidential candidate debate in 2016: “The best politicians play chess, but most candidates play checkers. The chess players know you have to be willing to lose a piece or two to win the game … but if Jeb Bush wants to survive the ‘Trumpnado’ and become the nominee he needs to be, he should play a little chess, get out of Iowa, and get to New Hampshire as soon as possible.” There are numerous further examples, but I particularly like the following by former state counselor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, shortly after her National League for Democracy party won the 2015 elections: “If you look at the democratic process as a game of chess, there have to be many, many moves before you get to checkmate. And simply because you do not make any checkmate in three moves does not mean it’s stalemate. There’s a vast difference between no checkmate and stalemate. This is what the democratic process is.” One politician who shouldn’t be named in the same sentence as chess—at least as far as Garry Kasparov is concerned—is Vladimir Putin. Retired as a chess player since 2005, Kasparov is a fierce opponent of the Russian leader, and in an interview with Der Spiegel in 2015, he proclaimed, “Putin is more of a poker player. In poker, unlike chess, you can effectively compensate for a very weak hand by bluffing. There are fixed rules in chess, and no one knows how the game will end. Things are currently the other way around in Putin’s realm.” Russian politics have been deeply intertwined with chess for a long time. It should be noted that chess was already quite popular in the big Russian empire (that included parts of current-day Poland and the Baltic countries), where big names like Mikhail Chigorin, Alexander Alekhine, Aron Nimzowitsch, and Akiba Rubinstein were from. After the revolution in 1917, the game developed into a means of propaganda for the Bolsheviks, whose leaders Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Nikolai Krylenko were all chess players. Luxurious tournaments were held in Moscow in 1935 and 1936 to show the world that in Russia, grandmasters were treated as kings. When the USSR beat the US with a big margin in a radio match in 1945, Stalin congratulated his team. The Soviet state strongly supported chess education in order to create the best players in the world, thereby demonstrating the intelligence and sophistication of the Soviet people. Between 1995 and 2018, FIDE was led by the eccentric Russian oligarch Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who was also president of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Russian Federation from 1993 to 2010. The chess world mostly remembers him for his friendly ties with dubious leaders like Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, and Bashar al-Assad; his claim to have been abducted by aliens; and his administration’s alleged involvement in the murder of a journalist in 1998, although there was no proof of his involvement. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former deputy prime minister and a former assistant to the president of the Russian Federation, succeeded Ilyumzhinov in 2018. Especially in the eyes of Western chess federations, Dvorkovich’s presidency became problematic when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Dvorkovich was nonetheless re-elected in August 2022 for a second term. In December 2023, FIDE voted to remove the two-term limit for its presidency, a “good-governance” measure Dvorkovich himself had introduced after announcing it during his 2018 campaign. After this remarkable 180-degree turn, the strong Russian (Kremlin?) influence on the chess world is not expected to end soon. Chess and Sports In a promo video produced by Puma in December 2023, Magnus Carlsen and soccer manager Pep Guardiola talked about the similarities between chess and soccer. Carlsen noted the games are comparable, saying: “I think both in chess and soccer, the important thing is to control the middle, so that’s one thing. If you control the middle, you control the pitch or the board. Another thing is that often in chess you attack on one side, force the opponent to overload, and then you switch, and you have an advantage on the other side in terms of space. It’s remarkably similar.” Guardiola shares an interest in chess with fellow managers Quique Setién and Felix Magath and players past and present including Edgar Davids, Fernando Torres, Christian Pulisic, and Mo Salah. Fans of chess from other sports include Steve Davis (snooker), Boris Becker, Daniil Medvedev, Andrey Rublev, Carlos Alcaraz (tennis), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Klay Thompson (basketball), Charles Leclerc, Carlos Sainz, Mick Schumacher (Formula 1), John Urschel, Chidobe Awuzie (football) and Ravichandran Ashwin (cricket). Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the sport with possibly the largest number of chess enthusiasts is said to resemble chess the most: boxing. Three-time heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is a chess fan and taught his corner team to play. The Ukrainian brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, who share 40 world heavyweight title fight wins between them, love to play chess as well, which is also the case for Manny Pacquiao, Anthony Joshua, and the MMA fighters Conor McGregor and Aljamain Sterling. Like his colleagues, Lewis said he used chess to “stay mentally sharp,” for example, when he was preparing for the 2003 “Battle of the Titans” with Vitali Klitschko, who commented before the match, “First I beat Lewis on the chessboard, and then we meet in the ring.” In the end, it was Lewis who won by technical knockout. Speaking of which, did you know that chessboxing is a thing? People have played chess while hanging on a parachute or while bathing in a lake of freezing cold water, so putting a chessboard and pieces inside a boxing ring perhaps isn’t so crazy. After all, we’re dealing with another two-person confrontation where the anticipation of the opponent’s moves is key. It works as follows: the two contestants, reasonably trained in both disciplines, play alternating boxing and blitz-chess rounds until someone wins by either knockout or checkmate (or if the opponent’s clock time runs out). I happened to be present at the first official competition, on November 14, 2003, held by the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO) in Paradiso, Amsterdam, between Luis the Lawyer (Jean Louis Veenstra) and Iepe the Joker (Iepe Rubingh). The latter won after his opponent lost on time in a winning position. Rubingh, the main event organizer, was a Dutch conceptual artist who sadly passed away in 2020 at age 45. The history of chessboxing goes back even further: it featured in the 1979 kung fu film Mystery of Chess Boxing by Joseph Kuo (where Chinese chess, xiangqi, is played), which the band Wu-Tang Clan referred to in their 1993 song “Da Mystery of Chessboxin.’ ” On December 11, 2022, chessboxing found itself under the spotlight again when the popular YouTuber Ludwig Ahgren organized the Mogul Chessboxing Championship. Twelve of the biggest content creators on YouTube and Twitch, all with an interest in chess (more on that in Chapter 10), stepped into the ring in front of 10,000 fans inside the Galen Center in Los Angeles and 558,000 viewers online, who enjoyed commentary by Levy Rozman, chessboxing world champion Matt Thomas, and Ludwig himself. The Canadian grandmaster (GM) Aman Hambleton won the matchup among the chess experts by beating international master (IM) Lawrence Trent with a technical knockout. The highlight of the evening was the fight between two chess content creators, where Dina Belenkaya initially won, as Andrea Botez resigned the chess game. (Both were seasoned chess players who had spent months in the gym training for the boxing part.) However, fans quickly pointed out that the referee had made a mistake. Before that final chess session, Belenkaya had received four eight-second standing counts, which should have been enough for Botez to win on a technical knockout (TKO). Two days after the fight, the organizers adjusted the result, writing on social media: “After discussing with the players, we are not reversing Dina Belenkaya’s win because the fighters played it out in the moment, and she competed valiantly. However, we have decided to award Andrea a belt for her performance and to correct the decision that was made in the ring.” The British philosopher and radio documentary maker David Edmonds described the sport in BBC News Magazine as follows: “Chess and boxing seems as bizarre a pairing as anything, but they do have something in common. One is a duel often characterized by cruelty, ruthlessness, and violence. And boxing is much the same.” Chess Is Everything The oldest tools used to play board games are at least five millennia old. In his landmark 1938 book Homo Ludens, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga analyzed play as a cultural phenomenon: “For many years the conviction has grown upon me that civilization arises and unfolds in and as play.” Elsewhere, he writes that playing games is “older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing.” Chess quickly became the most popular game when it entered Western society. It was prominently depicted in medieval texts and art, and is still firmly embedded in our culture. The big question is: why chess? What is it with chess that “beat” other board games, dice, cards, etc., to become the dominant game in our society? In a conversation for this book, Sir Tim Rice summarized: “The game is in some respects a metaphor for life. You’ve got pawns who don’t have much power. You’ve got kings and queens who’ve got a lot more power. This is all very interesting, and so, obviously, it’s very easy to make those pieces a metaphor for aspects of life. And many great writers have done that.” In his 2023 documentary Through the Mirror of Chess: A Cultural Exploration, the filmmaker and author Howard Burton has suggested that the dominance of chess has to do with the complexity of the game resulting from the different pieces having different values and different movements: “Chess is special because it isn’t just the fact that it uses an array of different types of pieces that need to be coordinated with each other. It’s that each piece is constantly, ever so subtly, changing its value depending on its position with respect to all the others. And it’s precisely this highly nuanced, constantly shifting dance of individual pieces and overall positions that gives chess its unique aesthetic appeal.” My own view on chess comes closest to what Robert Desjarlais wrote in his 2011 book Counterplay: An Anthropologist at the Chessboard: “Chess play entails narrative intrigue. Undertaking a chess game trips a sense of adventure, of venturing into surprises and unanticipated situations.” Although the pieces were initially created as members of a small army, they’ve always felt more like characters in a story to me. I’ve always thought of a game of chess as a tale written by two authors who don’t know yet where things will go. This analogy perhaps works even stronger for me as a serious player who needs to write down his moves on a scoresheet (per official regulations). This means that after the story is over, it is stored forever in the human knowledge database for everyone to pick up and enjoy. For anyone who has read many chess books that discuss master games from the past, the comparison with literature comes naturally. Marcel Duchamp—a key figure in the Dada movement and one of the most influential twentieth-century artists—must have had something similar in mind when he said, in a short speech at a banquet of the New York State Association of Chess in 1952, “Actually, I believe that every chess player experiences a mixture of two aesthetic pleasures: first the abstract image akin to the poetic idea of writing; second the sensuous pleasure of the ideographic execution of that image on the chessboard.” I would like to add another aspect: the element of time. For advanced players, it is common to use a chess clock during a game, but every single move, in itself, is a fundamental element of time. When fully immersed in a complicated game, you get the sense that the longer a player thinks, the more you feel time is frozen. At such moments, you feel inside a separate world, an existence cut off from reality—the same experience as reading a book or watching a movie. This is what chess means to me, but it’s just one personal approach. Chess has meant so many different things to different people, starting from a war game for the Indians and Arabs, a symbol of social hierarchy in medieval times, an art form in itself, “the touchstone of intellect” (Goethe), a social enterprise, an organized sport, and a complex of problems that can be approached scientifically, as we will see in the third chapter. The Dutch grandmaster and author Jan Hein Donner once stated that “chess cannot be compared with anything” while “many things can be compared with chess.” I believe what he actually did was point out that there are apparent similarities between chess and many aspects of life, as long as you also acknowledge that chess is unique in itself. How else can I end this chapter than by quoting my favorite player of all time, Bobby Fischer, who said, “Chess is life.”",

It was also recognized as symbolic of warfare, while the pieces could be made emblematic of the various elements of the society.” —H. J. R. Murray, A History of Chess, 1913 On November 19, 2022, a picture on Instagram quickly became one of the most-liked posts ever. It was the day before the opening of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and the leading fashion house Louis Vuitton shared a photo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess. Accompanied by the text “Victory is a State of Mind,” the photo was shot by the legendary celebrity portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz and posted on Messi’s, Ronaldo’s, and Louis Vuitton’s Instagram channels. The image, which gathered more than 84 million likes, showed the two soccer stars using a Louis Vuitton checkered suitcase as a chessboard. Two years after the release of The Queen’s Gambit, chess witnessed a new outing in popular culture that might have reached even more people than the incredibly successful Netflix series. Incidentally, the picture—which was shot at different moments in time, with Messi and Ronaldo not actually in the studio together—used an actual chess position taken from a real game. The coach of world number one Magnus Carlsen, the Dane Peter Heine Nielsen, tweeted that the position came from a game between Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the two biggest stars in chess, played in Norway in 2017 (see annotated game on pages 397–98). Carlsen retweeted Nielsen’s tweet with the witty line: “Second greatest rivalry of our time mimicking the greatest.” Messi and Ronaldo playing checkers or cards would have been far less likely. And it wouldn’t have worked. The visual possibilities, symbolism, tradition, and complexity of chess give it power. Chess has fascinated emperors, kings, maharajas, shahs, czars, generals, and presidents. It has inspired painters, poets, playwrights, novelists, directors, screenwriters, athletes, and politicians. The magic of chess has enthralled us for 1,500 years. The Origins of Chess Once upon a time, a bright queen in India named Jūshīr faced a rebellion. She sent one of her sons to fight back, but a rebel killed him, distressing the people of her kingdom. Fearing to tell her the news, they gathered before one of their wise men, Qaflān, and told him what had happened. He said, “Give me three days,” and went away to think. Then Qaflān told one of his pupils, “Bring me a carpenter and wood of two different colors, white and black.” The carpenter created chess pieces, instructed by Qaflān, who then said, “Bring me tanned leather.” A chessboard with 64 squares was made, and Qaflān started playing the game with one of his pupils until they understood it and became proficient in it. He told his pupil, “This is a war without loss of lives.” The kingdom’s people realized they were witnessing a piece of wisdom no one else could have arrived at. When Queen Jūshīr heard about the game, she summoned Qaflān to show it to her. He arrived at her palace with his pupil, and the two started playing chess. One defeated the other and said, “Checkmate!” Understanding what he meant, the queen asked Qaflān, “Has my son been killed?” “You have said it,” he replied. She told her chamberlain, “Let the people in, that they may offer me condolence.” She then turned to Qaflān and said to him, “Ask for whatever you need.” His reply will probably ring a bell for many readers. “Your Majesty, I do not seek great wealth or power. Instead, I ask for a simple reward: I request just one grain of wheat for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, eight grains for the fourth square, and so on.” The queen initially laughed off the request as a meager prize for his brilliant game, and readily agreed. However, her advisers soon pointed out the astonishing consequences of Qaflān’s request. The chessboard has 64 squares, and because the number of wheat grains doubles for each square, the total amount of wheat required would be 264-1, an amount not available in the entire world. (A recent calculation suggests it is over 1,600 times the global wheat production.) The legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, which still serves in mathematical education as a cautionary tale about the power of exponential growth, exists in several forms. One involves rice grains and the Indian god Krishna, while the most famous version of the story has the Brahmin mathematician Sissa inventing chess to teach his king a lesson in humility. Just like in the game, his fate is connected to the weakest of his subjects, and, as the king, he is the most powerful entity but still needs all the other pieces for his protection. The version I chose above is the oldest one, “dating back to pre-Muhammadan days,” according to H. J. R. Murray, a renowned and incredibly erudite chess historian who published his monumental A History of Chess in 1913. The legend was told by Ibn Wāḍiḥ al-Ya ‘qūbī, a Muslim imperial official and polymath of the ninth century whose works represent some of the earliest historical and geographical writings to survive in Arabic literature. Interestingly, al-Ya ֜qūbī refers to a queen (Jūshīr) instead of a king, and his story suggests that chess was already used as a metaphor the moment it was invented. From its infancy, chess was larger than chess. Whether it’s a true story is not a serious question. One thing most chess historians agree on is that the game originates in India. It originally sprung out of another board game called chaturanga, first appearing in the Gupta Empire around the sixth century CE. Xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), shogi (Japanese chess), sittuyin (Burmese chess) and makruk (Thai chess) are all believed to share chaturanga as a common ancestor. The Sanskrit word chaturanga means “having four limbs/parts”—from chatur, meaning “four,” and anga, meaning “parts”—and refers to the four divisions of an army: elephantry, chariotry, cavalry, and infantry. The game was played on an eight-by-eight board with 64 squares—note that these were all one color. The types of pieces were similar to chess: there was a king, a ferz (a counselor to the king), a chariot (rook), an elephant (an early form of a bishop), a horse (knight), and a foot soldier (pawn). We are clearly dealing with a board game that mimics the fight between two old-Indian armies. (Note that, a millennium later, some languages still use the same words for certain pieces. For example, a bishop in Russian is cлон, meaning “elephant.”) Chess spread to Asia and Persia (current-day Iran), likely in the sixth century, too. How that happened involves another legend pointing to India as the game’s birthplace. It was told in the Shahnama (Book of Kings), composed by the Persian poet Ferdowsi and completed around the year 1010. Bozorgmehr (bottom row, second from left), minister to sixth-century Persian king Khosrow I, plays chess with an Indian envoy, as depicted in a c. 1330–40 folio from Ferdowsi’s Shahnama (Book of Kings). One day, a richly equipped mission of envoys from the Raja of India arrived at the court of King Khosrow of Anushirvan, the Sāsānian king who ruled Persia from 531 to 579. Among the many treasures they brought was a beautiful, checkered board. A message written on silk described the board and the type of pieces that belonged to it, and noted that if anyone could detect how this game ought to be played, the Raja would happily pay the requested taxes. After a day and night of studying, Khosrow’s minister Bozorgmehr gave a complete description of the rules of chess, to the horror of the Indian envoys. To make matters worse, he went on to invent the game of nard (an early form of backgammon) and sent back a similar challenge to the Indian king—one his advisors failed to solve. 2–0 to the Persians. After the Muslim conquest of Persia in the middle of the seventh century, the Arabs got acquainted with chess, which the Persians had called chatrang and which they changed to shatranj. Chess grew in popularity and spread throughout the Arab-Islamic world. By the ninth or tenth century, chess was widely known in the Arab world, from India all the way to Spain. The first books about chess were written, containing more legends, poems, and expressions. One example described drunkenness: “He came following the path of a rook but left following the path of a knight.” The rich Arab chess literature further described links with mathematics, logical thinking, and even eroticism, while including chess instruction. Also, the manṣūbūt were introduced: chess puzzles from endgame positions with well-defined tasks, such as finding a forced checkmate in a few moves. A famous one is the Dilaram problem (given on page 381), supposedly coming from a chess game played by a nobleman named Murwardi. In financial dire straits, he had wagered his beautiful wife Dilaram on a game and ended up winning it thanks to her. When the position of the puzzle arose, she was the one who found the solution, saying to her husband, “Sacrifice your two rooks, and not me.” Chess in the Middle Ages Arab players brought chess to Europe through the Iberian Peninsula and the Byzantine Empire, probably during the tenth century. It also spread to Northern Europe, often following the routes of victorious armies. When the Normans conquered England, chess came with them. One of the earliest references to European chess is a famous letter from 1061 by Cardinal Bishop Petrus Damiani to the Pope-elect Alexander II and the Archdeacon Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII). In the letter, Damiani suggested that some clergy members had sinned by participating in certain leisure activities, including chess. The bishop of Florence defended himself by pointing out that, unlike other games which involved luck, chess was a game of skill. Until the mid-thirteenth century, the Church regularly prohibited playing chess (thus also demonstrating its popularity) as it did not clearly distinguish between chess and dice games. That is more understandable if you realize that, in those years, chess was often played with dice, with the numbers indicating which piece had to be played. But at some point, the Church’s stance changed. Murray wrote: “By 1250, the early prejudice of the Church against chess had begun to weaken in view of the royal and noble patronage of the game, and the monastic orders were freely accepting chess as a welcome alleviation of the monotony of convent life, while a knowledge of chess had spread downwards from the inmates of castle and monastery to the wealthier burgesses and merchants of the towns.” In other words, attempts to eradicate the game failed miserably, as chess simply could not be stopped. Chess became a regular feature of European nobility and courtly life in the course of just two centuries. Kings, priests, knights, and other members of the feudal nobility liked to play. In his influential work Disciplina Clericalis from the twelfth century, the Spanish physician, astronomer, and writer Peter Alfonsi listed it among the seven skills a good knight must acquire: riding, swimming, archery, boxing, hawking, verse writing, and chess. The game’s fame grew fast, as is shown by the hundreds of allusions to chess in literature from the thirteenth century onward. I quote Murray again: “During the latter part of the Middle Ages, and especially from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, chess attained to a popularity in Western Europe which has never been excelled, and probably never equalled, at any later date.” Well, the book you are reading has something to say about that last claim … A historically essential work is the Libro de los Juegos (Book of Games), commissioned by King Alfonso X of Castile and Léon in 1283. This stunningly beautiful manuscript, kept in the El Escorial monastery library close to Madrid, includes 97 leaves of parchment, many with beautiful color illustrations, and more than a hundred chess puzzles for the reader to solve, mostly taken from earlier Arabic sources (including the Dilaram problem). The puzzles are consistently shown on a chessboard in the middle of the illustration, with both male and female players to the left and right looking at the board. This important book deals with chess and notes, “Since chess is the noblest game, which requires the most skill compared to all the other games, we are going to talk about it first of all.” Chess quickly emerged as the most popular game due to its complexity and resemblance to medieval culture. Two men play chess in this illustration from the historic Spanish illuminated manuscript Libro de los juegos (Book of Games), or Libro de axedrez, dados, e tablas (Book of Chess, Dice, and Tables), 1283. A name change for some pieces helped chess become even more popular. Where chaturanga’s king had the Arabic ferz alongside him, Western chess replaced this piece with a queen. Other pieces were Westernized too: the horse became a knight, the chariot became a castle (or rook), and the elephant became a bishop. We now had pieces seemingly designed to match European social roles. The Birth of Modern Chess As chess spread from India toward Persia, the Arab empire, and into medieval Europe, the way it was played remained essentially the same. Some minor changes occurred, such as coloring the 64 squares to create a checkered board. Also, pawns were allowed to advance two squares instead of one on the first move, to speed up the game. Multiple versions of the game were played in different territories, even within Europe, with specific rules often varying from area to area. But then, around the end of the fifteenth century, chess underwent significant changes and reached a more or less unified form played all over the continent—the way we play it today. Two changes involved the movements of the bishop and the king. Instead of jumping diagonally exactly two squares only, the bishop could now move without jumping to any square on a diagonal. The king was allowed to run to safety by making a joint movement with one of the rooks, known as “castling.” A genuinely groundbreaking change, however, involved the queen. Like the Arabic ferz, hitherto the queen could only move one diagonal square at a time, making her the weakest piece on the board. Yet, by the turn of the fifteenth century, she could move as far as she wanted, following straight lines and diagonals. In what is generally called “modern chess,” she had become more potent than any other piece on the board. How this happened remains a bit of a mystery. One theory, now refuted, is that the newly empowered chess queen had been inspired by Joan of Arc, the peasant girl who claimed to have received divine visions while helping France defeat England at Orleans in 1429 during the Hundred Years’ War. Most chess historians, however, agree that the change for the chess queen was more than likely inspired by the new powers of an actual queen: Queen Isabella I, who reigned over Castile (part of present-day Spain) from 1474 until she died in 1504. Fittingly, she was considered more powerful than her husband, Ferdinand II, the King of Aragon. The first recorded tournament, probably played with the new rules, took place in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1467. Chess was played in many German cities in the late Middle Ages, and Heidelberg already had a chess club. Sponsored by Frederick I, Count Palatine of the Rhine, the conditions included accommodation and prizes for the winners. Chess had a sport element to it, like poetry and fencing had in those days. The new rules made the game faster, more complex, and rather tricky. Still, the popularity of chess hardly declined in the coming centuries, according to the historian Richard Eales in his 1985 book Chess: The History of a Game: “If the technical chess literature preserved in late medieval manuscripts and printed books compared with that in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscripts and printed books, or if the casual references to the game in wills, inventories, letters, and general literature are contrasted for the two periods, there is nothing to suggest a measurable decline in its popularity.” Part of this is explained by the fact that the social status of chess hardly changed either. It remained a respected pursuit among the upper classes (while also widely known among the lower classes), held in high esteem, not in the least due to its ancient history and many interpretations and analogies, which we’ll dive into somewhat deeper in the next chapter. An Increased Market Size By the eighteenth century, chess was in competition with various card games, especially the trendy game of whist. Still, the number of individuals playing chess kept growing. As Eales explained, there was a general increase in prosperity, giving more people the time and money to spend on leisure activities. In economic terms, the market size was increasing. Choosing to play chess became a matter of taste, which started a new phase for the game and how it was treated. Chess started to have a broader appeal than ever before and began to see more organized forms. For instance, it was increasingly becoming a pastime enjoyed at coffeehouses. In London, you had the Old Slaughter’s Coffee House in St. Martin’s Lane, which opened in 1692 and was visited by architects, painters, poets, and politicians. Even more famous was the Café de la Régence in Paris. Opened in 1681, the café welcomed a wide variety of intellectuals and many famous chess masters, including the best player of his time, François-André Danican Philidor (1726–95). In the Régence, Philidor met Voltaire and Robespierre and played chess with Rousseau. Coffeehouse chess soon led to the founding of the first “gentlemen’s” chess clubs in London and Paris in the late eighteenth century. They started to blossom in the early nineteenth century, and clubs soon opened in countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States. While chess was growing at this point, it also became a men’s game. Women rarely attended the coffeehouses and were often not allowed into the chess clubs. Additionally, chess was increasingly becoming a serious leisure activity (some even started considering it a sport), further stimulating the discrimination toward women in chess. Industrial society no doubt played a role here as well. While men shifted from doing paid work in the household to the factory, women remained in the private sphere. The two sexes lived more separate lives, and the women weren’t allowed much time for leisure activities at home. The first half of the nineteenth century also saw the organization of the first major chess events, adding to the game’s prestige. The biggest masters often played matches against each other (series of multiple games between two opponents), such as those between Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais of France and Alexander McDonnell of Ireland, or England’s Howard Staunton versus Frenchman Pierre de Saint-Amant—battles that were published widely and closely followed by chess fans all over Europe. Staunton was also the main organizer behind the first major international chess tournament in London in 1851. The increased interest in chess was reflected in the growing number of published chess-related books and the very first newspaper column (in the Liverpool Mercury in 1813) and magazine (Le Palamède, in 1836). Also, early attempts were made to systematically cover what was known about chess openings, in surveys such as Aaron Alexandre’s Encyclopedia of Chess from 1837. Chess tournaments started being held regularly in many countries, especially England and Germany. At the same time, the game generally became more organized and regulated as official federations were founded, in the same spirit as sports like soccer, track and field, and cricket. The first official World Chess Championship was held in various cities in the United States in 1886, when Wilhelm Steinitz beat Johannes Zukertort to earn the first World Chess Champion title. This particular championship started a long and wonderful tradition that continues today: a growing list of legendary world championship matches, two-player battles for the highest throne and eternal glory. The Fischer–Spassky match in 1972, with the Cold War as the backdrop, is the most famous. Every serious student of the game knows that the tradition goes back much further, and they can name all the world champions (and maybe even in the right order). I give them below followed by the years when they held the title: Wilhelm Steinitz (1886–94) Emanuel Lasker (1894–1921) José Raúl Capablanca (1921–27) Alexander Alekhine (1927–35, 1937–†1946) Max Euwe (1935–37) Mikhail Botvinnik (1948–57, 1958–60, 1961–63) Vasily Smyslov (1957–58) Mikhail Tal (1960–61) Tigran Petrosian (1963–69) Boris Spassky (1969–72) Bobby Fischer (1972–75) Anatoly Karpov (1975–85) Garry Kasparov (1985–2000) Vladimir Kramnik (2000–2007) Viswanathan Anand (2007–13) Magnus Carlsen (2013–23) Ding Liren (2023–) (Note that Alekhine died as world champion in 1946, after which Botvinnik took over the title in 1948 by winning a world championship tournament. Also note, this list doesn’t mention the FIDE world champions Alexander Khalifman, Ruslan Ponomariov, Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and Veselin Topalov, who won their titles between 1999 and 2005 during a messy situation in the chess world, described in Chapter 4.) Alongside the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, the French Chess Federation held an international team chess tournament, with 54 players from 18 countries. On July 20, the day of the last round, 15 participants founded the International Chess Federation under the French acronym Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE). It started to organize official Chess Olympiads modeled on the Olympic Games and, from 1948 onward, became the official body responsible for those world championships, with a separate category for women. The female champions are: Vera Menchik (1927–†1944) Lyudmila Rudenko (1950–53) Elisaveta Bykova (1953–56, 1958–62) Olga Rubtsova (1956–58) Nona Gaprindashvili (1962–78) Maia Chiburdanidze (1978–91) Xie Jun (1991–96, 1999–2001) Susan Polgar (1996–99) Zhu Chen (2001–4) Antoaneta Stefanova (2004–6) Xu Yuhua (2006–8) Alexandra Kosteniuk (2008–10) Hou Yifan (2010–12, 2013–15, 2016–17) Anna Ushenina (2012–13) Mariya Muzychuk (2015–16) Tan Zhongyi (2017–18) Ju Wenjun (2018–) (Note: Menchik died as world champion in 1944, after which Rudenko took over the title in 1950 by winning a world championship tournament.) All these players always brought a special aura whenever they entered a playing hall: a world champion has entered the building. They are the chess equivalent of the ancient residents of Mount Olympus, and it’s only natural that you’ll find many of their names throughout this book. Chess Is Everywhere Phoebe and Joey are playing a fast game of chess. As they move their pieces with one hand, they bang a chess clock with the other. It quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea what they’re doing. Joey says, “We should really learn how to play the real way.” Phoebe answers, “I like our way. Look!” She moves a piece, jumping over several of Joey’s as if they were playing checkers. She removes one of the enemy pieces and shouts triumphantly, “Chess!” Joey looks impressed and says, “Nice move!” Friends aired on NBC between 1994 and 2004 but, two decades later, the series is still watched worldwide via reruns and streaming services. In what is one of the most popular comedy shows of all time, chess made multiple appearances, most prominently in episode 20 of season eight, “The One With Rachel’s Big Kiss.” A deep analysis isn’t necessary to understand that chess was portrayed as a complicated game, while Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly known for their intellectual skills. Jerry Seinfeld, however, the titular character of that other enormously popular nineties sitcom, Seinfeld, was fairly smart. In episode nine of season three, titled “The Nose Job,” he describes a woman he started to date: “Isabel, she is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It’s like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game.” At the end of the episode, we see an actual chess game between two Jerry Seinfelds (through some special effects), one acting as his penis and one as his brain. The latter wins as the former laments a lack of energy. In the same series, Seinfeld’s friend George Costanza is, well, the less clever guy. At the start of “The Engagement,” the first episode of season seven, George plays chess with his current girlfriend, Alice. The opening scene focuses on the chessboard. George makes a move with the black pieces, sits back rather happy with himself, and says, “Well, you got no place to go. I’ll tell you what your problem is: you brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She’s one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? Nah, the queen is old-fashioned, likes to stay home, cook, take care of a man, makes sure he feels good.” With a stern look, Alice moves a piece and says, “Checkmate.” George studies the position closely and says, “I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” From The Big Bang Theory and Frasier to Cheers and The Simpsons, chess scenes appear in many popular shows—in fact, there’s a special cameo appearance in the latter’s season 28 by none other than Magnus Carlsen. It’s almost impossible to watch a TV series these days and not come across chess at some point. It happens so frequently that in my household, we have developed the habit of saying “No escape!” when we’re sitting on the couch and spot a reference to chess. My friend and Chess.com colleague Mike Klein told me a relatable experience: “Around 2008, I wanted to write an exhaustive story for the American magazine Chess Life about chess references in pop culture—movies, songs, advertisements, and the like. But I soon realized that there were far, far too many to write anything at magazine length. So I changed courses. I decided I would chronicle, for one year, all the pop-culture chess references that came to me organically. When watching TV and a chessboard appeared in a commercial, I would break out a pad and paper and jot it down. I gave up after about four weeks. Even when not seeking out the game, it found me far too often, and the many references inundated me.” One very binge-watchable Netflix show from 2020 was different because chess played a major role in every episode. It treated the game of kings most wonderfully and caused an incredible surge in the popularity of chess, this time also among girls and women. You probably already know what I am talking about. The Queen’s Gambit The Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit premiered on October 23, 2020. It helped that it was broadcast right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, but, just four weeks later, 62 million households had watched the show, which reached the top ten in 92 countries and occupied the number-one position in 63 of them. It took less than a month to become Netflix’s most-watched scripted limited series. Walter Tevis’s novel from 1983, on which the show was based, entered the New York Times bestseller list 37 years after its release. The Google search “how to play chess” hit a nine-year peak. Sales of chessboards and pieces rose by more than 1,000 percent and memberships on Chess.com went through the roof. The show created an incredible chess boom. In that sense, the series was the most influential use of chess in popular culture ever, at least in how it boosted the sport. Named after a popular chess opening, the miniseries follows the life of Beth Harmon (played as a young girl by Isla Johnston and as an adult by Anya Taylor-Joy), who discovers a prodigious talent for chess at a young age. Raised in an orphanage, she develops a tranquilizer addiction and hones her chess skills through dedicated practice. As she grows up, Beth enters the competitive world of chess, facing challenges and triumphs while battling her personal demons. That’s all very fascinating but, still, why the huge success? Anya Taylor-Joy as fictional chess prodigy Beth Harmon in a promotional still from the highly successful Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit, 2020. The answer might be that the show is not so much about chess, after all. When I interviewed the screenwriter Scott Frank for Chess.com in October 2020, he told me, “It’s about a child growing up, interrupted by this brilliant talent that she has. It’s very difficult to have a normal life if you have an extra-normal ability in almost any area, so this story is much more about her demons than it is about her obsession with chess. In fact, there’s nothing you need to know about chess.” Frank, who happens to be a Chess.com member and regularly plays on the site, made sure that the Beth Harmon character wouldn’t be another cliché of the troubled mind. He was helped by a famous chess player. “Garry Kasparov and I had many talks about this, and I didn’t wanna just hammer that. It’s mostly about genius in general and how it takes a cost on you. The thing about Beth Harmon is that she’s both the protagonist and antagonist in her own story.” Sir Tim Rice, the lyricist behind musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita and Disney productions Aladdin and The Lion King—and, with ABBA, Chess (see page 62)—told me about the series in a video call in May 2023: “It made clear that people who play chess are not all weirdos or automatons; they’re human beings.” Personally, I think The Queen’s Gambit is great because all the important individual aspects are great. The story is compelling: it combines a character-driven narrative with high-stakes chess games that create a sense of tension and intrigue. (Walter Tevis’s stories tended to do well on the big screen; he also wrote The Hustler, The Color of Money, and The Man Who Fell to Earth, all made into movies.) Apart from being a refreshing choice as a female star in a male-dominated subdomain, the main character is also a complex and relatable protagonist played wonderfully by Taylor-Joy. Furthermore, the excellent cinematic presentation of the actual chess games, the series’ detailed 1960s setting and the beautiful costumes (including lots of chess-themed clothes worn by the main character) contributed to the visual appeal. The Queen’s Gambit won many prizes, including a Golden Globe for limited series and a Golden Globe for Taylor-Joy, who beat Cate Blanchett (Mrs. America) and Nicole Kidman (The Undoing) in 2021. Among other prizes, she won Best Female Actor in the TV Movie or Limited Series category at the 27th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. Taylor-Joy even joined the chess boom herself. When asked, after winning her Golden Globe, if she had had enough chess for a lifetime, she replied, “Oh goodness, I could never say that. I love chess! I’ve had to pick up new skills for the movies that I’ve been doing, so I’m looking forward to having some time off so I can get back to chess.” Chess and Politics Alfonso X, Pope Leo XIII, Ivan the Terrible, King Edward I, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Napoleon, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Ernesto “Che” Guevara, Fidel Castro, Jimmy Carter—all of them enjoyed a game of chess. Yes, I am jumping to the world of politics, an area where the omnipresence of chess is strongly felt. Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was also one of the first politicians to write about chess. In his short essay from 1786 titled “The Morals of Chess,” he noted that chess is more than idle amusement: “Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions.” In one instance, Franklin used chess as an excuse for his political ploys. In December 1774—the period of rebellion by British colonial separatist leaders that would soon spark the American Revolution—he met several times with Caroline Howe, the sister of Admiral Richard Howe and General William Howe. The two brothers would later become commanders of the British naval and land forces during the American Revolutionary War, but they were both still somewhat sympathetic to the American cause at the time. Franklin played chess with Mrs. Howe, but these meetings were also an opportunity for him to meet with her brother Richard and discuss possible ways of reconciling the Continental Congress and the Thirteen Colonies. Franklin was a fanatic, but in politics Che Guevara was the biggest chess lover of them all. As a young boy, his father took him to the Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires in 1939, where Che saw the great José Raúl Capablanca, got interested in Cuba, and caught the chess fever. Later, he would call chess “mi segunda novia” (my second girlfriend). Che and Fidel Castro played chess to kill time while detained in Mexico, and, after the revolution, in his role as industry minister, Che began promoting chess. He ensured Cuba was represented at the 1960 Leipzig Chess Olympiad and launched a local team tournament. This 1853 engraving depicts Benjamin Franklin playing chess with Caroline Howe in December 1774. He had arranged several games as cover for peace talks with her brothers, Admiral Richard Howe (shown at center) and General William Howe. Che’s most significant chess legacy was establishing the annual Capablanca Memorial tournament in Havana, which still runs today. In the early years, many strong Soviet and European grandmasters participated as the prize fund was higher than at many tournaments elsewhere. I guess it helped that Che was both industry minister and director of the National Bank. He and Castro were daily visitors at the inaugural tournament in 1962 in the Habana Libre Hotel, and both participated in simultaneous exhibitions against visiting grandmasters, known as a simul. (In this old tradition, a strong player plays multiple amateur opponents simultaneously. As the expert walks around the boards, the opponent should make their move each time the expert arrives at their board.) Che had a lasting influence on chess in Cuba. For decades, it was the strongest Latin American country in chess, only recently surpassed by Brazil and Peru. When I visited Cuba in February 2016, the love for chess was still recognizable. I was surprised to see one of the leading chess clubs, the Academia de Ajedrez, located in the heart of Santiago de Cuba, in a building right next to the cathedral and Parque Céspedes. And, of course, I played against some of the many street players, facing stiff opposition. An old saying goes that every taxi driver in Russia is a strong player. I think in Cuba, every driver of a vintage classic car knows how to play chess. One of the 1965 Capablanca Memorial tournament participants was 22-year-old Bobby Fischer. The future world champion, however, played without traveling to Cuba. Due to the strained diplomatic relations with the United States, Fischer was not allowed to go there, but the organizers found a solution. Instead, he played from the Marshall Chess Club in New York, his moves transmitted to Havana by telex. Both Fischer and his opponents in Cuba were sitting across from empty chairs, receiving the countermoves from the arbiters. When Castro reportedly called the remarkable construction a “propaganda victory for Cuba,” Fischer sent a telegram demanding the Cuban leader stop using him for political purposes. In his reply, Castro denied he ever made the statement and questioned Fischer’s courage, after which Fischer decided to avoid further turmoil and just play the tournament. After Fischer qualified for the 1972 World Chess Champion-ship, President Richard Nixon wrote a letter saying the country was behind him. However, the match almost didn’t happen. A stubborn Fischer did not accept the initial conditions nor the location (Reykjavík, Iceland) and continued to protest, mainly about the financial arrangements. During the opening ceremony on Saturday, July 1, the front row had one empty seat as Fischer hadn’t arrived in Reykjavík yet. One thing that convinced Fischer to play was when James Slater, a successful British investment banker and chess lover, donated $125,000 to double the prize fund to $250,000. The other thing was an infamous phone call. Twenty-two-year-old Bobby Fischer playing in the Capablanca Memorial chess tournament in Cuba via telex at the Marshall Chess Club in New York, 1965. When Fischer picked up the phone on Monday, July 3, it was none other than Henry Kissinger on the line, Nixon’s national security advisor and future secretary of state. Kissinger’s opening sentence is usually cited as, “This is the worst chess player in the world calling the best chess player in the world.” Kissinger made the point that the match was necessary for the prestige of the United States, and that Fischer should go and play. That evening, Fischer finally boarded a plane to Reykjavík. In his 2011 book On China, Kissinger returned to the game of chess as he explained the differences between Western and Chinese political strategies by comparing them to chess and wéiqí (Go). Invented in China about 2,500 years ago, Go is older than chess and even more complex. Played on a 19×19 grid, players have 180 stones each and take turns to put them on one of the grid’s 361 intersections. After being so placed, stones do not move but can be captured when surrounded by the opponent’s stones. Kissinger noted: “If chess is about the decisive battle, wéiqí is about the protracted campaign. The chess player aims for total victory. The wéiqí player seeks relative advantage. In chess, the player always has the capability of the adversary in front of him; all the pieces are always fully deployed. The wéiqí player needs to assess not only the pieces on the board but the reinforcements the adversary is in a position to deploy.” The location of the Fischer–Spassky duel lay, not insignificantly, right between the US and the Soviet Union. It was the height of the Cold War, and the match could easily be seen as a symbolic fight between the capitalistic West and the Communist East, a point that wasn’t missed by the media. In hindsight, we should take all this with a grain of salt. Spassky wasn’t a strong Soviet patriot like some of his colleagues, while Fischer’s erratic and sometimes plain unpleasant behavior didn’t make him the perfect representative for his country either. Besides, at the highest diplomatic levels, the US and the USSR weren’t exactly rubbing hands for a military clash—perhaps for them, the match was a better, more peaceful way to fight it out, as the wise Qaflān had suggested in ancient India. Politics is the area that supplied several chess expressions to our language. The most common include: keeping an enemy “in check”; a minor entity being described as a mere “pawn” in a larger game; and a political “stalemate.” But there’s more. Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said before the first Republican presidential candidate debate in 2016: “The best politicians play chess, but most candidates play checkers. The chess players know you have to be willing to lose a piece or two to win the game … but if Jeb Bush wants to survive the ‘Trumpnado’ and become the nominee he needs to be, he should play a little chess, get out of Iowa, and get to New Hampshire as soon as possible.” There are numerous further examples, but I particularly like the following by former state counselor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, shortly after her National League for Democracy party won the 2015 elections: “If you look at the democratic process as a game of chess, there have to be many, many moves before you get to checkmate. And simply because you do not make any checkmate in three moves does not mean it’s stalemate. There’s a vast difference between no checkmate and stalemate. This is what the democratic process is.” One politician who shouldn’t be named in the same sentence as chess—at least as far as Garry Kasparov is concerned—is Vladimir Putin. Retired as a chess player since 2005, Kasparov is a fierce opponent of the Russian leader, and in an interview with Der Spiegel in 2015, he proclaimed, “Putin is more of a poker player. In poker, unlike chess, you can effectively compensate for a very weak hand by bluffing. There are fixed rules in chess, and no one knows how the game will end. Things are currently the other way around in Putin’s realm.” Russian politics have been deeply intertwined with chess for a long time. It should be noted that chess was already quite popular in the big Russian empire (that included parts of current-day Poland and the Baltic countries), where big names like Mikhail Chigorin, Alexander Alekhine, Aron Nimzowitsch, and Akiba Rubinstein were from. After the revolution in 1917, the game developed into a means of propaganda for the Bolsheviks, whose leaders Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Nikolai Krylenko were all chess players. Luxurious tournaments were held in Moscow in 1935 and 1936 to show the world that in Russia, grandmasters were treated as kings. When the USSR beat the US with a big margin in a radio match in 1945, Stalin congratulated his team. The Soviet state strongly supported chess education in order to create the best players in the world, thereby demonstrating the intelligence and sophistication of the Soviet people. Between 1995 and 2018, FIDE was led by the eccentric Russian oligarch Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who was also president of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Russian Federation from 1993 to 2010. The chess world mostly remembers him for his friendly ties with dubious leaders like Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, and Bashar al-Assad; his claim to have been abducted by aliens; and his administration’s alleged involvement in the murder of a journalist in 1998, although there was no proof of his involvement. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former deputy prime minister and a former assistant to the president of the Russian Federation, succeeded Ilyumzhinov in 2018. Especially in the eyes of Western chess federations, Dvorkovich’s presidency became problematic when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Dvorkovich was nonetheless re-elected in August 2022 for a second term. In December 2023, FIDE voted to remove the two-term limit for its presidency, a “good-governance” measure Dvorkovich himself had introduced after announcing it during his 2018 campaign. After this remarkable 180-degree turn, the strong Russian (Kremlin?) influence on the chess world is not expected to end soon. Chess and Sports In a promo video produced by Puma in December 2023, Magnus Carlsen and soccer manager Pep Guardiola talked about the similarities between chess and soccer. Carlsen noted the games are comparable, saying: “I think both in chess and soccer, the important thing is to control the middle, so that’s one thing. If you control the middle, you control the pitch or the board. Another thing is that often in chess you attack on one side, force the opponent to overload, and then you switch, and you have an advantage on the other side in terms of space. It’s remarkably similar.” Guardiola shares an interest in chess with fellow managers Quique Setién and Felix Magath and players past and present including Edgar Davids, Fernando Torres, Christian Pulisic, and Mo Salah. Fans of chess from other sports include Steve Davis (snooker), Boris Becker, Daniil Medvedev, Andrey Rublev, Carlos Alcaraz (tennis), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Klay Thompson (basketball), Charles Leclerc, Carlos Sainz, Mick Schumacher (Formula 1), John Urschel, Chidobe Awuzie (football) and Ravichandran Ashwin (cricket). Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the sport with possibly the largest number of chess enthusiasts is said to resemble chess the most: boxing. Three-time heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is a chess fan and taught his corner team to play. The Ukrainian brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, who share 40 world heavyweight title fight wins between them, love to play chess as well, which is also the case for Manny Pacquiao, Anthony Joshua, and the MMA fighters Conor McGregor and Aljamain Sterling. Like his colleagues, Lewis said he used chess to “stay mentally sharp,” for example, when he was preparing for the 2003 “Battle of the Titans” with Vitali Klitschko, who commented before the match, “First I beat Lewis on the chessboard, and then we meet in the ring.” In the end, it was Lewis who won by technical knockout. Speaking of which, did you know that chessboxing is a thing? People have played chess while hanging on a parachute or while bathing in a lake of freezing cold water, so putting a chessboard and pieces inside a boxing ring perhaps isn’t so crazy. After all, we’re dealing with another two-person confrontation where the anticipation of the opponent’s moves is key. It works as follows: the two contestants, reasonably trained in both disciplines, play alternating boxing and blitz-chess rounds until someone wins by either knockout or checkmate (or if the opponent’s clock time runs out). I happened to be present at the first official competition, on November 14, 2003, held by the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO) in Paradiso, Amsterdam, between Luis the Lawyer (Jean Louis Veenstra) and Iepe the Joker (Iepe Rubingh). The latter won after his opponent lost on time in a winning position. Rubingh, the main event organizer, was a Dutch conceptual artist who sadly passed away in 2020 at age 45. The history of chessboxing goes back even further: it featured in the 1979 kung fu film Mystery of Chess Boxing by Joseph Kuo (where Chinese chess, xiangqi, is played), which the band Wu-Tang Clan referred to in their 1993 song “Da Mystery of Chessboxin.’ ” On December 11, 2022, chessboxing found itself under the spotlight again when the popular YouTuber Ludwig Ahgren organized the Mogul Chessboxing Championship. Twelve of the biggest content creators on YouTube and Twitch, all with an interest in chess (more on that in Chapter 10), stepped into the ring in front of 10,000 fans inside the Galen Center in Los Angeles and 558,000 viewers online, who enjoyed commentary by Levy Rozman, chessboxing world champion Matt Thomas, and Ludwig himself. The Canadian grandmaster (GM) Aman Hambleton won the matchup among the chess experts by beating international master (IM) Lawrence Trent with a technical knockout. The highlight of the evening was the fight between two chess content creators, where Dina Belenkaya initially won, as Andrea Botez resigned the chess game. (Both were seasoned chess players who had spent months in the gym training for the boxing part.) However, fans quickly pointed out that the referee had made a mistake. Before that final chess session, Belenkaya had received four eight-second standing counts, which should have been enough for Botez to win on a technical knockout (TKO). Two days after the fight, the organizers adjusted the result, writing on social media: “After discussing with the players, we are not reversing Dina Belenkaya’s win because the fighters played it out in the moment, and she competed valiantly. However, we have decided to award Andrea a belt for her performance and to correct the decision that was made in the ring.” The British philosopher and radio documentary maker David Edmonds described the sport in BBC News Magazine as follows: “Chess and boxing seems as bizarre a pairing as anything, but they do have something in common. One is a duel often characterized by cruelty, ruthlessness, and violence. And boxing is much the same.” Chess Is Everything The oldest tools used to play board games are at least five millennia old. In his landmark 1938 book Homo Ludens, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga analyzed play as a cultural phenomenon: “For many years the conviction has grown upon me that civilization arises and unfolds in and as play.” Elsewhere, he writes that playing games is “older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing.” Chess quickly became the most popular game when it entered Western society. It was prominently depicted in medieval texts and art, and is still firmly embedded in our culture. The big question is: why chess? What is it with chess that “beat” other board games, dice, cards, etc., to become the dominant game in our society? In a conversation for this book, Sir Tim Rice summarized: “The game is in some respects a metaphor for life. You’ve got pawns who don’t have much power. You’ve got kings and queens who’ve got a lot more power. This is all very interesting, and so, obviously, it’s very easy to make those pieces a metaphor for aspects of life. And many great writers have done that.” In his 2023 documentary Through the Mirror of Chess: A Cultural Exploration, the filmmaker and author Howard Burton has suggested that the dominance of chess has to do with the complexity of the game resulting from the different pieces having different values and different movements: “Chess is special because it isn’t just the fact that it uses an array of different types of pieces that need to be coordinated with each other. It’s that each piece is constantly, ever so subtly, changing its value depending on its position with respect to all the others. And it’s precisely this highly nuanced, constantly shifting dance of individual pieces and overall positions that gives chess its unique aesthetic appeal.” My own view on chess comes closest to what Robert Desjarlais wrote in his 2011 book Counterplay: An Anthropologist at the Chessboard: “Chess play entails narrative intrigue. Undertaking a chess game trips a sense of adventure, of venturing into surprises and unanticipated situations.” Although the pieces were initially created as members of a small army, they’ve always felt more like characters in a story to me. I’ve always thought of a game of chess as a tale written by two authors who don’t know yet where things will go. This analogy perhaps works even stronger for me as a serious player who needs to write down his moves on a scoresheet (per official regulations). This means that after the story is over, it is stored forever in the human knowledge database for everyone to pick up and enjoy. For anyone who has read many chess books that discuss master games from the past, the comparison with literature comes naturally. Marcel Duchamp—a key figure in the Dada movement and one of the most influential twentieth-century artists—must have had something similar in mind when he said, in a short speech at a banquet of the New York State Association of Chess in 1952, “Actually, I believe that every chess player experiences a mixture of two aesthetic pleasures: first the abstract image akin to the poetic idea of writing; second the sensuous pleasure of the ideographic execution of that image on the chessboard.” I would like to add another aspect: the element of time. For advanced players, it is common to use a chess clock during a game, but every single move, in itself, is a fundamental element of time. When fully immersed in a complicated game, you get the sense that the longer a player thinks, the more you feel time is frozen. At such moments, you feel inside a separate world, an existence cut off from reality—the same experience as reading a book or watching a movie. This is what chess means to me, but it’s just one personal approach. Chess has meant so many different things to different people, starting from a war game for the Indians and Arabs, a symbol of social hierarchy in medieval times, an art form in itself, “the touchstone of intellect” (Goethe), a social enterprise, an organized sport, and a complex of problems that can be approached scientifically, as we will see in the third chapter. The Dutch grandmaster and author Jan Hein Donner once stated that “chess cannot be compared with anything” while “many things can be compared with chess.” I believe what he actually did was point out that there are apparent similarities between chess and many aspects of life, as long as you also acknowledge that chess is unique in itself. How else can I end this chapter than by quoting my favorite player of all time, Bobby Fischer, who said, “Chess is life.”",

      "content": "Chapter 2Duchamp, Nabokov, Bogart, Kubrick: Chess in the Arts “It’s a great huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the world—if this is the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them!” —Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 In 1923 Marcel Duchamp decided quite suddenly to interrupt his art career … to play chess. Years later, he said, “While not all artists are chess players, all chess players are artists.” He became a fanatic and eventually master-level player who participated in the French Championships and even represented his country at four Chess Olympiads. He justified his sudden switch to a chess career by stating that chess “has all the beauty of art—and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.” The story goes that Duchamp was so crazy about chess that in the first week after getting married to his first wife, Lydie Sarazin-Levassor, in 1927, he hardly spent any time with her but instead visited the chess club every night. She got so angry that she glued the pieces to his chessboard. The marriage didn’t last long. Chess as an Art Form Many will see chess as a mere board game, while others may accept it as a sport. To anyone who has dedicated more than just a few months of their life to it, chess is also an art. Among the infinite number of possible games and positions, there is so much hidden beauty, invisible to the untrained eye but an enormous pleasure to everyone willing to go beyond merely knowing the rules of the game. Chess is a labyrinth of endless pathways often paved with brilliant gems—as long as you keep looking for them. The ancient Arabic manṣūbāt, mentioned in the previous chapter, often had rather ingenious solutions that can easily be described as pretty or artistic. In the last two centuries, this old tradition has developed into the field of endgame studies (positions where one side can win or defend to a draw beautifully) and problems (positions where a forced checkmate needs to be found). Many chess compositions are considered pieces of art, and their composers are true artists of the game. The Russian Alexey Troitsky (1866–1942), the Frenchman Henri Rinck (1870–1952), and the Armenian Genrikh Kasparyan (1910–95) can be considered the Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven of endgame composition. The notion of chess as an art form is also reflected by the fact that our game had its so-called romantic period during the late-eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries. It may be a stretch to claim that this was directly influenced by Romanticism in the arts, but the periods did overlap. While Eugène Delacroix, Francisco Goya, Caspar David Friedrich, and John Constable created their masterpieces on canvas, players like Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, and the American genius Paul Morphy did the same on the chessboard. The “romantic” aspect of their chess was characterized by aggressive, tactical play that often involved gambits (pawn or even piece sacrifices in the opening) to attack the opponent’s king from the get-go. Two games by Anderssen—true artistic (and romantic!) masterpieces—have received names: the “Immortal” game, played against Lionel Kieseritzky at the London 1851 tournament; and the “Evergreen” game against Jean Dufresne in Berlin in 1852 (see annotated games on pages 382–84). (It was a kind of swashbuckling style of play, perhaps comparable with the English soccer club Arsenal under Arsène Wenger, or with the now fairly extinct service-volley style in tennis.) Wilhelm Steinitz, the first official world champion, has been deemed responsible for halting these crazy attackers as he led the foundations of positional, strategic play. About half a century later, Modernism, the art movement, reflected the newly emerging industrial world, and saw its counterpart in chess. It was called “hypermodernism,” a strategic approach where a player intentionally avoided occupying the center of the board with pawns early in the game, opting to control it from a distance, or intending to counterattack the opponent’s pawn center. This style of play came into swing in the 1920s as a reaction to the classical principles of chess, which typically advocated the center’s direct occupation and control. Key figures associated with hypermodern chess were Richard Réti and Aron Nimzowitsch, who both penned their thoughts in books considered classics. A century later, top-level chess mixes both classical and hypermodern ideas. Sometimes, single moves in a chess game are simultaneously brilliant and beautiful. Chess fans get a sparkle in their eyes in recognition of their appeal when they see Frank Marshall’s astonishing final move in his game with Stefan Levitsky (Breslau, 1912; see annotated game on page 384), Anatoly Karpov’s unexpected knight retreat against Garry Kasparov (Moscow, 1984; see pages 387–88), or Alexei Shirov’s stunning bishop sacrifice against Veselin Topalov (Linares, 1998; see pages 392–93). The chess pieces themselves can also be pure works of art. When I asked the Dutch former top grandmaster Jan Timman what initially attracted him to chess as a young boy, his answer was, “the pieces.” In his case, it was his grandmother’s beautifully decorated chess set, although even the pieces of the standard version can be inspiring. Officially sanctioned by FIDE, the Staunton chess set is named after the nineteenth-century English top player Howard Staunton. However, credit should go to the journalist Nathaniel Cooke, who designed the pieces in 1849, while Staunton only endorsed the set. Long before the Staunton pieces became the standard—afterward, too—an incredible variety of sets were designed containing the most beautiful chess pieces you can imagine. Archeological findings of chess pieces from the earliest times in India don’t exist, but it is assumed they depicted humans and animals. That is also the case for the oldest chess pieces that have survived, which were discovered in 1977 at the ancient site of Afrasiyab in Northern Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and date back to between the late sixth and early eighth centuries. Pieces from the subsequent Arabic period have a more basic design. As the beliefs of the day prohibited the depiction of humans or animals, those pieces were of quite abstract shapes, holding three geometrical forms: the cylinder, the rectangle, and the cone. During the Middle Ages, the shape of the chess pieces gradually changed under the influence of Christian culture, often showing more human-like figures. The most famous medieval chess pieces are the Lewis Chessmen: twelfth-century pieces discovered on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in 1831. They were almost certainly brought there by the Vikings, demonstrating that chess was already known and played in Scandinavia in the 1100s. These beautiful pieces were made of walrus tusks, varying in height from 3.5 to 10.2 centimeters. Except for the pawns, all the 79 pieces found (from multiple, incomplete chess sets) depict human figures: the knights are mounted on horses and are shown holding spears and shields, while the rooks are standing soldiers or “warders” holding shields and swords. At an auction in 2019 one of those warders, which had been kept in a drawer in Scotland for 55 years, was sold for £735,000 ($933,000). The king and queen pieces from the Lewis Chessmen, a set made in the twelfth century from walrus ivory and discovered in Scotland in 1831. Various materials have been used to make chess sets, such as ivory, bone, and different types of woods, but also rock-crystal, jasper, amber, and even silver or gold. Queen Margaret of England (1430–82) is said to have possessed green and red chess pieces made of jasper and crystal. Another common idea has been that the two armies of chess pieces represent real-life armies—for instance, a “Battle of Waterloo” chess set, with Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington as the adversary kings. (Wasn’t chess supposed to be a way to fight a war without bloodshed? Well, that didn’t work out for humanity, so instead we playfully depict bloody battles on the chessboard.) At some point, designs returned to more abstract forms, eventually leading to the Staunton pieces, although artists continued to be inspired by the royal game and often designed unique chess sets. Beautiful examples include Josef Hartwig’s minimalist 1923 design that followed the Bauhaus art school, where the shape of the cube-like pieces reflects how they move, and Man Ray’s equally abstract but more rounded design from 1920. Man Ray was not the only Dadaist who designed chess sets; the same can be said for his friends Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp was famous for his “readymades,” such as the porcelain urinal (titled Fountain) he declared a piece of art, because he could, in 1917. He was a hero of the early anti-art movement and a forefather of postmodernism. In his earlier work as a painter, before he became a fanatic player, chess played a prominent role. His 1910 work The Chess Game is painted fairly realistically, while his The Chess Players from a year later fits the Cubist movement of that time. Chess and art were not two completely separate territories for Duchamp. The two worlds came together at an exhibition in 1966 titled Homage to Caissa, also the title of a readymade chessboard that is missing its pieces. The exhibition opened on the rooftop of 978 Madison Avenue in New York, where Duchamp played chess with Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol. In 1968, Duchamp appeared with the avant-garde composer and music theorist John Cage (famous for his piece “4´33˝”—four minutes and 33 seconds of silence) at a concert titled Reunion. The two played a chess game on a special board with audio outputs connected to photoelectric cells underneath the board, so each move created a sound. In one of his interviews, Duchamp said, “I tried to protect my work with silence by dedicating myself for a long time to the game of chess. That is a game which always enthralled me because of its complexity. I always loved complexity.” I’d like to think that a love for complexity also defined his special relationship with art. The art photographer Julian Wasser, who passed away in early 2023, owed part of his celebrity to an iconic photo that he took in 1963 of Duchamp playing chess against the fully nude writer Eve Babitz at the Pasadena Art Museum in Los Angeles. In the 2009 book Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Chess, Francis Naumann and Bradley Bailey explored Duchamp’s chess career, and the two-time United States chess champion Jennifer Shahade analyzed 15 of his games. On this occasion, she shot a performance art video at the Philadelphia Soundstages inspired by the Duchamp versus Babitz picture. Shahade turned it around, playing with clothes herself (though wearing a corset) against a fully naked man named Jason Bretz. The two used a beautiful chess set, the pieces of which were also naked figures. Afterward, Shahade noted in a story on her website, “One great thing about playing against a naked man in chess is that there are no pockets for electronic devices, so you can be absolutely sure he is not cheating.” (At the height of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal, organizing a tournament involving participants wearing swimming shorts was jokingly suggested, as we will learn in Chapter 7.) It is a sign of the importance of chess in our culture that the game has been represented in the visual arts many thousands of times over the centuries. Some well-known examples include Lucas van Leyden’s The Game of Chess (1508), which you can see in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin; Sofonisba Anguissola’s The Chess Game (1555), hanging in the National Museum in Poznań, Poland; and Honoré Daumier’s The Chess Players (c. 1863–67), to be found in the Petit Palais in Paris. More recent examples are Chessboard, Glass, and Dish (1917) by the Spanish Cubist Juan Gris, to be found in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and M. C. Escher’s Metamorphosis II (1939), at the Escher in Het Paleis Museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. In these works, chess often functions as a metaphor, reflecting a strategic setting, a complex battle, a symbolic fight against fate, or the proximity of victory or defeat. Personally, I think the inner beauty of the board and pieces was often enough inspiration for artists to depict the game. De schaakspelers (Game of Chess), a painting by Dutch painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden, 1508. The most rudimentary meaning of chess is that of war. The earliest chess pieces reflected members of the Indian armies, with, as noted, specially designed chessmen who modeled actual armies of real-life battles. One avant-garde artist had a fundamentally different take, and she was the first to present it vigorously as a game of peace: Yoko Ono. Ono’s art installation Play it by Trust consists of a large and entirely white chess set. Half of the chessboard’s squares are placed on a slightly different level to maintain the checkered pattern, while both sets of pieces are painted white. The chess set is also a metaphor here, but, in this case, represents the futility of war, as the artist encourages humans to unite rather than divide. The installation was first exhibited in 1966 in London’s Indica Gallery and featured in her late husband John Lennon’s 1972 television film Imagine, which was soundtracked by the album of the same name. Half a century later, in March 2024, Sean Lennon, son of John and Yoko, won an Academy Award for his short animated film War Is Over! The film holds an anti-war message as well and shows two soldiers from rival armies playing chess with each other by sending their moves across the battlefield via carrier pigeon. Chess and Literature In a popular romantic story originating in France around 1160, Floris is trying to rescue Blancheflour, who is being kept in the emir’s tower. By playing chess with the tower watchman, Floris gains admission to the prison. In the Tristan en prose (Prose Tristan) from around the same time, the knight Tristan is sent to Ireland by King Mark to fetch his bride, Iseult. On the way back, while on a boat and immersed in a chess game, the two accidentally drink a love potion and fall in love, with disastrous consequences. Like in art, chess has been a source of inspiration in literature from a very early age. Chess plays an even greater role in the Roman van Walewein (Romance of Gawain), a Middle Dutch chivalric romance from the thirteenth century, in which a magic chessboard suddenly flies in through the window as King Arthur and his knights enjoy a banquet at Camelot. After the board flies away again, Arthur announces that whoever can fetch it for him will inherit his fortunes. Walewein (Gawain) goes for it and eventually brings it back after experiencing many adventures that involve slaying dragons, saving a damsel, and obtaining a special magical sword. Those were the days! The Roman van Walewein can be read as a traditional chivalric romance. However, some parts suggest that the authors Penninc and Pieter Vostaert were toying with the genre, as their story includes satirical elements. In general—and this can be said about many medieval literary texts involving chess—the story commented on the political order of the time. In his 2006 book The Immortal Game, David Shenk convincingly explains why chess was so well equipped for metaphorical usage (italics by Shenk): It largely came down to the fact that chess had been designed as a symbol to begin with. Out of the box, it came furnished with a wide variety of generic attributes that lent themselves to an even wider variety of metaphorical applications: chess was a battle between two groups, each stratified by social ranking, contesting for dominance over a finite piece of geography, interacting in a dynamic so complex it seemed to take on a life of its own, each army manipulated by a player, battling each other with wits rather than brawn, employing both tactics (short-term planning) and strategy (long-term planning), in a game that could never truly be mastered. Chess, therefore, lent itself perfectly to the allegory, a literary form that was highly popular in the Middle Ages. This way of using a narrative or visual representation to communicate a hidden meaning, often with moral or political significance, came from both biblical and classical traditions and was readily recognized by the readers of the time. The omnipresence of allegorical stories that involved chess, usually called “moralities,” emphasized the game’s status and further helped spread it. The oldest chess morality is a thirteenth-century Latin treatise titled Quaedam moralitas de scaccario. H. J. R. Murray called it Innocent Morality and summarized: “The world resembles a chessboard which is chequered white and black, the colors showing the two conditions of life and death, or praise and blame. The chessmen are men of this world who have a common birth, occupy different stations and hold different titles in this life, who contend together, and finally have a common fate which levels all ranks. The king often lies under the other pieces in the bag.” One of my favorite chess expressions goes: “At the end of the chess game, both the king and the pawn go back into the same box.” It seems to date back to Innocent Morality. I love the added detail that the king is often lying under other pieces—a similar lesson in humility as the one from the Brahmin mathematician Sissa (see page 11). The best example of a chess morality is the Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium super ludo scacchorum (Book of the Morals of Men and the Duties of Nobles and Commoners, on the Game of Chess) by the Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis, a very famous work from the mid-thirteenth century. According to Murray, the number of existing manuscripts and translations suggests that its popularity “must have almost rivaled that of the Bible itself.” Cessolis’s work further established that chess was a symbolic representation of society. The king, queen, and knight have their expected roles, but he described the alfils (bishops) as the judges, the rooks as the king’s governors, and the pawns as members of the common people, who represented eight different trades or professions. Unlike the Roman van Walewein, the Liber does not have the king as a center point but concerns all members of society, who should learn the game so they will be able to master their role. A facsimile of a page with a woodcut illustration of a chess player, from William Caxton’s The Game and Playe of Chesse, 1474—a translation of an earlier work by Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis. A few decades after the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press (which was around 1440), the English merchant William Caxton published Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye in 1473, a collection of stories associated with Homer’s Iliad. Caxton printed The Game and Playe of Chesse a year later, his translation of Cessolis’s book. What was probably the second book ever to be printed in the English language had chess all over it. Scachs d’amor (Chess of Love), a poem written around 1475 and published in Valencia, is significant for being the earliest available source delineating the new powers of the chess queen. The poem uses chess as an allegory for love: it describes a chess game between two players representing the gods Mars and Venus, while a referee (Mercury) watches over them. Almost half a century after Scachs d’amor was written, another chess poem appeared: Scacchia ludus (The Game of Chess), from 1527, by the Italian humanist, bishop, and poet Hieronymus Vida (Marco Girolamo Vida). This lengthy poem, written in Latin, was very popular for over a century and was reprinted more than 40 times. Once again an allegory for love, it describes a mythological chess game between Apollo and Mercury in the presence of the other gods and a nymph called Scacchis. In 1763, the British philologist and orientalist William Jones used it to write a chess poem, replacing “Scacchis” with “Caissa,” nowadays known as the goddess of chess. In chess literature, Caissa usually appears when discussing luck; for instance, a writer describing a fortunate victory can say, “Caissa was on my side.” (I’ve used that phrase myself too many times.) Go figure: the game’s divine protector is a woman, albeit one that you will not find in the writings of Homer or Sophocles. Caissa is a tawdry invention from the post-Renaissance. Although I play myself for a Dutch chess club named after Caissa, it’s hard not to see her as some kind of a kitsch goddess—the Betty Boop of the Greek gods, if you will. Chess continued to play a respectable role in written text in the following centuries, showing that the game was here to stay. In three books, chess plays a key part from start to finish. Stefan Zweig’s Die Schachnovelle (The Royal Game, also published as Chess Story) and Vladimir Nabokov’s Zashchita Luzhina (The Defense or The Luzhin Defense) have always been considered to be the “big two.” Since 2020, Walter Tevis’s novel The Queen’s Gambit should perhaps be mentioned in the same breath. Written by two literary heavyweights of the twentieth century, The Royal Game and The Defense were highly successful. Both deal with characters who are deeply obsessed with chess while also showing the destructive powers the game can have. In that sense, the two works have helped create the chess grandmaster’s archetype of the tormented genius. It’s a common and regrettable prejudice to think that brilliance in chess necessarily goes hand in hand with some form of lunacy. Still, I wouldn’t want to suggest that chess would have been better off without these books. The Royal Game was Zweig’s last and most famous work. The Austrian-born author wrote it while in exile in Brazil, where he tragically committed double suicide with his wife Lotte in early 1942, too depressed and disillusioned about what he saw as the inevitable destruction of his “spiritual homeland Europe” by Nazi Germany. First published posthumously in late 1942, the novella draws a clear parallel with Zweig’s personal life. The personage Dr. B. also feels the fascist pressure when imprisoned by the Gestapo. While in captivity, he teaches himself chess with the help of a book full of master games. On a boat traveling from New York to Buenos Aires, Dr. B. even manages to win a game against the reigning world champion, Czentovic. During their second game, Dr. B. has to withdraw prematurely as he fears a return to his obsessive behavior during his imprisonment. There are minor flaws in the story, such as Dr. B. and Czentovic reaching world-class strength in an unrealistically short period (the latter took a mere five years from learning the rules to winning the highest title, which is as unlikely in chess as in any sport). Still, The Royal Game sold millions of copies and was translated into many languages, and rightly so. It was turned into a film four times, most recently in 2021 in Philipp Stölzl’s Chess Story. An opera based on the novel ran in 2013 in the Kiel Opera House, and a theater production was produced for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2015. Zweig is still considered an important twentieth-century author with a corpus that includes poetry, theater, short stories, and biographies, and contains numerous chess references. The Defense was Nabokov’s third novel, written after he moved to Berlin. Published in 1930, it was among his first nine novels written in Russian; an English version appeared in 1964. The book is about Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin, who learns chess as a young boy and becomes one of the world’s strongest grandmasters. Despite having a unique gift, Luzhin’s life grows increasingly unstable. Even his beautiful and intelligent wife cannot save him from his ultimately fateful escape from reality. Despite frantic efforts, Luzhin fails to exterminate chess from his life and his thoughts. Although the game fully absorbs Luzhin until it checkmates him, Nabokov doesn’t make chess the direct cause of his demise. The Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree told me, “More important are Luzhin’s youth and his relationship with his impresario. Chess was a defense against the toughness of life, which it has been for me as well, although in a less dramatic way. Life can be difficult, but you can still score your little triumphs on the chessboard.” The book was neither the first nor the last time Nabokov would reference chess, but it’s the only one that deals with the game throughout the story. The thing was: Nabokov loved chess. He even liked to create chess problems and published a book in 1970 titled Poems and Problems (a compilation of 53 poems and 18 chess problems). He wrote, “Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterize all worthwhile art: originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity.” Nabokov’s love for creating puzzles that, by definition, have only one unique solution also shines through The Defense, which even has a structure that resembles a chess game. He wrote in the preface to the English edition: “The chess effects I planted are distinguishable not only in these separate scenes; their concatenation can be found in the basic structure of this attractive novel.” Like literature, chess is an invented reality in constant tension with the actual reality. For Luzhin and the reader, these realities can be hard to separate. Chess plays a smaller but significant part in an enormous variety of books. For example, many detective stories have been written where chess skills are used to solve the mystery at stake. In a recent title, the world’s biggest chess star plays a role. Magnus Carlsen og sjakkmorderen (Magnus Carlsen and the Chess Killer) is a Norwegian graphic novel from 2020 by Aleksander Kirkwood Brown. It has Carlsen using his chess prowess to chase down a serial killer in Oslo. The best example in this category is The Eight, a novel from 1988 by Katherine Neville. The book intertwines historical and modern storylines and revolves around a mysterious and powerful chess set with a centuries-old secret. The Eight is an avant la lettre Dan Brown with lots of chess (and is much better written). I cannot talk about chess and literature without mentioning Lewis Carroll’s children’s novel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, the sequel to Alice in Wonderland. Published in 1871, Through the Looking-Glass again follows the adventures of a young girl named Alice, who this time steps through a mirror into a whimsical world where everything is reversed, including logic. Chess forms a constant theme. Early in the story, Alice discovers chess pieces that have come to life. She then meets the Red Queen, who shows her a landscape resembling a giant chessboard, but also offers to turn Alice, now a pawn in a chess game, into a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank. Alice meets all kinds of strange creatures, such as Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, and talking flowers, while making her way across the board. The Red Queen chastises Alice in an illustration by John Tenniel for Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 (dated 1872). Nabokov saw a strong resemblance between composing a chess problem and a poem, but kept them separate. Carroll did not. In his story he presents an actual chess problem before anything else. After the title page and an overview of the characters, the book features a chess diagram where White has a queen, rook, knight, and pawn, and Red has a king, queen, and knight. The task is supplied—“White Pawn (Alice) to play and win in eleven moves”—and also the solution, which is a list of moves that, at the same time, functions as an index of key moments that will occur in the story. You could say that Carroll goes a step further than Nabokov when it comes to the game played with the reader, because the solution to the diagram, at least for chess players, doesn’t strictly follow the game’s rules and therefore doesn’t make much sense. (White can actually checkmate the enemy king in just three moves.) But the fact that it’s illogical isn’t illogical in a world behind a mirror, right? In the 1887 edition of the book, the author wrote in his preface (italics by Carroll): As the chess problem given on the previous page has puzzled some of my readers, it may be well to explain that it is correctly worked out so far as the moves are concerned. The alternation of Red and White is perhaps not so strictly observed as it might be, and the “castling” of the three Queens is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace; but the “check” of the White King at move 6, the capture of the Red Knight at move 7, and the final “checkmate” of the Red King, will be found, by any one who will take the trouble to set the pieces and play the moves as directed, to be strictly in accordance with the laws of the game. That still didn’t explain things fully, and perhaps rightly so, because it’s not necessarily an author’s task to explain his book. Many interpretations have been suggested over time. Alexander Taylor provided the best one in his 1952 biography of Carroll, titled The White Knight. He pointed out that one shouldn’t read it from the perspective of one of the players who has a complete vision of the board, but from the perspective of the pieces: Alice, as a pawn, but even the queens in the story, who cannot see or understand very well what is happening around them. He based his story, not on a game of chess, but on a chess lesson or demonstration of the moves such as he gave to Alice Liddell, a carefully worked-out sequence of moves designed to illustrate the queening of a pawn, the relative powers of the pieces—the feeble king, the eccentric knight, and the formidable queen whose powers include those of rook and bishop—and finally a checkmate. That is to say, he abstracted from the game exactly what he wanted for his design, and expressed that as a game between a child of seven-and-a-half who was to “be” a White Pawn and an older player (himself) who was to manipulate the other pieces. Considering his love for mirrors, labyrinths, and chess, it is unsurprising that the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges tremendously enjoyed Carroll’s books and made multiple references to him in his writings. In his 1976 preface to the Spanish translation of Carroll’s works, Borges highlights the concept of the reciprocal dream: “Alice dreams of the Red King, who is dreaming of her, and someone warns her that if the King awakens, she will go out like a candle because she is no more than a dream of the King that she is dreaming.” Such a reciprocal dream also represents another common theme in Borges’s work (for instance in his lovely poem “Chess”), which is that of “infinite recursion”—the effect of endless representations of realities, such as in a room covered with mirrors. For Borges, as we have seen with Nabokov, chess was a metaphor for his interpretation of literature. In both cases, we create an independent world with arbitrary features while challenging our understanding of reality. This could be said for any game, but chess is not just any game—and not for Borges either. In a 1981 interview, he said, “Chess is one of the means we have to save culture, such as Latin, the study of the humanities, the reading of classics, the laws of versification, ethics.” He had clearly placed chess on another level, as he continued, lamenting, “Chess is now replaced by football, boxing, or tennis, which are games of fools, not of intellectuals.” (It makes you wonder what he would have thought about chessboxing.) Borges’s poem is just one of numerous examples where chess features prominently in poetry. In his 1981 anthology The Poetry of Chess, Andrew Waterman covered six centuries of English poetry mentioning chess, which included works from Geoffrey Chaucer, John Skelton, Richard Lovelace, Abraham Cowley, Oliver Goldsmith, William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Louis MacNeice, Robert Lowell, and John Berryman. “Chess resembles writing, painting, and music in being an obsessional mental activity preoccupied with exploring tension and complication to resolve them to triumphant harmony,” Waterman wrote in his introduction, providing another tremendous meaning to our beloved game. It would be impossible and unnecessary to try to list all books and stories with chess prominently present. To end this section, I feel obliged to mention just a few more: Agatha Christie’s The Big Four, Ilya and Evgeny Petrov’s The Twelve Chairs, Elias Canetti’s Auto-da-Fé, Samuel Beckett’s Murphy, Isaac Asimov’s Nightfall and Pebble in the Sky, Ian Fleming’s From Russia, with Love (for the latter, see page 67 of the section on films), John Healy’s The Grass Arena, J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s The Flanders Panel and What We Become, Tom Clancy’s Red Rabbit, and Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club. Chess is omnipresent in literature, seemingly more so than any other game. Matthew James Seidel observed in an essay in 2017: “The most obvious explanation why fiction is so replete with chess players is that at their core, chess and stories are about the same thing—conflict. And it is a particular kind of conflict that is utterly devoid of chance. Whether a king is playing against a beggar or a nuclear physicist against a kindergartener, all that matters are the choices you make.” That so many authors have chosen to depict chess in their works cannot be considered a coincidence. At the end of this segment about chess and literature, I should mention that there’s also an incredible wealth of chess literature: books that, to a greater or lesser extent, are of a technical nature and discuss chess openings, middlegames, endgames, players, tournaments, and many other subtopics. I was once told there are more books written about chess than about any other sport, and I think it’s true. To give you an idea: the Royal Library in The Hague has the largest collection in Europe, with around thirty thousand books on chess and draughts (checkers, but played on a ten-by-ten board). I suspect quite a small minority is about draughts. In the chess world some of these books are considered absolute classics, regarded in high esteem for the literary style in which they are written. Famous titles are My System (1925) by Aron Nimzowitsch, My 60 Memorable Games (1969) by Bobby Fischer, and The King (1987), a large selection of articles by Jan Hein Donner. All three include sentences that have become iconic and/or part of typical chess jargon. Nimzowitsch, for example, wrote, “The passed pawn is a criminal, who should be kept under lock and key. Mild measures, such as police surveillance, are not sufficient.” Fischer’s famous line “best by test” to describe his favorite first move for White (1.e4) is another one, while you will find plenty of Donner examples elsewhere in this book. Chess and Theater With literature and theater being intrinsically linked, it is not surprising that we find many chess-related stories performed on stage. If one says “theater,” you think immediately of William Shakespeare. Still, the few mentions of chess in his works (and the game Miranda and Ferdinand are playing in The Tempest) merely demonstrate that chess was widely known at the time and that some of its terminology (such as “check” and “mate”) had already enriched the English language. More notable is Thomas Middleton’s A Game at Chess from 1624. This satirical play featured a chess plot but actually alluded to Anglo-Spanish diplomacy in such a way that King James I of England made sure the performances were stopped after just nine days! We find a more significant use of chess in Samuel Beckett’s oeuvre. The Irish novelist and dramatist, who won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature, had a lifelong love for the game. Beckett played chess, studied technical books and even followed important tournaments. In his work he often used chess, exploring its artistic and metaphorical possibilities, such as in his 1938 avant-garde novel Murphy, where the main character’s involvement in a chess game also signifies his personal struggle. But since we are discussing chess and theater, I will focus on Beckett’s piece Endgame—its title doesn’t leave much room for doubt. This tragicomedy from 1957 is basically a game of chess—well, the final phase of it—performed on stage. In fact, you can distinguish multiple games of chess, as the Dutch researcher Onno Kosters suggested in an article in 1996. As the curtain opens, we see the character Hamm sitting in a wheelchair and wearing sunglasses; he is blind and unable to use his legs. Next to him stand two large metal dustbins; Hamm’s parents Nagg and Nell, both without legs, are inside them. The fourth character is Hamm’s servant, the restless Clov, who constantly threatens to leave but never does. Most of the play consists of seemingly unimportant actions, with Hamm ordering Clov to move to different places and Clov moving Hamm’s wheelchair for no understandable reason. It’s easy to see Hamm as a king, moving slowly over the chessboard, and Clov as a freedom-seeking pawn, while Nagg and Nell appear like captured pieces, no longer involved in the main action. At the same time, Hamm and Clov and Nagg and Nell seem involved in a chess game against each other. And then, there is the game played between the playwright and his audience. According to James Acheson, a former Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, this particular game serves the purpose of frustrating “our attempts to interpret Endgame definitively; checkmate occurs when we recognize that the play is deliberately designed to resist even the most ingenious of explications.” Probably the most famous chess-related stage performance is the musical production Chess, conceived by Sir Tim Rice, with music by ABBA’s male half, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson. After a concept album was released in the autumn of 1984, the show opened in London’s West End in 1986, where it ran for nearly three years. Although it didn’t have a major Broadway run, the musical was still quite successful as it was also performed in Sydney, Los Angeles, Stockholm, Florence, Moscow, Budapest, Tokyo, and St. Louis, among other places. The hit song “One Night in Bangkok,” from the musical’s 1984 concept album, topped the charts in countries including West Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, and South Africa. The plot centers on two rival chess grandmasters—Freddie Trumper from the United States, and Anatoly Sergievsky from the Soviet Union—playing a world championship match in Merano, Italy. As the championship progresses, a love triangle emerges, with Florence Vassy, Freddie’s assistant and former lover, becoming romantically involved with Anatoly. The match itself is not only a battle of chess strategy but also a reflection of the political tensions between the two superpowers. So, once again, we see the game of chess used effectively as a metaphor: the musical portrays the ideological struggles of the Cold War era, with the American–Soviet rivalry serving as a backdrop to the characters’ personal struggles. The musical was inspired by the famous 1972 Fischer–Spassky world championship match. Rice, already famous as the author of the lyrics for Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, was among the millions who closely followed the “Match of the Century.” “It was the characters, the East–West clash, and the politics that drew me in,” Rice told me. He said he built the two main characters on Fischer and Spassky: “I found it interesting that Fischer was being not a very nice man, and yet he was meant to be the on the side of the good guys, being an American, a Westerner—and Spassky was meant to be an evil, commie bastard, but he was a nice guy.” It should be noted that the Sergievsky character also possessed elements of Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi, the two who played world championships in 1978 in Baguio City, Philippines, and in 1981 in Merano, Italy—Rice even visited the latter event. Sergievsky’s defection from the Soviet Union, seeking asylum at the British embassy, matches Korchnoi’s defection in 1976; and the Leonid Viigand character, who appears in the second act, has elements based on Karpov. The musical’s premiere in 1986 was met with disapproval in the Soviet Union, where the songs were banned for a long time. Thirty-four years later, in October 2020, the musical was performed in Russia for the first time. The 1,800-seat MDM Theatre in Moscow was sold out, and the show ran for two years. Rice told me it was quite special for him: “I was more excited about the Russian production than any other, really. In a way, the Russian character is more the central character than the American one. If it’s anybody’s story, it’s Anatoly’s story, or possibly Florence’s. But, who knows? I am not sure I know, and I wrote it!” Chess on the Big Screen Countless movies have included chess in one way or another, from a seemingly random prop in the background to a full-blown scene with dialogue, or anything in between. In a 2004 article in New in Chess magazine, David Edmonds and John Eidinow have pointed out that it has often served as a signaling system: “Chess has been used to create atmosphere and tone and to make instant narrative references to personality, temperament, and states of mind. Indeed, it is hard to think of any other pastime that would allow such a range of instant visual allusions and offer directors such certainty that they will be read appropriately by the general audience, no matter how fleeting the scene.” In many famous films, chess plays more than just a minor role. One of the earliest and possibly best examples is Ingmar Bergman’s classic The Seventh Seal, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and further cemented Bergman’s position as a world-class director. The story is set during the Black Death pandemic in the fourteenth century and follows a knight named Antonius Block and his squire, Jöns, who return from the Crusades to a plague-ridden Sweden. Block challenges Death to a chess game to delay his demise and seek answers about the meaning of life, while encountering various characters who represent different aspects of human existence and belief. Using chess, the film explores themes of existentialism, faith, and the search for meaning in the face of mortality. A still from Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, 1957, with Bengt Ekerot as Death, left, and Max von Sydow as the knight Antonius Block, right. In his 1971 book A Short History of the Movies, Gerald Mast noted that death is treated as a bitter and hopeless joke and added, “Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well and live is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the Church urges in Bergman’s metaphor.” I want to briefly mention four more movies based on fiction where I feel both the chess part and the plot were done well. In the 1992 thriller Knight Moves, directed by Carl Schenkel, a chess grandmaster played by Christopher Lambert is accused of several horrid murders. In the 2000 film The Luzhin Defence, based on Nabokov’s book and directed by Marleen Gorris, John Turturro plays Luzhin; Emily Watson, his wife. Pawn Sacrifice is a 2014 biographical drama film by Edward Zwick about Bobby Fischer (played by Tobey Maguire) and his fight against the Soviet chess players. And more recently, there was The Coldest Game (2019), with an alcoholic grandmaster (Bill Pullman) who becomes involved in espionage related to the Cuban missile crisis. There are also many chess-themed movies based on true stories that can be recommended to the readers of this book, such as Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), Life of a King (2013), The Dark Horse (2014), Queen of Katwe (2016), and Critical Thinking (2020). And, although it’s not a movie, the Canadian drama series Endgame (2011) features a former Russian chess champion (played by Shawn Doyle) who uses his chess prowess to solve criminal cases. In his 2005 book Chess in the Movies, Bob Basalla collected almost two thousand films and TV shows, described their “chessic content” and provided details on directors, languages, and awards, as well as the “correctness” of the actual chess played in the scenes—because, it seems that more often than not in cinema there are issues with the chessboard (placed wrongly, not having a dark square in the lower left corner) or the pieces (usually the king and queen placed on the wrong starting squares). Keeping in mind the multimillion-dollar budgets of some of these titles, it’s hard to believe that such basic mistakes can be found in famous films like The Great Escape (1963), Never Say Never Again (1983), The Da Vinci Code (2006), and even the all-time number one on the Internet Movie Database Top 100, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). For chess fanatics, such errors can be rather annoying, and it is telling that Basalla, in his book, works with a special, symbol-based index system to categorize which type of error is being made in a particular film. Yes, we take such things very seriously! I remember a story by Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree where he wrote about a chess shop that he walked by on holiday and saw a chess set wrongly set up in the window. The owner told him he had done it intentionally because more customers would come inside that way. As Ree noted, it’s similar to a newly painted door having a sign that reads “just paintted” (with the double t), so that people will pay more attention. A painter like that pays more attention to detail than your average Hollywood producer. Some chess scenes form a truly iconic part of large Hollywood productions. I have always loved the opening scene of the 1963 James Bond movie From Russia with Love, where we see a chess game being played in a stunningly beautiful hall (likely a museum) on a circular stage placed on a brown-blue checkered floor. It is the Venice International Grandmasters’ Championship’s match final between Kronsteen from Czechoslovakia and MacAdams from Canada. After Kronsteen takes MacAdams’s bishop with a check, a waiter serves him a glass of water. He reads through the bottom of the glass some text on the paper coaster that says: “You are required at once.” He dries his lips with the paper, tears it, and then, as MacAdams moves his king, Kronsteen gives a decisive check with his queen. MacAdams tilts his king over (something that happens all the time in Hollywood but rarely in the real world) and congratulates his opponent, who immediately walks away from the board. Kronsteen, SPECTRE’s key asset to fight Bond in this movie, must have been one hell of a player if he could finish a game of chess whenever he needed to. The film uses a real game, played between the Russian top grandmasters Boris Spassky and David Bronstein (surely no coincidence that it sounds so similar to Kronsteen!) from 1960. In that game it was Spassky who was victorious, with the same final moves, but in the movie two of White’s central pawns had been removed from the board. For a long time it was speculated that the director, Terence Young, felt they ruined the shot aesthetically. However, a 2002 BBC Radio 4 documentary revealed that the producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman wrongly assumed that chess games are copyrighted and wanted to avoid legal issues by making this small alteration. In any case, I’d like to believe that the scene was famous enough for director Sam Mendes to place Daniel Craig behind a chessboard in the 2015 Bond film Spectre, perhaps paying homage to From Russia with Love. The chess scene in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey is also highly symbolic. In what is one of the greatest and most influential science fiction movies ever made, we see Dr. Frank Poole, one of the pilots of the spacecraft Discovery One that is bound for Jupiter, playing chess with the onboard computer HAL 9000. Frank plays at a board with 2D pieces on a screen that resembles an iPad. He stands no chance against this computer from the future. After Frank agrees to the inevitable and throws in the towel, HAL says, “Thank you for a very enjoyable game.” Annoyingly, the computer is not only unbeatable, showing it is capable of the purest form of human intellect, but also human-like. We’ll look closely at chess and artificial intelligence in the second part of this book. That Kubrick used chess in this film was unsurprising: he was a lifelong chess lover. As a teenager, he could be seen playing in New York’s Central Park or Washington Square for money, or even at tournaments at the Marshall Chess Club in Greenwich Village. Kubrick also included chess scenes in his 1956 film The Killing and even in Lolita (1962), although those were not part of chess-lover Nabokov’s book. Kubrick was also known for sometimes playing chess in between directing scenes. As Adam Feinstein wrote in New in Chess magazine, during the filming of 2001, Kubrick played many games with the American physicist Jeremy Bernstein at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Bernstein remembered Kubrick as a real hustler: “Finally, we reached the 25th game, and it was agreed that this would decide the matter. Well into the game, he made a move that I was sure was a loser. He even clutched his stomach to show how upset he was. But it was a trap, and I was promptly clobbered. ‘You didn’t know I could act too,’ he remarked.” Among the many chess-loving Hollywood actors (such as Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Laurence Fishburne, Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, and Viola Davis, to name just a few), the most fanatical and perhaps best player was Humphrey Bogart. Before his acting career (and like Kubrick), Bogart hustled opponents for small money in New York parks and at Coney Island. Bogart has been a tournament director, was active in the California State Chess Association, and often visited Hollywood’s chess club. He even held the world-class grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky to a draw in a simultaneous display in 1952 in Beverly Hills. Chess aficionado Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, play chess at their California home, c. 1949. That Bogart can be seen in front of a chessboard in Casablanca (1942) is not a coincidence, even though it was not part of the original script. The Hungarian film Curtiz from 2018, based on the making of Casablanca by director Michael Curtiz, furnished an interesting explanation: Bogart didn’t know what to do with his hands in the scenes where he was sitting and talking, so he suggested using a chess set. He put up the position himself from a correspondence game he was involved in. Because Curtiz agreed, we find chess as part of one of the most famous movies ever. Chess and Music The French eighteenth-century genius François-André Danican Philidor (see pages 19 and 79) was not only the best chess player of his time but also a talented musician. He was considered among France’s leading opera composers, creating over twenty opéras comiques. The German composer Richard Strauss liked to play chess too, as did Dmitri Shostakovich. A story the Russian composer loved to tell later in his life relayed how he once played world champion Alexander Alekhine in the lobby of a Leningrad cinema. However, the best player among all classical composers was the Russian Sergei Prokofiev—“a first-rate chess player” who “played a very vigorous, forthright game,” according to former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. (If he said so, who are we to argue?) Prokofiev was also friends with another former world champion, José Capablanca, and even beat the great Cuban once, rather convincingly, in a simul. What does it say that some famous musicians were fond of chess? It may not be such a coincidence, Achilleas Zographos argued in his 2017 book Music and Chess. According to Zographos, chess is “an art in itself” and “strongly related to mathematics and music.” He points to the many similarities between chess and music: both are a universal language (making age, gender, race, or religion irrelevant) and a means of personal expression (musicians and chess players have styles of play); both are a performance art that is played; both have symbolic languages; and both rely on patterns (chunks of notes or moves). The great Italian composer Ennio Morricone—one of the absolute giants of twentieth-century cinema; the man behind famous film scores such as Sergio Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Brian DePalma’s The Untouchables, and Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight—had something to say about this topic as well. His career spanned more than six decades as a composer, orchestrator, conductor, and trumpet player. On top of all that, he was an avid chess fan and even played serious tournaments in the 1950s before his musical career took off. In the 2019 book From Ennio Morricone: In His Own Words, Alessandro De Rosa quoted Morricone about the links between music and chess: In time, I’ve discovered that strong links exist between chess and the musical notation system, set up as it is in durations and pitches. In chess, the two dimensions remain spatial, and time is what players have at their disposal in order to make the right move. In addition there are horizontal and vertical combinations, different graphic patterns, just like musical notes in harmony. Even still, one can pair patterns and plays as if they were instrumental parts in an orchestra. Morricone’s love for the game can also be seen in different examples of his chess-related compositions throughout the years. One of these is “Chess Game,” on the soundtrack of The Endless Game (Gioco senza fine), a TV miniseries from the late 1980s. Another is “Dance of the Chess Game,” also part of a TV miniseries from the same period, Secret of the Sahara (Il Segreto del Sahara). Morricone also composed the “Chess Players’ Anthem” (Inno degli scacchisti) for the 2006 Chess Olympiad in Turin. In 2007, after he had won the Academy Honorary Award, Morricone was asked on Italian TV if he would have liked anything more than that prize. His answer: “To be a grandmaster, like Kasparov.” Chess is not alien to pop music either, with numerous appearances in lyrics or visuals. The Wu-Tang Clan’s “spiritual head” GZA released the album Grandmasters in 2005, with songs referencing chess such as “Advanced Pawns,” “Unprotected Pieces” and “Smothered Mate.” Taylor Swift must have a certain fondness for the game as she references chess in several songs, such as “Dear John” (2010). Katy Perry’s 2015 Super Bowl half-time show featured spectacular chess choreography around her song “Dark Horse.” Beyoncé’s second visual album Black Is King (2020) featured a big chess motif, with her husband Jay-Z pressing a chess clock and Beyoncé herself as an all-powerful black queen. As we have seen, chess continues to be the most prominent game to feature both as an art form in itself and in the arts, literature, theater, cinema, music, and popular culture. There is one more very important part of society where chess plays an important role: that of science. As we will see in the next chapter, science has revealed much of the game of chess, while chess has contributed massively to science.",

      "content": "Chapter 2Duchamp, Nabokov, Bogart, Kubrick: Chess in the Arts “It’s a great huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the world—if this is the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them!” —Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 In 1923 Marcel Duchamp decided quite suddenly to interrupt his art career … to play chess. Years later, he said, “While not all artists are chess players, all chess players are artists.” He became a fanatic and eventually master-level player who participated in the French Championships and even represented his country at four Chess Olympiads. He justified his sudden switch to a chess career by stating that chess “has all the beauty of art—and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.” The story goes that Duchamp was so crazy about chess that in the first week after getting married to his first wife, Lydie Sarazin-Levassor, in 1927, he hardly spent any time with her but instead visited the chess club every night. She got so angry that she glued the pieces to his chessboard. The marriage didn’t last long. Chess as an Art Form Many will see chess as a mere board game, while others may accept it as a sport. To anyone who has dedicated more than just a few months of their life to it, chess is also an art. Among the infinite number of possible games and positions, there is so much hidden beauty, invisible to the untrained eye but an enormous pleasure to everyone willing to go beyond merely knowing the rules of the game. Chess is a labyrinth of endless pathways often paved with brilliant gems—as long as you keep looking for them. The ancient Arabic manṣūbāt, mentioned in the previous chapter, often had rather ingenious solutions that can easily be described as pretty or artistic. In the last two centuries, this old tradition has developed into the field of endgame studies (positions where one side can win or defend to a draw beautifully) and problems (positions where a forced checkmate needs to be found). Many chess compositions are considered pieces of art, and their composers are true artists of the game. The Russian Alexey Troitsky (1866–1942), the Frenchman Henri Rinck (1870–1952), and the Armenian Genrikh Kasparyan (1910–95) can be considered the Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven of endgame composition. The notion of chess as an art form is also reflected by the fact that our game had its so-called romantic period during the late-eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries. It may be a stretch to claim that this was directly influenced by Romanticism in the arts, but the periods did overlap. While Eugène Delacroix, Francisco Goya, Caspar David Friedrich, and John Constable created their masterpieces on canvas, players like Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, and the American genius Paul Morphy did the same on the chessboard. The “romantic” aspect of their chess was characterized by aggressive, tactical play that often involved gambits (pawn or even piece sacrifices in the opening) to attack the opponent’s king from the get-go. Two games by Anderssen—true artistic (and romantic!) masterpieces—have received names: the “Immortal” game, played against Lionel Kieseritzky at the London 1851 tournament; and the “Evergreen” game against Jean Dufresne in Berlin in 1852 (see annotated games on pages 382–84). (It was a kind of swashbuckling style of play, perhaps comparable with the English soccer club Arsenal under Arsène Wenger, or with the now fairly extinct service-volley style in tennis.) Wilhelm Steinitz, the first official world champion, has been deemed responsible for halting these crazy attackers as he led the foundations of positional, strategic play. About half a century later, Modernism, the art movement, reflected the newly emerging industrial world, and saw its counterpart in chess. It was called “hypermodernism,” a strategic approach where a player intentionally avoided occupying the center of the board with pawns early in the game, opting to control it from a distance, or intending to counterattack the opponent’s pawn center. This style of play came into swing in the 1920s as a reaction to the classical principles of chess, which typically advocated the center’s direct occupation and control. Key figures associated with hypermodern chess were Richard Réti and Aron Nimzowitsch, who both penned their thoughts in books considered classics. A century later, top-level chess mixes both classical and hypermodern ideas. Sometimes, single moves in a chess game are simultaneously brilliant and beautiful. Chess fans get a sparkle in their eyes in recognition of their appeal when they see Frank Marshall’s astonishing final move in his game with Stefan Levitsky (Breslau, 1912; see annotated game on page 384), Anatoly Karpov’s unexpected knight retreat against Garry Kasparov (Moscow, 1984; see pages 387–88), or Alexei Shirov’s stunning bishop sacrifice against Veselin Topalov (Linares, 1998; see pages 392–93). The chess pieces themselves can also be pure works of art. When I asked the Dutch former top grandmaster Jan Timman what initially attracted him to chess as a young boy, his answer was, “the pieces.” In his case, it was his grandmother’s beautifully decorated chess set, although even the pieces of the standard version can be inspiring. Officially sanctioned by FIDE, the Staunton chess set is named after the nineteenth-century English top player Howard Staunton. However, credit should go to the journalist Nathaniel Cooke, who designed the pieces in 1849, while Staunton only endorsed the set. Long before the Staunton pieces became the standard—afterward, too—an incredible variety of sets were designed containing the most beautiful chess pieces you can imagine. Archeological findings of chess pieces from the earliest times in India don’t exist, but it is assumed they depicted humans and animals. That is also the case for the oldest chess pieces that have survived, which were discovered in 1977 at the ancient site of Afrasiyab in Northern Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and date back to between the late sixth and early eighth centuries. Pieces from the subsequent Arabic period have a more basic design. As the beliefs of the day prohibited the depiction of humans or animals, those pieces were of quite abstract shapes, holding three geometrical forms: the cylinder, the rectangle, and the cone. During the Middle Ages, the shape of the chess pieces gradually changed under the influence of Christian culture, often showing more human-like figures. The most famous medieval chess pieces are the Lewis Chessmen: twelfth-century pieces discovered on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in 1831. They were almost certainly brought there by the Vikings, demonstrating that chess was already known and played in Scandinavia in the 1100s. These beautiful pieces were made of walrus tusks, varying in height from 3.5 to 10.2 centimeters. Except for the pawns, all the 79 pieces found (from multiple, incomplete chess sets) depict human figures: the knights are mounted on horses and are shown holding spears and shields, while the rooks are standing soldiers or “warders” holding shields and swords. At an auction in 2019 one of those warders, which had been kept in a drawer in Scotland for 55 years, was sold for £735,000 ($933,000). The king and queen pieces from the Lewis Chessmen, a set made in the twelfth century from walrus ivory and discovered in Scotland in 1831. Various materials have been used to make chess sets, such as ivory, bone, and different types of woods, but also rock-crystal, jasper, amber, and even silver or gold. Queen Margaret of England (1430–82) is said to have possessed green and red chess pieces made of jasper and crystal. Another common idea has been that the two armies of chess pieces represent real-life armies—for instance, a “Battle of Waterloo” chess set, with Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington as the adversary kings. (Wasn’t chess supposed to be a way to fight a war without bloodshed? Well, that didn’t work out for humanity, so instead we playfully depict bloody battles on the chessboard.) At some point, designs returned to more abstract forms, eventually leading to the Staunton pieces, although artists continued to be inspired by the royal game and often designed unique chess sets. Beautiful examples include Josef Hartwig’s minimalist 1923 design that followed the Bauhaus art school, where the shape of the cube-like pieces reflects how they move, and Man Ray’s equally abstract but more rounded design from 1920. Man Ray was not the only Dadaist who designed chess sets; the same can be said for his friends Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp was famous for his “readymades,” such as the porcelain urinal (titled Fountain) he declared a piece of art, because he could, in 1917. He was a hero of the early anti-art movement and a forefather of postmodernism. In his earlier work as a painter, before he became a fanatic player, chess played a prominent role. His 1910 work The Chess Game is painted fairly realistically, while his The Chess Players from a year later fits the Cubist movement of that time. Chess and art were not two completely separate territories for Duchamp. The two worlds came together at an exhibition in 1966 titled Homage to Caissa, also the title of a readymade chessboard that is missing its pieces. The exhibition opened on the rooftop of 978 Madison Avenue in New York, where Duchamp played chess with Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol. In 1968, Duchamp appeared with the avant-garde composer and music theorist John Cage (famous for his piece “4´33˝”—four minutes and 33 seconds of silence) at a concert titled Reunion. The two played a chess game on a special board with audio outputs connected to photoelectric cells underneath the board, so each move created a sound. In one of his interviews, Duchamp said, “I tried to protect my work with silence by dedicating myself for a long time to the game of chess. That is a game which always enthralled me because of its complexity. I always loved complexity.” I’d like to think that a love for complexity also defined his special relationship with art. The art photographer Julian Wasser, who passed away in early 2023, owed part of his celebrity to an iconic photo that he took in 1963 of Duchamp playing chess against the fully nude writer Eve Babitz at the Pasadena Art Museum in Los Angeles. In the 2009 book Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Chess, Francis Naumann and Bradley Bailey explored Duchamp’s chess career, and the two-time United States chess champion Jennifer Shahade analyzed 15 of his games. On this occasion, she shot a performance art video at the Philadelphia Soundstages inspired by the Duchamp versus Babitz picture. Shahade turned it around, playing with clothes herself (though wearing a corset) against a fully naked man named Jason Bretz. The two used a beautiful chess set, the pieces of which were also naked figures. Afterward, Shahade noted in a story on her website, “One great thing about playing against a naked man in chess is that there are no pockets for electronic devices, so you can be absolutely sure he is not cheating.” (At the height of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal, organizing a tournament involving participants wearing swimming shorts was jokingly suggested, as we will learn in Chapter 7.) It is a sign of the importance of chess in our culture that the game has been represented in the visual arts many thousands of times over the centuries. Some well-known examples include Lucas van Leyden’s The Game of Chess (1508), which you can see in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin; Sofonisba Anguissola’s The Chess Game (1555), hanging in the National Museum in Poznań, Poland; and Honoré Daumier’s The Chess Players (c. 1863–67), to be found in the Petit Palais in Paris. More recent examples are Chessboard, Glass, and Dish (1917) by the Spanish Cubist Juan Gris, to be found in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and M. C. Escher’s Metamorphosis II (1939), at the Escher in Het Paleis Museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. In these works, chess often functions as a metaphor, reflecting a strategic setting, a complex battle, a symbolic fight against fate, or the proximity of victory or defeat. Personally, I think the inner beauty of the board and pieces was often enough inspiration for artists to depict the game. De schaakspelers (Game of Chess), a painting by Dutch painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden, 1508. The most rudimentary meaning of chess is that of war. The earliest chess pieces reflected members of the Indian armies, with, as noted, specially designed chessmen who modeled actual armies of real-life battles. One avant-garde artist had a fundamentally different take, and she was the first to present it vigorously as a game of peace: Yoko Ono. Ono’s art installation Play it by Trust consists of a large and entirely white chess set. Half of the chessboard’s squares are placed on a slightly different level to maintain the checkered pattern, while both sets of pieces are painted white. The chess set is also a metaphor here, but, in this case, represents the futility of war, as the artist encourages humans to unite rather than divide. The installation was first exhibited in 1966 in London’s Indica Gallery and featured in her late husband John Lennon’s 1972 television film Imagine, which was soundtracked by the album of the same name. Half a century later, in March 2024, Sean Lennon, son of John and Yoko, won an Academy Award for his short animated film War Is Over! The film holds an anti-war message as well and shows two soldiers from rival armies playing chess with each other by sending their moves across the battlefield via carrier pigeon. Chess and Literature In a popular romantic story originating in France around 1160, Floris is trying to rescue Blancheflour, who is being kept in the emir’s tower. By playing chess with the tower watchman, Floris gains admission to the prison. In the Tristan en prose (Prose Tristan) from around the same time, the knight Tristan is sent to Ireland by King Mark to fetch his bride, Iseult. On the way back, while on a boat and immersed in a chess game, the two accidentally drink a love potion and fall in love, with disastrous consequences. Like in art, chess has been a source of inspiration in literature from a very early age. Chess plays an even greater role in the Roman van Walewein (Romance of Gawain), a Middle Dutch chivalric romance from the thirteenth century, in which a magic chessboard suddenly flies in through the window as King Arthur and his knights enjoy a banquet at Camelot. After the board flies away again, Arthur announces that whoever can fetch it for him will inherit his fortunes. Walewein (Gawain) goes for it and eventually brings it back after experiencing many adventures that involve slaying dragons, saving a damsel, and obtaining a special magical sword. Those were the days! The Roman van Walewein can be read as a traditional chivalric romance. However, some parts suggest that the authors Penninc and Pieter Vostaert were toying with the genre, as their story includes satirical elements. In general—and this can be said about many medieval literary texts involving chess—the story commented on the political order of the time. In his 2006 book The Immortal Game, David Shenk convincingly explains why chess was so well equipped for metaphorical usage (italics by Shenk): It largely came down to the fact that chess had been designed as a symbol to begin with. Out of the box, it came furnished with a wide variety of generic attributes that lent themselves to an even wider variety of metaphorical applications: chess was a battle between two groups, each stratified by social ranking, contesting for dominance over a finite piece of geography, interacting in a dynamic so complex it seemed to take on a life of its own, each army manipulated by a player, battling each other with wits rather than brawn, employing both tactics (short-term planning) and strategy (long-term planning), in a game that could never truly be mastered. Chess, therefore, lent itself perfectly to the allegory, a literary form that was highly popular in the Middle Ages. This way of using a narrative or visual representation to communicate a hidden meaning, often with moral or political significance, came from both biblical and classical traditions and was readily recognized by the readers of the time. The omnipresence of allegorical stories that involved chess, usually called “moralities,” emphasized the game’s status and further helped spread it. The oldest chess morality is a thirteenth-century Latin treatise titled Quaedam moralitas de scaccario. H. J. R. Murray called it Innocent Morality and summarized: “The world resembles a chessboard which is chequered white and black, the colors showing the two conditions of life and death, or praise and blame. The chessmen are men of this world who have a common birth, occupy different stations and hold different titles in this life, who contend together, and finally have a common fate which levels all ranks. The king often lies under the other pieces in the bag.” One of my favorite chess expressions goes: “At the end of the chess game, both the king and the pawn go back into the same box.” It seems to date back to Innocent Morality. I love the added detail that the king is often lying under other pieces—a similar lesson in humility as the one from the Brahmin mathematician Sissa (see page 11). The best example of a chess morality is the Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium super ludo scacchorum (Book of the Morals of Men and the Duties of Nobles and Commoners, on the Game of Chess) by the Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis, a very famous work from the mid-thirteenth century. According to Murray, the number of existing manuscripts and translations suggests that its popularity “must have almost rivaled that of the Bible itself.” Cessolis’s work further established that chess was a symbolic representation of society. The king, queen, and knight have their expected roles, but he described the alfils (bishops) as the judges, the rooks as the king’s governors, and the pawns as members of the common people, who represented eight different trades or professions. Unlike the Roman van Walewein, the Liber does not have the king as a center point but concerns all members of society, who should learn the game so they will be able to master their role. A facsimile of a page with a woodcut illustration of a chess player, from William Caxton’s The Game and Playe of Chesse, 1474—a translation of an earlier work by Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis. A few decades after the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press (which was around 1440), the English merchant William Caxton published Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye in 1473, a collection of stories associated with Homer’s Iliad. Caxton printed The Game and Playe of Chesse a year later, his translation of Cessolis’s book. What was probably the second book ever to be printed in the English language had chess all over it. Scachs d’amor (Chess of Love), a poem written around 1475 and published in Valencia, is significant for being the earliest available source delineating the new powers of the chess queen. The poem uses chess as an allegory for love: it describes a chess game between two players representing the gods Mars and Venus, while a referee (Mercury) watches over them. Almost half a century after Scachs d’amor was written, another chess poem appeared: Scacchia ludus (The Game of Chess), from 1527, by the Italian humanist, bishop, and poet Hieronymus Vida (Marco Girolamo Vida). This lengthy poem, written in Latin, was very popular for over a century and was reprinted more than 40 times. Once again an allegory for love, it describes a mythological chess game between Apollo and Mercury in the presence of the other gods and a nymph called Scacchis. In 1763, the British philologist and orientalist William Jones used it to write a chess poem, replacing “Scacchis” with “Caissa,” nowadays known as the goddess of chess. In chess literature, Caissa usually appears when discussing luck; for instance, a writer describing a fortunate victory can say, “Caissa was on my side.” (I’ve used that phrase myself too many times.) Go figure: the game’s divine protector is a woman, albeit one that you will not find in the writings of Homer or Sophocles. Caissa is a tawdry invention from the post-Renaissance. Although I play myself for a Dutch chess club named after Caissa, it’s hard not to see her as some kind of a kitsch goddess—the Betty Boop of the Greek gods, if you will. Chess continued to play a respectable role in written text in the following centuries, showing that the game was here to stay. In three books, chess plays a key part from start to finish. Stefan Zweig’s Die Schachnovelle (The Royal Game, also published as Chess Story) and Vladimir Nabokov’s Zashchita Luzhina (The Defense or The Luzhin Defense) have always been considered to be the “big two.” Since 2020, Walter Tevis’s novel The Queen’s Gambit should perhaps be mentioned in the same breath. Written by two literary heavyweights of the twentieth century, The Royal Game and The Defense were highly successful. Both deal with characters who are deeply obsessed with chess while also showing the destructive powers the game can have. In that sense, the two works have helped create the chess grandmaster’s archetype of the tormented genius. It’s a common and regrettable prejudice to think that brilliance in chess necessarily goes hand in hand with some form of lunacy. Still, I wouldn’t want to suggest that chess would have been better off without these books. The Royal Game was Zweig’s last and most famous work. The Austrian-born author wrote it while in exile in Brazil, where he tragically committed double suicide with his wife Lotte in early 1942, too depressed and disillusioned about what he saw as the inevitable destruction of his “spiritual homeland Europe” by Nazi Germany. First published posthumously in late 1942, the novella draws a clear parallel with Zweig’s personal life. The personage Dr. B. also feels the fascist pressure when imprisoned by the Gestapo. While in captivity, he teaches himself chess with the help of a book full of master games. On a boat traveling from New York to Buenos Aires, Dr. B. even manages to win a game against the reigning world champion, Czentovic. During their second game, Dr. B. has to withdraw prematurely as he fears a return to his obsessive behavior during his imprisonment. There are minor flaws in the story, such as Dr. B. and Czentovic reaching world-class strength in an unrealistically short period (the latter took a mere five years from learning the rules to winning the highest title, which is as unlikely in chess as in any sport). Still, The Royal Game sold millions of copies and was translated into many languages, and rightly so. It was turned into a film four times, most recently in 2021 in Philipp Stölzl’s Chess Story. An opera based on the novel ran in 2013 in the Kiel Opera House, and a theater production was produced for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2015. Zweig is still considered an important twentieth-century author with a corpus that includes poetry, theater, short stories, and biographies, and contains numerous chess references. The Defense was Nabokov’s third novel, written after he moved to Berlin. Published in 1930, it was among his first nine novels written in Russian; an English version appeared in 1964. The book is about Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin, who learns chess as a young boy and becomes one of the world’s strongest grandmasters. Despite having a unique gift, Luzhin’s life grows increasingly unstable. Even his beautiful and intelligent wife cannot save him from his ultimately fateful escape from reality. Despite frantic efforts, Luzhin fails to exterminate chess from his life and his thoughts. Although the game fully absorbs Luzhin until it checkmates him, Nabokov doesn’t make chess the direct cause of his demise. The Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree told me, “More important are Luzhin’s youth and his relationship with his impresario. Chess was a defense against the toughness of life, which it has been for me as well, although in a less dramatic way. Life can be difficult, but you can still score your little triumphs on the chessboard.” The book was neither the first nor the last time Nabokov would reference chess, but it’s the only one that deals with the game throughout the story. The thing was: Nabokov loved chess. He even liked to create chess problems and published a book in 1970 titled Poems and Problems (a compilation of 53 poems and 18 chess problems). He wrote, “Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterize all worthwhile art: originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity.” Nabokov’s love for creating puzzles that, by definition, have only one unique solution also shines through The Defense, which even has a structure that resembles a chess game. He wrote in the preface to the English edition: “The chess effects I planted are distinguishable not only in these separate scenes; their concatenation can be found in the basic structure of this attractive novel.” Like literature, chess is an invented reality in constant tension with the actual reality. For Luzhin and the reader, these realities can be hard to separate. Chess plays a smaller but significant part in an enormous variety of books. For example, many detective stories have been written where chess skills are used to solve the mystery at stake. In a recent title, the world’s biggest chess star plays a role. Magnus Carlsen og sjakkmorderen (Magnus Carlsen and the Chess Killer) is a Norwegian graphic novel from 2020 by Aleksander Kirkwood Brown. It has Carlsen using his chess prowess to chase down a serial killer in Oslo. The best example in this category is The Eight, a novel from 1988 by Katherine Neville. The book intertwines historical and modern storylines and revolves around a mysterious and powerful chess set with a centuries-old secret. The Eight is an avant la lettre Dan Brown with lots of chess (and is much better written). I cannot talk about chess and literature without mentioning Lewis Carroll’s children’s novel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, the sequel to Alice in Wonderland. Published in 1871, Through the Looking-Glass again follows the adventures of a young girl named Alice, who this time steps through a mirror into a whimsical world where everything is reversed, including logic. Chess forms a constant theme. Early in the story, Alice discovers chess pieces that have come to life. She then meets the Red Queen, who shows her a landscape resembling a giant chessboard, but also offers to turn Alice, now a pawn in a chess game, into a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank. Alice meets all kinds of strange creatures, such as Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, and talking flowers, while making her way across the board. The Red Queen chastises Alice in an illustration by John Tenniel for Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 (dated 1872). Nabokov saw a strong resemblance between composing a chess problem and a poem, but kept them separate. Carroll did not. In his story he presents an actual chess problem before anything else. After the title page and an overview of the characters, the book features a chess diagram where White has a queen, rook, knight, and pawn, and Red has a king, queen, and knight. The task is supplied—“White Pawn (Alice) to play and win in eleven moves”—and also the solution, which is a list of moves that, at the same time, functions as an index of key moments that will occur in the story. You could say that Carroll goes a step further than Nabokov when it comes to the game played with the reader, because the solution to the diagram, at least for chess players, doesn’t strictly follow the game’s rules and therefore doesn’t make much sense. (White can actually checkmate the enemy king in just three moves.) But the fact that it’s illogical isn’t illogical in a world behind a mirror, right? In the 1887 edition of the book, the author wrote in his preface (italics by Carroll): As the chess problem given on the previous page has puzzled some of my readers, it may be well to explain that it is correctly worked out so far as the moves are concerned. The alternation of Red and White is perhaps not so strictly observed as it might be, and the “castling” of the three Queens is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace; but the “check” of the White King at move 6, the capture of the Red Knight at move 7, and the final “checkmate” of the Red King, will be found, by any one who will take the trouble to set the pieces and play the moves as directed, to be strictly in accordance with the laws of the game. That still didn’t explain things fully, and perhaps rightly so, because it’s not necessarily an author’s task to explain his book. Many interpretations have been suggested over time. Alexander Taylor provided the best one in his 1952 biography of Carroll, titled The White Knight. He pointed out that one shouldn’t read it from the perspective of one of the players who has a complete vision of the board, but from the perspective of the pieces: Alice, as a pawn, but even the queens in the story, who cannot see or understand very well what is happening around them. He based his story, not on a game of chess, but on a chess lesson or demonstration of the moves such as he gave to Alice Liddell, a carefully worked-out sequence of moves designed to illustrate the queening of a pawn, the relative powers of the pieces—the feeble king, the eccentric knight, and the formidable queen whose powers include those of rook and bishop—and finally a checkmate. That is to say, he abstracted from the game exactly what he wanted for his design, and expressed that as a game between a child of seven-and-a-half who was to “be” a White Pawn and an older player (himself) who was to manipulate the other pieces. Considering his love for mirrors, labyrinths, and chess, it is unsurprising that the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges tremendously enjoyed Carroll’s books and made multiple references to him in his writings. In his 1976 preface to the Spanish translation of Carroll’s works, Borges highlights the concept of the reciprocal dream: “Alice dreams of the Red King, who is dreaming of her, and someone warns her that if the King awakens, she will go out like a candle because she is no more than a dream of the King that she is dreaming.” Such a reciprocal dream also represents another common theme in Borges’s work (for instance in his lovely poem “Chess”), which is that of “infinite recursion”—the effect of endless representations of realities, such as in a room covered with mirrors. For Borges, as we have seen with Nabokov, chess was a metaphor for his interpretation of literature. In both cases, we create an independent world with arbitrary features while challenging our understanding of reality. This could be said for any game, but chess is not just any game—and not for Borges either. In a 1981 interview, he said, “Chess is one of the means we have to save culture, such as Latin, the study of the humanities, the reading of classics, the laws of versification, ethics.” He had clearly placed chess on another level, as he continued, lamenting, “Chess is now replaced by football, boxing, or tennis, which are games of fools, not of intellectuals.” (It makes you wonder what he would have thought about chessboxing.) Borges’s poem is just one of numerous examples where chess features prominently in poetry. In his 1981 anthology The Poetry of Chess, Andrew Waterman covered six centuries of English poetry mentioning chess, which included works from Geoffrey Chaucer, John Skelton, Richard Lovelace, Abraham Cowley, Oliver Goldsmith, William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Louis MacNeice, Robert Lowell, and John Berryman. “Chess resembles writing, painting, and music in being an obsessional mental activity preoccupied with exploring tension and complication to resolve them to triumphant harmony,” Waterman wrote in his introduction, providing another tremendous meaning to our beloved game. It would be impossible and unnecessary to try to list all books and stories with chess prominently present. To end this section, I feel obliged to mention just a few more: Agatha Christie’s The Big Four, Ilya and Evgeny Petrov’s The Twelve Chairs, Elias Canetti’s Auto-da-Fé, Samuel Beckett’s Murphy, Isaac Asimov’s Nightfall and Pebble in the Sky, Ian Fleming’s From Russia, with Love (for the latter, see page 67 of the section on films), John Healy’s The Grass Arena, J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s The Flanders Panel and What We Become, Tom Clancy’s Red Rabbit, and Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club. Chess is omnipresent in literature, seemingly more so than any other game. Matthew James Seidel observed in an essay in 2017: “The most obvious explanation why fiction is so replete with chess players is that at their core, chess and stories are about the same thing—conflict. And it is a particular kind of conflict that is utterly devoid of chance. Whether a king is playing against a beggar or a nuclear physicist against a kindergartener, all that matters are the choices you make.” That so many authors have chosen to depict chess in their works cannot be considered a coincidence. At the end of this segment about chess and literature, I should mention that there’s also an incredible wealth of chess literature: books that, to a greater or lesser extent, are of a technical nature and discuss chess openings, middlegames, endgames, players, tournaments, and many other subtopics. I was once told there are more books written about chess than about any other sport, and I think it’s true. To give you an idea: the Royal Library in The Hague has the largest collection in Europe, with around thirty thousand books on chess and draughts (checkers, but played on a ten-by-ten board). I suspect quite a small minority is about draughts. In the chess world some of these books are considered absolute classics, regarded in high esteem for the literary style in which they are written. Famous titles are My System (1925) by Aron Nimzowitsch, My 60 Memorable Games (1969) by Bobby Fischer, and The King (1987), a large selection of articles by Jan Hein Donner. All three include sentences that have become iconic and/or part of typical chess jargon. Nimzowitsch, for example, wrote, “The passed pawn is a criminal, who should be kept under lock and key. Mild measures, such as police surveillance, are not sufficient.” Fischer’s famous line “best by test” to describe his favorite first move for White (1.e4) is another one, while you will find plenty of Donner examples elsewhere in this book. Chess and Theater With literature and theater being intrinsically linked, it is not surprising that we find many chess-related stories performed on stage. If one says “theater,” you think immediately of William Shakespeare. Still, the few mentions of chess in his works (and the game Miranda and Ferdinand are playing in The Tempest) merely demonstrate that chess was widely known at the time and that some of its terminology (such as “check” and “mate”) had already enriched the English language. More notable is Thomas Middleton’s A Game at Chess from 1624. This satirical play featured a chess plot but actually alluded to Anglo-Spanish diplomacy in such a way that King James I of England made sure the performances were stopped after just nine days! We find a more significant use of chess in Samuel Beckett’s oeuvre. The Irish novelist and dramatist, who won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature, had a lifelong love for the game. Beckett played chess, studied technical books and even followed important tournaments. In his work he often used chess, exploring its artistic and metaphorical possibilities, such as in his 1938 avant-garde novel Murphy, where the main character’s involvement in a chess game also signifies his personal struggle. But since we are discussing chess and theater, I will focus on Beckett’s piece Endgame—its title doesn’t leave much room for doubt. This tragicomedy from 1957 is basically a game of chess—well, the final phase of it—performed on stage. In fact, you can distinguish multiple games of chess, as the Dutch researcher Onno Kosters suggested in an article in 1996. As the curtain opens, we see the character Hamm sitting in a wheelchair and wearing sunglasses; he is blind and unable to use his legs. Next to him stand two large metal dustbins; Hamm’s parents Nagg and Nell, both without legs, are inside them. The fourth character is Hamm’s servant, the restless Clov, who constantly threatens to leave but never does. Most of the play consists of seemingly unimportant actions, with Hamm ordering Clov to move to different places and Clov moving Hamm’s wheelchair for no understandable reason. It’s easy to see Hamm as a king, moving slowly over the chessboard, and Clov as a freedom-seeking pawn, while Nagg and Nell appear like captured pieces, no longer involved in the main action. At the same time, Hamm and Clov and Nagg and Nell seem involved in a chess game against each other. And then, there is the game played between the playwright and his audience. According to James Acheson, a former Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, this particular game serves the purpose of frustrating “our attempts to interpret Endgame definitively; checkmate occurs when we recognize that the play is deliberately designed to resist even the most ingenious of explications.” Probably the most famous chess-related stage performance is the musical production Chess, conceived by Sir Tim Rice, with music by ABBA’s male half, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson. After a concept album was released in the autumn of 1984, the show opened in London’s West End in 1986, where it ran for nearly three years. Although it didn’t have a major Broadway run, the musical was still quite successful as it was also performed in Sydney, Los Angeles, Stockholm, Florence, Moscow, Budapest, Tokyo, and St. Louis, among other places. The hit song “One Night in Bangkok,” from the musical’s 1984 concept album, topped the charts in countries including West Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, and South Africa. The plot centers on two rival chess grandmasters—Freddie Trumper from the United States, and Anatoly Sergievsky from the Soviet Union—playing a world championship match in Merano, Italy. As the championship progresses, a love triangle emerges, with Florence Vassy, Freddie’s assistant and former lover, becoming romantically involved with Anatoly. The match itself is not only a battle of chess strategy but also a reflection of the political tensions between the two superpowers. So, once again, we see the game of chess used effectively as a metaphor: the musical portrays the ideological struggles of the Cold War era, with the American–Soviet rivalry serving as a backdrop to the characters’ personal struggles. The musical was inspired by the famous 1972 Fischer–Spassky world championship match. Rice, already famous as the author of the lyrics for Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, was among the millions who closely followed the “Match of the Century.” “It was the characters, the East–West clash, and the politics that drew me in,” Rice told me. He said he built the two main characters on Fischer and Spassky: “I found it interesting that Fischer was being not a very nice man, and yet he was meant to be the on the side of the good guys, being an American, a Westerner—and Spassky was meant to be an evil, commie bastard, but he was a nice guy.” It should be noted that the Sergievsky character also possessed elements of Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi, the two who played world championships in 1978 in Baguio City, Philippines, and in 1981 in Merano, Italy—Rice even visited the latter event. Sergievsky’s defection from the Soviet Union, seeking asylum at the British embassy, matches Korchnoi’s defection in 1976; and the Leonid Viigand character, who appears in the second act, has elements based on Karpov. The musical’s premiere in 1986 was met with disapproval in the Soviet Union, where the songs were banned for a long time. Thirty-four years later, in October 2020, the musical was performed in Russia for the first time. The 1,800-seat MDM Theatre in Moscow was sold out, and the show ran for two years. Rice told me it was quite special for him: “I was more excited about the Russian production than any other, really. In a way, the Russian character is more the central character than the American one. If it’s anybody’s story, it’s Anatoly’s story, or possibly Florence’s. But, who knows? I am not sure I know, and I wrote it!” Chess on the Big Screen Countless movies have included chess in one way or another, from a seemingly random prop in the background to a full-blown scene with dialogue, or anything in between. In a 2004 article in New in Chess magazine, David Edmonds and John Eidinow have pointed out that it has often served as a signaling system: “Chess has been used to create atmosphere and tone and to make instant narrative references to personality, temperament, and states of mind. Indeed, it is hard to think of any other pastime that would allow such a range of instant visual allusions and offer directors such certainty that they will be read appropriately by the general audience, no matter how fleeting the scene.” In many famous films, chess plays more than just a minor role. One of the earliest and possibly best examples is Ingmar Bergman’s classic The Seventh Seal, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and further cemented Bergman’s position as a world-class director. The story is set during the Black Death pandemic in the fourteenth century and follows a knight named Antonius Block and his squire, Jöns, who return from the Crusades to a plague-ridden Sweden. Block challenges Death to a chess game to delay his demise and seek answers about the meaning of life, while encountering various characters who represent different aspects of human existence and belief. Using chess, the film explores themes of existentialism, faith, and the search for meaning in the face of mortality. A still from Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, 1957, with Bengt Ekerot as Death, left, and Max von Sydow as the knight Antonius Block, right. In his 1971 book A Short History of the Movies, Gerald Mast noted that death is treated as a bitter and hopeless joke and added, “Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well and live is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the Church urges in Bergman’s metaphor.” I want to briefly mention four more movies based on fiction where I feel both the chess part and the plot were done well. In the 1992 thriller Knight Moves, directed by Carl Schenkel, a chess grandmaster played by Christopher Lambert is accused of several horrid murders. In the 2000 film The Luzhin Defence, based on Nabokov’s book and directed by Marleen Gorris, John Turturro plays Luzhin; Emily Watson, his wife. Pawn Sacrifice is a 2014 biographical drama film by Edward Zwick about Bobby Fischer (played by Tobey Maguire) and his fight against the Soviet chess players. And more recently, there was The Coldest Game (2019), with an alcoholic grandmaster (Bill Pullman) who becomes involved in espionage related to the Cuban missile crisis. There are also many chess-themed movies based on true stories that can be recommended to the readers of this book, such as Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), Life of a King (2013), The Dark Horse (2014), Queen of Katwe (2016), and Critical Thinking (2020). And, although it’s not a movie, the Canadian drama series Endgame (2011) features a former Russian chess champion (played by Shawn Doyle) who uses his chess prowess to solve criminal cases. In his 2005 book Chess in the Movies, Bob Basalla collected almost two thousand films and TV shows, described their “chessic content” and provided details on directors, languages, and awards, as well as the “correctness” of the actual chess played in the scenes—because, it seems that more often than not in cinema there are issues with the chessboard (placed wrongly, not having a dark square in the lower left corner) or the pieces (usually the king and queen placed on the wrong starting squares). Keeping in mind the multimillion-dollar budgets of some of these titles, it’s hard to believe that such basic mistakes can be found in famous films like The Great Escape (1963), Never Say Never Again (1983), The Da Vinci Code (2006), and even the all-time number one on the Internet Movie Database Top 100, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). For chess fanatics, such errors can be rather annoying, and it is telling that Basalla, in his book, works with a special, symbol-based index system to categorize which type of error is being made in a particular film. Yes, we take such things very seriously! I remember a story by Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree where he wrote about a chess shop that he walked by on holiday and saw a chess set wrongly set up in the window. The owner told him he had done it intentionally because more customers would come inside that way. As Ree noted, it’s similar to a newly painted door having a sign that reads “just paintted” (with the double t), so that people will pay more attention. A painter like that pays more attention to detail than your average Hollywood producer. Some chess scenes form a truly iconic part of large Hollywood productions. I have always loved the opening scene of the 1963 James Bond movie From Russia with Love, where we see a chess game being played in a stunningly beautiful hall (likely a museum) on a circular stage placed on a brown-blue checkered floor. It is the Venice International Grandmasters’ Championship’s match final between Kronsteen from Czechoslovakia and MacAdams from Canada. After Kronsteen takes MacAdams’s bishop with a check, a waiter serves him a glass of water. He reads through the bottom of the glass some text on the paper coaster that says: “You are required at once.” He dries his lips with the paper, tears it, and then, as MacAdams moves his king, Kronsteen gives a decisive check with his queen. MacAdams tilts his king over (something that happens all the time in Hollywood but rarely in the real world) and congratulates his opponent, who immediately walks away from the board. Kronsteen, SPECTRE’s key asset to fight Bond in this movie, must have been one hell of a player if he could finish a game of chess whenever he needed to. The film uses a real game, played between the Russian top grandmasters Boris Spassky and David Bronstein (surely no coincidence that it sounds so similar to Kronsteen!) from 1960. In that game it was Spassky who was victorious, with the same final moves, but in the movie two of White’s central pawns had been removed from the board. For a long time it was speculated that the director, Terence Young, felt they ruined the shot aesthetically. However, a 2002 BBC Radio 4 documentary revealed that the producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman wrongly assumed that chess games are copyrighted and wanted to avoid legal issues by making this small alteration. In any case, I’d like to believe that the scene was famous enough for director Sam Mendes to place Daniel Craig behind a chessboard in the 2015 Bond film Spectre, perhaps paying homage to From Russia with Love. The chess scene in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey is also highly symbolic. In what is one of the greatest and most influential science fiction movies ever made, we see Dr. Frank Poole, one of the pilots of the spacecraft Discovery One that is bound for Jupiter, playing chess with the onboard computer HAL 9000. Frank plays at a board with 2D pieces on a screen that resembles an iPad. He stands no chance against this computer from the future. After Frank agrees to the inevitable and throws in the towel, HAL says, “Thank you for a very enjoyable game.” Annoyingly, the computer is not only unbeatable, showing it is capable of the purest form of human intellect, but also human-like. We’ll look closely at chess and artificial intelligence in the second part of this book. That Kubrick used chess in this film was unsurprising: he was a lifelong chess lover. As a teenager, he could be seen playing in New York’s Central Park or Washington Square for money, or even at tournaments at the Marshall Chess Club in Greenwich Village. Kubrick also included chess scenes in his 1956 film The Killing and even in Lolita (1962), although those were not part of chess-lover Nabokov’s book. Kubrick was also known for sometimes playing chess in between directing scenes. As Adam Feinstein wrote in New in Chess magazine, during the filming of 2001, Kubrick played many games with the American physicist Jeremy Bernstein at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Bernstein remembered Kubrick as a real hustler: “Finally, we reached the 25th game, and it was agreed that this would decide the matter. Well into the game, he made a move that I was sure was a loser. He even clutched his stomach to show how upset he was. But it was a trap, and I was promptly clobbered. ‘You didn’t know I could act too,’ he remarked.” Among the many chess-loving Hollywood actors (such as Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Laurence Fishburne, Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, and Viola Davis, to name just a few), the most fanatical and perhaps best player was Humphrey Bogart. Before his acting career (and like Kubrick), Bogart hustled opponents for small money in New York parks and at Coney Island. Bogart has been a tournament director, was active in the California State Chess Association, and often visited Hollywood’s chess club. He even held the world-class grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky to a draw in a simultaneous display in 1952 in Beverly Hills. Chess aficionado Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, play chess at their California home, c. 1949. That Bogart can be seen in front of a chessboard in Casablanca (1942) is not a coincidence, even though it was not part of the original script. The Hungarian film Curtiz from 2018, based on the making of Casablanca by director Michael Curtiz, furnished an interesting explanation: Bogart didn’t know what to do with his hands in the scenes where he was sitting and talking, so he suggested using a chess set. He put up the position himself from a correspondence game he was involved in. Because Curtiz agreed, we find chess as part of one of the most famous movies ever. Chess and Music The French eighteenth-century genius François-André Danican Philidor (see pages 19 and 79) was not only the best chess player of his time but also a talented musician. He was considered among France’s leading opera composers, creating over twenty opéras comiques. The German composer Richard Strauss liked to play chess too, as did Dmitri Shostakovich. A story the Russian composer loved to tell later in his life relayed how he once played world champion Alexander Alekhine in the lobby of a Leningrad cinema. However, the best player among all classical composers was the Russian Sergei Prokofiev—“a first-rate chess player” who “played a very vigorous, forthright game,” according to former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. (If he said so, who are we to argue?) Prokofiev was also friends with another former world champion, José Capablanca, and even beat the great Cuban once, rather convincingly, in a simul. What does it say that some famous musicians were fond of chess? It may not be such a coincidence, Achilleas Zographos argued in his 2017 book Music and Chess. According to Zographos, chess is “an art in itself” and “strongly related to mathematics and music.” He points to the many similarities between chess and music: both are a universal language (making age, gender, race, or religion irrelevant) and a means of personal expression (musicians and chess players have styles of play); both are a performance art that is played; both have symbolic languages; and both rely on patterns (chunks of notes or moves). The great Italian composer Ennio Morricone—one of the absolute giants of twentieth-century cinema; the man behind famous film scores such as Sergio Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Brian DePalma’s The Untouchables, and Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight—had something to say about this topic as well. His career spanned more than six decades as a composer, orchestrator, conductor, and trumpet player. On top of all that, he was an avid chess fan and even played serious tournaments in the 1950s before his musical career took off. In the 2019 book From Ennio Morricone: In His Own Words, Alessandro De Rosa quoted Morricone about the links between music and chess: In time, I’ve discovered that strong links exist between chess and the musical notation system, set up as it is in durations and pitches. In chess, the two dimensions remain spatial, and time is what players have at their disposal in order to make the right move. In addition there are horizontal and vertical combinations, different graphic patterns, just like musical notes in harmony. Even still, one can pair patterns and plays as if they were instrumental parts in an orchestra. Morricone’s love for the game can also be seen in different examples of his chess-related compositions throughout the years. One of these is “Chess Game,” on the soundtrack of The Endless Game (Gioco senza fine), a TV miniseries from the late 1980s. Another is “Dance of the Chess Game,” also part of a TV miniseries from the same period, Secret of the Sahara (Il Segreto del Sahara). Morricone also composed the “Chess Players’ Anthem” (Inno degli scacchisti) for the 2006 Chess Olympiad in Turin. In 2007, after he had won the Academy Honorary Award, Morricone was asked on Italian TV if he would have liked anything more than that prize. His answer: “To be a grandmaster, like Kasparov.” Chess is not alien to pop music either, with numerous appearances in lyrics or visuals. The Wu-Tang Clan’s “spiritual head” GZA released the album Grandmasters in 2005, with songs referencing chess such as “Advanced Pawns,” “Unprotected Pieces” and “Smothered Mate.” Taylor Swift must have a certain fondness for the game as she references chess in several songs, such as “Dear John” (2010). Katy Perry’s 2015 Super Bowl half-time show featured spectacular chess choreography around her song “Dark Horse.” Beyoncé’s second visual album Black Is King (2020) featured a big chess motif, with her husband Jay-Z pressing a chess clock and Beyoncé herself as an all-powerful black queen. As we have seen, chess continues to be the most prominent game to feature both as an art form in itself and in the arts, literature, theater, cinema, music, and popular culture. There is one more very important part of society where chess plays an important role: that of science. As we will see in the next chapter, science has revealed much of the game of chess, while chess has contributed massively to science.",

Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them!” —Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 In 1923 Marcel Duchamp decided quite suddenly to interrupt his art career … to play chess. Years later, he said, “While not all artists are chess players, all chess players are artists.” He became a fanatic and eventually master-level player who participated in the French Championships and even represented his country at four Chess Olympiads. He justified his sudden switch to a chess career by stating that chess “has all the beauty of art—and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.” The story goes that Duchamp was so crazy about chess that in the first week after getting married to his first wife, Lydie Sarazin-Levassor, in 1927, he hardly spent any time with her but instead visited the chess club every night. She got so angry that she glued the pieces to his chessboard. The marriage didn’t last long. Chess as an Art Form Many will see chess as a mere board game, while others may accept it as a sport. To anyone who has dedicated more than just a few months of their life to it, chess is also an art. Among the infinite number of possible games and positions, there is so much hidden beauty, invisible to the untrained eye but an enormous pleasure to everyone willing to go beyond merely knowing the rules of the game. Chess is a labyrinth of endless pathways often paved with brilliant gems—as long as you keep looking for them. The ancient Arabic manṣūbāt, mentioned in the previous chapter, often had rather ingenious solutions that can easily be described as pretty or artistic. In the last two centuries, this old tradition has developed into the field of endgame studies (positions where one side can win or defend to a draw beautifully) and problems (positions where a forced checkmate needs to be found). Many chess compositions are considered pieces of art, and their composers are true artists of the game. The Russian Alexey Troitsky (1866–1942), the Frenchman Henri Rinck (1870–1952), and the Armenian Genrikh Kasparyan (1910–95) can be considered the Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven of endgame composition. The notion of chess as an art form is also reflected by the fact that our game had its so-called romantic period during the late-eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries. It may be a stretch to claim that this was directly influenced by Romanticism in the arts, but the periods did overlap. While Eugène Delacroix, Francisco Goya, Caspar David Friedrich, and John Constable created their masterpieces on canvas, players like Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, and the American genius Paul Morphy did the same on the chessboard. The “romantic” aspect of their chess was characterized by aggressive, tactical play that often involved gambits (pawn or even piece sacrifices in the opening) to attack the opponent’s king from the get-go. Two games by Anderssen—true artistic (and romantic!) masterpieces—have received names: the “Immortal” game, played against Lionel Kieseritzky at the London 1851 tournament; and the “Evergreen” game against Jean Dufresne in Berlin in 1852 (see annotated games on pages 382–84). (It was a kind of swashbuckling style of play, perhaps comparable with the English soccer club Arsenal under Arsène Wenger, or with the now fairly extinct service-volley style in tennis.) Wilhelm Steinitz, the first official world champion, has been deemed responsible for halting these crazy attackers as he led the foundations of positional, strategic play. About half a century later, Modernism, the art movement, reflected the newly emerging industrial world, and saw its counterpart in chess. It was called “hypermodernism,” a strategic approach where a player intentionally avoided occupying the center of the board with pawns early in the game, opting to control it from a distance, or intending to counterattack the opponent’s pawn center. This style of play came into swing in the 1920s as a reaction to the classical principles of chess, which typically advocated the center’s direct occupation and control. Key figures associated with hypermodern chess were Richard Réti and Aron Nimzowitsch, who both penned their thoughts in books considered classics. A century later, top-level chess mixes both classical and hypermodern ideas. Sometimes, single moves in a chess game are simultaneously brilliant and beautiful. Chess fans get a sparkle in their eyes in recognition of their appeal when they see Frank Marshall’s astonishing final move in his game with Stefan Levitsky (Breslau, 1912; see annotated game on page 384), Anatoly Karpov’s unexpected knight retreat against Garry Kasparov (Moscow, 1984; see pages 387–88), or Alexei Shirov’s stunning bishop sacrifice against Veselin Topalov (Linares, 1998; see pages 392–93). The chess pieces themselves can also be pure works of art. When I asked the Dutch former top grandmaster Jan Timman what initially attracted him to chess as a young boy, his answer was, “the pieces.” In his case, it was his grandmother’s beautifully decorated chess set, although even the pieces of the standard version can be inspiring. Officially sanctioned by FIDE, the Staunton chess set is named after the nineteenth-century English top player Howard Staunton. However, credit should go to the journalist Nathaniel Cooke, who designed the pieces in 1849, while Staunton only endorsed the set. Long before the Staunton pieces became the standard—afterward, too—an incredible variety of sets were designed containing the most beautiful chess pieces you can imagine. Archeological findings of chess pieces from the earliest times in India don’t exist, but it is assumed they depicted humans and animals. That is also the case for the oldest chess pieces that have survived, which were discovered in 1977 at the ancient site of Afrasiyab in Northern Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and date back to between the late sixth and early eighth centuries. Pieces from the subsequent Arabic period have a more basic design. As the beliefs of the day prohibited the depiction of humans or animals, those pieces were of quite abstract shapes, holding three geometrical forms: the cylinder, the rectangle, and the cone. During the Middle Ages, the shape of the chess pieces gradually changed under the influence of Christian culture, often showing more human-like figures. The most famous medieval chess pieces are the Lewis Chessmen: twelfth-century pieces discovered on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in 1831. They were almost certainly brought there by the Vikings, demonstrating that chess was already known and played in Scandinavia in the 1100s. These beautiful pieces were made of walrus tusks, varying in height from 3.5 to 10.2 centimeters. Except for the pawns, all the 79 pieces found (from multiple, incomplete chess sets) depict human figures: the knights are mounted on horses and are shown holding spears and shields, while the rooks are standing soldiers or “warders” holding shields and swords. At an auction in 2019 one of those warders, which had been kept in a drawer in Scotland for 55 years, was sold for £735,000 ($933,000). The king and queen pieces from the Lewis Chessmen, a set made in the twelfth century from walrus ivory and discovered in Scotland in 1831. Various materials have been used to make chess sets, such as ivory, bone, and different types of woods, but also rock-crystal, jasper, amber, and even silver or gold. Queen Margaret of England (1430–82) is said to have possessed green and red chess pieces made of jasper and crystal. Another common idea has been that the two armies of chess pieces represent real-life armies—for instance, a “Battle of Waterloo” chess set, with Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington as the adversary kings. (Wasn’t chess supposed to be a way to fight a war without bloodshed? Well, that didn’t work out for humanity, so instead we playfully depict bloody battles on the chessboard.) At some point, designs returned to more abstract forms, eventually leading to the Staunton pieces, although artists continued to be inspired by the royal game and often designed unique chess sets. Beautiful examples include Josef Hartwig’s minimalist 1923 design that followed the Bauhaus art school, where the shape of the cube-like pieces reflects how they move, and Man Ray’s equally abstract but more rounded design from 1920. Man Ray was not the only Dadaist who designed chess sets; the same can be said for his friends Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp was famous for his “readymades,” such as the porcelain urinal (titled Fountain) he declared a piece of art, because he could, in 1917. He was a hero of the early anti-art movement and a forefather of postmodernism. In his earlier work as a painter, before he became a fanatic player, chess played a prominent role. His 1910 work The Chess Game is painted fairly realistically, while his The Chess Players from a year later fits the Cubist movement of that time. Chess and art were not two completely separate territories for Duchamp. The two worlds came together at an exhibition in 1966 titled Homage to Caissa, also the title of a readymade chessboard that is missing its pieces. The exhibition opened on the rooftop of 978 Madison Avenue in New York, where Duchamp played chess with Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol. In 1968, Duchamp appeared with the avant-garde composer and music theorist John Cage (famous for his piece “4´33˝”—four minutes and 33 seconds of silence) at a concert titled Reunion. The two played a chess game on a special board with audio outputs connected to photoelectric cells underneath the board, so each move created a sound. In one of his interviews, Duchamp said, “I tried to protect my work with silence by dedicating myself for a long time to the game of chess. That is a game which always enthralled me because of its complexity. I always loved complexity.” I’d like to think that a love for complexity also defined his special relationship with art. The art photographer Julian Wasser, who passed away in early 2023, owed part of his celebrity to an iconic photo that he took in 1963 of Duchamp playing chess against the fully nude writer Eve Babitz at the Pasadena Art Museum in Los Angeles. In the 2009 book Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Chess, Francis Naumann and Bradley Bailey explored Duchamp’s chess career, and the two-time United States chess champion Jennifer Shahade analyzed 15 of his games. On this occasion, she shot a performance art video at the Philadelphia Soundstages inspired by the Duchamp versus Babitz picture. Shahade turned it around, playing with clothes herself (though wearing a corset) against a fully naked man named Jason Bretz. The two used a beautiful chess set, the pieces of which were also naked figures. Afterward, Shahade noted in a story on her website, “One great thing about playing against a naked man in chess is that there are no pockets for electronic devices, so you can be absolutely sure he is not cheating.” (At the height of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal, organizing a tournament involving participants wearing swimming shorts was jokingly suggested, as we will learn in Chapter 7.) It is a sign of the importance of chess in our culture that the game has been represented in the visual arts many thousands of times over the centuries. Some well-known examples include Lucas van Leyden’s The Game of Chess (1508), which you can see in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin; Sofonisba Anguissola’s The Chess Game (1555), hanging in the National Museum in Poznań, Poland; and Honoré Daumier’s The Chess Players (c. 1863–67), to be found in the Petit Palais in Paris. More recent examples are Chessboard, Glass, and Dish (1917) by the Spanish Cubist Juan Gris, to be found in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and M. C. Escher’s Metamorphosis II (1939), at the Escher in Het Paleis Museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. In these works, chess often functions as a metaphor, reflecting a strategic setting, a complex battle, a symbolic fight against fate, or the proximity of victory or defeat. Personally, I think the inner beauty of the board and pieces was often enough inspiration for artists to depict the game. De schaakspelers (Game of Chess), a painting by Dutch painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden, 1508. The most rudimentary meaning of chess is that of war. The earliest chess pieces reflected members of the Indian armies, with, as noted, specially designed chessmen who modeled actual armies of real-life battles. One avant-garde artist had a fundamentally different take, and she was the first to present it vigorously as a game of peace: Yoko Ono. Ono’s art installation Play it by Trust consists of a large and entirely white chess set. Half of the chessboard’s squares are placed on a slightly different level to maintain the checkered pattern, while both sets of pieces are painted white. The chess set is also a metaphor here, but, in this case, represents the futility of war, as the artist encourages humans to unite rather than divide. The installation was first exhibited in 1966 in London’s Indica Gallery and featured in her late husband John Lennon’s 1972 television film Imagine, which was soundtracked by the album of the same name. Half a century later, in March 2024, Sean Lennon, son of John and Yoko, won an Academy Award for his short animated film War Is Over! The film holds an anti-war message as well and shows two soldiers from rival armies playing chess with each other by sending their moves across the battlefield via carrier pigeon. Chess and Literature In a popular romantic story originating in France around 1160, Floris is trying to rescue Blancheflour, who is being kept in the emir’s tower. By playing chess with the tower watchman, Floris gains admission to the prison. In the Tristan en prose (Prose Tristan) from around the same time, the knight Tristan is sent to Ireland by King Mark to fetch his bride, Iseult. On the way back, while on a boat and immersed in a chess game, the two accidentally drink a love potion and fall in love, with disastrous consequences. Like in art, chess has been a source of inspiration in literature from a very early age. Chess plays an even greater role in the Roman van Walewein (Romance of Gawain), a Middle Dutch chivalric romance from the thirteenth century, in which a magic chessboard suddenly flies in through the window as King Arthur and his knights enjoy a banquet at Camelot. After the board flies away again, Arthur announces that whoever can fetch it for him will inherit his fortunes. Walewein (Gawain) goes for it and eventually brings it back after experiencing many adventures that involve slaying dragons, saving a damsel, and obtaining a special magical sword. Those were the days! The Roman van Walewein can be read as a traditional chivalric romance. However, some parts suggest that the authors Penninc and Pieter Vostaert were toying with the genre, as their story includes satirical elements. In general—and this can be said about many medieval literary texts involving chess—the story commented on the political order of the time. In his 2006 book The Immortal Game, David Shenk convincingly explains why chess was so well equipped for metaphorical usage (italics by Shenk): It largely came down to the fact that chess had been designed as a symbol to begin with. Out of the box, it came furnished with a wide variety of generic attributes that lent themselves to an even wider variety of metaphorical applications: chess was a battle between two groups, each stratified by social ranking, contesting for dominance over a finite piece of geography, interacting in a dynamic so complex it seemed to take on a life of its own, each army manipulated by a player, battling each other with wits rather than brawn, employing both tactics (short-term planning) and strategy (long-term planning), in a game that could never truly be mastered. Chess, therefore, lent itself perfectly to the allegory, a literary form that was highly popular in the Middle Ages. This way of using a narrative or visual representation to communicate a hidden meaning, often with moral or political significance, came from both biblical and classical traditions and was readily recognized by the readers of the time. The omnipresence of allegorical stories that involved chess, usually called “moralities,” emphasized the game’s status and further helped spread it. The oldest chess morality is a thirteenth-century Latin treatise titled Quaedam moralitas de scaccario. H. J. R. Murray called it Innocent Morality and summarized: “The world resembles a chessboard which is chequered white and black, the colors showing the two conditions of life and death, or praise and blame. The chessmen are men of this world who have a common birth, occupy different stations and hold different titles in this life, who contend together, and finally have a common fate which levels all ranks. The king often lies under the other pieces in the bag.” One of my favorite chess expressions goes: “At the end of the chess game, both the king and the pawn go back into the same box.” It seems to date back to Innocent Morality. I love the added detail that the king is often lying under other pieces—a similar lesson in humility as the one from the Brahmin mathematician Sissa (see page 11). The best example of a chess morality is the Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium super ludo scacchorum (Book of the Morals of Men and the Duties of Nobles and Commoners, on the Game of Chess) by the Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis, a very famous work from the mid-thirteenth century. According to Murray, the number of existing manuscripts and translations suggests that its popularity “must have almost rivaled that of the Bible itself.” Cessolis’s work further established that chess was a symbolic representation of society. The king, queen, and knight have their expected roles, but he described the alfils (bishops) as the judges, the rooks as the king’s governors, and the pawns as members of the common people, who represented eight different trades or professions. Unlike the Roman van Walewein, the Liber does not have the king as a center point but concerns all members of society, who should learn the game so they will be able to master their role. A facsimile of a page with a woodcut illustration of a chess player, from William Caxton’s The Game and Playe of Chesse, 1474—a translation of an earlier work by Italian monk Jacobus de Cessolis. A few decades after the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press (which was around 1440), the English merchant William Caxton published Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye in 1473, a collection of stories associated with Homer’s Iliad. Caxton printed The Game and Playe of Chesse a year later, his translation of Cessolis’s book. What was probably the second book ever to be printed in the English language had chess all over it. Scachs d’amor (Chess of Love), a poem written around 1475 and published in Valencia, is significant for being the earliest available source delineating the new powers of the chess queen. The poem uses chess as an allegory for love: it describes a chess game between two players representing the gods Mars and Venus, while a referee (Mercury) watches over them. Almost half a century after Scachs d’amor was written, another chess poem appeared: Scacchia ludus (The Game of Chess), from 1527, by the Italian humanist, bishop, and poet Hieronymus Vida (Marco Girolamo Vida). This lengthy poem, written in Latin, was very popular for over a century and was reprinted more than 40 times. Once again an allegory for love, it describes a mythological chess game between Apollo and Mercury in the presence of the other gods and a nymph called Scacchis. In 1763, the British philologist and orientalist William Jones used it to write a chess poem, replacing “Scacchis” with “Caissa,” nowadays known as the goddess of chess. In chess literature, Caissa usually appears when discussing luck; for instance, a writer describing a fortunate victory can say, “Caissa was on my side.” (I’ve used that phrase myself too many times.) Go figure: the game’s divine protector is a woman, albeit one that you will not find in the writings of Homer or Sophocles. Caissa is a tawdry invention from the post-Renaissance. Although I play myself for a Dutch chess club named after Caissa, it’s hard not to see her as some kind of a kitsch goddess—the Betty Boop of the Greek gods, if you will. Chess continued to play a respectable role in written text in the following centuries, showing that the game was here to stay. In three books, chess plays a key part from start to finish. Stefan Zweig’s Die Schachnovelle (The Royal Game, also published as Chess Story) and Vladimir Nabokov’s Zashchita Luzhina (The Defense or The Luzhin Defense) have always been considered to be the “big two.” Since 2020, Walter Tevis’s novel The Queen’s Gambit should perhaps be mentioned in the same breath. Written by two literary heavyweights of the twentieth century, The Royal Game and The Defense were highly successful. Both deal with characters who are deeply obsessed with chess while also showing the destructive powers the game can have. In that sense, the two works have helped create the chess grandmaster’s archetype of the tormented genius. It’s a common and regrettable prejudice to think that brilliance in chess necessarily goes hand in hand with some form of lunacy. Still, I wouldn’t want to suggest that chess would have been better off without these books. The Royal Game was Zweig’s last and most famous work. The Austrian-born author wrote it while in exile in Brazil, where he tragically committed double suicide with his wife Lotte in early 1942, too depressed and disillusioned about what he saw as the inevitable destruction of his “spiritual homeland Europe” by Nazi Germany. First published posthumously in late 1942, the novella draws a clear parallel with Zweig’s personal life. The personage Dr. B. also feels the fascist pressure when imprisoned by the Gestapo. While in captivity, he teaches himself chess with the help of a book full of master games. On a boat traveling from New York to Buenos Aires, Dr. B. even manages to win a game against the reigning world champion, Czentovic. During their second game, Dr. B. has to withdraw prematurely as he fears a return to his obsessive behavior during his imprisonment. There are minor flaws in the story, such as Dr. B. and Czentovic reaching world-class strength in an unrealistically short period (the latter took a mere five years from learning the rules to winning the highest title, which is as unlikely in chess as in any sport). Still, The Royal Game sold millions of copies and was translated into many languages, and rightly so. It was turned into a film four times, most recently in 2021 in Philipp Stölzl’s Chess Story. An opera based on the novel ran in 2013 in the Kiel Opera House, and a theater production was produced for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2015. Zweig is still considered an important twentieth-century author with a corpus that includes poetry, theater, short stories, and biographies, and contains numerous chess references. The Defense was Nabokov’s third novel, written after he moved to Berlin. Published in 1930, it was among his first nine novels written in Russian; an English version appeared in 1964. The book is about Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin, who learns chess as a young boy and becomes one of the world’s strongest grandmasters. Despite having a unique gift, Luzhin’s life grows increasingly unstable. Even his beautiful and intelligent wife cannot save him from his ultimately fateful escape from reality. Despite frantic efforts, Luzhin fails to exterminate chess from his life and his thoughts. Although the game fully absorbs Luzhin until it checkmates him, Nabokov doesn’t make chess the direct cause of his demise. The Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree told me, “More important are Luzhin’s youth and his relationship with his impresario. Chess was a defense against the toughness of life, which it has been for me as well, although in a less dramatic way. Life can be difficult, but you can still score your little triumphs on the chessboard.” The book was neither the first nor the last time Nabokov would reference chess, but it’s the only one that deals with the game throughout the story. The thing was: Nabokov loved chess. He even liked to create chess problems and published a book in 1970 titled Poems and Problems (a compilation of 53 poems and 18 chess problems). He wrote, “Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterize all worthwhile art: originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity.” Nabokov’s love for creating puzzles that, by definition, have only one unique solution also shines through The Defense, which even has a structure that resembles a chess game. He wrote in the preface to the English edition: “The chess effects I planted are distinguishable not only in these separate scenes; their concatenation can be found in the basic structure of this attractive novel.” Like literature, chess is an invented reality in constant tension with the actual reality. For Luzhin and the reader, these realities can be hard to separate. Chess plays a smaller but significant part in an enormous variety of books. For example, many detective stories have been written where chess skills are used to solve the mystery at stake. In a recent title, the world’s biggest chess star plays a role. Magnus Carlsen og sjakkmorderen (Magnus Carlsen and the Chess Killer) is a Norwegian graphic novel from 2020 by Aleksander Kirkwood Brown. It has Carlsen using his chess prowess to chase down a serial killer in Oslo. The best example in this category is The Eight, a novel from 1988 by Katherine Neville. The book intertwines historical and modern storylines and revolves around a mysterious and powerful chess set with a centuries-old secret. The Eight is an avant la lettre Dan Brown with lots of chess (and is much better written). I cannot talk about chess and literature without mentioning Lewis Carroll’s children’s novel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, the sequel to Alice in Wonderland. Published in 1871, Through the Looking-Glass again follows the adventures of a young girl named Alice, who this time steps through a mirror into a whimsical world where everything is reversed, including logic. Chess forms a constant theme. Early in the story, Alice discovers chess pieces that have come to life. She then meets the Red Queen, who shows her a landscape resembling a giant chessboard, but also offers to turn Alice, now a pawn in a chess game, into a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank. Alice meets all kinds of strange creatures, such as Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, and talking flowers, while making her way across the board. The Red Queen chastises Alice in an illustration by John Tenniel for Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, 1871 (dated 1872). Nabokov saw a strong resemblance between composing a chess problem and a poem, but kept them separate. Carroll did not. In his story he presents an actual chess problem before anything else. After the title page and an overview of the characters, the book features a chess diagram where White has a queen, rook, knight, and pawn, and Red has a king, queen, and knight. The task is supplied—“White Pawn (Alice) to play and win in eleven moves”—and also the solution, which is a list of moves that, at the same time, functions as an index of key moments that will occur in the story. You could say that Carroll goes a step further than Nabokov when it comes to the game played with the reader, because the solution to the diagram, at least for chess players, doesn’t strictly follow the game’s rules and therefore doesn’t make much sense. (White can actually checkmate the enemy king in just three moves.) But the fact that it’s illogical isn’t illogical in a world behind a mirror, right? In the 1887 edition of the book, the author wrote in his preface (italics by Carroll): As the chess problem given on the previous page has puzzled some of my readers, it may be well to explain that it is correctly worked out so far as the moves are concerned. The alternation of Red and White is perhaps not so strictly observed as it might be, and the “castling” of the three Queens is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace; but the “check” of the White King at move 6, the capture of the Red Knight at move 7, and the final “checkmate” of the Red King, will be found, by any one who will take the trouble to set the pieces and play the moves as directed, to be strictly in accordance with the laws of the game. That still didn’t explain things fully, and perhaps rightly so, because it’s not necessarily an author’s task to explain his book. Many interpretations have been suggested over time. Alexander Taylor provided the best one in his 1952 biography of Carroll, titled The White Knight. He pointed out that one shouldn’t read it from the perspective of one of the players who has a complete vision of the board, but from the perspective of the pieces: Alice, as a pawn, but even the queens in the story, who cannot see or understand very well what is happening around them. He based his story, not on a game of chess, but on a chess lesson or demonstration of the moves such as he gave to Alice Liddell, a carefully worked-out sequence of moves designed to illustrate the queening of a pawn, the relative powers of the pieces—the feeble king, the eccentric knight, and the formidable queen whose powers include those of rook and bishop—and finally a checkmate. That is to say, he abstracted from the game exactly what he wanted for his design, and expressed that as a game between a child of seven-and-a-half who was to “be” a White Pawn and an older player (himself) who was to manipulate the other pieces. Considering his love for mirrors, labyrinths, and chess, it is unsurprising that the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges tremendously enjoyed Carroll’s books and made multiple references to him in his writings. In his 1976 preface to the Spanish translation of Carroll’s works, Borges highlights the concept of the reciprocal dream: “Alice dreams of the Red King, who is dreaming of her, and someone warns her that if the King awakens, she will go out like a candle because she is no more than a dream of the King that she is dreaming.” Such a reciprocal dream also represents another common theme in Borges’s work (for instance in his lovely poem “Chess”), which is that of “infinite recursion”—the effect of endless representations of realities, such as in a room covered with mirrors. For Borges, as we have seen with Nabokov, chess was a metaphor for his interpretation of literature. In both cases, we create an independent world with arbitrary features while challenging our understanding of reality. This could be said for any game, but chess is not just any game—and not for Borges either. In a 1981 interview, he said, “Chess is one of the means we have to save culture, such as Latin, the study of the humanities, the reading of classics, the laws of versification, ethics.” He had clearly placed chess on another level, as he continued, lamenting, “Chess is now replaced by football, boxing, or tennis, which are games of fools, not of intellectuals.” (It makes you wonder what he would have thought about chessboxing.) Borges’s poem is just one of numerous examples where chess features prominently in poetry. In his 1981 anthology The Poetry of Chess, Andrew Waterman covered six centuries of English poetry mentioning chess, which included works from Geoffrey Chaucer, John Skelton, Richard Lovelace, Abraham Cowley, Oliver Goldsmith, William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Louis MacNeice, Robert Lowell, and John Berryman. “Chess resembles writing, painting, and music in being an obsessional mental activity preoccupied with exploring tension and complication to resolve them to triumphant harmony,” Waterman wrote in his introduction, providing another tremendous meaning to our beloved game. It would be impossible and unnecessary to try to list all books and stories with chess prominently present. To end this section, I feel obliged to mention just a few more: Agatha Christie’s The Big Four, Ilya and Evgeny Petrov’s The Twelve Chairs, Elias Canetti’s Auto-da-Fé, Samuel Beckett’s Murphy, Isaac Asimov’s Nightfall and Pebble in the Sky, Ian Fleming’s From Russia, with Love (for the latter, see page 67 of the section on films), John Healy’s The Grass Arena, J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s The Flanders Panel and What We Become, Tom Clancy’s Red Rabbit, and Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club. Chess is omnipresent in literature, seemingly more so than any other game. Matthew James Seidel observed in an essay in 2017: “The most obvious explanation why fiction is so replete with chess players is that at their core, chess and stories are about the same thing—conflict. And it is a particular kind of conflict that is utterly devoid of chance. Whether a king is playing against a beggar or a nuclear physicist against a kindergartener, all that matters are the choices you make.” That so many authors have chosen to depict chess in their works cannot be considered a coincidence. At the end of this segment about chess and literature, I should mention that there’s also an incredible wealth of chess literature: books that, to a greater or lesser extent, are of a technical nature and discuss chess openings, middlegames, endgames, players, tournaments, and many other subtopics. I was once told there are more books written about chess than about any other sport, and I think it’s true. To give you an idea: the Royal Library in The Hague has the largest collection in Europe, with around thirty thousand books on chess and draughts (checkers, but played on a ten-by-ten board). I suspect quite a small minority is about draughts. In the chess world some of these books are considered absolute classics, regarded in high esteem for the literary style in which they are written. Famous titles are My System (1925) by Aron Nimzowitsch, My 60 Memorable Games (1969) by Bobby Fischer, and The King (1987), a large selection of articles by Jan Hein Donner. All three include sentences that have become iconic and/or part of typical chess jargon. Nimzowitsch, for example, wrote, “The passed pawn is a criminal, who should be kept under lock and key. Mild measures, such as police surveillance, are not sufficient.” Fischer’s famous line “best by test” to describe his favorite first move for White (1.e4) is another one, while you will find plenty of Donner examples elsewhere in this book. Chess and Theater With literature and theater being intrinsically linked, it is not surprising that we find many chess-related stories performed on stage. If one says “theater,” you think immediately of William Shakespeare. Still, the few mentions of chess in his works (and the game Miranda and Ferdinand are playing in The Tempest) merely demonstrate that chess was widely known at the time and that some of its terminology (such as “check” and “mate”) had already enriched the English language. More notable is Thomas Middleton’s A Game at Chess from 1624. This satirical play featured a chess plot but actually alluded to Anglo-Spanish diplomacy in such a way that King James I of England made sure the performances were stopped after just nine days! We find a more significant use of chess in Samuel Beckett’s oeuvre. The Irish novelist and dramatist, who won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature, had a lifelong love for the game. Beckett played chess, studied technical books and even followed important tournaments. In his work he often used chess, exploring its artistic and metaphorical possibilities, such as in his 1938 avant-garde novel Murphy, where the main character’s involvement in a chess game also signifies his personal struggle. But since we are discussing chess and theater, I will focus on Beckett’s piece Endgame—its title doesn’t leave much room for doubt. This tragicomedy from 1957 is basically a game of chess—well, the final phase of it—performed on stage. In fact, you can distinguish multiple games of chess, as the Dutch researcher Onno Kosters suggested in an article in 1996. As the curtain opens, we see the character Hamm sitting in a wheelchair and wearing sunglasses; he is blind and unable to use his legs. Next to him stand two large metal dustbins; Hamm’s parents Nagg and Nell, both without legs, are inside them. The fourth character is Hamm’s servant, the restless Clov, who constantly threatens to leave but never does. Most of the play consists of seemingly unimportant actions, with Hamm ordering Clov to move to different places and Clov moving Hamm’s wheelchair for no understandable reason. It’s easy to see Hamm as a king, moving slowly over the chessboard, and Clov as a freedom-seeking pawn, while Nagg and Nell appear like captured pieces, no longer involved in the main action. At the same time, Hamm and Clov and Nagg and Nell seem involved in a chess game against each other. And then, there is the game played between the playwright and his audience. According to James Acheson, a former Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, this particular game serves the purpose of frustrating “our attempts to interpret Endgame definitively; checkmate occurs when we recognize that the play is deliberately designed to resist even the most ingenious of explications.” Probably the most famous chess-related stage performance is the musical production Chess, conceived by Sir Tim Rice, with music by ABBA’s male half, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson. After a concept album was released in the autumn of 1984, the show opened in London’s West End in 1986, where it ran for nearly three years. Although it didn’t have a major Broadway run, the musical was still quite successful as it was also performed in Sydney, Los Angeles, Stockholm, Florence, Moscow, Budapest, Tokyo, and St. Louis, among other places. The hit song “One Night in Bangkok,” from the musical’s 1984 concept album, topped the charts in countries including West Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, and South Africa. The plot centers on two rival chess grandmasters—Freddie Trumper from the United States, and Anatoly Sergievsky from the Soviet Union—playing a world championship match in Merano, Italy. As the championship progresses, a love triangle emerges, with Florence Vassy, Freddie’s assistant and former lover, becoming romantically involved with Anatoly. The match itself is not only a battle of chess strategy but also a reflection of the political tensions between the two superpowers. So, once again, we see the game of chess used effectively as a metaphor: the musical portrays the ideological struggles of the Cold War era, with the American–Soviet rivalry serving as a backdrop to the characters’ personal struggles. The musical was inspired by the famous 1972 Fischer–Spassky world championship match. Rice, already famous as the author of the lyrics for Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, was among the millions who closely followed the “Match of the Century.” “It was the characters, the East–West clash, and the politics that drew me in,” Rice told me. He said he built the two main characters on Fischer and Spassky: “I found it interesting that Fischer was being not a very nice man, and yet he was meant to be the on the side of the good guys, being an American, a Westerner—and Spassky was meant to be an evil, commie bastard, but he was a nice guy.” It should be noted that the Sergievsky character also possessed elements of Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi, the two who played world championships in 1978 in Baguio City, Philippines, and in 1981 in Merano, Italy—Rice even visited the latter event. Sergievsky’s defection from the Soviet Union, seeking asylum at the British embassy, matches Korchnoi’s defection in 1976; and the Leonid Viigand character, who appears in the second act, has elements based on Karpov. The musical’s premiere in 1986 was met with disapproval in the Soviet Union, where the songs were banned for a long time. Thirty-four years later, in October 2020, the musical was performed in Russia for the first time. The 1,800-seat MDM Theatre in Moscow was sold out, and the show ran for two years. Rice told me it was quite special for him: “I was more excited about the Russian production than any other, really. In a way, the Russian character is more the central character than the American one. If it’s anybody’s story, it’s Anatoly’s story, or possibly Florence’s. But, who knows? I am not sure I know, and I wrote it!” Chess on the Big Screen Countless movies have included chess in one way or another, from a seemingly random prop in the background to a full-blown scene with dialogue, or anything in between. In a 2004 article in New in Chess magazine, David Edmonds and John Eidinow have pointed out that it has often served as a signaling system: “Chess has been used to create atmosphere and tone and to make instant narrative references to personality, temperament, and states of mind. Indeed, it is hard to think of any other pastime that would allow such a range of instant visual allusions and offer directors such certainty that they will be read appropriately by the general audience, no matter how fleeting the scene.” In many famous films, chess plays more than just a minor role. One of the earliest and possibly best examples is Ingmar Bergman’s classic The Seventh Seal, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and further cemented Bergman’s position as a world-class director. The story is set during the Black Death pandemic in the fourteenth century and follows a knight named Antonius Block and his squire, Jöns, who return from the Crusades to a plague-ridden Sweden. Block challenges Death to a chess game to delay his demise and seek answers about the meaning of life, while encountering various characters who represent different aspects of human existence and belief. Using chess, the film explores themes of existentialism, faith, and the search for meaning in the face of mortality. A still from Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, 1957, with Bengt Ekerot as Death, left, and Max von Sydow as the knight Antonius Block, right. In his 1971 book A Short History of the Movies, Gerald Mast noted that death is treated as a bitter and hopeless joke and added, “Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well and live is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the Church urges in Bergman’s metaphor.” I want to briefly mention four more movies based on fiction where I feel both the chess part and the plot were done well. In the 1992 thriller Knight Moves, directed by Carl Schenkel, a chess grandmaster played by Christopher Lambert is accused of several horrid murders. In the 2000 film The Luzhin Defence, based on Nabokov’s book and directed by Marleen Gorris, John Turturro plays Luzhin; Emily Watson, his wife. Pawn Sacrifice is a 2014 biographical drama film by Edward Zwick about Bobby Fischer (played by Tobey Maguire) and his fight against the Soviet chess players. And more recently, there was The Coldest Game (2019), with an alcoholic grandmaster (Bill Pullman) who becomes involved in espionage related to the Cuban missile crisis. There are also many chess-themed movies based on true stories that can be recommended to the readers of this book, such as Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), Life of a King (2013), The Dark Horse (2014), Queen of Katwe (2016), and Critical Thinking (2020). And, although it’s not a movie, the Canadian drama series Endgame (2011) features a former Russian chess champion (played by Shawn Doyle) who uses his chess prowess to solve criminal cases. In his 2005 book Chess in the Movies, Bob Basalla collected almost two thousand films and TV shows, described their “chessic content” and provided details on directors, languages, and awards, as well as the “correctness” of the actual chess played in the scenes—because, it seems that more often than not in cinema there are issues with the chessboard (placed wrongly, not having a dark square in the lower left corner) or the pieces (usually the king and queen placed on the wrong starting squares). Keeping in mind the multimillion-dollar budgets of some of these titles, it’s hard to believe that such basic mistakes can be found in famous films like The Great Escape (1963), Never Say Never Again (1983), The Da Vinci Code (2006), and even the all-time number one on the Internet Movie Database Top 100, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). For chess fanatics, such errors can be rather annoying, and it is telling that Basalla, in his book, works with a special, symbol-based index system to categorize which type of error is being made in a particular film. Yes, we take such things very seriously! I remember a story by Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree where he wrote about a chess shop that he walked by on holiday and saw a chess set wrongly set up in the window. The owner told him he had done it intentionally because more customers would come inside that way. As Ree noted, it’s similar to a newly painted door having a sign that reads “just paintted” (with the double t), so that people will pay more attention. A painter like that pays more attention to detail than your average Hollywood producer. Some chess scenes form a truly iconic part of large Hollywood productions. I have always loved the opening scene of the 1963 James Bond movie From Russia with Love, where we see a chess game being played in a stunningly beautiful hall (likely a museum) on a circular stage placed on a brown-blue checkered floor. It is the Venice International Grandmasters’ Championship’s match final between Kronsteen from Czechoslovakia and MacAdams from Canada. After Kronsteen takes MacAdams’s bishop with a check, a waiter serves him a glass of water. He reads through the bottom of the glass some text on the paper coaster that says: “You are required at once.” He dries his lips with the paper, tears it, and then, as MacAdams moves his king, Kronsteen gives a decisive check with his queen. MacAdams tilts his king over (something that happens all the time in Hollywood but rarely in the real world) and congratulates his opponent, who immediately walks away from the board. Kronsteen, SPECTRE’s key asset to fight Bond in this movie, must have been one hell of a player if he could finish a game of chess whenever he needed to. The film uses a real game, played between the Russian top grandmasters Boris Spassky and David Bronstein (surely no coincidence that it sounds so similar to Kronsteen!) from 1960. In that game it was Spassky who was victorious, with the same final moves, but in the movie two of White’s central pawns had been removed from the board. For a long time it was speculated that the director, Terence Young, felt they ruined the shot aesthetically. However, a 2002 BBC Radio 4 documentary revealed that the producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman wrongly assumed that chess games are copyrighted and wanted to avoid legal issues by making this small alteration. In any case, I’d like to believe that the scene was famous enough for director Sam Mendes to place Daniel Craig behind a chessboard in the 2015 Bond film Spectre, perhaps paying homage to From Russia with Love. The chess scene in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey is also highly symbolic. In what is one of the greatest and most influential science fiction movies ever made, we see Dr. Frank Poole, one of the pilots of the spacecraft Discovery One that is bound for Jupiter, playing chess with the onboard computer HAL 9000. Frank plays at a board with 2D pieces on a screen that resembles an iPad. He stands no chance against this computer from the future. After Frank agrees to the inevitable and throws in the towel, HAL says, “Thank you for a very enjoyable game.” Annoyingly, the computer is not only unbeatable, showing it is capable of the purest form of human intellect, but also human-like. We’ll look closely at chess and artificial intelligence in the second part of this book. That Kubrick used chess in this film was unsurprising: he was a lifelong chess lover. As a teenager, he could be seen playing in New York’s Central Park or Washington Square for money, or even at tournaments at the Marshall Chess Club in Greenwich Village. Kubrick also included chess scenes in his 1956 film The Killing and even in Lolita (1962), although those were not part of chess-lover Nabokov’s book. Kubrick was also known for sometimes playing chess in between directing scenes. As Adam Feinstein wrote in New in Chess magazine, during the filming of 2001, Kubrick played many games with the American physicist Jeremy Bernstein at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Bernstein remembered Kubrick as a real hustler: “Finally, we reached the 25th game, and it was agreed that this would decide the matter. Well into the game, he made a move that I was sure was a loser. He even clutched his stomach to show how upset he was. But it was a trap, and I was promptly clobbered. ‘You didn’t know I could act too,’ he remarked.” Among the many chess-loving Hollywood actors (such as Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Laurence Fishburne, Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, and Viola Davis, to name just a few), the most fanatical and perhaps best player was Humphrey Bogart. Before his acting career (and like Kubrick), Bogart hustled opponents for small money in New York parks and at Coney Island. Bogart has been a tournament director, was active in the California State Chess Association, and often visited Hollywood’s chess club. He even held the world-class grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky to a draw in a simultaneous display in 1952 in Beverly Hills. Chess aficionado Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, play chess at their California home, c. 1949. That Bogart can be seen in front of a chessboard in Casablanca (1942) is not a coincidence, even though it was not part of the original script. The Hungarian film Curtiz from 2018, based on the making of Casablanca by director Michael Curtiz, furnished an interesting explanation: Bogart didn’t know what to do with his hands in the scenes where he was sitting and talking, so he suggested using a chess set. He put up the position himself from a correspondence game he was involved in. Because Curtiz agreed, we find chess as part of one of the most famous movies ever. Chess and Music The French eighteenth-century genius François-André Danican Philidor (see pages 19 and 79) was not only the best chess player of his time but also a talented musician. He was considered among France’s leading opera composers, creating over twenty opéras comiques. The German composer Richard Strauss liked to play chess too, as did Dmitri Shostakovich. A story the Russian composer loved to tell later in his life relayed how he once played world champion Alexander Alekhine in the lobby of a Leningrad cinema. However, the best player among all classical composers was the Russian Sergei Prokofiev—“a first-rate chess player” who “played a very vigorous, forthright game,” according to former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. (If he said so, who are we to argue?) Prokofiev was also friends with another former world champion, José Capablanca, and even beat the great Cuban once, rather convincingly, in a simul. What does it say that some famous musicians were fond of chess? It may not be such a coincidence, Achilleas Zographos argued in his 2017 book Music and Chess. According to Zographos, chess is “an art in itself” and “strongly related to mathematics and music.” He points to the many similarities between chess and music: both are a universal language (making age, gender, race, or religion irrelevant) and a means of personal expression (musicians and chess players have styles of play); both are a performance art that is played; both have symbolic languages; and both rely on patterns (chunks of notes or moves). The great Italian composer Ennio Morricone—one of the absolute giants of twentieth-century cinema; the man behind famous film scores such as Sergio Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Brian DePalma’s The Untouchables, and Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight—had something to say about this topic as well. His career spanned more than six decades as a composer, orchestrator, conductor, and trumpet player. On top of all that, he was an avid chess fan and even played serious tournaments in the 1950s before his musical career took off. In the 2019 book From Ennio Morricone: In His Own Words, Alessandro De Rosa quoted Morricone about the links between music and chess: In time, I’ve discovered that strong links exist between chess and the musical notation system, set up as it is in durations and pitches. In chess, the two dimensions remain spatial, and time is what players have at their disposal in order to make the right move. In addition there are horizontal and vertical combinations, different graphic patterns, just like musical notes in harmony. Even still, one can pair patterns and plays as if they were instrumental parts in an orchestra. Morricone’s love for the game can also be seen in different examples of his chess-related compositions throughout the years. One of these is “Chess Game,” on the soundtrack of The Endless Game (Gioco senza fine), a TV miniseries from the late 1980s. Another is “Dance of the Chess Game,” also part of a TV miniseries from the same period, Secret of the Sahara (Il Segreto del Sahara). Morricone also composed the “Chess Players’ Anthem” (Inno degli scacchisti) for the 2006 Chess Olympiad in Turin. In 2007, after he had won the Academy Honorary Award, Morricone was asked on Italian TV if he would have liked anything more than that prize. His answer: “To be a grandmaster, like Kasparov.” Chess is not alien to pop music either, with numerous appearances in lyrics or visuals. The Wu-Tang Clan’s “spiritual head” GZA released the album Grandmasters in 2005, with songs referencing chess such as “Advanced Pawns,” “Unprotected Pieces” and “Smothered Mate.” Taylor Swift must have a certain fondness for the game as she references chess in several songs, such as “Dear John” (2010). Katy Perry’s 2015 Super Bowl half-time show featured spectacular chess choreography around her song “Dark Horse.” Beyoncé’s second visual album Black Is King (2020) featured a big chess motif, with her husband Jay-Z pressing a chess clock and Beyoncé herself as an all-powerful black queen. As we have seen, chess continues to be the most prominent game to feature both as an art form in itself and in the arts, literature, theater, cinema, music, and popular culture. There is one more very important part of society where chess plays an important role: that of science. As we will see in the next chapter, science has revealed much of the game of chess, while chess has contributed massively to science.",

      "content": "Chapter 3A Mutual Understanding: Chess and Science “Chess: Symbol of military tactics. All the great generals were good at it. Too serious as a game, too futile as a science.” —Gustave Flaubert, Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues, 1913 “Before I was born, my parents decided that I was going to be a genius.” With this intriguing sentence, Judit Polgár started her TED Talk in 2016. The most successful female chess player in the history of the game revealed the secret behind her brilliant career—one that would see her reach a level of play that no other woman has ever achieved. It’s a story of original thinking, determination, and love. Judit’s parents, László and Klára, were both teachers. Before they married in 1967, László shared his strong opinions with Klára about the Hungarian education system which, he felt, wasted talent due to a lack of focus. He wanted to teach their future children at home and, for each of them, focus on a single topic in which they could excel. “My mother initially thought he was crazy,” Judit later said, but Klára was impressed by László’s boundless energy and commitment and agreed to the marriage. The two read psychology books and immersed themselves in all the information they could find about prodigies and the early life of geniuses. And then they made their big decision: they embarked on a parenting experiment. Susan was born in 1969, followed by Sofia in 1974, and Judit in 1976. The three girls were homeschooled in different languages, math, and chess. László and Klára chose to focus on chess because it demands creative and intellectual capacities, while the results are easily measurable (more about that later). Soon, the unique upbringing of the girls meant a full-time job for their parents. In 1989, László explained his educational ideas in a small book titled Nevelj Zsenit! (Bring Up Genius!) It was his response to the famous nature-nurture debate: he considered talent not a hereditary trait but something you could teach to any child. In 1992 he told the Washington Post, “A genius is not born but is educated and trained.” Judit herself said chess is “80 percent hard work and 20 percent talent.” When I asked her in September 2023 to define talent, she thought briefly and said, “Talent is a tricky thing. Sometimes I feel it is kind of an attitude. It’s your personality. Many people want to be somebody different, but the people who are really doing good things dare to be themselves. I became exceptional in the chess world, but I was not exceptional. I created it to be. I mean, basically, I was doing something a lot on a daily basis, and the circumstances helped me.” In 1991, Judit became a grandmaster at the age of 15 years and four months, the youngest to ever achieve this feat at the time. In doing so she broke the record Bobby Fischer had held since 1958. While Sofia became an international master and Susan a strong grand-master (winning, for instance, the women’s world championship), Judit became the first and only woman to ever break into the world’s top ten in 1996. At her peak, in July 2005, she was ranked eighth in the world. The Polgár sisters at the 1988 Chess Olympiad in Thessaloniki, Greece. From left to right: Judit, Susan, and Sofia. László Polgár’s opinion that practice is (much) more important than talent is now generally accepted, but wasn’t at the time. He developed his ideas in a period when the study of expertise and the field of cognitive psychology were still in their infancy. Half a century later, we can see that chess has played a fundamental role in the development of these areas of science. It continues to do so, more than ever. Chess as a Toolbox for Science In the twenty-first century, chess-related scientific research has exploded. Between 1970 and 2007 Google Scholar lists 1,785 papers with chess in the title. In the period since: 3,400. Chess is booming, and chess research is too. It can be argued that chess has significantly impacted various branches of scientific thought, demonstrating incredible versatility and usefulness, and as a source of inspiration. As it is seen as the area closest to the game, let’s start with mathematics. The German mathematician and logician Ernst Zermelo was an avid chess player, and in 1913 he published his “Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels” (“On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of Chess”). It was the first paper on game theory. Zermelo introduced an important theorem that holds for any two-person non-chance game where players move alternately, have opposing interests, and access to “perfect information.” The latter means that both sides have complete knowledge of what is going on (as opposed to, for example, poker, where there’s both available and hidden information as the players are hiding their cards from the others). Zermelo attempted to mathematically formalize the concept of a winning position, noting that if a player is in a winning position, they can always force a win no matter what strategy the other player may employ. Zermelo’s work has contributed to various areas of mathematics and computer science. Chess has also been connected to language studies, beginning with the Swiss linguist, semiotician, and philosopher Ferdinand de Saussure. His Course in General Linguistics, published in 1916 and based on lectures he gave at the University of Geneva, is generally regarded as the starting point of structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the meaning of words is not fixed or independent but depends on how they relate to each other. However, even though individual words are arbitrary, the overall structure of language is not random but follows social conventions. Understanding how words work in a specific context involves looking at the rules and practices rather than just the history of individual words. To explain this, Saussure used a comparison to chess: “The respective value of the pieces depends on their position on the chessboard, just as each linguistic term derives its value from its opposition to all the other terms. The system is always momentary; it varies from one position to the next. It is also true that values depend above all else on an unchangeable convention, the set of rules that exists before a game begins and persists after each move.” In his Philosophical Investigations, published posthumously in 1953, the famous philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein reflected several times on chess. For instance, he compared linguistic expressions with chess pieces to explain that it is not enough to know the rules of a language to be able to recognize words and use them correctly: “When one shows someone the king in chess and says, ‘This is the king,’ this does not tell him the use of this piece—unless he already knows the rules of the game up to this last point: the shape of the king. You could imagine his having learned the rules of the game without ever having been shown an actual piece. The shape of the chessman corresponds here to the sound or shape of a word.” Later, he added, “But we talk about it as we do about pieces in chess when we are stating the rules of the game, not describing their physical properties. The question, ‘What is a word, really?’ is analogous to ‘What is a piece in chess?’ ” Chess and Psychology Aside from artificial intelligence, the scientific field that chess has had the most profound impact on is psychology. Chess has been used to study many aspects of the human mind, including perception, attention, memory, learning, creativity, thinking, and decision-making. The earliest recorded use of chess in psychological research dates from 1893. Alfred Binet, known for inventing the first practical IQ test, became fascinated by a particular aspect of chess that has mesmerized people for centuries: playing blindfold chess. Binet decided to do a study to test his hypothesis that chess masters were using a photographic kind of memory—an “inner mirror,” as he called it. Among his study participants was one of the world’s best players, Siegbert Tarrasch. The participants answered questions about what they were “seeing” during play, but their answers did not conform to Binet’s “inner mirror” idea. As it turned out, the players were not keeping complete positions sharply in their minds; what their internal memories stored were more like abstract patterns that they recognized, similar to musical chords or melodies. One of the participants, the French master Alphonse Goetz, said, “I grasp it as a musician grasps harmony in his orchestra.” Memory, it came to be understood, is only partly a visual concept; giving a meaningful context to the patterns and the impressions those patterns sparked help players remember positions. Binet concluded that it was “the multitude of suggestions and ideas emanating from a game which makes it interesting and establishes it in memory.” Binet’s study was the first in a long period of research in cognitive psychology that continues until this day, trying to answer fundamental questions like, “How do great chess players think?”; “How is that different from how amateurs think?” And, “What do these differences in chess thinking say about cognition in general?” Regarding the fascinating topic of blindfold chess, it’s important to stress that the ability to play a game of chess without looking at the board or the pieces is not as hard as it seems, nor is it limited to just a handful of brilliant minds. It is something any strong club player is capable of. I would compare it to playing a whole repertoire of études and nocturnes on the piano without needing the music in front of you, simply because you have practiced it for years. What is extraordinary, however, is the ability to play a blindfold simul. (This, in particular, was what inspired Binet to do his research.) When the great Philidor played two blindfold games at once in 1782, The World described it as “a phenomenon in the history of man” which “should be hoarded among the best samples of human memory, till memory shall be no more.” However, 150 years later, George Koltanowski played 34 blindfold games simultaneously. The current record stands at 48 games, played by the Uzbekistani American grandmaster Timur Gareyev in 2016 while wearing a blindfold mask and riding 80 kilometers (50 miles) on a spin bike. An engraving from 1794 depicts French composer and chess player François-André Danican Philidor, center, playing chess blindfolded, as members of the London Chess Club look on. It took several decades for another pioneer in the field to arrive on the scene—who, like Binet, was a remarkable scientist. I am talking about my fellow Dutchman, the internationally renowned psychologist (and chess master) Adriaan de Groot. De Groot suspected that grandmasters see more and calculate better than weaker players, and wanted to test his hypothesis. He convinced five of the eight participants of the international AVRO tournament in 1938 in the Netherlands to participate in some experiments. Still a student, de Groot was starting to collect data on what would become his now famous doctoral thesis from 1946, Het denken van den schaker, which in 1965 was translated into English and published as Thought and Choice in Chess. Apart from world-class grandmasters, de Groot worked with two other categories of players: experts and amateurs. He gave all of them two tasks. First, he asked the chess players to think aloud while looking at a position and choosing their next move, then recorded their verbal utterances. These “verbal protocols” were subjected to both a statistical and an interpretative analysis and yielded surprising results. Although grandmasters play better moves, their structural thinking isn’t much different from that of experts. For instance, they don’t see many more positions, and they don’t calculate much deeper. Allow me an intermezzo, because this brings me to the most frequently asked question for chess grandmasters by layman interviewers—a question which is utterly boring and completely misses the point: “How many moves can you think ahead?” The answer is: “It depends.” And usually the chess player doesn’t even bother trying to explain why. A century ago, someone gave arguably the best answer possible. The anecdote has appeared in different forms and has been attributed to many famous players. The version as told by Israel Albert Horowitz in 1946 in Chess Review, about a game from 1913, might be the most accurate: Apropos is the story of the game between the invincible Capablanca and Charles Jaffe, pride of the East Side. Capa forgot he was invincible: he lost. A reporter who was present asked the Cuban, “How far do you see ahead?” Capa replied impressively, “About ten moves.” Then the reporter went over to Jaffe: “How far do you see ahead?” Much to everyone’s surprise, the reply was, “Only one move.” This didn’t make sense. “How could a player who can see only one move ahead defeat another who can delve so deeply?” Here Jaffe explained: “I see only one move ahead, but always the best move.” An important difference between the grandmasters and the weaker players in de Groot’s experiment was that the strong players quickly discovered promising options, making their thought processes more efficient. The difference was so stark that, according to de Groot, a world champion had a better understanding of the positions after five seconds of looking at them than a strong amateur player after 15 minutes! De Groot concluded that superiority in chess must be related to how players look at positions—i.e., perception, and how that is linked to previous knowledge. That prompted him to devise a second task. This time, the players were confronted with several diagrams of chess positions and could only look at them briefly (two to 15 seconds). After each brief viewing session, the diagram was taken away, and the participants were asked to set up the position on a chessboard as precisely as possible. Grandmasters were clearly better at this task than experts and amateurs. In later research, de Groot and his PhD students discovered something that appears to be related to Binet’s findings: strong players quickly recognize patterns, groups of pieces, possible moves, or even sequences of moves. This allows them to remember positions without focusing on all the individual pieces and pawns. In the 1960s, de Groot further investigated this theory when he began measuring eye movements. Grandmasters spent more time looking at parts of the chessboard where groups of pieces were connected in a relevant way, and were more often fixated on the intersection of squares than weak players were. De Groot’s experiments in the 1930s, and his conclusions about knowledge, thinking skills, and perceptual-memory skills, formed the foundation for later research in the 1960s and beyond. The American research psychologist Christopher Chabris described him to me as a brilliant and groundbreaking researcher: “He was ahead of his time for the research methods he was using, the questions he was asking, and the kinds of conclusions he was coming to. It took decades for other people to do similar things.” Two more scientists have strongly impacted cognitive science with their chess-related research: William Chase and Herbert Simon. The two Carnegie Mellon psychologists offered valuable contributions in the areas of memory and problem-solving, which are still relevant in and outside the scope of chess. Building upon de Groot’s work, Chase and Simon were instrumental in the development of what is known as the chunking theory. Chunking, first mentioned in a 1956 paper by the American psychologist George Miller, is the process of connecting individual pieces of a set of information to create a meaningful whole that is easier to memorize. A clear example is the phone number 0603091943, which can be separated into 06 03 09 1943. The “06” signifies a mobile phone number (in the Netherlands) and forms a chunk almost automatically, while “03” and “09” can be remembered as March 9, and the last chunk clearly forms a year. Other examples of chunks are words created from single letters and sentences from words. Chase and Simon assumed that the long-term memory of chess players consists of chunks of chess information—again, somewhat similar to Binet’s patterns. Examples of such chunks are three pawns in front of a white king and rook in the third quadrant of the board (a typical situation after White has castled kingside) or an advanced white knight threatening a double attack on Black’s king and queenside rook. Chess chunks are familiar situations where a small number of pieces and pawns on a part of the board are somehow connected. The results of Chase and Simon’s research supported the hypothesis that strong players have stored many more such chunks—up to 50,000 in the case of a chess master—than an amateur player, allowing them to recognize more of them in new positions and remember these positions better. And because the chunks provide helpful information about what might be going on in the position, strong players can more easily pre-select moves to choose from. In other words, more knowledge and a better understanding of previous positions leads to more efficient reasoning in new positions. Together with the cognitive psychologist Fernand Gobet, Simon later refined the chunking theory into what is known as the template theory, which shows how high-level, schematic structures (templates) can evolve from perceptual chunks. In 1992, when the field of cognitive psychology was still relatively young, the American psychologist Neil Charness convincingly demonstrated that chess research had already impacted cognitive science and various areas of general psychology. Among other insights, studies using chess showed that acquiring knowledge is more important than age factors, and that problem-solving performance depends on skill, but not on age. In contrast, memory performance declines with age but increases with skill. The area in psychology that has probably experienced the most chess-related research is expertise. Why do some people become experts in their field and others don’t? Can anyone become a chess grandmaster, or a top musician or mathematician, for that matter? Is there such a thing as natural talent? Or is it all about getting those famed 10,000 hours of practice in? The “10,000-hour rule” stems from Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book Outliers. He gave several examples of how people became successful (including Bill Gates, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Bobby Fischer, and the Beatles) and claimed that achieving world-class expertise in any skill requires 10,000 hours of practice. Gladwell’s theory was based on a 1993 study led by the Swedish psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, who found that the best violinists had put significantly more hours into practicing their instrument from a young age than amateur or expert musicians. In a 2013 paper, Ericsson corrected what he saw as an oversimplification in Outliers. His most important point was that the best violinists had accumulated an average of over 10,000 hours by the age of 20, while Gladwell claimed they totaled 10,000 hours of practice. Ericsson further explained: “Our main point was that the best group of violinists had spent significantly more hours practicing than the two groups of less accomplished groups of expert violinists, and vastly more time than amateur musicians. There is nothing magical about exactly 10,000 hours.” The difference between total and average means a lot in practice, as was demonstrated in 2007 by psychology researchers Guillermo Campitelli and Fernand Gobet. After observing 104 competitive chess players of different skill levels, they concluded that to reach the level of a strong expert, about 11,000 hours of practice are needed on average. However, the range among their test subjects was striking: one player had needed only 3,000 hours to reach that level, while another required 23,000 hours. Others had spent more than 25,000 hours without getting as good. All of this suggests that practice is an important factor for success, but talent does play a role. The highest-rated player on the planet, Magnus Carlsen, became a grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 27 days—about five and a half years after starting to play chess. With a case like him, it’s hard not to believe in talent. I’d like to make one more important point about practice, for all you parents out there who are still eager for your child to put in those 10,000 hours. The 1993 study with musicians was not just about spending time on a particular skill; it concerned what Ericsson and his colleagues called deliberate practice, which is characterized by focused, systematic, and purposeful efforts to improve performance. In other words, both the quantity and the quality of practice lead to results. The good news is that nowadays it is easier than ever to practice chess meaningfully, thanks to the computer and the internet. Women and Chess: What Science Says Back in the 1970s when László and Klára Polgár decided to teach their children chess and demonstrate that practice trumps talent, some might have said it was a bummer that all three were girls. Because women can’t play chess, right? It’s a ludicrous question nowadays, but despite the first feminist wave in the late 1960s, much of the chess world agreed with this notion when Susan, Sofia, and Judit were born. The idea that only men are good at chess had been advocated by some big names, including Bobby Fischer, the Dutch grandmaster/writer Jan Hein Donner, and a young Garry Kasparov, who later corrected himself after suffering defeat at the hands of the youngest of the Polgár sisters. A decade after her retirement, Judit’s chess career is still unique. Only two other women have ever reached the world’s top 100: the former women’s world champions Maia Chiburdanidze (Georgia) and Hou Yifan (China). Neither of them made it into the top 50. The question of why so few women reach the absolute top is relevant to chess and other fields where women are underrepresented, such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. To explain and narrow the gender gap, chess can learn from science, and science can learn from chess. For starters, it’s essential to realize that the gender gap at the top is largely caused by underrepresentation. In January 2024 there were 440,390 chess players with an official FIDE rating (obtained in internationally rated tournaments), but only 47,435 of these were women—about 11 percent. In the highest segment, from strong club players to grandmasters, women count for just 6 percent. The higher the level of the players the further the women drop: roughly 1,800 players hold the grandmaster title, but only 42 women do—about 2.3 percent. Why is this? The world of statistics tells us that extreme values in a large sample are all the more probable than those in a small sample. This is explained by a thought experiment I borrowed from fellow Dutchman Wei Ji Ma, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at New York University. Take two groups, one consisting of ten people and the other of two people. All 12 people are given a random number between one and 100, and then we take the highest score in each group. If we repeat these steps many times, we will see that Group A will score 91.4 and Group B 67.2 on average. Because the larger group has more shots at a high score, it will get a higher score on average. Similarly, we can expect many more men at the top of the chess rankings than women because there are many more of them playing chess. A 2009 study led by psychologist Merim Bilalić used this argument to demonstrate that women are not underachieving but that their performance at the top is more or less what can be expected from statistics. The researchers looked at the more than 120,000 members of the German Chess Federation in April 2007, where only one in 16 members was a woman. The model used in the study predicted for 96 percent of the rating difference between the top 100 male and top 100 female players, meaning that those rating difference between genders closely followed the statistically expected difference. Subsequent research questioned the statistical approach of this study and argued that the participation rate only partly explains the observed differences between men and women. It’s not just a numbers game; there’s more to the story. What about the brain? The British grandmaster Nigel Short asked that question in a controversial column for New in Chess magazine in 2015. Short assumed that the difference in achievements between men and women in chess is most likely the result of differences between the male and female brains. He wrote: Men and women’s brains are hard-wired very differently, so why should they function in the same way? I don’t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than I do. Likewise, she doesn’t feel embarrassed in asking me to maneuver the car out of our narrow garage. One is not better than the other, we just have different skills. It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact. If anyone had something to say about the topic, it was Judit Polgár. As the strongest female chess player in the history of the game, she knew better than anyone what it’s like to compete against (and beat!) mostly male opponents. Responding to Short in TIME magazine, she said, “We are capable of the same fight as any other man, and I think during the decades that I actively played chess, I proved it as well. It’s not a matter of gender; it’s a matter of being smart.” Judit Polgár, the best female chess player of all time, in September 2021 at the Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. But, I hear some readers ask, don’t neuroscientists agree that the male and female brains are different and affected by separate hormones? Well, I have to point out two things here. First, this might be true, but no direct links with chess ability have ever been demonstrated convincingly. As Polgár pointed out in a tweet: “Men and women are different, but there are different ways of thinking and fighting [while] still achieving the same results.” Secondly, the neuroscientific research in this field is ongoing and inconclusive. Even a (substantial) distinction between male and female brains is under debate. In 2015, a team led by neuroscientist Daphna Joel from Tel Aviv University did a comprehensive study of over 1,400 brain scans from four different labs. The wide range of variability between each brain led them to conclude that we should “shift from thinking of brains as falling into two classes, one typical of males and the other typical of females, to appreciating the variability of the human brain mosaic.” That being successful in chess isn’t related to biology is perhaps easier to accept when you realize that domain knowledge (expertise obtained by encountering thousands of chess patterns and motifs) is one of the most consistent predictors of chess skill. The two-time US champion Jennifer Shahade wrote in her 2022 book Chess Queens: “Learning the rules of chess takes a few hours, but gaining competence in its intricacies and developing a personal style takes years of work. Playing a highly focused board game for four to six hours is difficult, and neither men nor women nor non-binary players are born with the concentration and motivation to excel at it. For that reason, I find the emphasis on women’s biological inferiority absurd: when it comes to chess, we are all born inept.” In an interesting paper published in 2008, researchers from the University of Padova argued that gender stereotypes are partly responsible for the underperformance of women in chess. They had 42 male–female pairs, all Italian and matched for ability, playing games online. When players were unaware of the sex of their opponent, the women played approximately as well as the men, as could be expected from their similar chess strength. However, when women knew they were playing against a male opponent, they showed a drastic performance drop. Also, when they (falsely) believed they were playing against a woman, they performed as well as their male opponents. The researchers concluded: “This small-scale pilot study suggests that gender stereotypes are very pronounced in the chess world and that both male and female players are perfectly aware of these stereotypes.” In 2020 a research team led by Australian chess grandmaster and researcher David Smerdon replicated these results in an analysis of over eight million tournament games played by over 180,000 players. They concluded that women perform statistically worse than expected when playing against men, with this stereotype threat being “especially large when games are played under tight (rapid or blitz) time constraints.” The latest news on this topic comes from the Dutch scientist Remy Rikers. In a 2022 study, he mentioned the term reversed stereotype threat. Rikers found that the influence of a negative stereotype of women’s ability to play chess is not only limited to their level of performance but that it also has an effect on their opponent’s performance. He had a hundred players play games online, unsure whether they were facing a man or a woman. Ultimately, the study participants were unaware they played neither: their opponent was always a computer. However, sometimes they would see a male nickname and sometimes a female one. The results showed that participants who played against a female nickname played less well, lost more games, and made more mistakes and blunders than participants who played against a male nickname. One way to explain the low female participation in chess is to look at similar fields in society. For instance, women are also underrepresented in careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which are considered to require cognitive abilities similar to chess. In 2017, Ming-Te Wang and Jessica Degol of the University of Pittsburgh reviewed research from the fields of psychology, sociology, economics, and education over the preceding 30 years. They summarized six empirically supported explanations for US women’s underrepresentation in math-intensive STEM fields, and noted a complicated interaction between them. Their conclusions seem to be quite relevant to the chess world. Wang and Degol first mentioned cognitive ability but noted that it had only little effect. On average, girls hardly did worse than boys in math. Boys outperformed them in spatial relations tests involving mental rotation tasks, but only slightly, while girls did somewhat better in verbal tasks. Relative cognitive strengths played a more significant role in future career choices. Among the best math students, girls were more likely to also possess high verbal ability, while boys were more likely to demonstrate higher math relative to verbal ability. As a result, young women often have a greater variety of career options with less of a necessity to focus on a single strength. The third reason Wang and Degol presented for the gender gap concerned women tending to have different career interests or preferences, sometimes explained by the short notion that “males prefer working with objects whereas females prefer working with other people.” These differences can reach back as far as early adolescence. Another factor involved lifestyle values or work–family balance preferences, where women, especially when planning to have children, were more willing than men to make occupational sacrifices for the sake of their families and didn’t like work-centered lifestyles as much as men. Field-specific ability beliefs could be a factor as well. The American psychologist Carol S. Dweck noticed in 2007 that when girls were told about the “innate ability” and “natural talent” of math geniuses, after that they would perform significantly worse on a geometry task than girls who were told the math geniuses were hard workers. Based on this, Wang and Degol noted that women might be avoiding STEM careers because they wrongly assume two things: that innate intelligence is required and that they are lacking this. The final explanation for female underrepresentation was discussed earlier: gender-related stereotypes and biases. The researchers noted that while overt (intentional) and hostile forms of gender discrimination were occurring less frequently than some decades ago, covert (more subtle) and benevolent (overly affective) forms of discrimination still happen all the time and no doubt affect women’s career choices. We can try to explain the gender gap in chess in another way. The percentage of female (to male) players varies quite a bit across different countries—but figuring out why might reveal something about the reasons behind the female minority in chess in the first place. In an article written in 2019 on his website, David Smerdon attempted just that. Interestingly, the numbers go against intuition completely. It would be fair to assume that in countries with less gender equality, female participation in chess would be smaller, right? As Smerdon put it: “In more conservative countries, one might expect that a girl would be encouraged to get married and stay at home with the kids, rather than play rated tournaments. In poorer countries, a family might not be able to afford to send all of the children to chess lessons, and so the girls might miss out.” However, in practice, it’s not like that at all. Countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, which are among the top-ranked in the United Nations Development Program’s annual rankings of gender equality, have the lowest percentage of women chess players (about 5 percent). Meanwhile, countries with much lower gender equality—such as Georgia, China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and the UAE—all have percentages above 25. So, the more gender-equal a country, the fewer females play chess. But why? One possible explanation for the small minority of women engaged in STEM fields is that women are more likely to have a variety of interests. While that was linked to relative cognitive ability before, it turns out this is also the case for their status in society: researchers have observed that the more women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences. But it would be too simple to state that women don’t like chess as much as men. Smerdon suggests that more women might play chess in gender-unequal countries “because it’s one of the few fields where they can both compete with men and be sure that the result is judged objectively and without discrimination (as opposed to, say, promotions in the workplace).” The economist Maryam Dilmaghani signaled in 2021 that a legacy of a command economy, where major economic decisions are made by the government (such as in the former Soviet Union), was the most significant predictor of a smaller gender gap in competitive chess across countries. Apart from the general popularity and governmental support for chess in formerly communist countries, a possible explanation for this smaller gap was that women participated as much as men in the labor force, taking jobs traditionally seen as male in the West, which perhaps made it easier for them to navigate the male-dominated chess world. Another difference in gender is something that anyone can easily detect by looking at youth chess across the world. At a young age—say, eight to ten years—the overrepresentation of boys in chess classes is not as significant as in older age groups, but more girls than boys stop playing chess at some point. Why is this happening? I believe it is a combination of girls starting as a minority in the first place (boys get introduced to chess more often than girls) and then also finding themselves in a somewhat hostile environment where boys tend to dominate the space and blurt out answers. In contrast, many girls turn silent in a group where the boys have a majority. Although chess-playing girls tend to be part of a social group with other girls during their school years, such comfort usually disappears upon finishing high school and joining a chess club, which means entering an environment with very few girls or women to interact with. This was reflected in a somewhat forgotten paper from 2002 by researcher Ingrid Galitis. She tried to discover how boys came to dominate her primary school’s chess club in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Interviews with 18 girls aged seven to 12 revealed the perception of hostility from boys and an aversion to the boys’ aggressive attitudes. Also, girls tended to talk much more freely when they were among girls only. Other factors related to dropping out included whether girls had family members or friends involved in chess and a lack of attention given to them by tutors. A paper from October 2023, co-written by Jennifer Shahade, revealed another reason girls might drop out of chess more than boys—one we have seen when discussing STEM careers. The research pointed out that parents and mentors often believe girls have a lower potential in chess than boys. This bias is more pronounced among those who think chess success requires brilliance. “It is striking that even the parents and coaches who have a vested interest in girls’ success hold biases against them and may also have some blind spots about the barriers to girls’ success,” said Andrei Cimpian, the paper’s senior author. To coaches and parents who are reading this: you need to believe in girls, because your attitude might hinder them from succeeding if you don’t. In an article for Slate.com from December 2020, Wei Ji Ma mentioned social, cultural, and economic factors that explain why all top chess players are men. It is one of the best pieces ever written about this topic. I quote Ma as he sums up many good reasons why women are underperforming: Top female players are often relegated to women-only invitational tournaments, most likely limiting their ability to increase their ranking. It is possible that national federations invest less in top female players than in their male counterparts, for example, in terms of training or finding sponsors. It’s much easier for male players to make a living from chess. Among top players with children, women might be more burdened with child-care duties than men and therefore have less time to play in and prepare for tournaments. Top female players might fall victim to stereotype threat (where a member of a negatively stereotyped group underperforms due to the pressure or anxiety induced by the stereotype), which indeed seems to manifest itself in the results of chess games. It is also likely that top female chess players face a particularly hostile environment, leading them to drop out in higher proportions than lower-ranked women. The chess world was rather slow in responding to the #MeToo movement, but when several cases of sexual assault came to light in 2023, they showed that Ma’s last point was spot on. Like everywhere else in society, we need to work harder to make chess safer for all genders. That includes transgender people, who have their own battles to fight. As of August 2023, FIDE decided that transgender women cannot compete in its official events for women until its officials make an assessment of the gender change. While some top women players approved of this measure, the French transwoman chess player and coach Yosha Iglesias was baffled. She wrote on X: “The new regulations will make trans chess players all over the world face a horrible dilemma: transition or quit chess”—adding that for trans players and especially women “it will do so much unnecessary harm.” Regarding the attempts to increase the participation and improve the atmosphere for women, there are signs that systemic changes might be happening. A promising new initiative is the Women in Chess Foundation, launched in the fall of 2023. More good news came from FIDE in November 2023 when it published its first Gender Equality in Chess Index, an innovative instrument designed to measure and compare the level of gender equality in chess federations across the globe. I have high hopes for research being conducted under the supervision of Jeroen Struben, Associate Professor of Strategy and Organization at the Emlyon Business School in Lyon, France. Struben, a specialist in systems thinking, examines gender segregation dynamics resulting from interactions between a variety of factors. He looks at how players decide to start with chess in the first place, their decisions about commitment to improving, gameplay, dropout, performance, and influences from peers, role models, and the broader community. He has compiled a dataset of over 40,000 members of the Dutch Chess Federation between 1994 and 2018 and combined it with elite-player interviews, an integrative literature review, and computation and simulation. Whereas scientific research usually focuses on a single aspect, Struben believes system thinking is crucial in areas like sustainability and gender. “Because research has shown that many factors play a role, you cannot isolate one since their interaction could be very important,” he said. “By looking at them together, we can figure out why, despite well-intended efforts, little progress has been made, and, secondly, we can conclude that some factors are of little importance individually but become important together, which can help [us] to come up with strategies that act following the whole system.” When I spoke to Struben in November 2023, he could share some initial conclusions. His model showed that peer influence and role models have a measurable relationship with dropout rates and effort. Also, no single factor is dominant in the gender differences in chess, so we must look deeper into how their inter-dependency works. The ultimate goal is to help the Dutch Chess Federation, and, hopefully, other federations, to develop a long-term policy toward more inclusion and integration in the chess world. For Struben, the next step will be to use his insights as a starting point for research in STEM areas. Elo Ratings, Databases, Engines: A Researcher’s Gold Mine As a closed environment that requires solving complex tasks, chess facilitates the design of experiments that specifically address theoretical questions. The researcher Roy Roring explained it perfectly: “Finding the best move in a chess position is a highly complex, real-world human activity, and each chess position represents a well-defined problem environment, with a fixed number of identifiable moves that can be played at any given point—perfect for studying search processes and problem-solving.” There are three more technical reasons chess lends itself well to scientific research: Elo ratings, databases, and engines. The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players. Developed by the Hungarian American physics professor Arpad Elo, the system assigns numerical ratings to players based on game performance. Players gain or lose points depending on the outcome of games, and this gain or loss is higher if the rating difference with their opponent is bigger. The system has been used since 1960 in the US and since 1970 internationally. Beginners have ratings of around 500 to 800, novices around 1100, and average players around 1500. We tend to call players above 2000 experts. An international master normally is between 2400 and 2500. An international grandmaster usually has a rating above 2500. In January 2024, 36 players were rated over 2700. “The Elo system is one of the reasons why, early on, chess was very useful for expertise research in particular,” research psychologist Christopher Chabris told me. “You could objectively identify who was an expert and even finer gradations of expert versus novice. You could identify the exact skill difference between two people. You can’t do that with anything else than the Elo system, and it’s a huge benefit. Even having a consensus on who are the experts and who are the novices, and how far apart they are in their actual ability to succeed in the task, doesn’t exist in law, it doesn’t exist in medicine or other areas.” Using chess ratings has become particularly useful in science since around 2006 when FIDE computerized all official ratings data gathered since their inaugural 1970 list. This means there is now a consistent database for the last half-century, and the rating progress of thousands of players can be tracked over years and sometimes decades. With such a well-organized, objective, and complete dataset, one advantage for researchers is that they don’t need to worry about sampling bias, which is when a sample selected for a study does not represent the broader population it intends to represent. Another type of chess database provides a second tool for the researcher: one that forms a structured collection of games that have been recorded and stored electronically. Such databases are used by both chess players and researchers to study and analyze games, track historical trends, and improve their understanding of the game. Chess databases typically include a wide range of games played by various players at different skill levels, from early historical events until present-day tournaments. With a software program, a search can filter out games based on all kinds of data, including the players’ names, the date the game was played, the event, the result, the opening played, or even specific positions. Since 1987, the Hamburg-based company ChessBase has been selling the leading chess database software bearing the same name. It was originally developed with the help of none other than Garry Kasparov, who commented about a prototype he had seen a year earlier: “This is the most important development in chess study since Gutenberg.” Decades later, it is also an important development for broader study. “These databases present a gold mine for researchers interested in various topics in psychology,” wrote the research psychologists Nemanja Vaci and Merim Bilalić in 2017. “Similarly to those in other fields, chess databases offer the possibilities of applying data-mining and modeling approaches on large datasets and of investigating a number of cognitive effects.” The pair noted that chess databases can be used “to tackle topics such as skill development over the lifetime, birth cohort effects, effects of activity and inactivity on chess play, and even gender differences.” Databases of over-the-board games have existed since the late 1980s and can include millions of games. The website Lichess allows users to download its complete database of all games played on the site since 2013. In January 2024, that consisted of an incredible 7.9 billion games. Because researchers have become much better at analyzing big data, sometimes helped by artificial intelligence, such online databases have become invaluable. The third handy research tool is an aspect of the modern chess world I will elaborate on later in the book: chess engines. These are basically computer programs that can play chess, but they can also analyze already-played games, which is particularly interesting for the scientist, as David Smerdon explained to me. Apart from looking at game results, we can now look at individual chess moves. It is as if, apart from the final scores, we can now also analyze the quality of passes, assists, and shots on goal to objectively evaluate the performance of soccer teams. In the past, we could only analyze performance at the game level, and the performance scores were also not independent of what the opponent was doing. From a statistical point of view, we can’t treat the performances of both players in a game as independent observations, so we end up throwing away a lot of data. Being able to analyze the quality of individual moves with engines improves both the quantity and the quality of research. First of all, the data size increases a lot because instead of looking at each game that you play as one data point, we’re looking at each move by each player as a data point. By treating each move as an independent decision problem, we end up with roughly 80 times more data. Secondly, the evaluation by the engine gives us an objective benchmark for the best move, which means we can get a reliable, independent measure of cognitive performance. The first time a chess engine was used for scientific research was probably in 1999 in Christopher Chabris’s doctoral dissertation, Cognitive and Neuropsychological Mechanisms of Expertise: Studies with Chess Masters. He analyzed 1,188 chess games with the help of the German program Fritz 5 to demonstrate in a reasonably objective manner that when players had additional time to think ahead, the quality of their decisions improved significantly. This might sound logical but was contrary to a theory that existed at the time, which held that pattern-recognition processes (which require little time on the clock) played a dominant role in top-level chess expertise. Voilà! Now we understand why there’s been such a boom in chess-related research over the last ten to 15 years: thanks to the Elo rating system, databases, and engines, many cognitive scientists and people interested in cognitive performance from different disciplines (such as economics, psychology, or computer science, including some high-profile researchers from Ivy League universities) suddenly became interested and started publishing papers using these tools. An excellent example of how all these chess tools combined can be used to study real-world phenomena was supplied by Smerdon himself. In a 2022 paper, he looked at the effect of face masks on cognitive performance. Two years after the COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020, 178 of 186 researched countries required facial coverings to be worn in some or all public spaces, workplaces, and educational settings. Little was known about the impact of masks on cognitive performance. Smerdon jumped on it. Using chess databases, he collected data from over 70 chess tournaments with mask requirements held during the pandemic. He matched those to an approximate figure of 140 tournaments staged without mask requirements but with a considerable overlap of the same players. He used a chess engine to analyze almost three million chess moves played by more than 8,000 people in 18 countries. His study showed that wearing a face mask during a chess game decreased the quality of chess players’ decisions—an effect that was relatively short-lived—and mostly hurt stronger players. While mask-wearing negatively impacted chess performance, the effect subsided after four to six hours of playing. “The decrease in performance was due to the annoyance caused by the masks rather than a physiological mechanism, but people adapted to the distraction over time,” Smerdon said. “The results suggest that the effect of masks may depend on the type of task, the duration of the task and the working memory load. This is something to keep in mind for occupations in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as well as other professions that demand a high level of working memory such as language interpreters, performers, waiters, and teachers.” The Benefits of Chess On Wednesday, February 11, 2015, something happened that the Spanish journalist Leontxo García called “the Spanish Miracle.” García has covered chess since the early 1980s. He is also a passionate promoter of the game, and, throughout his career, has supported the idea that teaching chess in schools is beneficial for children. On that winter Wednesday in 2015, the Spanish parliament agreed with him. “I was tempted to call the Vatican to report a miracle,” he told me, “because, in Spain, to get all parties with no exception agreeing on anything is a miracle, and it happened that day.” In a unanimous vote, the Education and Sports Commission of the Congress of Deputies recommended using chess as an educational tool in the curriculum. “It had to be a recommendation; it could not be compulsory because, in Spain, except for the major ones, the education competencies are transferred to the regional governments,” explained García. “But in the following three years, ten out of 17 regions introduced chess into the curriculum, and, after the pandemic, at least two or three more are thinking about it.” He estimates that over a million Spanish children are now connected to chess in their schools in one way or another. Almost a decade later, chess-related educational programs can be found across the globe, following the example of countries with an even longer tradition in the game, such as Armenia, Georgia, and Russia. Even in England, where chess is not officially recognized as a sport, the game was given a massive boost in the summer of 2023 when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced almost £1 million ($1.27 million) in funding to support the English Chess Federation, to promote chess in British schools and to install a hundred tables in public parks. When Sunak visited a school in Washington, DC, he said he was trying to get British children to play more chess, describing it as “good for you.” In general, chess is believed to be beneficial to educational development, and why wouldn’t it be? There are so many different types of skills and competencies needed for chess that are useful elsewhere in life: collaboration, communication, strategic thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, deduction, anticipation, concentration, clever use of resources, preparation, learning from mistakes, and even the concept of fair play. The benefits of chess are, however, the topic of an ongoing scientific debate. Research has shown that, like musicians, chess players are, on average, slightly more intelligent than the general population. This, however, doesn’t automatically mean that chess makes you smarter. People with a higher IQ may like chess (or music) more than others and choose to indulge in the game more often. This effect is known as self-selection. The question is whether certain qualities necessary for chess or music can transfer to other areas; chess as basis for developing intelligence. Scientists use the term transfer of learning, and distinguish between “near transfer” (the transfer between closely related domains—e.g., knowledge of Latin transfers to other languages) and “far transfer”(the transfer between domains that are only loosely related—e.g., Latin and geography). If chess could make kids better at mathematics, this would be a clear case of far transfer. Some research has pointed to the positive effects of chess teaching on math test results. At the same time, there are papers that fail to demonstrate a link. Which study to believe? In 2017, Giovanni Sala and Fernand Gobet of the University of Liverpool decided to look at 24 existing studies regarding the potential benefits of chess for children concerning mathematics, reading, and cognitive skills. Sala and Gobet’s meta-analysis showed small positive effects “with chess enhancing primary and middle-school students’ achievement in mathematics and overall cognitive ability.” However, the overall effect size was “not large enough to convincingly establish the effectiveness of chess instruction in enhancing the skills [under] consideration,” according to the researchers. They also pointed out a major problem in the existing research on the effectiveness of chess instruction: “Almost none of the reviewed studies compared chess-treated groups with active control groups to rule out possible placebo effects.” A 2022 paper by the Spanish research psychologist Angel Blanch noted similar issues with the existing research. He looked at 45 studies in 19 countries targeting cognitive ability and academic performance and noted that most had theoretical and methodological drawbacks. Only 16 percent of the studies had a robust research design with large enough sample sizes or more sophisticated data-analysis approaches. These studies tended to report lower or null effects, causing “reasonable concerns over the evidence about the benefits of chess instruction.” All in all, we have to conclude that the data doesn’t demonstrate proof that chess makes you smarter. But does this mean we should stop teaching chess at schools? Maybe not. Despite his “reasonable concerns,” Blanch ended his paper as follows: Nonetheless, chess seems … an interesting activity to teach in school contexts. Chess is an ancient universal game, an intellectually related activity that is part of human cultural heritage, and that comprises a considerable body of specialized knowledge. It is easy to implement, it is relatively cheap, and it is appealing to both children and adults because of its playing and competitive nature.… Perhaps it is not necessary to justify the need of teaching chess in the classrooms because of being beneficial for intelligence and academic performance. What is needed ultimately is the undertaking of higher quality studies about the benefits of chess for other kinds of simpler outcomes that may be relevant for education. As Blanch intimated, chess may not directly boost cognitive abilities but it may indirectly benefit academic achievement by enhancing skills such as concentration, risk-taking, and patience—something backed up by an Australian study published in 2020 on the effects of chess instruction to grade-five students on academic and non-cognitive outcomes. The research took place in 2016 in 16 rural primary schools in Bangladesh, where the children did not have previous experience playing chess, so the impact of the lessons might have been higher than in previous research. The main finding of the Bangladesh study was that, almost a year after the chess training had ended, it had reduced the level of risk aversion among the children. At the end of that period, nine out of ten students were still playing and reached a level where taking risks had become a regular aspect of their games. There were also signs of a slightly better performance in math and a higher level of patience than in the control group that did not partake in chess lessons, but those results were not statistically significant. Other indirect academic benefits were shown in a Danish paper from 2017. Chess was taught in five schools in Aarhus, the second-largest city in Denmark, to 482 children (grades one to three). About two-thirds had one of their four weekly mathematics lectures replaced with chess instruction; the other third was the control group. The results indicated moderate positive effects on the math skills of the pupils involved in chess. The most interesting conclusion was that these positive effects almost exclusively impacted children who were not very happy at school and those who were occasionally or always bored. Obtaining mathematical concepts through chess could be a more engaging way to deliver teaching. As we have seen, teachers skeptical about including chess lessons in the curriculum can claim their doubts are scientifically justified. The goal, however, doesn’t need to be that children learn chess. It is also possible to use chess to teach children whatever they need to know at school. This has been demonstrated in Hungary for over a decade with the “Chess Palace” program, developed by the Judit Polgár Chess Foundation for Educational Benefits. Since 2013, Chess Palace has been part of the national curriculum of Hungarian elementary schools. A decade on, it is used in over a thousand schools, with over 4,000 teachers teaching 50,000 children annually. The material, intended for children aged 4–10 years, is unique because it goes beyond the regular borders of chess teaching. The chess-themed program teaches children areas like mathematics, science, arts and crafts, foreign languages, reading, and writing, thus demonstrating the incredible versatility of the game. Judit Polgár, here with Magnus Carlsen at a primary school in Stavanger, Norway, in 2019, dedicates a lot of her time to chess education. When I spoke to Leontxo García in September 2023, we discussed science’s failure to back up claims about the beneficial nature of chess. He wasn’t discouraged. “I have talked to more than 200 neurologists during my career,” he said. “There is no doubt. Of course, chess is not the only thing you can do, but it is one of the best, for sure. Nobody is questioning that, as far as I know.” The benefits of chess don’t need to be limited to general educational purposes either. Growing research is focusing on specific groups, such as children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A review article from 2023 that looked at four studies published in medical journals concluded that “chess has positive effects on ADHD symptoms and their severity” and recommended chess be “included for the management of ADHD patients as a complementary therapy.” Chess may also benefit the elderly, preventing or delaying the onset of dementia. This field of research has existed a bit longer. In a 2019 review article that looked at 21 studies, a group of researchers from Spain concluded that “even though the evidence is weak to demonstrate its role as a protective factor, other evidence indirectly related to chess and based on its cognitive stimulating functions suggest it may work as a protective factor.” On a final note, which once again shows the versatility of chess, I will mention the positive impact a chess program had on an unexpected group: prisoners. In 2012, Sheriff Thomas Dart and coach/organizer Mikhail Korenman started a “chess in jail” program in Cook County, Illinois, that involved chess classes for inmates. “Chess is more than an entertaining pastime,” Dart said in 2020. “The game teaches its players valuable life lessons. It requires critical thinking to consider the risks and rewards of their decisions, which are valuable skills that help foster a reduction in violent behavior.” When I visited the London Chess Conference in March 2023, Korenman presented some results after a decade of running the project with about 3,000 inmates. An important conclusion was that spending time with chess had a positive effect on bringing down the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among those participants who had been involved in the program for more than six months. There were also lower levels of inmate fights, uses of force, batteries to staff, and recidivism among the chess participants compared with a control group that did not join the program. In their landmark 1973 article “Skill in Chess,” Herbert Simon and William Chase were the first to make the now famous comparison between chess and the fruit fly in print. This comparison suggests that both chess and the common fruit fly (Latin name: Drosophila melanogaster) are simple and widely known tools for experiments that can be effectively used to gain valuable insights into more complex systems. While the fruit fly has played a key role in bio-medical research, revealing fundamental principles of genetics and development and illuminating human health and disease, chess has played a similar role in other areas of scientific research. As we have seen in this chapter, chess has indeed been a perfect model and an incredibly versatile tool for cognitive psychologists, in particular, but also other kinds of scientists. In the second part of this book, we will see that this analogy worked even better for chess and artificial intelligence—where the comparison was made first. But first, we’ll learn which players have left the biggest mark on chess, thus shaping the cultural meaning of the game in their stead. I’ll also try to answer the impossible but ever-entertaining question: who was the greatest of all?",

      "content": "Chapter 3A Mutual Understanding: Chess and Science “Chess: Symbol of military tactics. All the great generals were good at it. Too serious as a game, too futile as a science.” —Gustave Flaubert, Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues, 1913 “Before I was born, my parents decided that I was going to be a genius.” With this intriguing sentence, Judit Polgár started her TED Talk in 2016. The most successful female chess player in the history of the game revealed the secret behind her brilliant career—one that would see her reach a level of play that no other woman has ever achieved. It’s a story of original thinking, determination, and love. Judit’s parents, László and Klára, were both teachers. Before they married in 1967, László shared his strong opinions with Klára about the Hungarian education system which, he felt, wasted talent due to a lack of focus. He wanted to teach their future children at home and, for each of them, focus on a single topic in which they could excel. “My mother initially thought he was crazy,” Judit later said, but Klára was impressed by László’s boundless energy and commitment and agreed to the marriage. The two read psychology books and immersed themselves in all the information they could find about prodigies and the early life of geniuses. And then they made their big decision: they embarked on a parenting experiment. Susan was born in 1969, followed by Sofia in 1974, and Judit in 1976. The three girls were homeschooled in different languages, math, and chess. László and Klára chose to focus on chess because it demands creative and intellectual capacities, while the results are easily measurable (more about that later). Soon, the unique upbringing of the girls meant a full-time job for their parents. In 1989, László explained his educational ideas in a small book titled Nevelj Zsenit! (Bring Up Genius!) It was his response to the famous nature-nurture debate: he considered talent not a hereditary trait but something you could teach to any child. In 1992 he told the Washington Post, “A genius is not born but is educated and trained.” Judit herself said chess is “80 percent hard work and 20 percent talent.” When I asked her in September 2023 to define talent, she thought briefly and said, “Talent is a tricky thing. Sometimes I feel it is kind of an attitude. It’s your personality. Many people want to be somebody different, but the people who are really doing good things dare to be themselves. I became exceptional in the chess world, but I was not exceptional. I created it to be. I mean, basically, I was doing something a lot on a daily basis, and the circumstances helped me.” In 1991, Judit became a grandmaster at the age of 15 years and four months, the youngest to ever achieve this feat at the time. In doing so she broke the record Bobby Fischer had held since 1958. While Sofia became an international master and Susan a strong grand-master (winning, for instance, the women’s world championship), Judit became the first and only woman to ever break into the world’s top ten in 1996. At her peak, in July 2005, she was ranked eighth in the world. The Polgár sisters at the 1988 Chess Olympiad in Thessaloniki, Greece. From left to right: Judit, Susan, and Sofia. László Polgár’s opinion that practice is (much) more important than talent is now generally accepted, but wasn’t at the time. He developed his ideas in a period when the study of expertise and the field of cognitive psychology were still in their infancy. Half a century later, we can see that chess has played a fundamental role in the development of these areas of science. It continues to do so, more than ever. Chess as a Toolbox for Science In the twenty-first century, chess-related scientific research has exploded. Between 1970 and 2007 Google Scholar lists 1,785 papers with chess in the title. In the period since: 3,400. Chess is booming, and chess research is too. It can be argued that chess has significantly impacted various branches of scientific thought, demonstrating incredible versatility and usefulness, and as a source of inspiration. As it is seen as the area closest to the game, let’s start with mathematics. The German mathematician and logician Ernst Zermelo was an avid chess player, and in 1913 he published his “Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels” (“On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of Chess”). It was the first paper on game theory. Zermelo introduced an important theorem that holds for any two-person non-chance game where players move alternately, have opposing interests, and access to “perfect information.” The latter means that both sides have complete knowledge of what is going on (as opposed to, for example, poker, where there’s both available and hidden information as the players are hiding their cards from the others). Zermelo attempted to mathematically formalize the concept of a winning position, noting that if a player is in a winning position, they can always force a win no matter what strategy the other player may employ. Zermelo’s work has contributed to various areas of mathematics and computer science. Chess has also been connected to language studies, beginning with the Swiss linguist, semiotician, and philosopher Ferdinand de Saussure. His Course in General Linguistics, published in 1916 and based on lectures he gave at the University of Geneva, is generally regarded as the starting point of structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the meaning of words is not fixed or independent but depends on how they relate to each other. However, even though individual words are arbitrary, the overall structure of language is not random but follows social conventions. Understanding how words work in a specific context involves looking at the rules and practices rather than just the history of individual words. To explain this, Saussure used a comparison to chess: “The respective value of the pieces depends on their position on the chessboard, just as each linguistic term derives its value from its opposition to all the other terms. The system is always momentary; it varies from one position to the next. It is also true that values depend above all else on an unchangeable convention, the set of rules that exists before a game begins and persists after each move.” In his Philosophical Investigations, published posthumously in 1953, the famous philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein reflected several times on chess. For instance, he compared linguistic expressions with chess pieces to explain that it is not enough to know the rules of a language to be able to recognize words and use them correctly: “When one shows someone the king in chess and says, ‘This is the king,’ this does not tell him the use of this piece—unless he already knows the rules of the game up to this last point: the shape of the king. You could imagine his having learned the rules of the game without ever having been shown an actual piece. The shape of the chessman corresponds here to the sound or shape of a word.” Later, he added, “But we talk about it as we do about pieces in chess when we are stating the rules of the game, not describing their physical properties. The question, ‘What is a word, really?’ is analogous to ‘What is a piece in chess?’ ” Chess and Psychology Aside from artificial intelligence, the scientific field that chess has had the most profound impact on is psychology. Chess has been used to study many aspects of the human mind, including perception, attention, memory, learning, creativity, thinking, and decision-making. The earliest recorded use of chess in psychological research dates from 1893. Alfred Binet, known for inventing the first practical IQ test, became fascinated by a particular aspect of chess that has mesmerized people for centuries: playing blindfold chess. Binet decided to do a study to test his hypothesis that chess masters were using a photographic kind of memory—an “inner mirror,” as he called it. Among his study participants was one of the world’s best players, Siegbert Tarrasch. The participants answered questions about what they were “seeing” during play, but their answers did not conform to Binet’s “inner mirror” idea. As it turned out, the players were not keeping complete positions sharply in their minds; what their internal memories stored were more like abstract patterns that they recognized, similar to musical chords or melodies. One of the participants, the French master Alphonse Goetz, said, “I grasp it as a musician grasps harmony in his orchestra.” Memory, it came to be understood, is only partly a visual concept; giving a meaningful context to the patterns and the impressions those patterns sparked help players remember positions. Binet concluded that it was “the multitude of suggestions and ideas emanating from a game which makes it interesting and establishes it in memory.” Binet’s study was the first in a long period of research in cognitive psychology that continues until this day, trying to answer fundamental questions like, “How do great chess players think?”; “How is that different from how amateurs think?” And, “What do these differences in chess thinking say about cognition in general?” Regarding the fascinating topic of blindfold chess, it’s important to stress that the ability to play a game of chess without looking at the board or the pieces is not as hard as it seems, nor is it limited to just a handful of brilliant minds. It is something any strong club player is capable of. I would compare it to playing a whole repertoire of études and nocturnes on the piano without needing the music in front of you, simply because you have practiced it for years. What is extraordinary, however, is the ability to play a blindfold simul. (This, in particular, was what inspired Binet to do his research.) When the great Philidor played two blindfold games at once in 1782, The World described it as “a phenomenon in the history of man” which “should be hoarded among the best samples of human memory, till memory shall be no more.” However, 150 years later, George Koltanowski played 34 blindfold games simultaneously. The current record stands at 48 games, played by the Uzbekistani American grandmaster Timur Gareyev in 2016 while wearing a blindfold mask and riding 80 kilometers (50 miles) on a spin bike. An engraving from 1794 depicts French composer and chess player François-André Danican Philidor, center, playing chess blindfolded, as members of the London Chess Club look on. It took several decades for another pioneer in the field to arrive on the scene—who, like Binet, was a remarkable scientist. I am talking about my fellow Dutchman, the internationally renowned psychologist (and chess master) Adriaan de Groot. De Groot suspected that grandmasters see more and calculate better than weaker players, and wanted to test his hypothesis. He convinced five of the eight participants of the international AVRO tournament in 1938 in the Netherlands to participate in some experiments. Still a student, de Groot was starting to collect data on what would become his now famous doctoral thesis from 1946, Het denken van den schaker, which in 1965 was translated into English and published as Thought and Choice in Chess. Apart from world-class grandmasters, de Groot worked with two other categories of players: experts and amateurs. He gave all of them two tasks. First, he asked the chess players to think aloud while looking at a position and choosing their next move, then recorded their verbal utterances. These “verbal protocols” were subjected to both a statistical and an interpretative analysis and yielded surprising results. Although grandmasters play better moves, their structural thinking isn’t much different from that of experts. For instance, they don’t see many more positions, and they don’t calculate much deeper. Allow me an intermezzo, because this brings me to the most frequently asked question for chess grandmasters by layman interviewers—a question which is utterly boring and completely misses the point: “How many moves can you think ahead?” The answer is: “It depends.” And usually the chess player doesn’t even bother trying to explain why. A century ago, someone gave arguably the best answer possible. The anecdote has appeared in different forms and has been attributed to many famous players. The version as told by Israel Albert Horowitz in 1946 in Chess Review, about a game from 1913, might be the most accurate: Apropos is the story of the game between the invincible Capablanca and Charles Jaffe, pride of the East Side. Capa forgot he was invincible: he lost. A reporter who was present asked the Cuban, “How far do you see ahead?” Capa replied impressively, “About ten moves.” Then the reporter went over to Jaffe: “How far do you see ahead?” Much to everyone’s surprise, the reply was, “Only one move.” This didn’t make sense. “How could a player who can see only one move ahead defeat another who can delve so deeply?” Here Jaffe explained: “I see only one move ahead, but always the best move.” An important difference between the grandmasters and the weaker players in de Groot’s experiment was that the strong players quickly discovered promising options, making their thought processes more efficient. The difference was so stark that, according to de Groot, a world champion had a better understanding of the positions after five seconds of looking at them than a strong amateur player after 15 minutes! De Groot concluded that superiority in chess must be related to how players look at positions—i.e., perception, and how that is linked to previous knowledge. That prompted him to devise a second task. This time, the players were confronted with several diagrams of chess positions and could only look at them briefly (two to 15 seconds). After each brief viewing session, the diagram was taken away, and the participants were asked to set up the position on a chessboard as precisely as possible. Grandmasters were clearly better at this task than experts and amateurs. In later research, de Groot and his PhD students discovered something that appears to be related to Binet’s findings: strong players quickly recognize patterns, groups of pieces, possible moves, or even sequences of moves. This allows them to remember positions without focusing on all the individual pieces and pawns. In the 1960s, de Groot further investigated this theory when he began measuring eye movements. Grandmasters spent more time looking at parts of the chessboard where groups of pieces were connected in a relevant way, and were more often fixated on the intersection of squares than weak players were. De Groot’s experiments in the 1930s, and his conclusions about knowledge, thinking skills, and perceptual-memory skills, formed the foundation for later research in the 1960s and beyond. The American research psychologist Christopher Chabris described him to me as a brilliant and groundbreaking researcher: “He was ahead of his time for the research methods he was using, the questions he was asking, and the kinds of conclusions he was coming to. It took decades for other people to do similar things.” Two more scientists have strongly impacted cognitive science with their chess-related research: William Chase and Herbert Simon. The two Carnegie Mellon psychologists offered valuable contributions in the areas of memory and problem-solving, which are still relevant in and outside the scope of chess. Building upon de Groot’s work, Chase and Simon were instrumental in the development of what is known as the chunking theory. Chunking, first mentioned in a 1956 paper by the American psychologist George Miller, is the process of connecting individual pieces of a set of information to create a meaningful whole that is easier to memorize. A clear example is the phone number 0603091943, which can be separated into 06 03 09 1943. The “06” signifies a mobile phone number (in the Netherlands) and forms a chunk almost automatically, while “03” and “09” can be remembered as March 9, and the last chunk clearly forms a year. Other examples of chunks are words created from single letters and sentences from words. Chase and Simon assumed that the long-term memory of chess players consists of chunks of chess information—again, somewhat similar to Binet’s patterns. Examples of such chunks are three pawns in front of a white king and rook in the third quadrant of the board (a typical situation after White has castled kingside) or an advanced white knight threatening a double attack on Black’s king and queenside rook. Chess chunks are familiar situations where a small number of pieces and pawns on a part of the board are somehow connected. The results of Chase and Simon’s research supported the hypothesis that strong players have stored many more such chunks—up to 50,000 in the case of a chess master—than an amateur player, allowing them to recognize more of them in new positions and remember these positions better. And because the chunks provide helpful information about what might be going on in the position, strong players can more easily pre-select moves to choose from. In other words, more knowledge and a better understanding of previous positions leads to more efficient reasoning in new positions. Together with the cognitive psychologist Fernand Gobet, Simon later refined the chunking theory into what is known as the template theory, which shows how high-level, schematic structures (templates) can evolve from perceptual chunks. In 1992, when the field of cognitive psychology was still relatively young, the American psychologist Neil Charness convincingly demonstrated that chess research had already impacted cognitive science and various areas of general psychology. Among other insights, studies using chess showed that acquiring knowledge is more important than age factors, and that problem-solving performance depends on skill, but not on age. In contrast, memory performance declines with age but increases with skill. The area in psychology that has probably experienced the most chess-related research is expertise. Why do some people become experts in their field and others don’t? Can anyone become a chess grandmaster, or a top musician or mathematician, for that matter? Is there such a thing as natural talent? Or is it all about getting those famed 10,000 hours of practice in? The “10,000-hour rule” stems from Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book Outliers. He gave several examples of how people became successful (including Bill Gates, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Bobby Fischer, and the Beatles) and claimed that achieving world-class expertise in any skill requires 10,000 hours of practice. Gladwell’s theory was based on a 1993 study led by the Swedish psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, who found that the best violinists had put significantly more hours into practicing their instrument from a young age than amateur or expert musicians. In a 2013 paper, Ericsson corrected what he saw as an oversimplification in Outliers. His most important point was that the best violinists had accumulated an average of over 10,000 hours by the age of 20, while Gladwell claimed they totaled 10,000 hours of practice. Ericsson further explained: “Our main point was that the best group of violinists had spent significantly more hours practicing than the two groups of less accomplished groups of expert violinists, and vastly more time than amateur musicians. There is nothing magical about exactly 10,000 hours.” The difference between total and average means a lot in practice, as was demonstrated in 2007 by psychology researchers Guillermo Campitelli and Fernand Gobet. After observing 104 competitive chess players of different skill levels, they concluded that to reach the level of a strong expert, about 11,000 hours of practice are needed on average. However, the range among their test subjects was striking: one player had needed only 3,000 hours to reach that level, while another required 23,000 hours. Others had spent more than 25,000 hours without getting as good. All of this suggests that practice is an important factor for success, but talent does play a role. The highest-rated player on the planet, Magnus Carlsen, became a grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 27 days—about five and a half years after starting to play chess. With a case like him, it’s hard not to believe in talent. I’d like to make one more important point about practice, for all you parents out there who are still eager for your child to put in those 10,000 hours. The 1993 study with musicians was not just about spending time on a particular skill; it concerned what Ericsson and his colleagues called deliberate practice, which is characterized by focused, systematic, and purposeful efforts to improve performance. In other words, both the quantity and the quality of practice lead to results. The good news is that nowadays it is easier than ever to practice chess meaningfully, thanks to the computer and the internet. Women and Chess: What Science Says Back in the 1970s when László and Klára Polgár decided to teach their children chess and demonstrate that practice trumps talent, some might have said it was a bummer that all three were girls. Because women can’t play chess, right? It’s a ludicrous question nowadays, but despite the first feminist wave in the late 1960s, much of the chess world agreed with this notion when Susan, Sofia, and Judit were born. The idea that only men are good at chess had been advocated by some big names, including Bobby Fischer, the Dutch grandmaster/writer Jan Hein Donner, and a young Garry Kasparov, who later corrected himself after suffering defeat at the hands of the youngest of the Polgár sisters. A decade after her retirement, Judit’s chess career is still unique. Only two other women have ever reached the world’s top 100: the former women’s world champions Maia Chiburdanidze (Georgia) and Hou Yifan (China). Neither of them made it into the top 50. The question of why so few women reach the absolute top is relevant to chess and other fields where women are underrepresented, such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. To explain and narrow the gender gap, chess can learn from science, and science can learn from chess. For starters, it’s essential to realize that the gender gap at the top is largely caused by underrepresentation. In January 2024 there were 440,390 chess players with an official FIDE rating (obtained in internationally rated tournaments), but only 47,435 of these were women—about 11 percent. In the highest segment, from strong club players to grandmasters, women count for just 6 percent. The higher the level of the players the further the women drop: roughly 1,800 players hold the grandmaster title, but only 42 women do—about 2.3 percent. Why is this? The world of statistics tells us that extreme values in a large sample are all the more probable than those in a small sample. This is explained by a thought experiment I borrowed from fellow Dutchman Wei Ji Ma, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at New York University. Take two groups, one consisting of ten people and the other of two people. All 12 people are given a random number between one and 100, and then we take the highest score in each group. If we repeat these steps many times, we will see that Group A will score 91.4 and Group B 67.2 on average. Because the larger group has more shots at a high score, it will get a higher score on average. Similarly, we can expect many more men at the top of the chess rankings than women because there are many more of them playing chess. A 2009 study led by psychologist Merim Bilalić used this argument to demonstrate that women are not underachieving but that their performance at the top is more or less what can be expected from statistics. The researchers looked at the more than 120,000 members of the German Chess Federation in April 2007, where only one in 16 members was a woman. The model used in the study predicted for 96 percent of the rating difference between the top 100 male and top 100 female players, meaning that those rating difference between genders closely followed the statistically expected difference. Subsequent research questioned the statistical approach of this study and argued that the participation rate only partly explains the observed differences between men and women. It’s not just a numbers game; there’s more to the story. What about the brain? The British grandmaster Nigel Short asked that question in a controversial column for New in Chess magazine in 2015. Short assumed that the difference in achievements between men and women in chess is most likely the result of differences between the male and female brains. He wrote: Men and women’s brains are hard-wired very differently, so why should they function in the same way? I don’t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than I do. Likewise, she doesn’t feel embarrassed in asking me to maneuver the car out of our narrow garage. One is not better than the other, we just have different skills. It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact. If anyone had something to say about the topic, it was Judit Polgár. As the strongest female chess player in the history of the game, she knew better than anyone what it’s like to compete against (and beat!) mostly male opponents. Responding to Short in TIME magazine, she said, “We are capable of the same fight as any other man, and I think during the decades that I actively played chess, I proved it as well. It’s not a matter of gender; it’s a matter of being smart.” Judit Polgár, the best female chess player of all time, in September 2021 at the Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. But, I hear some readers ask, don’t neuroscientists agree that the male and female brains are different and affected by separate hormones? Well, I have to point out two things here. First, this might be true, but no direct links with chess ability have ever been demonstrated convincingly. As Polgár pointed out in a tweet: “Men and women are different, but there are different ways of thinking and fighting [while] still achieving the same results.” Secondly, the neuroscientific research in this field is ongoing and inconclusive. Even a (substantial) distinction between male and female brains is under debate. In 2015, a team led by neuroscientist Daphna Joel from Tel Aviv University did a comprehensive study of over 1,400 brain scans from four different labs. The wide range of variability between each brain led them to conclude that we should “shift from thinking of brains as falling into two classes, one typical of males and the other typical of females, to appreciating the variability of the human brain mosaic.” That being successful in chess isn’t related to biology is perhaps easier to accept when you realize that domain knowledge (expertise obtained by encountering thousands of chess patterns and motifs) is one of the most consistent predictors of chess skill. The two-time US champion Jennifer Shahade wrote in her 2022 book Chess Queens: “Learning the rules of chess takes a few hours, but gaining competence in its intricacies and developing a personal style takes years of work. Playing a highly focused board game for four to six hours is difficult, and neither men nor women nor non-binary players are born with the concentration and motivation to excel at it. For that reason, I find the emphasis on women’s biological inferiority absurd: when it comes to chess, we are all born inept.” In an interesting paper published in 2008, researchers from the University of Padova argued that gender stereotypes are partly responsible for the underperformance of women in chess. They had 42 male–female pairs, all Italian and matched for ability, playing games online. When players were unaware of the sex of their opponent, the women played approximately as well as the men, as could be expected from their similar chess strength. However, when women knew they were playing against a male opponent, they showed a drastic performance drop. Also, when they (falsely) believed they were playing against a woman, they performed as well as their male opponents. The researchers concluded: “This small-scale pilot study suggests that gender stereotypes are very pronounced in the chess world and that both male and female players are perfectly aware of these stereotypes.” In 2020 a research team led by Australian chess grandmaster and researcher David Smerdon replicated these results in an analysis of over eight million tournament games played by over 180,000 players. They concluded that women perform statistically worse than expected when playing against men, with this stereotype threat being “especially large when games are played under tight (rapid or blitz) time constraints.” The latest news on this topic comes from the Dutch scientist Remy Rikers. In a 2022 study, he mentioned the term reversed stereotype threat. Rikers found that the influence of a negative stereotype of women’s ability to play chess is not only limited to their level of performance but that it also has an effect on their opponent’s performance. He had a hundred players play games online, unsure whether they were facing a man or a woman. Ultimately, the study participants were unaware they played neither: their opponent was always a computer. However, sometimes they would see a male nickname and sometimes a female one. The results showed that participants who played against a female nickname played less well, lost more games, and made more mistakes and blunders than participants who played against a male nickname. One way to explain the low female participation in chess is to look at similar fields in society. For instance, women are also underrepresented in careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which are considered to require cognitive abilities similar to chess. In 2017, Ming-Te Wang and Jessica Degol of the University of Pittsburgh reviewed research from the fields of psychology, sociology, economics, and education over the preceding 30 years. They summarized six empirically supported explanations for US women’s underrepresentation in math-intensive STEM fields, and noted a complicated interaction between them. Their conclusions seem to be quite relevant to the chess world. Wang and Degol first mentioned cognitive ability but noted that it had only little effect. On average, girls hardly did worse than boys in math. Boys outperformed them in spatial relations tests involving mental rotation tasks, but only slightly, while girls did somewhat better in verbal tasks. Relative cognitive strengths played a more significant role in future career choices. Among the best math students, girls were more likely to also possess high verbal ability, while boys were more likely to demonstrate higher math relative to verbal ability. As a result, young women often have a greater variety of career options with less of a necessity to focus on a single strength. The third reason Wang and Degol presented for the gender gap concerned women tending to have different career interests or preferences, sometimes explained by the short notion that “males prefer working with objects whereas females prefer working with other people.” These differences can reach back as far as early adolescence. Another factor involved lifestyle values or work–family balance preferences, where women, especially when planning to have children, were more willing than men to make occupational sacrifices for the sake of their families and didn’t like work-centered lifestyles as much as men. Field-specific ability beliefs could be a factor as well. The American psychologist Carol S. Dweck noticed in 2007 that when girls were told about the “innate ability” and “natural talent” of math geniuses, after that they would perform significantly worse on a geometry task than girls who were told the math geniuses were hard workers. Based on this, Wang and Degol noted that women might be avoiding STEM careers because they wrongly assume two things: that innate intelligence is required and that they are lacking this. The final explanation for female underrepresentation was discussed earlier: gender-related stereotypes and biases. The researchers noted that while overt (intentional) and hostile forms of gender discrimination were occurring less frequently than some decades ago, covert (more subtle) and benevolent (overly affective) forms of discrimination still happen all the time and no doubt affect women’s career choices. We can try to explain the gender gap in chess in another way. The percentage of female (to male) players varies quite a bit across different countries—but figuring out why might reveal something about the reasons behind the female minority in chess in the first place. In an article written in 2019 on his website, David Smerdon attempted just that. Interestingly, the numbers go against intuition completely. It would be fair to assume that in countries with less gender equality, female participation in chess would be smaller, right? As Smerdon put it: “In more conservative countries, one might expect that a girl would be encouraged to get married and stay at home with the kids, rather than play rated tournaments. In poorer countries, a family might not be able to afford to send all of the children to chess lessons, and so the girls might miss out.” However, in practice, it’s not like that at all. Countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, which are among the top-ranked in the United Nations Development Program’s annual rankings of gender equality, have the lowest percentage of women chess players (about 5 percent). Meanwhile, countries with much lower gender equality—such as Georgia, China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and the UAE—all have percentages above 25. So, the more gender-equal a country, the fewer females play chess. But why? One possible explanation for the small minority of women engaged in STEM fields is that women are more likely to have a variety of interests. While that was linked to relative cognitive ability before, it turns out this is also the case for their status in society: researchers have observed that the more women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences. But it would be too simple to state that women don’t like chess as much as men. Smerdon suggests that more women might play chess in gender-unequal countries “because it’s one of the few fields where they can both compete with men and be sure that the result is judged objectively and without discrimination (as opposed to, say, promotions in the workplace).” The economist Maryam Dilmaghani signaled in 2021 that a legacy of a command economy, where major economic decisions are made by the government (such as in the former Soviet Union), was the most significant predictor of a smaller gender gap in competitive chess across countries. Apart from the general popularity and governmental support for chess in formerly communist countries, a possible explanation for this smaller gap was that women participated as much as men in the labor force, taking jobs traditionally seen as male in the West, which perhaps made it easier for them to navigate the male-dominated chess world. Another difference in gender is something that anyone can easily detect by looking at youth chess across the world. At a young age—say, eight to ten years—the overrepresentation of boys in chess classes is not as significant as in older age groups, but more girls than boys stop playing chess at some point. Why is this happening? I believe it is a combination of girls starting as a minority in the first place (boys get introduced to chess more often than girls) and then also finding themselves in a somewhat hostile environment where boys tend to dominate the space and blurt out answers. In contrast, many girls turn silent in a group where the boys have a majority. Although chess-playing girls tend to be part of a social group with other girls during their school years, such comfort usually disappears upon finishing high school and joining a chess club, which means entering an environment with very few girls or women to interact with. This was reflected in a somewhat forgotten paper from 2002 by researcher Ingrid Galitis. She tried to discover how boys came to dominate her primary school’s chess club in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Interviews with 18 girls aged seven to 12 revealed the perception of hostility from boys and an aversion to the boys’ aggressive attitudes. Also, girls tended to talk much more freely when they were among girls only. Other factors related to dropping out included whether girls had family members or friends involved in chess and a lack of attention given to them by tutors. A paper from October 2023, co-written by Jennifer Shahade, revealed another reason girls might drop out of chess more than boys—one we have seen when discussing STEM careers. The research pointed out that parents and mentors often believe girls have a lower potential in chess than boys. This bias is more pronounced among those who think chess success requires brilliance. “It is striking that even the parents and coaches who have a vested interest in girls’ success hold biases against them and may also have some blind spots about the barriers to girls’ success,” said Andrei Cimpian, the paper’s senior author. To coaches and parents who are reading this: you need to believe in girls, because your attitude might hinder them from succeeding if you don’t. In an article for Slate.com from December 2020, Wei Ji Ma mentioned social, cultural, and economic factors that explain why all top chess players are men. It is one of the best pieces ever written about this topic. I quote Ma as he sums up many good reasons why women are underperforming: Top female players are often relegated to women-only invitational tournaments, most likely limiting their ability to increase their ranking. It is possible that national federations invest less in top female players than in their male counterparts, for example, in terms of training or finding sponsors. It’s much easier for male players to make a living from chess. Among top players with children, women might be more burdened with child-care duties than men and therefore have less time to play in and prepare for tournaments. Top female players might fall victim to stereotype threat (where a member of a negatively stereotyped group underperforms due to the pressure or anxiety induced by the stereotype), which indeed seems to manifest itself in the results of chess games. It is also likely that top female chess players face a particularly hostile environment, leading them to drop out in higher proportions than lower-ranked women. The chess world was rather slow in responding to the #MeToo movement, but when several cases of sexual assault came to light in 2023, they showed that Ma’s last point was spot on. Like everywhere else in society, we need to work harder to make chess safer for all genders. That includes transgender people, who have their own battles to fight. As of August 2023, FIDE decided that transgender women cannot compete in its official events for women until its officials make an assessment of the gender change. While some top women players approved of this measure, the French transwoman chess player and coach Yosha Iglesias was baffled. She wrote on X: “The new regulations will make trans chess players all over the world face a horrible dilemma: transition or quit chess”—adding that for trans players and especially women “it will do so much unnecessary harm.” Regarding the attempts to increase the participation and improve the atmosphere for women, there are signs that systemic changes might be happening. A promising new initiative is the Women in Chess Foundation, launched in the fall of 2023. More good news came from FIDE in November 2023 when it published its first Gender Equality in Chess Index, an innovative instrument designed to measure and compare the level of gender equality in chess federations across the globe. I have high hopes for research being conducted under the supervision of Jeroen Struben, Associate Professor of Strategy and Organization at the Emlyon Business School in Lyon, France. Struben, a specialist in systems thinking, examines gender segregation dynamics resulting from interactions between a variety of factors. He looks at how players decide to start with chess in the first place, their decisions about commitment to improving, gameplay, dropout, performance, and influences from peers, role models, and the broader community. He has compiled a dataset of over 40,000 members of the Dutch Chess Federation between 1994 and 2018 and combined it with elite-player interviews, an integrative literature review, and computation and simulation. Whereas scientific research usually focuses on a single aspect, Struben believes system thinking is crucial in areas like sustainability and gender. “Because research has shown that many factors play a role, you cannot isolate one since their interaction could be very important,” he said. “By looking at them together, we can figure out why, despite well-intended efforts, little progress has been made, and, secondly, we can conclude that some factors are of little importance individually but become important together, which can help [us] to come up with strategies that act following the whole system.” When I spoke to Struben in November 2023, he could share some initial conclusions. His model showed that peer influence and role models have a measurable relationship with dropout rates and effort. Also, no single factor is dominant in the gender differences in chess, so we must look deeper into how their inter-dependency works. The ultimate goal is to help the Dutch Chess Federation, and, hopefully, other federations, to develop a long-term policy toward more inclusion and integration in the chess world. For Struben, the next step will be to use his insights as a starting point for research in STEM areas. Elo Ratings, Databases, Engines: A Researcher’s Gold Mine As a closed environment that requires solving complex tasks, chess facilitates the design of experiments that specifically address theoretical questions. The researcher Roy Roring explained it perfectly: “Finding the best move in a chess position is a highly complex, real-world human activity, and each chess position represents a well-defined problem environment, with a fixed number of identifiable moves that can be played at any given point—perfect for studying search processes and problem-solving.” There are three more technical reasons chess lends itself well to scientific research: Elo ratings, databases, and engines. The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players. Developed by the Hungarian American physics professor Arpad Elo, the system assigns numerical ratings to players based on game performance. Players gain or lose points depending on the outcome of games, and this gain or loss is higher if the rating difference with their opponent is bigger. The system has been used since 1960 in the US and since 1970 internationally. Beginners have ratings of around 500 to 800, novices around 1100, and average players around 1500. We tend to call players above 2000 experts. An international master normally is between 2400 and 2500. An international grandmaster usually has a rating above 2500. In January 2024, 36 players were rated over 2700. “The Elo system is one of the reasons why, early on, chess was very useful for expertise research in particular,” research psychologist Christopher Chabris told me. “You could objectively identify who was an expert and even finer gradations of expert versus novice. You could identify the exact skill difference between two people. You can’t do that with anything else than the Elo system, and it’s a huge benefit. Even having a consensus on who are the experts and who are the novices, and how far apart they are in their actual ability to succeed in the task, doesn’t exist in law, it doesn’t exist in medicine or other areas.” Using chess ratings has become particularly useful in science since around 2006 when FIDE computerized all official ratings data gathered since their inaugural 1970 list. This means there is now a consistent database for the last half-century, and the rating progress of thousands of players can be tracked over years and sometimes decades. With such a well-organized, objective, and complete dataset, one advantage for researchers is that they don’t need to worry about sampling bias, which is when a sample selected for a study does not represent the broader population it intends to represent. Another type of chess database provides a second tool for the researcher: one that forms a structured collection of games that have been recorded and stored electronically. Such databases are used by both chess players and researchers to study and analyze games, track historical trends, and improve their understanding of the game. Chess databases typically include a wide range of games played by various players at different skill levels, from early historical events until present-day tournaments. With a software program, a search can filter out games based on all kinds of data, including the players’ names, the date the game was played, the event, the result, the opening played, or even specific positions. Since 1987, the Hamburg-based company ChessBase has been selling the leading chess database software bearing the same name. It was originally developed with the help of none other than Garry Kasparov, who commented about a prototype he had seen a year earlier: “This is the most important development in chess study since Gutenberg.” Decades later, it is also an important development for broader study. “These databases present a gold mine for researchers interested in various topics in psychology,” wrote the research psychologists Nemanja Vaci and Merim Bilalić in 2017. “Similarly to those in other fields, chess databases offer the possibilities of applying data-mining and modeling approaches on large datasets and of investigating a number of cognitive effects.” The pair noted that chess databases can be used “to tackle topics such as skill development over the lifetime, birth cohort effects, effects of activity and inactivity on chess play, and even gender differences.” Databases of over-the-board games have existed since the late 1980s and can include millions of games. The website Lichess allows users to download its complete database of all games played on the site since 2013. In January 2024, that consisted of an incredible 7.9 billion games. Because researchers have become much better at analyzing big data, sometimes helped by artificial intelligence, such online databases have become invaluable. The third handy research tool is an aspect of the modern chess world I will elaborate on later in the book: chess engines. These are basically computer programs that can play chess, but they can also analyze already-played games, which is particularly interesting for the scientist, as David Smerdon explained to me. Apart from looking at game results, we can now look at individual chess moves. It is as if, apart from the final scores, we can now also analyze the quality of passes, assists, and shots on goal to objectively evaluate the performance of soccer teams. In the past, we could only analyze performance at the game level, and the performance scores were also not independent of what the opponent was doing. From a statistical point of view, we can’t treat the performances of both players in a game as independent observations, so we end up throwing away a lot of data. Being able to analyze the quality of individual moves with engines improves both the quantity and the quality of research. First of all, the data size increases a lot because instead of looking at each game that you play as one data point, we’re looking at each move by each player as a data point. By treating each move as an independent decision problem, we end up with roughly 80 times more data. Secondly, the evaluation by the engine gives us an objective benchmark for the best move, which means we can get a reliable, independent measure of cognitive performance. The first time a chess engine was used for scientific research was probably in 1999 in Christopher Chabris’s doctoral dissertation, Cognitive and Neuropsychological Mechanisms of Expertise: Studies with Chess Masters. He analyzed 1,188 chess games with the help of the German program Fritz 5 to demonstrate in a reasonably objective manner that when players had additional time to think ahead, the quality of their decisions improved significantly. This might sound logical but was contrary to a theory that existed at the time, which held that pattern-recognition processes (which require little time on the clock) played a dominant role in top-level chess expertise. Voilà! Now we understand why there’s been such a boom in chess-related research over the last ten to 15 years: thanks to the Elo rating system, databases, and engines, many cognitive scientists and people interested in cognitive performance from different disciplines (such as economics, psychology, or computer science, including some high-profile researchers from Ivy League universities) suddenly became interested and started publishing papers using these tools. An excellent example of how all these chess tools combined can be used to study real-world phenomena was supplied by Smerdon himself. In a 2022 paper, he looked at the effect of face masks on cognitive performance. Two years after the COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020, 178 of 186 researched countries required facial coverings to be worn in some or all public spaces, workplaces, and educational settings. Little was known about the impact of masks on cognitive performance. Smerdon jumped on it. Using chess databases, he collected data from over 70 chess tournaments with mask requirements held during the pandemic. He matched those to an approximate figure of 140 tournaments staged without mask requirements but with a considerable overlap of the same players. He used a chess engine to analyze almost three million chess moves played by more than 8,000 people in 18 countries. His study showed that wearing a face mask during a chess game decreased the quality of chess players’ decisions—an effect that was relatively short-lived—and mostly hurt stronger players. While mask-wearing negatively impacted chess performance, the effect subsided after four to six hours of playing. “The decrease in performance was due to the annoyance caused by the masks rather than a physiological mechanism, but people adapted to the distraction over time,” Smerdon said. “The results suggest that the effect of masks may depend on the type of task, the duration of the task and the working memory load. This is something to keep in mind for occupations in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as well as other professions that demand a high level of working memory such as language interpreters, performers, waiters, and teachers.” The Benefits of Chess On Wednesday, February 11, 2015, something happened that the Spanish journalist Leontxo García called “the Spanish Miracle.” García has covered chess since the early 1980s. He is also a passionate promoter of the game, and, throughout his career, has supported the idea that teaching chess in schools is beneficial for children. On that winter Wednesday in 2015, the Spanish parliament agreed with him. “I was tempted to call the Vatican to report a miracle,” he told me, “because, in Spain, to get all parties with no exception agreeing on anything is a miracle, and it happened that day.” In a unanimous vote, the Education and Sports Commission of the Congress of Deputies recommended using chess as an educational tool in the curriculum. “It had to be a recommendation; it could not be compulsory because, in Spain, except for the major ones, the education competencies are transferred to the regional governments,” explained García. “But in the following three years, ten out of 17 regions introduced chess into the curriculum, and, after the pandemic, at least two or three more are thinking about it.” He estimates that over a million Spanish children are now connected to chess in their schools in one way or another. Almost a decade later, chess-related educational programs can be found across the globe, following the example of countries with an even longer tradition in the game, such as Armenia, Georgia, and Russia. Even in England, where chess is not officially recognized as a sport, the game was given a massive boost in the summer of 2023 when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced almost £1 million ($1.27 million) in funding to support the English Chess Federation, to promote chess in British schools and to install a hundred tables in public parks. When Sunak visited a school in Washington, DC, he said he was trying to get British children to play more chess, describing it as “good for you.” In general, chess is believed to be beneficial to educational development, and why wouldn’t it be? There are so many different types of skills and competencies needed for chess that are useful elsewhere in life: collaboration, communication, strategic thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, deduction, anticipation, concentration, clever use of resources, preparation, learning from mistakes, and even the concept of fair play. The benefits of chess are, however, the topic of an ongoing scientific debate. Research has shown that, like musicians, chess players are, on average, slightly more intelligent than the general population. This, however, doesn’t automatically mean that chess makes you smarter. People with a higher IQ may like chess (or music) more than others and choose to indulge in the game more often. This effect is known as self-selection. The question is whether certain qualities necessary for chess or music can transfer to other areas; chess as basis for developing intelligence. Scientists use the term transfer of learning, and distinguish between “near transfer” (the transfer between closely related domains—e.g., knowledge of Latin transfers to other languages) and “far transfer”(the transfer between domains that are only loosely related—e.g., Latin and geography). If chess could make kids better at mathematics, this would be a clear case of far transfer. Some research has pointed to the positive effects of chess teaching on math test results. At the same time, there are papers that fail to demonstrate a link. Which study to believe? In 2017, Giovanni Sala and Fernand Gobet of the University of Liverpool decided to look at 24 existing studies regarding the potential benefits of chess for children concerning mathematics, reading, and cognitive skills. Sala and Gobet’s meta-analysis showed small positive effects “with chess enhancing primary and middle-school students’ achievement in mathematics and overall cognitive ability.” However, the overall effect size was “not large enough to convincingly establish the effectiveness of chess instruction in enhancing the skills [under] consideration,” according to the researchers. They also pointed out a major problem in the existing research on the effectiveness of chess instruction: “Almost none of the reviewed studies compared chess-treated groups with active control groups to rule out possible placebo effects.” A 2022 paper by the Spanish research psychologist Angel Blanch noted similar issues with the existing research. He looked at 45 studies in 19 countries targeting cognitive ability and academic performance and noted that most had theoretical and methodological drawbacks. Only 16 percent of the studies had a robust research design with large enough sample sizes or more sophisticated data-analysis approaches. These studies tended to report lower or null effects, causing “reasonable concerns over the evidence about the benefits of chess instruction.” All in all, we have to conclude that the data doesn’t demonstrate proof that chess makes you smarter. But does this mean we should stop teaching chess at schools? Maybe not. Despite his “reasonable concerns,” Blanch ended his paper as follows: Nonetheless, chess seems … an interesting activity to teach in school contexts. Chess is an ancient universal game, an intellectually related activity that is part of human cultural heritage, and that comprises a considerable body of specialized knowledge. It is easy to implement, it is relatively cheap, and it is appealing to both children and adults because of its playing and competitive nature.… Perhaps it is not necessary to justify the need of teaching chess in the classrooms because of being beneficial for intelligence and academic performance. What is needed ultimately is the undertaking of higher quality studies about the benefits of chess for other kinds of simpler outcomes that may be relevant for education. As Blanch intimated, chess may not directly boost cognitive abilities but it may indirectly benefit academic achievement by enhancing skills such as concentration, risk-taking, and patience—something backed up by an Australian study published in 2020 on the effects of chess instruction to grade-five students on academic and non-cognitive outcomes. The research took place in 2016 in 16 rural primary schools in Bangladesh, where the children did not have previous experience playing chess, so the impact of the lessons might have been higher than in previous research. The main finding of the Bangladesh study was that, almost a year after the chess training had ended, it had reduced the level of risk aversion among the children. At the end of that period, nine out of ten students were still playing and reached a level where taking risks had become a regular aspect of their games. There were also signs of a slightly better performance in math and a higher level of patience than in the control group that did not partake in chess lessons, but those results were not statistically significant. Other indirect academic benefits were shown in a Danish paper from 2017. Chess was taught in five schools in Aarhus, the second-largest city in Denmark, to 482 children (grades one to three). About two-thirds had one of their four weekly mathematics lectures replaced with chess instruction; the other third was the control group. The results indicated moderate positive effects on the math skills of the pupils involved in chess. The most interesting conclusion was that these positive effects almost exclusively impacted children who were not very happy at school and those who were occasionally or always bored. Obtaining mathematical concepts through chess could be a more engaging way to deliver teaching. As we have seen, teachers skeptical about including chess lessons in the curriculum can claim their doubts are scientifically justified. The goal, however, doesn’t need to be that children learn chess. It is also possible to use chess to teach children whatever they need to know at school. This has been demonstrated in Hungary for over a decade with the “Chess Palace” program, developed by the Judit Polgár Chess Foundation for Educational Benefits. Since 2013, Chess Palace has been part of the national curriculum of Hungarian elementary schools. A decade on, it is used in over a thousand schools, with over 4,000 teachers teaching 50,000 children annually. The material, intended for children aged 4–10 years, is unique because it goes beyond the regular borders of chess teaching. The chess-themed program teaches children areas like mathematics, science, arts and crafts, foreign languages, reading, and writing, thus demonstrating the incredible versatility of the game. Judit Polgár, here with Magnus Carlsen at a primary school in Stavanger, Norway, in 2019, dedicates a lot of her time to chess education. When I spoke to Leontxo García in September 2023, we discussed science’s failure to back up claims about the beneficial nature of chess. He wasn’t discouraged. “I have talked to more than 200 neurologists during my career,” he said. “There is no doubt. Of course, chess is not the only thing you can do, but it is one of the best, for sure. Nobody is questioning that, as far as I know.” The benefits of chess don’t need to be limited to general educational purposes either. Growing research is focusing on specific groups, such as children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A review article from 2023 that looked at four studies published in medical journals concluded that “chess has positive effects on ADHD symptoms and their severity” and recommended chess be “included for the management of ADHD patients as a complementary therapy.” Chess may also benefit the elderly, preventing or delaying the onset of dementia. This field of research has existed a bit longer. In a 2019 review article that looked at 21 studies, a group of researchers from Spain concluded that “even though the evidence is weak to demonstrate its role as a protective factor, other evidence indirectly related to chess and based on its cognitive stimulating functions suggest it may work as a protective factor.” On a final note, which once again shows the versatility of chess, I will mention the positive impact a chess program had on an unexpected group: prisoners. In 2012, Sheriff Thomas Dart and coach/organizer Mikhail Korenman started a “chess in jail” program in Cook County, Illinois, that involved chess classes for inmates. “Chess is more than an entertaining pastime,” Dart said in 2020. “The game teaches its players valuable life lessons. It requires critical thinking to consider the risks and rewards of their decisions, which are valuable skills that help foster a reduction in violent behavior.” When I visited the London Chess Conference in March 2023, Korenman presented some results after a decade of running the project with about 3,000 inmates. An important conclusion was that spending time with chess had a positive effect on bringing down the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among those participants who had been involved in the program for more than six months. There were also lower levels of inmate fights, uses of force, batteries to staff, and recidivism among the chess participants compared with a control group that did not join the program. In their landmark 1973 article “Skill in Chess,” Herbert Simon and William Chase were the first to make the now famous comparison between chess and the fruit fly in print. This comparison suggests that both chess and the common fruit fly (Latin name: Drosophila melanogaster) are simple and widely known tools for experiments that can be effectively used to gain valuable insights into more complex systems. While the fruit fly has played a key role in bio-medical research, revealing fundamental principles of genetics and development and illuminating human health and disease, chess has played a similar role in other areas of scientific research. As we have seen in this chapter, chess has indeed been a perfect model and an incredibly versatile tool for cognitive psychologists, in particular, but also other kinds of scientists. In the second part of this book, we will see that this analogy worked even better for chess and artificial intelligence—where the comparison was made first. But first, we’ll learn which players have left the biggest mark on chess, thus shaping the cultural meaning of the game in their stead. I’ll also try to answer the impossible but ever-entertaining question: who was the greatest of all?",

Too serious as a game, too futile as a science.” —Gustave Flaubert, Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues, 1913 “Before I was born, my parents decided that I was going to be a genius.” With this intriguing sentence, Judit Polgár started her TED Talk in 2016. The most successful female chess player in the history of the game revealed the secret behind her brilliant career—one that would see her reach a level of play that no other woman has ever achieved. It’s a story of original thinking, determination, and love. Judit’s parents, László and Klára, were both teachers. Before they married in 1967, László shared his strong opinions with Klára about the Hungarian education system which, he felt, wasted talent due to a lack of focus. He wanted to teach their future children at home and, for each of them, focus on a single topic in which they could excel. “My mother initially thought he was crazy,” Judit later said, but Klára was impressed by László’s boundless energy and commitment and agreed to the marriage. The two read psychology books and immersed themselves in all the information they could find about prodigies and the early life of geniuses. And then they made their big decision: they embarked on a parenting experiment. Susan was born in 1969, followed by Sofia in 1974, and Judit in 1976. The three girls were homeschooled in different languages, math, and chess. László and Klára chose to focus on chess because it demands creative and intellectual capacities, while the results are easily measurable (more about that later). Soon, the unique upbringing of the girls meant a full-time job for their parents. In 1989, László explained his educational ideas in a small book titled Nevelj Zsenit! (Bring Up Genius!) It was his response to the famous nature-nurture debate: he considered talent not a hereditary trait but something you could teach to any child. In 1992 he told the Washington Post, “A genius is not born but is educated and trained.” Judit herself said chess is “80 percent hard work and 20 percent talent.” When I asked her in September 2023 to define talent, she thought briefly and said, “Talent is a tricky thing. Sometimes I feel it is kind of an attitude. It’s your personality. Many people want to be somebody different, but the people who are really doing good things dare to be themselves. I became exceptional in the chess world, but I was not exceptional. I created it to be. I mean, basically, I was doing something a lot on a daily basis, and the circumstances helped me.” In 1991, Judit became a grandmaster at the age of 15 years and four months, the youngest to ever achieve this feat at the time. In doing so she broke the record Bobby Fischer had held since 1958. While Sofia became an international master and Susan a strong grand-master (winning, for instance, the women’s world championship), Judit became the first and only woman to ever break into the world’s top ten in 1996. At her peak, in July 2005, she was ranked eighth in the world. The Polgár sisters at the 1988 Chess Olympiad in Thessaloniki, Greece. From left to right: Judit, Susan, and Sofia. László Polgár’s opinion that practice is (much) more important than talent is now generally accepted, but wasn’t at the time. He developed his ideas in a period when the study of expertise and the field of cognitive psychology were still in their infancy. Half a century later, we can see that chess has played a fundamental role in the development of these areas of science. It continues to do so, more than ever. Chess as a Toolbox for Science In the twenty-first century, chess-related scientific research has exploded. Between 1970 and 2007 Google Scholar lists 1,785 papers with chess in the title. In the period since: 3,400. Chess is booming, and chess research is too. It can be argued that chess has significantly impacted various branches of scientific thought, demonstrating incredible versatility and usefulness, and as a source of inspiration. As it is seen as the area closest to the game, let’s start with mathematics. The German mathematician and logician Ernst Zermelo was an avid chess player, and in 1913 he published his “Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels” (“On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of Chess”). It was the first paper on game theory. Zermelo introduced an important theorem that holds for any two-person non-chance game where players move alternately, have opposing interests, and access to “perfect information.” The latter means that both sides have complete knowledge of what is going on (as opposed to, for example, poker, where there’s both available and hidden information as the players are hiding their cards from the others). Zermelo attempted to mathematically formalize the concept of a winning position, noting that if a player is in a winning position, they can always force a win no matter what strategy the other player may employ. Zermelo’s work has contributed to various areas of mathematics and computer science. Chess has also been connected to language studies, beginning with the Swiss linguist, semiotician, and philosopher Ferdinand de Saussure. His Course in General Linguistics, published in 1916 and based on lectures he gave at the University of Geneva, is generally regarded as the starting point of structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the meaning of words is not fixed or independent but depends on how they relate to each other. However, even though individual words are arbitrary, the overall structure of language is not random but follows social conventions. Understanding how words work in a specific context involves looking at the rules and practices rather than just the history of individual words. To explain this, Saussure used a comparison to chess: “The respective value of the pieces depends on their position on the chessboard, just as each linguistic term derives its value from its opposition to all the other terms. The system is always momentary; it varies from one position to the next. It is also true that values depend above all else on an unchangeable convention, the set of rules that exists before a game begins and persists after each move.” In his Philosophical Investigations, published posthumously in 1953, the famous philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein reflected several times on chess. For instance, he compared linguistic expressions with chess pieces to explain that it is not enough to know the rules of a language to be able to recognize words and use them correctly: “When one shows someone the king in chess and says, ‘This is the king,’ this does not tell him the use of this piece—unless he already knows the rules of the game up to this last point: the shape of the king. You could imagine his having learned the rules of the game without ever having been shown an actual piece. The shape of the chessman corresponds here to the sound or shape of a word.” Later, he added, “But we talk about it as we do about pieces in chess when we are stating the rules of the game, not describing their physical properties. The question, ‘What is a word, really?’ is analogous to ‘What is a piece in chess?’ ” Chess and Psychology Aside from artificial intelligence, the scientific field that chess has had the most profound impact on is psychology. Chess has been used to study many aspects of the human mind, including perception, attention, memory, learning, creativity, thinking, and decision-making. The earliest recorded use of chess in psychological research dates from 1893. Alfred Binet, known for inventing the first practical IQ test, became fascinated by a particular aspect of chess that has mesmerized people for centuries: playing blindfold chess. Binet decided to do a study to test his hypothesis that chess masters were using a photographic kind of memory—an “inner mirror,” as he called it. Among his study participants was one of the world’s best players, Siegbert Tarrasch. The participants answered questions about what they were “seeing” during play, but their answers did not conform to Binet’s “inner mirror” idea. As it turned out, the players were not keeping complete positions sharply in their minds; what their internal memories stored were more like abstract patterns that they recognized, similar to musical chords or melodies. One of the participants, the French master Alphonse Goetz, said, “I grasp it as a musician grasps harmony in his orchestra.” Memory, it came to be understood, is only partly a visual concept; giving a meaningful context to the patterns and the impressions those patterns sparked help players remember positions. Binet concluded that it was “the multitude of suggestions and ideas emanating from a game which makes it interesting and establishes it in memory.” Binet’s study was the first in a long period of research in cognitive psychology that continues until this day, trying to answer fundamental questions like, “How do great chess players think?”; “How is that different from how amateurs think?” And, “What do these differences in chess thinking say about cognition in general?” Regarding the fascinating topic of blindfold chess, it’s important to stress that the ability to play a game of chess without looking at the board or the pieces is not as hard as it seems, nor is it limited to just a handful of brilliant minds. It is something any strong club player is capable of. I would compare it to playing a whole repertoire of études and nocturnes on the piano without needing the music in front of you, simply because you have practiced it for years. What is extraordinary, however, is the ability to play a blindfold simul. (This, in particular, was what inspired Binet to do his research.) When the great Philidor played two blindfold games at once in 1782, The World described it as “a phenomenon in the history of man” which “should be hoarded among the best samples of human memory, till memory shall be no more.” However, 150 years later, George Koltanowski played 34 blindfold games simultaneously. The current record stands at 48 games, played by the Uzbekistani American grandmaster Timur Gareyev in 2016 while wearing a blindfold mask and riding 80 kilometers (50 miles) on a spin bike. An engraving from 1794 depicts French composer and chess player François-André Danican Philidor, center, playing chess blindfolded, as members of the London Chess Club look on. It took several decades for another pioneer in the field to arrive on the scene—who, like Binet, was a remarkable scientist. I am talking about my fellow Dutchman, the internationally renowned psychologist (and chess master) Adriaan de Groot. De Groot suspected that grandmasters see more and calculate better than weaker players, and wanted to test his hypothesis. He convinced five of the eight participants of the international AVRO tournament in 1938 in the Netherlands to participate in some experiments. Still a student, de Groot was starting to collect data on what would become his now famous doctoral thesis from 1946, Het denken van den schaker, which in 1965 was translated into English and published as Thought and Choice in Chess. Apart from world-class grandmasters, de Groot worked with two other categories of players: experts and amateurs. He gave all of them two tasks. First, he asked the chess players to think aloud while looking at a position and choosing their next move, then recorded their verbal utterances. These “verbal protocols” were subjected to both a statistical and an interpretative analysis and yielded surprising results. Although grandmasters play better moves, their structural thinking isn’t much different from that of experts. For instance, they don’t see many more positions, and they don’t calculate much deeper. Allow me an intermezzo, because this brings me to the most frequently asked question for chess grandmasters by layman interviewers—a question which is utterly boring and completely misses the point: “How many moves can you think ahead?” The answer is: “It depends.” And usually the chess player doesn’t even bother trying to explain why. A century ago, someone gave arguably the best answer possible. The anecdote has appeared in different forms and has been attributed to many famous players. The version as told by Israel Albert Horowitz in 1946 in Chess Review, about a game from 1913, might be the most accurate: Apropos is the story of the game between the invincible Capablanca and Charles Jaffe, pride of the East Side. Capa forgot he was invincible: he lost. A reporter who was present asked the Cuban, “How far do you see ahead?” Capa replied impressively, “About ten moves.” Then the reporter went over to Jaffe: “How far do you see ahead?” Much to everyone’s surprise, the reply was, “Only one move.” This didn’t make sense. “How could a player who can see only one move ahead defeat another who can delve so deeply?” Here Jaffe explained: “I see only one move ahead, but always the best move.” An important difference between the grandmasters and the weaker players in de Groot’s experiment was that the strong players quickly discovered promising options, making their thought processes more efficient. The difference was so stark that, according to de Groot, a world champion had a better understanding of the positions after five seconds of looking at them than a strong amateur player after 15 minutes! De Groot concluded that superiority in chess must be related to how players look at positions—i.e., perception, and how that is linked to previous knowledge. That prompted him to devise a second task. This time, the players were confronted with several diagrams of chess positions and could only look at them briefly (two to 15 seconds). After each brief viewing session, the diagram was taken away, and the participants were asked to set up the position on a chessboard as precisely as possible. Grandmasters were clearly better at this task than experts and amateurs. In later research, de Groot and his PhD students discovered something that appears to be related to Binet’s findings: strong players quickly recognize patterns, groups of pieces, possible moves, or even sequences of moves. This allows them to remember positions without focusing on all the individual pieces and pawns. In the 1960s, de Groot further investigated this theory when he began measuring eye movements. Grandmasters spent more time looking at parts of the chessboard where groups of pieces were connected in a relevant way, and were more often fixated on the intersection of squares than weak players were. De Groot’s experiments in the 1930s, and his conclusions about knowledge, thinking skills, and perceptual-memory skills, formed the foundation for later research in the 1960s and beyond. The American research psychologist Christopher Chabris described him to me as a brilliant and groundbreaking researcher: “He was ahead of his time for the research methods he was using, the questions he was asking, and the kinds of conclusions he was coming to. It took decades for other people to do similar things.” Two more scientists have strongly impacted cognitive science with their chess-related research: William Chase and Herbert Simon. The two Carnegie Mellon psychologists offered valuable contributions in the areas of memory and problem-solving, which are still relevant in and outside the scope of chess. Building upon de Groot’s work, Chase and Simon were instrumental in the development of what is known as the chunking theory. Chunking, first mentioned in a 1956 paper by the American psychologist George Miller, is the process of connecting individual pieces of a set of information to create a meaningful whole that is easier to memorize. A clear example is the phone number 0603091943, which can be separated into 06 03 09 1943. The “06” signifies a mobile phone number (in the Netherlands) and forms a chunk almost automatically, while “03” and “09” can be remembered as March 9, and the last chunk clearly forms a year. Other examples of chunks are words created from single letters and sentences from words. Chase and Simon assumed that the long-term memory of chess players consists of chunks of chess information—again, somewhat similar to Binet’s patterns. Examples of such chunks are three pawns in front of a white king and rook in the third quadrant of the board (a typical situation after White has castled kingside) or an advanced white knight threatening a double attack on Black’s king and queenside rook. Chess chunks are familiar situations where a small number of pieces and pawns on a part of the board are somehow connected. The results of Chase and Simon’s research supported the hypothesis that strong players have stored many more such chunks—up to 50,000 in the case of a chess master—than an amateur player, allowing them to recognize more of them in new positions and remember these positions better. And because the chunks provide helpful information about what might be going on in the position, strong players can more easily pre-select moves to choose from. In other words, more knowledge and a better understanding of previous positions leads to more efficient reasoning in new positions. Together with the cognitive psychologist Fernand Gobet, Simon later refined the chunking theory into what is known as the template theory, which shows how high-level, schematic structures (templates) can evolve from perceptual chunks. In 1992, when the field of cognitive psychology was still relatively young, the American psychologist Neil Charness convincingly demonstrated that chess research had already impacted cognitive science and various areas of general psychology. Among other insights, studies using chess showed that acquiring knowledge is more important than age factors, and that problem-solving performance depends on skill, but not on age. In contrast, memory performance declines with age but increases with skill. The area in psychology that has probably experienced the most chess-related research is expertise. Why do some people become experts in their field and others don’t? Can anyone become a chess grandmaster, or a top musician or mathematician, for that matter? Is there such a thing as natural talent? Or is it all about getting those famed 10,000 hours of practice in? The “10,000-hour rule” stems from Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book Outliers. He gave several examples of how people became successful (including Bill Gates, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Bobby Fischer, and the Beatles) and claimed that achieving world-class expertise in any skill requires 10,000 hours of practice. Gladwell’s theory was based on a 1993 study led by the Swedish psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, who found that the best violinists had put significantly more hours into practicing their instrument from a young age than amateur or expert musicians. In a 2013 paper, Ericsson corrected what he saw as an oversimplification in Outliers. His most important point was that the best violinists had accumulated an average of over 10,000 hours by the age of 20, while Gladwell claimed they totaled 10,000 hours of practice. Ericsson further explained: “Our main point was that the best group of violinists had spent significantly more hours practicing than the two groups of less accomplished groups of expert violinists, and vastly more time than amateur musicians. There is nothing magical about exactly 10,000 hours.” The difference between total and average means a lot in practice, as was demonstrated in 2007 by psychology researchers Guillermo Campitelli and Fernand Gobet. After observing 104 competitive chess players of different skill levels, they concluded that to reach the level of a strong expert, about 11,000 hours of practice are needed on average. However, the range among their test subjects was striking: one player had needed only 3,000 hours to reach that level, while another required 23,000 hours. Others had spent more than 25,000 hours without getting as good. All of this suggests that practice is an important factor for success, but talent does play a role. The highest-rated player on the planet, Magnus Carlsen, became a grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 27 days—about five and a half years after starting to play chess. With a case like him, it’s hard not to believe in talent. I’d like to make one more important point about practice, for all you parents out there who are still eager for your child to put in those 10,000 hours. The 1993 study with musicians was not just about spending time on a particular skill; it concerned what Ericsson and his colleagues called deliberate practice, which is characterized by focused, systematic, and purposeful efforts to improve performance. In other words, both the quantity and the quality of practice lead to results. The good news is that nowadays it is easier than ever to practice chess meaningfully, thanks to the computer and the internet. Women and Chess: What Science Says Back in the 1970s when László and Klára Polgár decided to teach their children chess and demonstrate that practice trumps talent, some might have said it was a bummer that all three were girls. Because women can’t play chess, right? It’s a ludicrous question nowadays, but despite the first feminist wave in the late 1960s, much of the chess world agreed with this notion when Susan, Sofia, and Judit were born. The idea that only men are good at chess had been advocated by some big names, including Bobby Fischer, the Dutch grandmaster/writer Jan Hein Donner, and a young Garry Kasparov, who later corrected himself after suffering defeat at the hands of the youngest of the Polgár sisters. A decade after her retirement, Judit’s chess career is still unique. Only two other women have ever reached the world’s top 100: the former women’s world champions Maia Chiburdanidze (Georgia) and Hou Yifan (China). Neither of them made it into the top 50. The question of why so few women reach the absolute top is relevant to chess and other fields where women are underrepresented, such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. To explain and narrow the gender gap, chess can learn from science, and science can learn from chess. For starters, it’s essential to realize that the gender gap at the top is largely caused by underrepresentation. In January 2024 there were 440,390 chess players with an official FIDE rating (obtained in internationally rated tournaments), but only 47,435 of these were women—about 11 percent. In the highest segment, from strong club players to grandmasters, women count for just 6 percent. The higher the level of the players the further the women drop: roughly 1,800 players hold the grandmaster title, but only 42 women do—about 2.3 percent. Why is this? The world of statistics tells us that extreme values in a large sample are all the more probable than those in a small sample. This is explained by a thought experiment I borrowed from fellow Dutchman Wei Ji Ma, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at New York University. Take two groups, one consisting of ten people and the other of two people. All 12 people are given a random number between one and 100, and then we take the highest score in each group. If we repeat these steps many times, we will see that Group A will score 91.4 and Group B 67.2 on average. Because the larger group has more shots at a high score, it will get a higher score on average. Similarly, we can expect many more men at the top of the chess rankings than women because there are many more of them playing chess. A 2009 study led by psychologist Merim Bilalić used this argument to demonstrate that women are not underachieving but that their performance at the top is more or less what can be expected from statistics. The researchers looked at the more than 120,000 members of the German Chess Federation in April 2007, where only one in 16 members was a woman. The model used in the study predicted for 96 percent of the rating difference between the top 100 male and top 100 female players, meaning that those rating difference between genders closely followed the statistically expected difference. Subsequent research questioned the statistical approach of this study and argued that the participation rate only partly explains the observed differences between men and women. It’s not just a numbers game; there’s more to the story. What about the brain? The British grandmaster Nigel Short asked that question in a controversial column for New in Chess magazine in 2015. Short assumed that the difference in achievements between men and women in chess is most likely the result of differences between the male and female brains. He wrote: Men and women’s brains are hard-wired very differently, so why should they function in the same way? I don’t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than I do. Likewise, she doesn’t feel embarrassed in asking me to maneuver the car out of our narrow garage. One is not better than the other, we just have different skills. It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact. If anyone had something to say about the topic, it was Judit Polgár. As the strongest female chess player in the history of the game, she knew better than anyone what it’s like to compete against (and beat!) mostly male opponents. Responding to Short in TIME magazine, she said, “We are capable of the same fight as any other man, and I think during the decades that I actively played chess, I proved it as well. It’s not a matter of gender; it’s a matter of being smart.” Judit Polgár, the best female chess player of all time, in September 2021 at the Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. But, I hear some readers ask, don’t neuroscientists agree that the male and female brains are different and affected by separate hormones? Well, I have to point out two things here. First, this might be true, but no direct links with chess ability have ever been demonstrated convincingly. As Polgár pointed out in a tweet: “Men and women are different, but there are different ways of thinking and fighting [while] still achieving the same results.” Secondly, the neuroscientific research in this field is ongoing and inconclusive. Even a (substantial) distinction between male and female brains is under debate. In 2015, a team led by neuroscientist Daphna Joel from Tel Aviv University did a comprehensive study of over 1,400 brain scans from four different labs. The wide range of variability between each brain led them to conclude that we should “shift from thinking of brains as falling into two classes, one typical of males and the other typical of females, to appreciating the variability of the human brain mosaic.” That being successful in chess isn’t related to biology is perhaps easier to accept when you realize that domain knowledge (expertise obtained by encountering thousands of chess patterns and motifs) is one of the most consistent predictors of chess skill. The two-time US champion Jennifer Shahade wrote in her 2022 book Chess Queens: “Learning the rules of chess takes a few hours, but gaining competence in its intricacies and developing a personal style takes years of work. Playing a highly focused board game for four to six hours is difficult, and neither men nor women nor non-binary players are born with the concentration and motivation to excel at it. For that reason, I find the emphasis on women’s biological inferiority absurd: when it comes to chess, we are all born inept.” In an interesting paper published in 2008, researchers from the University of Padova argued that gender stereotypes are partly responsible for the underperformance of women in chess. They had 42 male–female pairs, all Italian and matched for ability, playing games online. When players were unaware of the sex of their opponent, the women played approximately as well as the men, as could be expected from their similar chess strength. However, when women knew they were playing against a male opponent, they showed a drastic performance drop. Also, when they (falsely) believed they were playing against a woman, they performed as well as their male opponents. The researchers concluded: “This small-scale pilot study suggests that gender stereotypes are very pronounced in the chess world and that both male and female players are perfectly aware of these stereotypes.” In 2020 a research team led by Australian chess grandmaster and researcher David Smerdon replicated these results in an analysis of over eight million tournament games played by over 180,000 players. They concluded that women perform statistically worse than expected when playing against men, with this stereotype threat being “especially large when games are played under tight (rapid or blitz) time constraints.” The latest news on this topic comes from the Dutch scientist Remy Rikers. In a 2022 study, he mentioned the term reversed stereotype threat. Rikers found that the influence of a negative stereotype of women’s ability to play chess is not only limited to their level of performance but that it also has an effect on their opponent’s performance. He had a hundred players play games online, unsure whether they were facing a man or a woman. Ultimately, the study participants were unaware they played neither: their opponent was always a computer. However, sometimes they would see a male nickname and sometimes a female one. The results showed that participants who played against a female nickname played less well, lost more games, and made more mistakes and blunders than participants who played against a male nickname. One way to explain the low female participation in chess is to look at similar fields in society. For instance, women are also underrepresented in careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which are considered to require cognitive abilities similar to chess. In 2017, Ming-Te Wang and Jessica Degol of the University of Pittsburgh reviewed research from the fields of psychology, sociology, economics, and education over the preceding 30 years. They summarized six empirically supported explanations for US women’s underrepresentation in math-intensive STEM fields, and noted a complicated interaction between them. Their conclusions seem to be quite relevant to the chess world. Wang and Degol first mentioned cognitive ability but noted that it had only little effect. On average, girls hardly did worse than boys in math. Boys outperformed them in spatial relations tests involving mental rotation tasks, but only slightly, while girls did somewhat better in verbal tasks. Relative cognitive strengths played a more significant role in future career choices. Among the best math students, girls were more likely to also possess high verbal ability, while boys were more likely to demonstrate higher math relative to verbal ability. As a result, young women often have a greater variety of career options with less of a necessity to focus on a single strength. The third reason Wang and Degol presented for the gender gap concerned women tending to have different career interests or preferences, sometimes explained by the short notion that “males prefer working with objects whereas females prefer working with other people.” These differences can reach back as far as early adolescence. Another factor involved lifestyle values or work–family balance preferences, where women, especially when planning to have children, were more willing than men to make occupational sacrifices for the sake of their families and didn’t like work-centered lifestyles as much as men. Field-specific ability beliefs could be a factor as well. The American psychologist Carol S. Dweck noticed in 2007 that when girls were told about the “innate ability” and “natural talent” of math geniuses, after that they would perform significantly worse on a geometry task than girls who were told the math geniuses were hard workers. Based on this, Wang and Degol noted that women might be avoiding STEM careers because they wrongly assume two things: that innate intelligence is required and that they are lacking this. The final explanation for female underrepresentation was discussed earlier: gender-related stereotypes and biases. The researchers noted that while overt (intentional) and hostile forms of gender discrimination were occurring less frequently than some decades ago, covert (more subtle) and benevolent (overly affective) forms of discrimination still happen all the time and no doubt affect women’s career choices. We can try to explain the gender gap in chess in another way. The percentage of female (to male) players varies quite a bit across different countries—but figuring out why might reveal something about the reasons behind the female minority in chess in the first place. In an article written in 2019 on his website, David Smerdon attempted just that. Interestingly, the numbers go against intuition completely. It would be fair to assume that in countries with less gender equality, female participation in chess would be smaller, right? As Smerdon put it: “In more conservative countries, one might expect that a girl would be encouraged to get married and stay at home with the kids, rather than play rated tournaments. In poorer countries, a family might not be able to afford to send all of the children to chess lessons, and so the girls might miss out.” However, in practice, it’s not like that at all. Countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, which are among the top-ranked in the United Nations Development Program’s annual rankings of gender equality, have the lowest percentage of women chess players (about 5 percent). Meanwhile, countries with much lower gender equality—such as Georgia, China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and the UAE—all have percentages above 25. So, the more gender-equal a country, the fewer females play chess. But why? One possible explanation for the small minority of women engaged in STEM fields is that women are more likely to have a variety of interests. While that was linked to relative cognitive ability before, it turns out this is also the case for their status in society: researchers have observed that the more women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences. But it would be too simple to state that women don’t like chess as much as men. Smerdon suggests that more women might play chess in gender-unequal countries “because it’s one of the few fields where they can both compete with men and be sure that the result is judged objectively and without discrimination (as opposed to, say, promotions in the workplace).” The economist Maryam Dilmaghani signaled in 2021 that a legacy of a command economy, where major economic decisions are made by the government (such as in the former Soviet Union), was the most significant predictor of a smaller gender gap in competitive chess across countries. Apart from the general popularity and governmental support for chess in formerly communist countries, a possible explanation for this smaller gap was that women participated as much as men in the labor force, taking jobs traditionally seen as male in the West, which perhaps made it easier for them to navigate the male-dominated chess world. Another difference in gender is something that anyone can easily detect by looking at youth chess across the world. At a young age—say, eight to ten years—the overrepresentation of boys in chess classes is not as significant as in older age groups, but more girls than boys stop playing chess at some point. Why is this happening? I believe it is a combination of girls starting as a minority in the first place (boys get introduced to chess more often than girls) and then also finding themselves in a somewhat hostile environment where boys tend to dominate the space and blurt out answers. In contrast, many girls turn silent in a group where the boys have a majority. Although chess-playing girls tend to be part of a social group with other girls during their school years, such comfort usually disappears upon finishing high school and joining a chess club, which means entering an environment with very few girls or women to interact with. This was reflected in a somewhat forgotten paper from 2002 by researcher Ingrid Galitis. She tried to discover how boys came to dominate her primary school’s chess club in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Interviews with 18 girls aged seven to 12 revealed the perception of hostility from boys and an aversion to the boys’ aggressive attitudes. Also, girls tended to talk much more freely when they were among girls only. Other factors related to dropping out included whether girls had family members or friends involved in chess and a lack of attention given to them by tutors. A paper from October 2023, co-written by Jennifer Shahade, revealed another reason girls might drop out of chess more than boys—one we have seen when discussing STEM careers. The research pointed out that parents and mentors often believe girls have a lower potential in chess than boys. This bias is more pronounced among those who think chess success requires brilliance. “It is striking that even the parents and coaches who have a vested interest in girls’ success hold biases against them and may also have some blind spots about the barriers to girls’ success,” said Andrei Cimpian, the paper’s senior author. To coaches and parents who are reading this: you need to believe in girls, because your attitude might hinder them from succeeding if you don’t. In an article for Slate.com from December 2020, Wei Ji Ma mentioned social, cultural, and economic factors that explain why all top chess players are men. It is one of the best pieces ever written about this topic. I quote Ma as he sums up many good reasons why women are underperforming: Top female players are often relegated to women-only invitational tournaments, most likely limiting their ability to increase their ranking. It is possible that national federations invest less in top female players than in their male counterparts, for example, in terms of training or finding sponsors. It’s much easier for male players to make a living from chess. Among top players with children, women might be more burdened with child-care duties than men and therefore have less time to play in and prepare for tournaments. Top female players might fall victim to stereotype threat (where a member of a negatively stereotyped group underperforms due to the pressure or anxiety induced by the stereotype), which indeed seems to manifest itself in the results of chess games. It is also likely that top female chess players face a particularly hostile environment, leading them to drop out in higher proportions than lower-ranked women. The chess world was rather slow in responding to the #MeToo movement, but when several cases of sexual assault came to light in 2023, they showed that Ma’s last point was spot on. Like everywhere else in society, we need to work harder to make chess safer for all genders. That includes transgender people, who have their own battles to fight. As of August 2023, FIDE decided that transgender women cannot compete in its official events for women until its officials make an assessment of the gender change. While some top women players approved of this measure, the French transwoman chess player and coach Yosha Iglesias was baffled. She wrote on X: “The new regulations will make trans chess players all over the world face a horrible dilemma: transition or quit chess”—adding that for trans players and especially women “it will do so much unnecessary harm.” Regarding the attempts to increase the participation and improve the atmosphere for women, there are signs that systemic changes might be happening. A promising new initiative is the Women in Chess Foundation, launched in the fall of 2023. More good news came from FIDE in November 2023 when it published its first Gender Equality in Chess Index, an innovative instrument designed to measure and compare the level of gender equality in chess federations across the globe. I have high hopes for research being conducted under the supervision of Jeroen Struben, Associate Professor of Strategy and Organization at the Emlyon Business School in Lyon, France. Struben, a specialist in systems thinking, examines gender segregation dynamics resulting from interactions between a variety of factors. He looks at how players decide to start with chess in the first place, their decisions about commitment to improving, gameplay, dropout, performance, and influences from peers, role models, and the broader community. He has compiled a dataset of over 40,000 members of the Dutch Chess Federation between 1994 and 2018 and combined it with elite-player interviews, an integrative literature review, and computation and simulation. Whereas scientific research usually focuses on a single aspect, Struben believes system thinking is crucial in areas like sustainability and gender. “Because research has shown that many factors play a role, you cannot isolate one since their interaction could be very important,” he said. “By looking at them together, we can figure out why, despite well-intended efforts, little progress has been made, and, secondly, we can conclude that some factors are of little importance individually but become important together, which can help [us] to come up with strategies that act following the whole system.” When I spoke to Struben in November 2023, he could share some initial conclusions. His model showed that peer influence and role models have a measurable relationship with dropout rates and effort. Also, no single factor is dominant in the gender differences in chess, so we must look deeper into how their inter-dependency works. The ultimate goal is to help the Dutch Chess Federation, and, hopefully, other federations, to develop a long-term policy toward more inclusion and integration in the chess world. For Struben, the next step will be to use his insights as a starting point for research in STEM areas. Elo Ratings, Databases, Engines: A Researcher’s Gold Mine As a closed environment that requires solving complex tasks, chess facilitates the design of experiments that specifically address theoretical questions. The researcher Roy Roring explained it perfectly: “Finding the best move in a chess position is a highly complex, real-world human activity, and each chess position represents a well-defined problem environment, with a fixed number of identifiable moves that can be played at any given point—perfect for studying search processes and problem-solving.” There are three more technical reasons chess lends itself well to scientific research: Elo ratings, databases, and engines. The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players. Developed by the Hungarian American physics professor Arpad Elo, the system assigns numerical ratings to players based on game performance. Players gain or lose points depending on the outcome of games, and this gain or loss is higher if the rating difference with their opponent is bigger. The system has been used since 1960 in the US and since 1970 internationally. Beginners have ratings of around 500 to 800, novices around 1100, and average players around 1500. We tend to call players above 2000 experts. An international master normally is between 2400 and 2500. An international grandmaster usually has a rating above 2500. In January 2024, 36 players were rated over 2700. “The Elo system is one of the reasons why, early on, chess was very useful for expertise research in particular,” research psychologist Christopher Chabris told me. “You could objectively identify who was an expert and even finer gradations of expert versus novice. You could identify the exact skill difference between two people. You can’t do that with anything else than the Elo system, and it’s a huge benefit. Even having a consensus on who are the experts and who are the novices, and how far apart they are in their actual ability to succeed in the task, doesn’t exist in law, it doesn’t exist in medicine or other areas.” Using chess ratings has become particularly useful in science since around 2006 when FIDE computerized all official ratings data gathered since their inaugural 1970 list. This means there is now a consistent database for the last half-century, and the rating progress of thousands of players can be tracked over years and sometimes decades. With such a well-organized, objective, and complete dataset, one advantage for researchers is that they don’t need to worry about sampling bias, which is when a sample selected for a study does not represent the broader population it intends to represent. Another type of chess database provides a second tool for the researcher: one that forms a structured collection of games that have been recorded and stored electronically. Such databases are used by both chess players and researchers to study and analyze games, track historical trends, and improve their understanding of the game. Chess databases typically include a wide range of games played by various players at different skill levels, from early historical events until present-day tournaments. With a software program, a search can filter out games based on all kinds of data, including the players’ names, the date the game was played, the event, the result, the opening played, or even specific positions. Since 1987, the Hamburg-based company ChessBase has been selling the leading chess database software bearing the same name. It was originally developed with the help of none other than Garry Kasparov, who commented about a prototype he had seen a year earlier: “This is the most important development in chess study since Gutenberg.” Decades later, it is also an important development for broader study. “These databases present a gold mine for researchers interested in various topics in psychology,” wrote the research psychologists Nemanja Vaci and Merim Bilalić in 2017. “Similarly to those in other fields, chess databases offer the possibilities of applying data-mining and modeling approaches on large datasets and of investigating a number of cognitive effects.” The pair noted that chess databases can be used “to tackle topics such as skill development over the lifetime, birth cohort effects, effects of activity and inactivity on chess play, and even gender differences.” Databases of over-the-board games have existed since the late 1980s and can include millions of games. The website Lichess allows users to download its complete database of all games played on the site since 2013. In January 2024, that consisted of an incredible 7.9 billion games. Because researchers have become much better at analyzing big data, sometimes helped by artificial intelligence, such online databases have become invaluable. The third handy research tool is an aspect of the modern chess world I will elaborate on later in the book: chess engines. These are basically computer programs that can play chess, but they can also analyze already-played games, which is particularly interesting for the scientist, as David Smerdon explained to me. Apart from looking at game results, we can now look at individual chess moves. It is as if, apart from the final scores, we can now also analyze the quality of passes, assists, and shots on goal to objectively evaluate the performance of soccer teams. In the past, we could only analyze performance at the game level, and the performance scores were also not independent of what the opponent was doing. From a statistical point of view, we can’t treat the performances of both players in a game as independent observations, so we end up throwing away a lot of data. Being able to analyze the quality of individual moves with engines improves both the quantity and the quality of research. First of all, the data size increases a lot because instead of looking at each game that you play as one data point, we’re looking at each move by each player as a data point. By treating each move as an independent decision problem, we end up with roughly 80 times more data. Secondly, the evaluation by the engine gives us an objective benchmark for the best move, which means we can get a reliable, independent measure of cognitive performance. The first time a chess engine was used for scientific research was probably in 1999 in Christopher Chabris’s doctoral dissertation, Cognitive and Neuropsychological Mechanisms of Expertise: Studies with Chess Masters. He analyzed 1,188 chess games with the help of the German program Fritz 5 to demonstrate in a reasonably objective manner that when players had additional time to think ahead, the quality of their decisions improved significantly. This might sound logical but was contrary to a theory that existed at the time, which held that pattern-recognition processes (which require little time on the clock) played a dominant role in top-level chess expertise. Voilà! Now we understand why there’s been such a boom in chess-related research over the last ten to 15 years: thanks to the Elo rating system, databases, and engines, many cognitive scientists and people interested in cognitive performance from different disciplines (such as economics, psychology, or computer science, including some high-profile researchers from Ivy League universities) suddenly became interested and started publishing papers using these tools. An excellent example of how all these chess tools combined can be used to study real-world phenomena was supplied by Smerdon himself. In a 2022 paper, he looked at the effect of face masks on cognitive performance. Two years after the COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020, 178 of 186 researched countries required facial coverings to be worn in some or all public spaces, workplaces, and educational settings. Little was known about the impact of masks on cognitive performance. Smerdon jumped on it. Using chess databases, he collected data from over 70 chess tournaments with mask requirements held during the pandemic. He matched those to an approximate figure of 140 tournaments staged without mask requirements but with a considerable overlap of the same players. He used a chess engine to analyze almost three million chess moves played by more than 8,000 people in 18 countries. His study showed that wearing a face mask during a chess game decreased the quality of chess players’ decisions—an effect that was relatively short-lived—and mostly hurt stronger players. While mask-wearing negatively impacted chess performance, the effect subsided after four to six hours of playing. “The decrease in performance was due to the annoyance caused by the masks rather than a physiological mechanism, but people adapted to the distraction over time,” Smerdon said. “The results suggest that the effect of masks may depend on the type of task, the duration of the task and the working memory load. This is something to keep in mind for occupations in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as well as other professions that demand a high level of working memory such as language interpreters, performers, waiters, and teachers.” The Benefits of Chess On Wednesday, February 11, 2015, something happened that the Spanish journalist Leontxo García called “the Spanish Miracle.” García has covered chess since the early 1980s. He is also a passionate promoter of the game, and, throughout his career, has supported the idea that teaching chess in schools is beneficial for children. On that winter Wednesday in 2015, the Spanish parliament agreed with him. “I was tempted to call the Vatican to report a miracle,” he told me, “because, in Spain, to get all parties with no exception agreeing on anything is a miracle, and it happened that day.” In a unanimous vote, the Education and Sports Commission of the Congress of Deputies recommended using chess as an educational tool in the curriculum. “It had to be a recommendation; it could not be compulsory because, in Spain, except for the major ones, the education competencies are transferred to the regional governments,” explained García. “But in the following three years, ten out of 17 regions introduced chess into the curriculum, and, after the pandemic, at least two or three more are thinking about it.” He estimates that over a million Spanish children are now connected to chess in their schools in one way or another. Almost a decade later, chess-related educational programs can be found across the globe, following the example of countries with an even longer tradition in the game, such as Armenia, Georgia, and Russia. Even in England, where chess is not officially recognized as a sport, the game was given a massive boost in the summer of 2023 when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced almost £1 million ($1.27 million) in funding to support the English Chess Federation, to promote chess in British schools and to install a hundred tables in public parks. When Sunak visited a school in Washington, DC, he said he was trying to get British children to play more chess, describing it as “good for you.” In general, chess is believed to be beneficial to educational development, and why wouldn’t it be? There are so many different types of skills and competencies needed for chess that are useful elsewhere in life: collaboration, communication, strategic thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, deduction, anticipation, concentration, clever use of resources, preparation, learning from mistakes, and even the concept of fair play. The benefits of chess are, however, the topic of an ongoing scientific debate. Research has shown that, like musicians, chess players are, on average, slightly more intelligent than the general population. This, however, doesn’t automatically mean that chess makes you smarter. People with a higher IQ may like chess (or music) more than others and choose to indulge in the game more often. This effect is known as self-selection. The question is whether certain qualities necessary for chess or music can transfer to other areas; chess as basis for developing intelligence. Scientists use the term transfer of learning, and distinguish between “near transfer” (the transfer between closely related domains—e.g., knowledge of Latin transfers to other languages) and “far transfer”(the transfer between domains that are only loosely related—e.g., Latin and geography). If chess could make kids better at mathematics, this would be a clear case of far transfer. Some research has pointed to the positive effects of chess teaching on math test results. At the same time, there are papers that fail to demonstrate a link. Which study to believe? In 2017, Giovanni Sala and Fernand Gobet of the University of Liverpool decided to look at 24 existing studies regarding the potential benefits of chess for children concerning mathematics, reading, and cognitive skills. Sala and Gobet’s meta-analysis showed small positive effects “with chess enhancing primary and middle-school students’ achievement in mathematics and overall cognitive ability.” However, the overall effect size was “not large enough to convincingly establish the effectiveness of chess instruction in enhancing the skills [under] consideration,” according to the researchers. They also pointed out a major problem in the existing research on the effectiveness of chess instruction: “Almost none of the reviewed studies compared chess-treated groups with active control groups to rule out possible placebo effects.” A 2022 paper by the Spanish research psychologist Angel Blanch noted similar issues with the existing research. He looked at 45 studies in 19 countries targeting cognitive ability and academic performance and noted that most had theoretical and methodological drawbacks. Only 16 percent of the studies had a robust research design with large enough sample sizes or more sophisticated data-analysis approaches. These studies tended to report lower or null effects, causing “reasonable concerns over the evidence about the benefits of chess instruction.” All in all, we have to conclude that the data doesn’t demonstrate proof that chess makes you smarter. But does this mean we should stop teaching chess at schools? Maybe not. Despite his “reasonable concerns,” Blanch ended his paper as follows: Nonetheless, chess seems … an interesting activity to teach in school contexts. Chess is an ancient universal game, an intellectually related activity that is part of human cultural heritage, and that comprises a considerable body of specialized knowledge. It is easy to implement, it is relatively cheap, and it is appealing to both children and adults because of its playing and competitive nature.… Perhaps it is not necessary to justify the need of teaching chess in the classrooms because of being beneficial for intelligence and academic performance. What is needed ultimately is the undertaking of higher quality studies about the benefits of chess for other kinds of simpler outcomes that may be relevant for education. As Blanch intimated, chess may not directly boost cognitive abilities but it may indirectly benefit academic achievement by enhancing skills such as concentration, risk-taking, and patience—something backed up by an Australian study published in 2020 on the effects of chess instruction to grade-five students on academic and non-cognitive outcomes. The research took place in 2016 in 16 rural primary schools in Bangladesh, where the children did not have previous experience playing chess, so the impact of the lessons might have been higher than in previous research. The main finding of the Bangladesh study was that, almost a year after the chess training had ended, it had reduced the level of risk aversion among the children. At the end of that period, nine out of ten students were still playing and reached a level where taking risks had become a regular aspect of their games. There were also signs of a slightly better performance in math and a higher level of patience than in the control group that did not partake in chess lessons, but those results were not statistically significant. Other indirect academic benefits were shown in a Danish paper from 2017. Chess was taught in five schools in Aarhus, the second-largest city in Denmark, to 482 children (grades one to three). About two-thirds had one of their four weekly mathematics lectures replaced with chess instruction; the other third was the control group. The results indicated moderate positive effects on the math skills of the pupils involved in chess. The most interesting conclusion was that these positive effects almost exclusively impacted children who were not very happy at school and those who were occasionally or always bored. Obtaining mathematical concepts through chess could be a more engaging way to deliver teaching. As we have seen, teachers skeptical about including chess lessons in the curriculum can claim their doubts are scientifically justified. The goal, however, doesn’t need to be that children learn chess. It is also possible to use chess to teach children whatever they need to know at school. This has been demonstrated in Hungary for over a decade with the “Chess Palace” program, developed by the Judit Polgár Chess Foundation for Educational Benefits. Since 2013, Chess Palace has been part of the national curriculum of Hungarian elementary schools. A decade on, it is used in over a thousand schools, with over 4,000 teachers teaching 50,000 children annually. The material, intended for children aged 4–10 years, is unique because it goes beyond the regular borders of chess teaching. The chess-themed program teaches children areas like mathematics, science, arts and crafts, foreign languages, reading, and writing, thus demonstrating the incredible versatility of the game. Judit Polgár, here with Magnus Carlsen at a primary school in Stavanger, Norway, in 2019, dedicates a lot of her time to chess education. When I spoke to Leontxo García in September 2023, we discussed science’s failure to back up claims about the beneficial nature of chess. He wasn’t discouraged. “I have talked to more than 200 neurologists during my career,” he said. “There is no doubt. Of course, chess is not the only thing you can do, but it is one of the best, for sure. Nobody is questioning that, as far as I know.” The benefits of chess don’t need to be limited to general educational purposes either. Growing research is focusing on specific groups, such as children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A review article from 2023 that looked at four studies published in medical journals concluded that “chess has positive effects on ADHD symptoms and their severity” and recommended chess be “included for the management of ADHD patients as a complementary therapy.” Chess may also benefit the elderly, preventing or delaying the onset of dementia. This field of research has existed a bit longer. In a 2019 review article that looked at 21 studies, a group of researchers from Spain concluded that “even though the evidence is weak to demonstrate its role as a protective factor, other evidence indirectly related to chess and based on its cognitive stimulating functions suggest it may work as a protective factor.” On a final note, which once again shows the versatility of chess, I will mention the positive impact a chess program had on an unexpected group: prisoners. In 2012, Sheriff Thomas Dart and coach/organizer Mikhail Korenman started a “chess in jail” program in Cook County, Illinois, that involved chess classes for inmates. “Chess is more than an entertaining pastime,” Dart said in 2020. “The game teaches its players valuable life lessons. It requires critical thinking to consider the risks and rewards of their decisions, which are valuable skills that help foster a reduction in violent behavior.” When I visited the London Chess Conference in March 2023, Korenman presented some results after a decade of running the project with about 3,000 inmates. An important conclusion was that spending time with chess had a positive effect on bringing down the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among those participants who had been involved in the program for more than six months. There were also lower levels of inmate fights, uses of force, batteries to staff, and recidivism among the chess participants compared with a control group that did not join the program. In their landmark 1973 article “Skill in Chess,” Herbert Simon and William Chase were the first to make the now famous comparison between chess and the fruit fly in print. This comparison suggests that both chess and the common fruit fly (Latin name: Drosophila melanogaster) are simple and widely known tools for experiments that can be effectively used to gain valuable insights into more complex systems. While the fruit fly has played a key role in bio-medical research, revealing fundamental principles of genetics and development and illuminating human health and disease, chess has played a similar role in other areas of scientific research. As we have seen in this chapter, chess has indeed been a perfect model and an incredibly versatile tool for cognitive psychologists, in particular, but also other kinds of scientists. In the second part of this book, we will see that this analogy worked even better for chess and artificial intelligence—where the comparison was made first. But first, we’ll learn which players have left the biggest mark on chess, thus shaping the cultural meaning of the game in their stead. I’ll also try to answer the impossible but ever-entertaining question: who was the greatest of all?",

      "content": "Chapter 4Brilliance at the Board: The Biggest Stars in Chess “Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see.” —Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation (Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung), vol. 2, 1844 It is March 9, 2014, the day Bobby Fischer would have celebrated his 71st birthday. As we make the 60-kilometer (37-mile) ride from Reykjavík to Selfoss, snow is falling and the road is slippery. Garry Kasparov, however, is determined to continue the drive. The 13th World Chess Champion will be visiting Fischer’s grave, carefully planned on this day, at the small Christian cemetery of Laugardælir church in Selfoss. Dressed appropriately, with dark trousers, a warm black coat, and a dark gray hat to protect him from Iceland’s cold breeze and snow, Kasparov gets out of the car and walks toward the small graveyard, leaving deep footsteps in the thick snow. He takes off his hat and waits respectfully for a moment, at a distance of a few meters, before walking closer to the marble tombstone that says: ROBERT JAMES FISCHER F. 9. MARS 1943 D. 17. JANÚAR 2008 It is a historic moment for chess. The two giants of the game had never met, yet never were they so close. I was honored to be present that day, to witness a unique and touching synergy between two of my biggest heroes. Few players have meant as much for chess as Fischer and Kasparov—until Magnus Carlsen arrived. All three influenced the game’s cultural development enormously, and are also considered the three best players in history. This chapter is about them, what they have in common, and which of them was the Greatest of All Time (GOAT). The Lone American Warrior Robert James Fischer was born in Chicago on March 9, 1943. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was still legally married to a man named Hans Gerhardt Fischer. He was named the father on Bobby’s birth certificate despite never entering the US. Most likely, the real father of the future world champion was the Hungarian mechanical engineer Paul Neményi, who became friendly with Regina in Colorado in 1942 and sent her money regularly after Bobby was born. In any case, Bobby grew up without a father. In 1949, the family moved to Manhattan and a year later to Brooklyn. Soon after Bobby’s sixth birthday, his sister, Joan, bought a $1 plastic chess set at a candy store. It didn’t take long before Bobby beat both her and his mother. After that, he started playing games against himself. In an interview many years later, he quipped, “I usually won.” Bobby soon started frequenting the Brooklyn Chess Club, while a man named Carmine Nigro began to give him lessons at his home on Saturdays. He would also take him to Washington Square Park’s open-air tables in Greenwich Village. Fischer would later say that meeting Nigro was “probably a decisive factor in my going ahead with chess.” Bobby was 12 when he joined the prestigious Manhattan Chess Club, and, about a year later, met with the chess master Jack Collins, who took over the role of trainer/mentor from Nigro. Bobby played thousands of blitz games with many strong players, read the chess books on Collins’s bookshelves, and often stayed for dinner. Bobby was eating, sleeping, and dreaming chess. A young Bobby Fischer, c. 1957. It took a few years before his breakthrough came, but after that his rise to the top was faster than anyone before him. In 1956, he first won a tournament at the Manhattan club and then the US Junior Chess Championship, something that had never been achieved by a 13-year-old. And then, in October of that year, he did something that catapulted his name into fame all over the United States and abroad. At the Rosenwald Memorial, held in the Marshall Chess Club, it was his round-seven game against Donald Byrne that left a deep impression (see annotated game on pages 384–85). With tactical wizardry that included a queen sacrifice, he won in beautiful style. Hans Kmoch, the arbiter at the tournament, called it the “Game of the Century” and wrote, “A stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies.” Some of America’s strongest grandmasters played in the Rosenwald Memorial, and Bobby lost more games than he won. He bridged that gap just 14 months later when he unexpectedly won his first “adult” US championship in 1957–58 without losing a single game, two months before his 15th birthday. Fischer was nothing less than a sensation. With his first-place finish he qualified for the upcoming Interzonal tournament in Portorož, then part of Yugoslavia, in August 1958. It was his first step into the world championship cycle. The top six players at the Interzonal would qualify for the 1959 Candidates Tournament, where the winner would play the world champion. All very nice, but a 15-year-old boy wasn’t going to be among the top six finishers, was he? Well … scoring 12 points from 20 games, Bobby tied for fifth–sixth place and just made it! An incredible achievement about which the Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh wrote, “In Fischer’s play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition, one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess.” Thanks to his result in Portorož, Fischer became the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, six months, and one day—a record that would only be broken three decades later by Judit Polgár. Fischer also became the youngest person to qualify for the Candidates, a record only broken in 2007 by Magnus Carlsen (using a different qualifying system). The 1959 Candidates Tournament in Yugoslavia was too strong for Fischer, but a worthwhile experience. Three years later Fischer again qualified for the Candidates Tournament, held in May 1962 in Curaçao. The now 19-year-old Fischer finished in fourth place among eight participants. After-ward, in an article in Sports Illustrated, he accused the Soviet players of drawing their mutual games quickly, saving energy for their other games, and even helping each other during play. He would remain suspicious of the Russians for the rest of his career. Substantial proof of collusion does not exist, but Viktor Korchnoi, one of the Soviet participants, confirmed Fischer’s suspicions in his 1977 memoir Chess Is My Life. How many times can a player do something unique? Fischer found a new way (and not for the last time) when he played his sixth US championship, the 1963–64 edition, and won all 11 games against top opposition. By now it was clear Fischer was by far the best player in his country, and he made the point rather perspicuously. In tournaments like these, Fischer established his lasting influence on chess as someone who always played to win, even with the black pieces—something we would also see with Kasparov and Carlsen. Since 2009, a $64,000 Fischer Memorial Prize has been at stake for anyone who can sweep the field at America’s national championship, but it hasn’t happened yet. After beating everyone at home, six years later Fischer would start doing the same internationally. The years between 1970 and 1972 bore witness to the most dominant period at the top of the game by a single chess player the world has ever seen—only comparable with how Paul Morphy (1837–84) outclassed the entire European chess community a century earlier. Fischer won several strong tournaments, most importantly the 1970 Interzonal tournament in Palma de Mallorca. He’d failed to qualify for this event by missing the previous US championship, but the Hungarian American Pal Benko stepped aside and let Fischer play instead—a little detail in chess history that had huge consequences. The next stage of the world championship cycle consisted of Candidates matches. Fischer was paired with the Soviet grandmaster Mark Taimanov for a best-of-ten in Vancouver, Canada, and set down an unprecedented 6–0 score. Wow! Below is an eyewitness account from chess editor Daniel Bailey that beautifully describes Fischer’s presence at the board and intense concentration: In the summer of 1971 I went up to Vancouver to see one of the Fischer–Taimanov games. I sat near the front. All I can say is I have never been in the force field of more powerful human concentration. That includes master politicians, superb actors, and consummate concert musicians. Fischer would come on stage from the wings and in three long strides reach the table, sit and start analyzing in one swift seamless motion. Then he’d freeze, his body motionless but his mind no more motionless than a big cat’s riveted on prey. The intensity of his focus bumped up my pulse and blood pressure and made my breath come shallow minute after minute, hour after hour in the dark silence of the hall. I can only imagine what Taimanov must have been feeling from merely across the board. In the next match, held later that year in Denver, Colorado, Fischer defeated the great Dane Bent Larsen, scoring 6–0 again. A whirlwind was ripping through the chess world, following the quickest path to the crown. Winning his last Candidates match 6½–2½ against the former Soviet world champion Tigran Petrosian, Fischer achieved his goal: he would play for the world title. A chess craze started in the US as Fischer became a national hero, appearing on television and in magazines. Among the congratulatory telegrams was one from President Richard Nixon. Set at $250,000 (equivalent to $1.8 million today), the prize fund was higher than all previous world championships combined. Just three years earlier, Boris Spassky had earned $1,400 for winning the championship. The 1972 prize fund was astronomical for its time and, in hindsight, the first proper payout for chess. According to Kasparov, this was Fischer’s biggest legacy: “Fischer—and this is his chief merit—placed chess on a professional footing. He was the first genuine chess pro!” The match started disastrously for the challenger. He lost the first game due to a silly blunder, and then, after a conflict with the organizers about the placement of the TV cameras, Fischer refused to play the second game. In this best-of-24 match, he was 2–0 down. Spassky would have been justified in leaving the battlefield there and then, and was even urged to do so by the Soviet authorities, but he wanted to play. Spassky saved the match, and with that, he determined Fischer’s fate. The third game was played in a back room, away from the cameras, and Fischer scored his first-ever win against Spassky. After this, the players returned to the main stage for the remainder. Fischer won five times in games 4 to 13, some in brilliant style, while Spassky won just one more time. Seven draws followed, and Fischer won the match 12½–8½ to become the 11th World Chess Champion. The mighty Soviet chess machine, which had dominated the game for decades, was defeated by the lone American warrior. Fischer’s sister Joan put it unpolitically: “Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship.” After returning home, Fischer was received by Mayor John Lindsay at New York City Hall. He was the first Western world champion since Dutchman Max Euwe held the title between 1935 and 1937. “I never thought I’d see the day when chess would be all over the front pages here, but confined only to one paragraph in Pravda,” Fischer said in his speech, referring to the Russian newspaper Truth, the official voice of the Soviet Communist Party. By single-handedly defeating the representatives of a Communist country full of chess experts, Fischer instantly became one of the world’s most famous personalities, not just in sports. And, more than anyone before (and perhaps after) him, Fischer popularized the game immensely. Over a million viewers—an incredible number at the time—had tuned in to watch live commentary of the games by the chess teacher Shelby Lyman on the PBS television station Channel 13. One day, a reporter had walked past 21 bars in Manhattan and discovered that 18 of the televisions showed Lyman instead of a New York Mets baseball match that was also underway. The match had been front-page news globally. Chess author and Fischer expert John Donaldson told me, “On the news, there would be Walter Cronkite saying, ‘The war in Vietnam rages on, the stock market is down, oil prices are … ’ and then he’d say: ‘But first we go to Reykjavík!’ ” Fischer once again featured in major newspapers and magazines and on television, appearing on famous show such as The Bob Hope Special, 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and (a third appearance on) The Dick Cavett Show. Richard Nixon again contacted Fischer, this time inviting him to the White House. In subsequent years, chess experienced an international “Fischer Boom.” As sales of chess sets went through the roof, the United States Chess Federation membership doubled in 1972, and similar effects were seen at chess federations worldwide. Fischer meant more to the game than anyone before him. How did Fischer become so good? Talent is obviously part of the equation, while an immense love for the game made him spend most of his time analyzing, playing, and reading chess books and magazines as a child and adolescent. He had ample access to chess literature in New York City, where he found coaches early on. Donaldson wrote in his 2020 book Bobby Fischer and His World: If Bobby had stayed in Mobile, Arizona (35 miles southwest of Phoenix near the Sierra Estrella Mountains), where his family lived for a year (his mother taught school there), it’s almost inconceivable that he would have developed into a world champion. Today, with the internet, databases, computer programs, and tons of chess literature, a player from an isolated area can go far. This was not the case when Bobby was growing up. It was pretty much New York City, or forget it. Fischer’s life would be a true fairytale if the story ended there, but the remainder was altogether different. For starters, he didn’t defend his title: not all of his demands about the format of the match were accepted by FIDE, and he wouldn’t budge. The challenger, Anatoly Karpov, was declared the 12th world champion in 1975 without playing. As the years went by, Fischer lived an increasingly secluded life, and whenever people heard from him, he seemed to display signs of paranoia. He went so far as to suggest that all the Karpov–Kasparov matches were fixed. And then there was the antisemitism. A few hours after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, Fischer called it “wonderful news” on a Philippine radio station, expressing the hope that “the country will be taken over by the military—they’ll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.” It was not altogether new. The Dutch grandmaster Jan Hein Donner wrote about meeting a young Fischer in 1961: “He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of antisemitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.” At the same time, it is known that Fischer had good relations with several Jewish chess players. It might be that, at least when he was still young, he had something against Judaism but not necessarily Jewish people per se. In 1968, he played a tournament in Netanya, Israel, and even visited a kibbutz. There, he told the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree that his former antisemitism was “stupid,” and added, “Besides, I’m half-Jewish myself, so how can I be antisemitic?” But, particularly after his active playing career, Fischer was definitely antisemitic, as he made numerous comments about Jews and denied the Holocaust both publicly and privately. Given that most experts believe Paul Neményi was his father, we now know Fischer had not one, but two Jewish parents. Still, even if his rabid antisemitism only started long after his chess career, his fans are left with an uncomfortable double emotion. We like to remember him as the brilliant chess player that he was—but, at the same time, we cannot ignore his rather unpleasant characteristics. On a more positive note, Fischer’s legacy goes beyond the brilliant results and the many wonderful games he left behind to be studied and admired by students of the game. In the 1990s, Fischer promoted what he called “Fischer Random,” where before the game starts, the pieces are shuffled on the first and eighth rank to avoid opening theory. It is also called “Chess960” (or “Freestyle”), because there are 960 possible starting positions. (As early as 1792, the Dutch chess enthusiast Philip Julius van Zuylen van Nijevelt had a similar idea.) And then there is his chess clock, which he patented in the late 1980s and which became the standard for the chess world. In contrast with older chess clocks, a Fischer time control gives each player a small increment after each completed move, on top of a fixed period at the start of the game. In 1992, Fischer suddenly returned to the chessboard. The shady Yugoslav banker Jezdimir Vasiljević, who would later be convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, had convinced him to play another match with Spassky, exactly 20 years after Reykjavík—and for a prize fund of $5 million. The event occurred in Yugoslavia (partly on Sveti Stefan, an island off the coast of Montenegro, and partly in Belgrade). It was global news, not least because of Fischer’s reaction to the US government’s warning not to play the match as it would violate UN sports sanctions imposed following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Fischer showed the letter to the journalists during a press conference and spat on it. He won the return match 10–5 (with 15 draws) but never returned to the United States, knowing he would be arrested upon arrival. Fischer lived the final years of his life in Iceland, where he died from degenerative kidney failure on January 17, 2008. He was 64 years old—a year for each of the squares on the chessboard. News of his death was released on a Saturday morning—my mother texted me about it while I was in the car on my way to the Wijk aan Zee tournament. I was shocked and felt it in my stomach. At the start of the first round the sad news was announced, and I made a video where I filmed the playing hall with all the top grandmasters and the hundreds of amateurs standing up for a minute of silence, a truly heartbreaking moment. The chess world had lost one of its greatest players. When Kasparov visited Fischer’s grave in 2014, I had the unforgettable opportunity to record a video interview. As I held my Nikon D90 camera, I ensured Fischer’s snow-covered grave and the tombstone were visible in the background. Later, I would edit out my questions and combine Kasparov’s touching words with appropriate background music. Ten years on, the video on YouTube has collected 856,000 views. It might be the one thing I am the proudest of in my career. Kasparov said: I can’t help but think that this is the graveyard also for great, unfulfilled hopes, because so much could be achieved. This is the country where Robert Fischer reached his peak. It was not only his peak, but it was one of the most glorious moments in the history of the game of chess. It could have ended differently. It’s not for us to come up with hypothetical versions of alternative history, but it’s still very sad. It’s as if this graveyard.… We could feel that so many great hopes and expectations have been buried without being realized. It’s all behind us, all the controversies, and what is left is the unique contribution of Robert James Fischer to the game of chess, and I’m here to pay this tribute. The Beast from Baku Garry Kasparov was born Garik Kimovich Weinstein in Baku, Azerbaijan, on April 13, 1963. His Armenian mother, Klara Kasparova, and his Jewish father, Kim Weinstein, were engineers. Garry learned chess from his father at five and beat him a year later. However, like Fischer, he mostly grew up without his father, who sadly died of lymphatic sarcoma at age 39, not long before Garry’s eighth birthday. Four and a half years later, in August 1975, he took his mother’s surname and became Garry Kasparov. His uncle started playing a lot of chess with seven-year-old Garry, and, within three months, he couldn’t beat his nephew any more, so he took him to the Pioneers’ Palace in Baku. In the Soviet Union all big cities had such palaces: institutions designed to engage and educate young people in various extracurricular activities, including sports, arts, cultural programs, and chess. Young Garry’s chess talent was immediately recognized at the Baku Pioneers’ Palace. When he reached the final of the Baku adult blitz championship in June 1972, a newspaper wrote about the nine-year-old, dark-haired boy: “Third-year pupil Garik Weinstein, playing standing up (when sitting he can’t reach all the pieces), achieved the overall best result in the first stage—9 points out of 9.” Even a newspaper in West Germany picked up the story. You could say that in the same summer when Fischer played his last serious chess games, Kasparov entered the arena. In 1973 Kasparov was accepted into the prestigious school of the legendary former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Just a few years later, Kasparov achieved a very high level of play. He became the youngest player ever to win the junior championship of the USSR in 1976, at 13, and then unexpectedly won the 1978 Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk, Belarus, at 14. He scored 3½ points more than was needed to obtain the Soviet master title. He was not an international master yet, as up until that point he had only played in a small number of youth championships abroad. As a chess player (or any sportsman, for that matter), one depended on the whims of the Sports Committee to be allowed to play internationally. The first published photo of Garry Kasparov, at 10 years old already attracting spectators as he defeated grandmaster Yuri Averbakh in 1973 in Moscow. That changed in April 1979, when Kasparov, after helpful talks between Botvinnik and the organizers, was invited to a strong tournament in Banja Luka, in then Yugoslavia. Without holding an international title or rating, Kasparov—again rather unexpectedly—won the 15-round tournament with a two-point margin, ahead of 14 grandmasters. It was a true breakthrough moment in his career. Kasparov’s first official rating, published in January 1980, was a stunning 2595, instantly throwing the 16-year-old schoolboy into the world’s top 20. Only two other players had scored a similar result at that age: Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Even though he was already approaching the world’s top ten, Kasparov decided to participate in the 1981 World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, Germany. He won the tournament—this time surprising no one—with a certain Nigel Short of England taking second place. (The two would play a major role in the chess world 12 years later.) In 1982 Kasparov finally obtained the grandmaster title officially—having demonstrated that level of play for years. In 1983, he defeated three world-class grandmasters (Alexander Beliavsky, Viktor Korchnoi, and Vasily Smyslov) in Candidates matches to become the challenger to the reigning world champion, Anatoly Karpov. The 21-year-old Kasparov, who became the number-one ranked player in the world in January 1984 with a rating of 2710, would prove to be Karpov’s fiercest opponent. Their first match began on September 9, 1984. It started one of the most epic rivalries in sports history, eclipsing contemporary clashes such as Ali versus Frazier, Evert versus Navratilova, or Prost versus Senna. Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov during their 1984 match in Moscow, the longest in the history of the game, lasting five months and 48 games. The winner would be the first to score six wins, with draws not counting. The world championship thus returned to an ancient format (and one that Fischer proposed in 1975), resulting in the longest title match in history. Karpov initially took a 5–0 lead, winning games three, six, seven, and nine (see annotated game on pages 387–88), and, after a string of 17 draws, also game 27. Kasparov, however, refused to throw in the towel. The longer the match progressed, the stronger the player he became, all the while learning from his formidable opponent. Kasparov finally scored a win, his first ever against Karpov, in game 32—94 days into the match! Karpov failed to deliver the final blow in the 14 more draws that followed, while the chess world closely followed this fascinating struggle between the “two Ks.” And then, a bombshell. No, two. With the sword of Damocles hanging above him for weeks on end, Kasparov suddenly won games 47 and 48. The 32-year-old Karpov was collapsing. On February 16, 1985, a week after that 48th game and five months after the start of the match, the players appeared at a press conference alongside Florencio Campomanes, president of the International Chess Federation. Astonishingly, “Campo” stopped the match without a result and announced that a new one would begin in September. Both Karpov and Kasparov wanted to continue, but the FIDE president stuck to his controversial decision, saying the match had “exhausted the physical if not the psychological resources” of the players. Kasparov and many chess experts suggested that this was mostly true for the reigning champion, but Karpov stepped on the stage and retorted, “The reports of my death are exaggerated. I believe we can and should continue.” Kasparov would later write: Later I became convinced that the decision to stop the match was carried out not so much because of any risk to the champion’s health, but rather in view of his psychological exhaustion, confusion, and fear of continuing. No other way of retaining his title was now apparent: had Karpov also lost a fourth game, the only way to complete the match would have been in accordance with the regulations. And the powers which at that time controlled Soviet sport, including chess, decided not to take the risk. This comment also reveals the political aspect of the rivalry: while the closed and compliant Karpov represented the old power, the brash, open-minded and pro-Western Kasparov represented the demise of the Soviet Union. Within one year, the chess world would discover how much stronger Kasparov had become. For the new match, FIDE returned to a format of 24 games. If the result was 12–12, Karpov would retain his title. On November 9, 1985, Kasparov won with a score of 13–11, becoming the 13th and youngest world champion in history at 22. Kasparov and Karpov played three more matches—in 1986, 1987, and 1990—all closely contested, with Kasparov barely managing to keep his title. Over seven years, the two gladiators had played 144 world championship games, with Kasparov scoring 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws. In 1993, Karpov failed to qualify for a sixth clash with Kasparov as he lost a Candidates match to the English number one Nigel Short. Unsatisfied with the $1.38 million FIDE had raised for their upcoming title match, Kasparov and Short decided to play outside FIDE’s jurisdiction. They raised $2.55 million themselves and played under the newly launched Professional Chess Association (PCA). Kasparov convincingly won their match in London, but the two had disrupted the chess world in a way that would have a lasting impact. FIDE stripped Kasparov of its title and organized a match between the highest-placed players in the world championship cycle. Karpov defeated Jan Timman and won back his FIDE world title, but most fans saw Kasparov as the legitimate world champion. It was the start of a very messy situation in chess, which continued to produce multiple world champions until 2006 (see also Chapter 1 on this). Kasparov defeated Viswanathan Anand in 1995, a match in which one of his seconds (the chess term for coach/trainer/assistant) was Vladimir Kramnik. The young Russian grandmaster put his experience to good use, later dethroning his former boss in 2000. After years of failed attempts to organize a new world championship match, Kasparov retired from competitive chess in March 2005. Only in 2006 was the situation resolved when Kramnik won a “reunification match” against the FIDE world champion, Veselin Topalov. In 2009, the old legends Kasparov and Karpov played an exhibition match in Valencia, Spain. This time, Karpov was no match for his opponent in a series of rapid and blitz games. At the press conference the two legends were critical of FIDE and its handling of the world championship cycle over recent years. When I asked whether it might be an idea for the top players to consider starting a new organization altogether, Kasparov reacted as if stung by a bee, saying, “I have apologized many times for what I did in 1993!” Later, he wrote that creating the PCA was the worst blunder of his chess career. Kasparov has remained active in chess as an occasional trainer of upcoming players, including Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. And he still plays a bit, just not official games at a long time control. Every year, the chess legend can be seen in action in St. Louis, where he participates in exhibition events financed by billionaire Rex Sinquefield. I will never forget when I placed my camera about a meter and a half away from Kasparov’s board during the first round of a St. Louis blitz tournament in 2017, his first official (rated) game since 2005. Playing Sergey Karjakin with the white pieces, he employed the King’s Gambit, an ancient, romantic, and somewhat dubious opening he had never played before in his long career. Witnessing Kasparov grab that pawn in front of his king’s bishop and move it up two squares, it felt special just being there, watching it as a chess fan and filming it for the many fans who could soon watch it on YouTube. The game was an eventful draw (see annotated game on pages 398–99). Part of Kasparov’s incredible legacy springs from his books, in particular his famous My Great Predecessors series, published between 2003 and 2006. Over the course of five volumes, he gives a detailed account of the careers of the first 12 world champions, analyzing their most important games and covering the other strong players of their time. It is an extensive and beautiful account of the history of top-level chess in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and an indispensable part of any serious chess fan’s library. Kasparov also wrote books about his matches with Karpov, as well as three vol-umes focusing on his best games, totaling 12 wonderful works. Most of his time, however, is spent on something else. Soon after his retirement, Kasparov became a political activist and a fierce opponent of Vladimir Putin. In the fall of 2007, he briefly ran for president of Russia but the authorities prevented him from participating in the elections, as they did with many other opposition figures. He was jailed for five days for participating in a protest in November of that year. He moved to New York in 2013 and has not returned to Russia since. His 2015 book Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped wasn’t taken seriously enough by Western policymakers; only when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, did it become clear how accurately Kasparov had predicted the future. Kasparov had an incredible chess career. He won the Chess Oscar, an award based on votes by chess journalists, 11 times. He reached the highest-ever Elo rating of 2851 in 1999, a record that stood for 13 years. He still holds the record for the most months (255!) as the number-one rated player in the world (with Kramnik in shared first place in January 1996). He also has the most consecutive professional tournament victories, finishing first or tied for first in a remarkable 15 individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990. (Once, he quipped that he “lost a tournament,” referring to the fact that he did not finish in first place!) How did Kasparov get to dominate his peers? The answer lies in a combination of immense talent, excellent work ethic, and being raised in a good environment for chess. His matches with Anatoly Karpov brought him to another level. And, as we will learn more about in the second part of the book, as soon as computers became strong enough, Kasparov used them to maximum effect for his preparation. Kasparov’s presence at the board was legendary—in fact, it edged toward terrifying. He famously removed his watch from his wrist and placed it on the table at the start of a game. He would put it back only when he knew he had a winning position, by which point the opponent knew they were toast. The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler, who played Kasparov many times, told me, “A game against Garry would always take out all the energy from me; I would be half-dead the next day. I like Garry, I admire Garry a great deal; Garry is somebody I tried to model my chess life and career on, but the words ‘energy vampire’ kind of enter the conversation there a little bit.” Garry Kasparov, at a business-meets-grandmasters exhibition event in Paris in 2018, looking fierce as ever. The Mozart of Chess While the fifth and final match between Kasparov and Karpov was underway, Magnus Øen Carlsen was born on November 30, 1990, in Husvik, on the edge of Tønsberg, Norway’s oldest city. Magnus has one older and two younger sisters. He has in common with Kasparov that his parents, his mother Sigrun and his father Henrik, both graduated as civil engineers. Henrik, a chess lover, taught Magnus the game before he turned five. His son seemed interested, but it was difficult for him. He returned to it when he was seven due to a desire to beat his older sister, Ellen. The young Magnus could spend hours alone with a chess set, playing games against himself, trying to find combinations, or going through games his father had shown him. Later, playing online became part of the routine as well. Magnus spent thousands of hours playing chess, which Henrik emphasized when I asked him about the mystery behind his son’s talent: “I think the answer is a bit boring: he has practiced these capabilities a lot. Chess was something he delved into and tried to discover, find out about, a mystery that he wanted to understand more about.” Having produced just four grandmasters, Norway wasn’t exactly a chess-minded country. Its youth chess infrastructure was in pretty good shape, though, partly thanks to the efforts of the country’s number-one player. The multitalented Simen Agdestein was a strong chess player, ranked number 16 in the world at his best, and a professional soccer player who made eight appearances for the Norwegian national team as a striker. Agdestein had started a chess department at the Norges Toppi-drettsgymnas (Norwegian College of Elite Sport) just two years before Magnus joined, and soon introduced a trainer for him, the International Master Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen. Weekly training sessions, where Hansen discovered his pupil’s great memory and intuition, quickly bore fruit, helping Magnus increase his rating by a thousand points in a year. In July 2000, four months before his tenth birthday, Magnus played in the Norwegian championship for kids under 11. When speaking about it in a podcast in 2022, he still considered it the most satisfying tournament victory of his career, despite everything he achieved later: “At that point, I realized, you know, I could actually be very good at this.” After finishing primary school Carlsen took a year off in 2003–4, as his parents decided to take the family on a big trip. They rented out the house for a year and hit the road with a secondhand Hyundai H-100 van they named “Kassa.” The route meandered through Central and Southeast Europe and then back home to Bærum, Norway, for Christmas. “The focus was on educating the children and getting to know the world, and chess was something Magnus could do along the way,” Henrik explained. “In practice, we made a route that was consistent with him playing a lot of tournaments, but that was not the focus, really.” The first time I saw Magnus was when the family had just started the second part of their trip. In January 2004, I played in the amateur section in Wijk aan Zee and noticed a 13-year-old Norwegian boy playing in Grandmaster Group C. This was the third-highest tournament of the festival, held on stage just meters away from the main event. The tournament saw his international breakthrough. Magnus started with six wins and two draws, before losing one game—but with three more wins and a draw, he won the group with 10½ out of 13. He scored his first grandmaster norm (a tournament score at GM-level; you need three of those and a rating over 2500 to obtain the title) and was promoted to next year’s B group. Meanwhile, his beautiful win against the Dutch grandmaster Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round was published in chess magazines worldwide. He was a true wonderboy, which would be the title of the first biography written about him, by Agdestein in the same year. The Czech-American grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek compared Magnus to the prodigy of all prodigies. “In January 2004, I called Magnus Carlsen the Mozart of chess for the first time,” Kavalek wrote years later. “It was a spontaneous, last-minute decision to meet a deadline for my column in the Washington Post. The name was picked up immediately and spread around quickly. It was used, misused, overused.” The thing is: many past masters, including Morphy, Spassky, and Fischer, were also compared to Mozart. “How rich the chess world is!” noted the Dutch chess writer Hans Ree. “The music lovers have Mozart, but we have at least 11 of them.” Two months later, in March 2004, a rapid tournament in Reyk-javík witnessed a historic moment for chess as Magnus played against Kasparov for the first time (see annotated game on page 394). The time control was 25 minutes per person plus five seconds per move—the now common Fischer increment. Magnus, who had beaten Anatoly Karpov earlier in the tournament, again played brilliantly. He reached a winning position but spoiled it to draw, which was still a good result that made him a national celebrity as all major Norwegian media reported on it. After losing the second game, Magnus was quoted as saying, “I played like a child.” The next month, in April 2004, that child fulfilled all requirements to become the world’s youngest grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 26 days. At the 2007 tournament in Wijk aan Zee, the first where I worked as a reporter, Carlsen debuted in the highest group. He finished in last place, and the general thought was that this event had come too soon for him. The critics were quickly silenced when he finished in shared second place at another world-class event, Linares, Spain, only a few weeks later. It was a brilliant result for the now 16-year-old Norwegian in a field with seven of the best grandmasters in the world. In September 2009, the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang (VG) broke the news that, in all secrecy, Kasparov was training Carlsen, an arrangement that had started six months earlier and would end in early 2010. The news came out just as Kasparov arrived in Valencia to play his old nemesis Karpov, who had brought several grandmasters to assist him, while Kasparov came only with his wife, his mother, and a companion of hers. When someone doubted this modest entourage, Kasparov countered, “But I just came from a training session with Magnus!” Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, the two best players in the history of the game, first played each other in March 2004 in Reykjavík. Carlsen was thirteen. Carlsen, now 18, was the fourth-ranked player in the world, and the main goal of the training was to bring him to pole position in the coming year. That happened faster than anticipated. A spectacular performance at a tournament in Nanjing, China, where he played at a 3002 rating level (that is, his six wins and four draws at the tournament was equal to the expected score of a player with a theoretical rating of 3002), got him to second place, and then the London Chess Classic in December gave him the last push toward a rating of 2810. That was two points shy of Kasparov’s last published rating, but on January 1, 2010, a month after turning 19, Carlsen was the official world number one. (Fourteen years later, he still is.) In the fall of 2010 fans got to see yet another version of Carlsen: one that started to popularize the game in a broader sense. In a first for the chess world, he became a fashion model, joining the Dutch brand G-Star Raw’s Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn photographed the campaign, and suddenly Magnus could be seen on billboards and fashion magazines in 80 countries. He would also be part of G-Star’s Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole. As the Norwegian writer Arne Danielsen pointed out, it was at this point Magnus Carlsen became a brand, while his fashion activities aligned with the credo of trendwatchers in those days: “Smart is the new sexy.” Carlsen would later embark on further collaborations outside chess, including appearances in The Simpsons and Norway’s Donald Duck comics magazine and in commercials. For several years he was a global ambassador for Unibet; he helped create a special edition shoe for Puma; and in 2013 he took the honorary kickoff in a La Liga game for his favorite club, Real Madrid. In December 2019 he briefly led the official Fantasy Premier League ahead of seven million other players before eventually finishing the season in tenth place. More than any chess player previously, Carlsen has connected with global brands and promoted the game along the way. Three years after becoming the world number one, London was the scene for another special occasion for Carlsen. On December 8, 2012, he broke Garry Kasparov’s 2851 rating record. I filmed him throughout the day and interviewed him in the Hilton London Kensington hotel lobby afterward. “I think that’s pretty cool,” he commented with a smile. “It’s probably the biggest achievement of my career so far because I didn’t think that anyone thought it was going to be broken this soon.” The same interview revealed the kind of honesty about his play that Fischer and Kasparov were known for: “My games haven’t been brilliant. They haven’t been bad, but they haven’t been brilliant either, so it’s just about fighting, I think. And in the end, I believe you always get what you deserve, so to some extent I think I at least deserve this score.” In March 2013, Carlsen participated in what proved simultaneously to be a crucial tournament for his career and one of the most dramatic events in chess history. He was one of the eight participants of the Candidates Tournament, a double round-robin (all eight players faced each other twice) from which the winner would qualify for a world championship match against Viswanathan Anand. A round before the end, Carlsen was in a tie for first place with former world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Carlsen was slightly ahead on number of wins, so only had to match or better Kramnik’s final result. On a final day that couldn’t have been contrived by the best Hollywood scriptwriters, Carlsen and Kramnik both lost their games. As a result, Carlsen won on that tiebreak rule of scoring more wins. “I think a lot of other players would have gone for a draw in the last round or kind of secured the draw,” Carlsen’s father Henrik said. “But he wanted to win the game, to control his own destiny. I was so proud of that.” The Anand–Carlsen world championship started on November 9, 2013, in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chennai, India—a 15-minute drive from Anand’s home. I was among the 150 journalists present (40 from abroad, half of those from Norway), a number I had never seen before at a chess event. “Magnus and I both underestimated the intensity of a match,” Henrik told me. “The thought was, ‘Well, [Magnus] is the best tournament player in the world; he should play like it’s a tournament.’ But when Magnus came to the first game, he was pretty nervous, and before the second game, he was shaking, basically. He was fumbling with his pieces and twice dropped a piece; I had never seen him like that, ever. He was really on the edge. The experience was larger than life in a way, exotic and quite unique.” After four draws, Carlsen was the first to win a game and hit again in the next game. The remainder of the match saw one more win for the challenger and three draws, which in this best-of-12 match was enough for Carlsen to be crowned the 16th World Chess Champion a week before his 23rd birthday. For my news report I used the now iconic photo taken by my Norwegian friend and colleague Tarjei Svensen, who was responsible for Carlsen’s social media at the time. Magnus is standing in the water in a dark suit and white shirt, completely soaked but with two hands victoriously in the air. He had just been thrown into the hotel pool by his sponsors during a victory party with family, friends, former trainers, donors, and fans, including the Norwegian ambassador in India and his wife. Tarjei Svensen’s photograph of Magnus Carlsen, soaking wet but all smiles, as the newly crowned world chess champion who had just been thrown into the hotel pool, November 22, 2013. The next day the new world champion was officially crowned at the closing ceremony, hours after playing basketball with friends, sponsors, and media members. (Embarrassing photos exist of me failing horribly to defend against him.) My publisher insisted on including this picture of me playing basketball with Magnus Carlsen (and Tarjei Svensen, far right), in November 2013 in Chennai. Throughout the match, Carlsen played a lot of soccer and basketball on rest days. He is probably the biggest sports lover among all the top chess players. Since he was small, he has played soccer, tennis, and other ball sports. Skiing is still a favorite pastime when he is in Norway. As a result, he is generally fit, which has helped him in many long games that can take up to seven hours—for example, the crucial sixth game in his world championship match with Ian Nepomniachtchi in Dubai on December 3, 2021, where he won after 136 moves, seven hours, and 46 minutes of play. In late 2023, Carlsen answered the typical sports question concerning what was going through his mind after that marathon game: “I felt good; I was ready to play more! Because that was the key breakthrough, that was the moment I had been waiting for, for the first six games of that match. I remember I was so calm, so focused for the last two and a half hours. I was playing with fairly little time on my clock, but I knew: this is my chance; if I win this game I’m probably winning another world championship, so I knew that was my moment. Afterward I was just so calm, I even told my manager I was ready to go for three more hours.” Back to 2013 and Carlsen’s world championship match against Anand. The chess craze was truly incredible in Norway. The match was covered live on the website of the country’s biggest newspaper VG and on television at prime time. There were close to a million concurrent viewers, while about two and a half million people watched at some point, which is half of Norway’s population. VG declared him “Man of the Year,” and at the national sports gala he clinched the three biggest trophies. The following year Anand won the 2014 Candidates Tournament to qualify for a return match, showing that class is permanent. The Indian legend also lost his second match to Carlsen, in Sochi, Russia. Carlsen played his next two title matches—in 2016 against the Russian Sergey Karjakin and in 2018 against the American Fabiano Caruana—deciding both in the rapid tiebreak after the regular games had ended 6–6. In 2021, he defeated Nepomniachtchi more convincingly, 7½–3½. Meanwhile, he won multiple gold medals at speed chess events, winning the World Blitz Chess Championship seven times and the World Rapid Chess Championship five times. Carlsen holds the longest unbeaten streak in history, going undefeated for 125 classical games between August 2018 and October 2020. His peak classical rating is 2882, which he has reached twice in his career, in May 2014 and August 2019, in two different ways. “Specifically in 2019, I benefited a lot from opening preparation, while in 2013–14, I mostly tried to avoid my opponent’s preparation rather than that being [my] strength,” he said in the summer of 2022. In Chapter 6 we will see how Carlsen changed his approach to the game, becoming stronger also in the opening thanks to remarkable computer developments. Carlsen is a player from the modern era, meaning many of his events have occurred online. He won numerous internet tournaments, first on the platform Chess24, and then, following a merger in 2022, on Chess.com. One of his toughest opponents in very fast online games is the American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, who managed to beat him in the 2022 Speed Chess Championship final (Nakamura is a player we’ll learn more about in Chapter 10). Carlsen took revenge in the 2023 edition but only won narrowly: 13½–12½. In the summer of 2022, Carlsen shocked the chess world by announcing that he wouldn’t be defending his world championship title. “I’m not motivated to play another match. I simply feel that I don’t have a lot to gain,” he said in a Norwegian podcast. Luckily for his many fans, he didn’t retire like Kasparov, or vanish like Fischer. Carlsen is still playing a lot of tournaments, online and offline, and thus far has retained his number-one ranking. His legacy is still being written. Why is Carlsen better than his rivals? Kasparov has said, “Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov, which is very unusual because Fischer’s style was very dynamic, just fighting to the last pawn, just using every resource available. Karpov was very different. He had an unparalleled ability to use every piece with a maximum effect.” Henrik Carlsen suggested that Karpov was closer in style to his son than Fischer, with Magnus taking Karpov’s prowess to the next level: “Fischer had more of Fischer in him than Magnus, but if Karpov had more of Karpov in him than Magnus, I’m not so sure.” Magnus Carlsen during the 2018 Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. I asked the same question, why Carlsen is superior to his rivals, to the Dutch number one, Anish Giri, who’d played Carlsen dozens of times. His answer was insightful: He does what everybody does: a little better here, a little better there. Where he is the best is that he has this insane feel for pattern recognition, which is a subconscious thing, coming from somewhere deep in the trenches of your memory. But you can try to trace it, like, “Where have I seen it?” And then it can be something like: “Ah, it’s actually kind of similar to the Fischer–Taimanov game.” Magnus has the best pattern recognition: the passive, intuitive one where he sees the position, and he knows White is better. His evaluations are spot on, especially for positions that are positional when nothing concrete is there [lacking direct, forcing tactics]. If he has an argument with another top player about a position, I think 29 out of 30 times, he’s right. And then, what is also very impressive is that he will also tell you what it reminds him of right away. So, he knows where the connection comes from. His pattern recognition is not only better, it’s also closer to his consciousness. They are better connected in him. And what impresses me also is the speed of his connections, the consciousness of his subconscious. That he recognizes what it is that he sees so quickly. I think that is talent. Who Is the GOAT? On October 8, 2023, the late Kelvin Kiptum from Kenya set the official world record for marathons at 2:00:35 in Chicago. In 1925, the American Albert Michelsen was the fastest at the Port Chester, New York, marathon with a time of 2:29:01. On February 11, 2024, Pan Zhanle of China swam the 100 meters freestyle in long course (a 50-meter pool) in 46.80 seconds, in Doha. It took the American Johnny Weissmuller 57.4 seconds to finish the same distance in Miami in 1924. In the span of a century, top runners and swimmers have become roughly 20 percent faster. As time progresses, athletes get better and stronger in just about any physical sport, decade after decade. The most famous exception is Bob Beamon, whose long-jump world record of 8.90 meters at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics stood for almost 23 years until it was broken in 1991 by Mike Powell. What Beamon had done was an unbelievable performance, way ahead of his time. New generations of athletes are continuously beating their predecessors because of the progress made in training methods and the accumulated knowledge about nutrition, sleep, and other relevant factors. That also makes it harder, or perhaps nonsensical, to compare contestants from different periods in time. Was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar better than Michael Jordan? Would you prefer to have Shohei Ohtani in your team over Babe Ruth? The times are different; everything is different. Only boxing might be an exception here, where it has been suggested that the greats of the past might be on a par with, or even better than, the greats of today. But what about chess? It would seem that the Elo rating system is the perfect tool for making such comparisons for chess players. We have the numbers to tell us who was the best player, right? Well, there are two problems. For starters, Arpad Elo only introduced his calculations in the 1960s, so we must disregard any great master from before then. A bigger issue stems from the nature of the rating system, which Elo himself pointed out: it doesn’t provide stable numbers of a certain level of play. Instead, it measures the strength of a player as compared with their contemporaries. Regarding our topic, it can only tell us how much someone dominated their peers. As early as 1962, Elo noted that ratings are mere approximates. He compared the calculations to “the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yardstick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind.” In the late 1990s and early 2000s the American statistician Jeff Sonas acknowledged the second problem, but more or less solved the first. Working with his own rating formula, he evaluated the strength of historical tournaments and the performance ratings of players. Based on that, he calculated monthly historical ratings going back to 1843. His main conclusions: Bobby Fischer established the largest gap between the number-one player and the rest of the world, but that lasted only a few months, and then he retired. Emanuel Lasker had the longest reign as world champion (27 years) and was at the top of Sonas’s rating list for most months, but his career included several periods when he hardly played, including during World War I. No, Garry Kasparov was the most dominant player of all time. One of Sonas’s arguments (which refers to his own rating formula, not the official FIDE ratings) is pretty convincing: “For a stretch of 18.5 years, not a single other player even came within ten rating points of Kasparov on any of the monthly lists.” We can now agree that Kasparov beats Fischer in dominance, if only for the longevity that Fischer is missing. But what about Carlsen? We cannot ask Sonas, who stopped looking at this topic after Kasparov’s retirement. Two experts answered the GOAT question more recently, though. At the end of 2020, the grandmasters Jan Gustafsson and Peter Heine Nielsen published their list of the 50 greatest players of all time on Chess24. Their top three: Kasparov, Carlsen, Fischer, in that order. Nielsen said, “There’s just nothing to talk about, it’s as simple as that.” Gustafsson: “The only guy who could match him [Kasparov] is if Magnus has another ten years like the ten years he’s had, then we have something to talk about. That we can do in 2030 when we redo this series.” In 2017, the French researcher Jean-Marc Alliot took a different approach. Instead of going by ratings, he used a chess engine to look at the quality of moves in 26,000 games played by all world champions since Wilhelm Steinitz. His model predicted the results of the games extremely close to actual results, and better than predictions based on Elo scores. Alliot’s list, based on the year when individual players were at their peak, had an interesting number two: 1. Carlsen (best year: 2013); 2. Kramnik (1999); 3. Fischer (1971); 4. Kasparov (2001). In the same year, 2017, Chess.com introduced its Computer Aggregated Precision Score (CAPS), an engine-based tool that evaluates the strength of play for a chess player, or the quality of moves in a chess game. Their top four was similar: 1. Carlsen; 2. Kramnik; 3. Kasparov; 4. Fischer. In August 2023, the American grandmaster Larry Kaufman pointed out that such research needs some tweaking. He noted that players who prioritize not losing and excel in endgames play more draws than those who prioritize winning and excel in attacking, and draws usually show much higher overall quality of moves than decisive games. He did his own research where he excluded draws from the data and limited himself to games that were part of world championship matches and tournaments, Candidates matches or tournaments, and Interzonals. All this didn’t help Kramnik, because Kaufman’s list has Carlsen first, Kasparov second, Fischer third. The conclusion is that of all the players that ever lived, Carlsen has shown the highest objective quality of play. However you want to look at it, and whichever player you prefer, it cannot be denied that the Norwegian superstar has been responsible for the best moves ever played. It’s impossible to say whether he is also the most talented player who ever lived because, like all modern athletes, Carlsen has benefited from greater accumulated knowledge, modern training methods, and the strongest computer engines. (For what it’s worth, Carlsen himself still put Kasparov slightly ahead of him in August 2022, when he said, “Garry generally edges it because of the longevity in the competitive era.”) The “previous GOAT,” Kasparov, was a pioneer when it came to using computers, as we will see in the following chapters. Fischer, however, had to do without machines altogether. In fact, he hardly had any seconds or coaches through most of his career, while his estimated performance rating during his peak period of 1970–72 was over 2800, the level of the absolute top players of today. Just imagine what he could have done in the modern era. John Donaldson believed, “If Bobby Fischer had access to the engines they have now, and ChessBase, and he was exactly the way he was back then, so he would be, like, studying for 12 hours a day, right? I mean, I don’t know, he would come to the tournament, and probably there would be like steam coming from his brain, like fully cooked.” Fischer might not be the objective GOAT by generally accepted criteria, but what he achieved, mostly all by himself, is perhaps still unique, after all—as unique as Bob Beamon was for the long jump. With its 1,500-year history that has left indelible marks on art, literature, and science, chess has established itself as a unique cultural phenomenon. A world without the game of kings is unimaginable. Meanwhile, the kings of the game have left their mark. Fischer, Kasparov, and Carlsen have each played unique roles in shaping the narrative of chess in Western culture. As we will explore in the next two parts of the book, chess eventually became more popular than ever after two giant forces deeply impacted the game—the computer and the internet.",

As we make the 60-kilometer (37-mile) ride from Reykjavík to Selfoss, snow is falling and the road is slippery. Garry Kasparov, however, is determined to continue the drive. The 13th World Chess Champion will be visiting Fischer’s grave, carefully planned on this day, at the small Christian cemetery of Laugardælir church in Selfoss. Dressed appropriately, with dark trousers, a warm black coat, and a dark gray hat to protect him from Iceland’s cold breeze and snow, Kasparov gets out of the car and walks toward the small graveyard, leaving deep footsteps in the thick snow. He takes off his hat and waits respectfully for a moment, at a distance of a few meters, before walking closer to the marble tombstone that says: ROBERT JAMES FISCHER F. 9. MARS 1943 D. 17. JANÚAR 2008 It is a historic moment for chess. The two giants of the game had never met, yet never were they so close. I was honored to be present that day, to witness a unique and touching synergy between two of my biggest heroes. Few players have meant as much for chess as Fischer and Kasparov—until Magnus Carlsen arrived. All three influenced the game’s cultural development enormously, and are also considered the three best players in history. This chapter is about them, what they have in common, and which of them was the Greatest of All Time (GOAT). The Lone American Warrior Robert James Fischer was born in Chicago on March 9, 1943. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was still legally married to a man named Hans Gerhardt Fischer. He was named the father on Bobby’s birth certificate despite never entering the US. Most likely, the real father of the future world champion was the Hungarian mechanical engineer Paul Neményi, who became friendly with Regina in Colorado in 1942 and sent her money regularly after Bobby was born. In any case, Bobby grew up without a father. In 1949, the family moved to Manhattan and a year later to Brooklyn. Soon after Bobby’s sixth birthday, his sister, Joan, bought a $1 plastic chess set at a candy store. It didn’t take long before Bobby beat both her and his mother. After that, he started playing games against himself. In an interview many years later, he quipped, “I usually won.” Bobby soon started frequenting the Brooklyn Chess Club, while a man named Carmine Nigro began to give him lessons at his home on Saturdays. He would also take him to Washington Square Park’s open-air tables in Greenwich Village. Fischer would later say that meeting Nigro was “probably a decisive factor in my going ahead with chess.” Bobby was 12 when he joined the prestigious Manhattan Chess Club, and, about a year later, met with the chess master Jack Collins, who took over the role of trainer/mentor from Nigro. Bobby played thousands of blitz games with many strong players, read the chess books on Collins’s bookshelves, and often stayed for dinner. Bobby was eating, sleeping, and dreaming chess. A young Bobby Fischer, c. 1957. It took a few years before his breakthrough came, but after that his rise to the top was faster than anyone before him. In 1956, he first won a tournament at the Manhattan club and then the US Junior Chess Championship, something that had never been achieved by a 13-year-old. And then, in October of that year, he did something that catapulted his name into fame all over the United States and abroad. At the Rosenwald Memorial, held in the Marshall Chess Club, it was his round-seven game against Donald Byrne that left a deep impression (see annotated game on pages 384–85). With tactical wizardry that included a queen sacrifice, he won in beautiful style. Hans Kmoch, the arbiter at the tournament, called it the “Game of the Century” and wrote, “A stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies.” Some of America’s strongest grandmasters played in the Rosenwald Memorial, and Bobby lost more games than he won. He bridged that gap just 14 months later when he unexpectedly won his first “adult” US championship in 1957–58 without losing a single game, two months before his 15th birthday. Fischer was nothing less than a sensation. With his first-place finish he qualified for the upcoming Interzonal tournament in Portorož, then part of Yugoslavia, in August 1958. It was his first step into the world championship cycle. The top six players at the Interzonal would qualify for the 1959 Candidates Tournament, where the winner would play the world champion. All very nice, but a 15-year-old boy wasn’t going to be among the top six finishers, was he? Well … scoring 12 points from 20 games, Bobby tied for fifth–sixth place and just made it! An incredible achievement about which the Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh wrote, “In Fischer’s play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition, one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess.” Thanks to his result in Portorož, Fischer became the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, six months, and one day—a record that would only be broken three decades later by Judit Polgár. Fischer also became the youngest person to qualify for the Candidates, a record only broken in 2007 by Magnus Carlsen (using a different qualifying system). The 1959 Candidates Tournament in Yugoslavia was too strong for Fischer, but a worthwhile experience. Three years later Fischer again qualified for the Candidates Tournament, held in May 1962 in Curaçao. The now 19-year-old Fischer finished in fourth place among eight participants. After-ward, in an article in Sports Illustrated, he accused the Soviet players of drawing their mutual games quickly, saving energy for their other games, and even helping each other during play. He would remain suspicious of the Russians for the rest of his career. Substantial proof of collusion does not exist, but Viktor Korchnoi, one of the Soviet participants, confirmed Fischer’s suspicions in his 1977 memoir Chess Is My Life. How many times can a player do something unique? Fischer found a new way (and not for the last time) when he played his sixth US championship, the 1963–64 edition, and won all 11 games against top opposition. By now it was clear Fischer was by far the best player in his country, and he made the point rather perspicuously. In tournaments like these, Fischer established his lasting influence on chess as someone who always played to win, even with the black pieces—something we would also see with Kasparov and Carlsen. Since 2009, a $64,000 Fischer Memorial Prize has been at stake for anyone who can sweep the field at America’s national championship, but it hasn’t happened yet. After beating everyone at home, six years later Fischer would start doing the same internationally. The years between 1970 and 1972 bore witness to the most dominant period at the top of the game by a single chess player the world has ever seen—only comparable with how Paul Morphy (1837–84) outclassed the entire European chess community a century earlier. Fischer won several strong tournaments, most importantly the 1970 Interzonal tournament in Palma de Mallorca. He’d failed to qualify for this event by missing the previous US championship, but the Hungarian American Pal Benko stepped aside and let Fischer play instead—a little detail in chess history that had huge consequences. The next stage of the world championship cycle consisted of Candidates matches. Fischer was paired with the Soviet grandmaster Mark Taimanov for a best-of-ten in Vancouver, Canada, and set down an unprecedented 6–0 score. Wow! Below is an eyewitness account from chess editor Daniel Bailey that beautifully describes Fischer’s presence at the board and intense concentration: In the summer of 1971 I went up to Vancouver to see one of the Fischer–Taimanov games. I sat near the front. All I can say is I have never been in the force field of more powerful human concentration. That includes master politicians, superb actors, and consummate concert musicians. Fischer would come on stage from the wings and in three long strides reach the table, sit and start analyzing in one swift seamless motion. Then he’d freeze, his body motionless but his mind no more motionless than a big cat’s riveted on prey. The intensity of his focus bumped up my pulse and blood pressure and made my breath come shallow minute after minute, hour after hour in the dark silence of the hall. I can only imagine what Taimanov must have been feeling from merely across the board. In the next match, held later that year in Denver, Colorado, Fischer defeated the great Dane Bent Larsen, scoring 6–0 again. A whirlwind was ripping through the chess world, following the quickest path to the crown. Winning his last Candidates match 6½–2½ against the former Soviet world champion Tigran Petrosian, Fischer achieved his goal: he would play for the world title. A chess craze started in the US as Fischer became a national hero, appearing on television and in magazines. Among the congratulatory telegrams was one from President Richard Nixon. Set at $250,000 (equivalent to $1.8 million today), the prize fund was higher than all previous world championships combined. Just three years earlier, Boris Spassky had earned $1,400 for winning the championship. The 1972 prize fund was astronomical for its time and, in hindsight, the first proper payout for chess. According to Kasparov, this was Fischer’s biggest legacy: “Fischer—and this is his chief merit—placed chess on a professional footing. He was the first genuine chess pro!” The match started disastrously for the challenger. He lost the first game due to a silly blunder, and then, after a conflict with the organizers about the placement of the TV cameras, Fischer refused to play the second game. In this best-of-24 match, he was 2–0 down. Spassky would have been justified in leaving the battlefield there and then, and was even urged to do so by the Soviet authorities, but he wanted to play. Spassky saved the match, and with that, he determined Fischer’s fate. The third game was played in a back room, away from the cameras, and Fischer scored his first-ever win against Spassky. After this, the players returned to the main stage for the remainder. Fischer won five times in games 4 to 13, some in brilliant style, while Spassky won just one more time. Seven draws followed, and Fischer won the match 12½–8½ to become the 11th World Chess Champion. The mighty Soviet chess machine, which had dominated the game for decades, was defeated by the lone American warrior. Fischer’s sister Joan put it unpolitically: “Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship.” After returning home, Fischer was received by Mayor John Lindsay at New York City Hall. He was the first Western world champion since Dutchman Max Euwe held the title between 1935 and 1937. “I never thought I’d see the day when chess would be all over the front pages here, but confined only to one paragraph in Pravda,” Fischer said in his speech, referring to the Russian newspaper Truth, the official voice of the Soviet Communist Party. By single-handedly defeating the representatives of a Communist country full of chess experts, Fischer instantly became one of the world’s most famous personalities, not just in sports. And, more than anyone before (and perhaps after) him, Fischer popularized the game immensely. Over a million viewers—an incredible number at the time—had tuned in to watch live commentary of the games by the chess teacher Shelby Lyman on the PBS television station Channel 13. One day, a reporter had walked past 21 bars in Manhattan and discovered that 18 of the televisions showed Lyman instead of a New York Mets baseball match that was also underway. The match had been front-page news globally. Chess author and Fischer expert John Donaldson told me, “On the news, there would be Walter Cronkite saying, ‘The war in Vietnam rages on, the stock market is down, oil prices are … ’ and then he’d say: ‘But first we go to Reykjavík!’ ” Fischer once again featured in major newspapers and magazines and on television, appearing on famous show such as The Bob Hope Special, 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and (a third appearance on) The Dick Cavett Show. Richard Nixon again contacted Fischer, this time inviting him to the White House. In subsequent years, chess experienced an international “Fischer Boom.” As sales of chess sets went through the roof, the United States Chess Federation membership doubled in 1972, and similar effects were seen at chess federations worldwide. Fischer meant more to the game than anyone before him. How did Fischer become so good? Talent is obviously part of the equation, while an immense love for the game made him spend most of his time analyzing, playing, and reading chess books and magazines as a child and adolescent. He had ample access to chess literature in New York City, where he found coaches early on. Donaldson wrote in his 2020 book Bobby Fischer and His World: If Bobby had stayed in Mobile, Arizona (35 miles southwest of Phoenix near the Sierra Estrella Mountains), where his family lived for a year (his mother taught school there), it’s almost inconceivable that he would have developed into a world champion. Today, with the internet, databases, computer programs, and tons of chess literature, a player from an isolated area can go far. This was not the case when Bobby was growing up. It was pretty much New York City, or forget it. Fischer’s life would be a true fairytale if the story ended there, but the remainder was altogether different. For starters, he didn’t defend his title: not all of his demands about the format of the match were accepted by FIDE, and he wouldn’t budge. The challenger, Anatoly Karpov, was declared the 12th world champion in 1975 without playing. As the years went by, Fischer lived an increasingly secluded life, and whenever people heard from him, he seemed to display signs of paranoia. He went so far as to suggest that all the Karpov–Kasparov matches were fixed. And then there was the antisemitism. A few hours after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, Fischer called it “wonderful news” on a Philippine radio station, expressing the hope that “the country will be taken over by the military—they’ll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.” It was not altogether new. The Dutch grandmaster Jan Hein Donner wrote about meeting a young Fischer in 1961: “He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of antisemitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.” At the same time, it is known that Fischer had good relations with several Jewish chess players. It might be that, at least when he was still young, he had something against Judaism but not necessarily Jewish people per se. In 1968, he played a tournament in Netanya, Israel, and even visited a kibbutz. There, he told the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree that his former antisemitism was “stupid,” and added, “Besides, I’m half-Jewish myself, so how can I be antisemitic?” But, particularly after his active playing career, Fischer was definitely antisemitic, as he made numerous comments about Jews and denied the Holocaust both publicly and privately. Given that most experts believe Paul Neményi was his father, we now know Fischer had not one, but two Jewish parents. Still, even if his rabid antisemitism only started long after his chess career, his fans are left with an uncomfortable double emotion. We like to remember him as the brilliant chess player that he was—but, at the same time, we cannot ignore his rather unpleasant characteristics. On a more positive note, Fischer’s legacy goes beyond the brilliant results and the many wonderful games he left behind to be studied and admired by students of the game. In the 1990s, Fischer promoted what he called “Fischer Random,” where before the game starts, the pieces are shuffled on the first and eighth rank to avoid opening theory. It is also called “Chess960” (or “Freestyle”), because there are 960 possible starting positions. (As early as 1792, the Dutch chess enthusiast Philip Julius van Zuylen van Nijevelt had a similar idea.) And then there is his chess clock, which he patented in the late 1980s and which became the standard for the chess world. In contrast with older chess clocks, a Fischer time control gives each player a small increment after each completed move, on top of a fixed period at the start of the game. In 1992, Fischer suddenly returned to the chessboard. The shady Yugoslav banker Jezdimir Vasiljević, who would later be convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, had convinced him to play another match with Spassky, exactly 20 years after Reykjavík—and for a prize fund of $5 million. The event occurred in Yugoslavia (partly on Sveti Stefan, an island off the coast of Montenegro, and partly in Belgrade). It was global news, not least because of Fischer’s reaction to the US government’s warning not to play the match as it would violate UN sports sanctions imposed following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Fischer showed the letter to the journalists during a press conference and spat on it. He won the return match 10–5 (with 15 draws) but never returned to the United States, knowing he would be arrested upon arrival. Fischer lived the final years of his life in Iceland, where he died from degenerative kidney failure on January 17, 2008. He was 64 years old—a year for each of the squares on the chessboard. News of his death was released on a Saturday morning—my mother texted me about it while I was in the car on my way to the Wijk aan Zee tournament. I was shocked and felt it in my stomach. At the start of the first round the sad news was announced, and I made a video where I filmed the playing hall with all the top grandmasters and the hundreds of amateurs standing up for a minute of silence, a truly heartbreaking moment. The chess world had lost one of its greatest players. When Kasparov visited Fischer’s grave in 2014, I had the unforgettable opportunity to record a video interview. As I held my Nikon D90 camera, I ensured Fischer’s snow-covered grave and the tombstone were visible in the background. Later, I would edit out my questions and combine Kasparov’s touching words with appropriate background music. Ten years on, the video on YouTube has collected 856,000 views. It might be the one thing I am the proudest of in my career. Kasparov said: I can’t help but think that this is the graveyard also for great, unfulfilled hopes, because so much could be achieved. This is the country where Robert Fischer reached his peak. It was not only his peak, but it was one of the most glorious moments in the history of the game of chess. It could have ended differently. It’s not for us to come up with hypothetical versions of alternative history, but it’s still very sad. It’s as if this graveyard.… We could feel that so many great hopes and expectations have been buried without being realized. It’s all behind us, all the controversies, and what is left is the unique contribution of Robert James Fischer to the game of chess, and I’m here to pay this tribute. The Beast from Baku Garry Kasparov was born Garik Kimovich Weinstein in Baku, Azerbaijan, on April 13, 1963. His Armenian mother, Klara Kasparova, and his Jewish father, Kim Weinstein, were engineers. Garry learned chess from his father at five and beat him a year later. However, like Fischer, he mostly grew up without his father, who sadly died of lymphatic sarcoma at age 39, not long before Garry’s eighth birthday. Four and a half years later, in August 1975, he took his mother’s surname and became Garry Kasparov. His uncle started playing a lot of chess with seven-year-old Garry, and, within three months, he couldn’t beat his nephew any more, so he took him to the Pioneers’ Palace in Baku. In the Soviet Union all big cities had such palaces: institutions designed to engage and educate young people in various extracurricular activities, including sports, arts, cultural programs, and chess. Young Garry’s chess talent was immediately recognized at the Baku Pioneers’ Palace. When he reached the final of the Baku adult blitz championship in June 1972, a newspaper wrote about the nine-year-old, dark-haired boy: “Third-year pupil Garik Weinstein, playing standing up (when sitting he can’t reach all the pieces), achieved the overall best result in the first stage—9 points out of 9.” Even a newspaper in West Germany picked up the story. You could say that in the same summer when Fischer played his last serious chess games, Kasparov entered the arena. In 1973 Kasparov was accepted into the prestigious school of the legendary former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Just a few years later, Kasparov achieved a very high level of play. He became the youngest player ever to win the junior championship of the USSR in 1976, at 13, and then unexpectedly won the 1978 Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk, Belarus, at 14. He scored 3½ points more than was needed to obtain the Soviet master title. He was not an international master yet, as up until that point he had only played in a small number of youth championships abroad. As a chess player (or any sportsman, for that matter), one depended on the whims of the Sports Committee to be allowed to play internationally. The first published photo of Garry Kasparov, at 10 years old already attracting spectators as he defeated grandmaster Yuri Averbakh in 1973 in Moscow. That changed in April 1979, when Kasparov, after helpful talks between Botvinnik and the organizers, was invited to a strong tournament in Banja Luka, in then Yugoslavia. Without holding an international title or rating, Kasparov—again rather unexpectedly—won the 15-round tournament with a two-point margin, ahead of 14 grandmasters. It was a true breakthrough moment in his career. Kasparov’s first official rating, published in January 1980, was a stunning 2595, instantly throwing the 16-year-old schoolboy into the world’s top 20. Only two other players had scored a similar result at that age: Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Even though he was already approaching the world’s top ten, Kasparov decided to participate in the 1981 World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, Germany. He won the tournament—this time surprising no one—with a certain Nigel Short of England taking second place. (The two would play a major role in the chess world 12 years later.) In 1982 Kasparov finally obtained the grandmaster title officially—having demonstrated that level of play for years. In 1983, he defeated three world-class grandmasters (Alexander Beliavsky, Viktor Korchnoi, and Vasily Smyslov) in Candidates matches to become the challenger to the reigning world champion, Anatoly Karpov. The 21-year-old Kasparov, who became the number-one ranked player in the world in January 1984 with a rating of 2710, would prove to be Karpov’s fiercest opponent. Their first match began on September 9, 1984. It started one of the most epic rivalries in sports history, eclipsing contemporary clashes such as Ali versus Frazier, Evert versus Navratilova, or Prost versus Senna. Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov during their 1984 match in Moscow, the longest in the history of the game, lasting five months and 48 games. The winner would be the first to score six wins, with draws not counting. The world championship thus returned to an ancient format (and one that Fischer proposed in 1975), resulting in the longest title match in history. Karpov initially took a 5–0 lead, winning games three, six, seven, and nine (see annotated game on pages 387–88), and, after a string of 17 draws, also game 27. Kasparov, however, refused to throw in the towel. The longer the match progressed, the stronger the player he became, all the while learning from his formidable opponent. Kasparov finally scored a win, his first ever against Karpov, in game 32—94 days into the match! Karpov failed to deliver the final blow in the 14 more draws that followed, while the chess world closely followed this fascinating struggle between the “two Ks.” And then, a bombshell. No, two. With the sword of Damocles hanging above him for weeks on end, Kasparov suddenly won games 47 and 48. The 32-year-old Karpov was collapsing. On February 16, 1985, a week after that 48th game and five months after the start of the match, the players appeared at a press conference alongside Florencio Campomanes, president of the International Chess Federation. Astonishingly, “Campo” stopped the match without a result and announced that a new one would begin in September. Both Karpov and Kasparov wanted to continue, but the FIDE president stuck to his controversial decision, saying the match had “exhausted the physical if not the psychological resources” of the players. Kasparov and many chess experts suggested that this was mostly true for the reigning champion, but Karpov stepped on the stage and retorted, “The reports of my death are exaggerated. I believe we can and should continue.” Kasparov would later write: Later I became convinced that the decision to stop the match was carried out not so much because of any risk to the champion’s health, but rather in view of his psychological exhaustion, confusion, and fear of continuing. No other way of retaining his title was now apparent: had Karpov also lost a fourth game, the only way to complete the match would have been in accordance with the regulations. And the powers which at that time controlled Soviet sport, including chess, decided not to take the risk. This comment also reveals the political aspect of the rivalry: while the closed and compliant Karpov represented the old power, the brash, open-minded and pro-Western Kasparov represented the demise of the Soviet Union. Within one year, the chess world would discover how much stronger Kasparov had become. For the new match, FIDE returned to a format of 24 games. If the result was 12–12, Karpov would retain his title. On November 9, 1985, Kasparov won with a score of 13–11, becoming the 13th and youngest world champion in history at 22. Kasparov and Karpov played three more matches—in 1986, 1987, and 1990—all closely contested, with Kasparov barely managing to keep his title. Over seven years, the two gladiators had played 144 world championship games, with Kasparov scoring 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws. In 1993, Karpov failed to qualify for a sixth clash with Kasparov as he lost a Candidates match to the English number one Nigel Short. Unsatisfied with the $1.38 million FIDE had raised for their upcoming title match, Kasparov and Short decided to play outside FIDE’s jurisdiction. They raised $2.55 million themselves and played under the newly launched Professional Chess Association (PCA). Kasparov convincingly won their match in London, but the two had disrupted the chess world in a way that would have a lasting impact. FIDE stripped Kasparov of its title and organized a match between the highest-placed players in the world championship cycle. Karpov defeated Jan Timman and won back his FIDE world title, but most fans saw Kasparov as the legitimate world champion. It was the start of a very messy situation in chess, which continued to produce multiple world champions until 2006 (see also Chapter 1 on this). Kasparov defeated Viswanathan Anand in 1995, a match in which one of his seconds (the chess term for coach/trainer/assistant) was Vladimir Kramnik. The young Russian grandmaster put his experience to good use, later dethroning his former boss in 2000. After years of failed attempts to organize a new world championship match, Kasparov retired from competitive chess in March 2005. Only in 2006 was the situation resolved when Kramnik won a “reunification match” against the FIDE world champion, Veselin Topalov. In 2009, the old legends Kasparov and Karpov played an exhibition match in Valencia, Spain. This time, Karpov was no match for his opponent in a series of rapid and blitz games. At the press conference the two legends were critical of FIDE and its handling of the world championship cycle over recent years. When I asked whether it might be an idea for the top players to consider starting a new organization altogether, Kasparov reacted as if stung by a bee, saying, “I have apologized many times for what I did in 1993!” Later, he wrote that creating the PCA was the worst blunder of his chess career. Kasparov has remained active in chess as an occasional trainer of upcoming players, including Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. And he still plays a bit, just not official games at a long time control. Every year, the chess legend can be seen in action in St. Louis, where he participates in exhibition events financed by billionaire Rex Sinquefield. I will never forget when I placed my camera about a meter and a half away from Kasparov’s board during the first round of a St. Louis blitz tournament in 2017, his first official (rated) game since 2005. Playing Sergey Karjakin with the white pieces, he employed the King’s Gambit, an ancient, romantic, and somewhat dubious opening he had never played before in his long career. Witnessing Kasparov grab that pawn in front of his king’s bishop and move it up two squares, it felt special just being there, watching it as a chess fan and filming it for the many fans who could soon watch it on YouTube. The game was an eventful draw (see annotated game on pages 398–99). Part of Kasparov’s incredible legacy springs from his books, in particular his famous My Great Predecessors series, published between 2003 and 2006. Over the course of five volumes, he gives a detailed account of the careers of the first 12 world champions, analyzing their most important games and covering the other strong players of their time. It is an extensive and beautiful account of the history of top-level chess in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and an indispensable part of any serious chess fan’s library. Kasparov also wrote books about his matches with Karpov, as well as three vol-umes focusing on his best games, totaling 12 wonderful works. Most of his time, however, is spent on something else. Soon after his retirement, Kasparov became a political activist and a fierce opponent of Vladimir Putin. In the fall of 2007, he briefly ran for president of Russia but the authorities prevented him from participating in the elections, as they did with many other opposition figures. He was jailed for five days for participating in a protest in November of that year. He moved to New York in 2013 and has not returned to Russia since. His 2015 book Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped wasn’t taken seriously enough by Western policymakers; only when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, did it become clear how accurately Kasparov had predicted the future. Kasparov had an incredible chess career. He won the Chess Oscar, an award based on votes by chess journalists, 11 times. He reached the highest-ever Elo rating of 2851 in 1999, a record that stood for 13 years. He still holds the record for the most months (255!) as the number-one rated player in the world (with Kramnik in shared first place in January 1996). He also has the most consecutive professional tournament victories, finishing first or tied for first in a remarkable 15 individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990. (Once, he quipped that he “lost a tournament,” referring to the fact that he did not finish in first place!) How did Kasparov get to dominate his peers? The answer lies in a combination of immense talent, excellent work ethic, and being raised in a good environment for chess. His matches with Anatoly Karpov brought him to another level. And, as we will learn more about in the second part of the book, as soon as computers became strong enough, Kasparov used them to maximum effect for his preparation. Kasparov’s presence at the board was legendary—in fact, it edged toward terrifying. He famously removed his watch from his wrist and placed it on the table at the start of a game. He would put it back only when he knew he had a winning position, by which point the opponent knew they were toast. The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler, who played Kasparov many times, told me, “A game against Garry would always take out all the energy from me; I would be half-dead the next day. I like Garry, I admire Garry a great deal; Garry is somebody I tried to model my chess life and career on, but the words ‘energy vampire’ kind of enter the conversation there a little bit.” Garry Kasparov, at a business-meets-grandmasters exhibition event in Paris in 2018, looking fierce as ever. The Mozart of Chess While the fifth and final match between Kasparov and Karpov was underway, Magnus Øen Carlsen was born on November 30, 1990, in Husvik, on the edge of Tønsberg, Norway’s oldest city. Magnus has one older and two younger sisters. He has in common with Kasparov that his parents, his mother Sigrun and his father Henrik, both graduated as civil engineers. Henrik, a chess lover, taught Magnus the game before he turned five. His son seemed interested, but it was difficult for him. He returned to it when he was seven due to a desire to beat his older sister, Ellen. The young Magnus could spend hours alone with a chess set, playing games against himself, trying to find combinations, or going through games his father had shown him. Later, playing online became part of the routine as well. Magnus spent thousands of hours playing chess, which Henrik emphasized when I asked him about the mystery behind his son’s talent: “I think the answer is a bit boring: he has practiced these capabilities a lot. Chess was something he delved into and tried to discover, find out about, a mystery that he wanted to understand more about.” Having produced just four grandmasters, Norway wasn’t exactly a chess-minded country. Its youth chess infrastructure was in pretty good shape, though, partly thanks to the efforts of the country’s number-one player. The multitalented Simen Agdestein was a strong chess player, ranked number 16 in the world at his best, and a professional soccer player who made eight appearances for the Norwegian national team as a striker. Agdestein had started a chess department at the Norges Toppi-drettsgymnas (Norwegian College of Elite Sport) just two years before Magnus joined, and soon introduced a trainer for him, the International Master Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen. Weekly training sessions, where Hansen discovered his pupil’s great memory and intuition, quickly bore fruit, helping Magnus increase his rating by a thousand points in a year. In July 2000, four months before his tenth birthday, Magnus played in the Norwegian championship for kids under 11. When speaking about it in a podcast in 2022, he still considered it the most satisfying tournament victory of his career, despite everything he achieved later: “At that point, I realized, you know, I could actually be very good at this.” After finishing primary school Carlsen took a year off in 2003–4, as his parents decided to take the family on a big trip. They rented out the house for a year and hit the road with a secondhand Hyundai H-100 van they named “Kassa.” The route meandered through Central and Southeast Europe and then back home to Bærum, Norway, for Christmas. “The focus was on educating the children and getting to know the world, and chess was something Magnus could do along the way,” Henrik explained. “In practice, we made a route that was consistent with him playing a lot of tournaments, but that was not the focus, really.” The first time I saw Magnus was when the family had just started the second part of their trip. In January 2004, I played in the amateur section in Wijk aan Zee and noticed a 13-year-old Norwegian boy playing in Grandmaster Group C. This was the third-highest tournament of the festival, held on stage just meters away from the main event. The tournament saw his international breakthrough. Magnus started with six wins and two draws, before losing one game—but with three more wins and a draw, he won the group with 10½ out of 13. He scored his first grandmaster norm (a tournament score at GM-level; you need three of those and a rating over 2500 to obtain the title) and was promoted to next year’s B group. Meanwhile, his beautiful win against the Dutch grandmaster Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round was published in chess magazines worldwide. He was a true wonderboy, which would be the title of the first biography written about him, by Agdestein in the same year. The Czech-American grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek compared Magnus to the prodigy of all prodigies. “In January 2004, I called Magnus Carlsen the Mozart of chess for the first time,” Kavalek wrote years later. “It was a spontaneous, last-minute decision to meet a deadline for my column in the Washington Post. The name was picked up immediately and spread around quickly. It was used, misused, overused.” The thing is: many past masters, including Morphy, Spassky, and Fischer, were also compared to Mozart. “How rich the chess world is!” noted the Dutch chess writer Hans Ree. “The music lovers have Mozart, but we have at least 11 of them.” Two months later, in March 2004, a rapid tournament in Reyk-javík witnessed a historic moment for chess as Magnus played against Kasparov for the first time (see annotated game on page 394). The time control was 25 minutes per person plus five seconds per move—the now common Fischer increment. Magnus, who had beaten Anatoly Karpov earlier in the tournament, again played brilliantly. He reached a winning position but spoiled it to draw, which was still a good result that made him a national celebrity as all major Norwegian media reported on it. After losing the second game, Magnus was quoted as saying, “I played like a child.” The next month, in April 2004, that child fulfilled all requirements to become the world’s youngest grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 26 days. At the 2007 tournament in Wijk aan Zee, the first where I worked as a reporter, Carlsen debuted in the highest group. He finished in last place, and the general thought was that this event had come too soon for him. The critics were quickly silenced when he finished in shared second place at another world-class event, Linares, Spain, only a few weeks later. It was a brilliant result for the now 16-year-old Norwegian in a field with seven of the best grandmasters in the world. In September 2009, the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang (VG) broke the news that, in all secrecy, Kasparov was training Carlsen, an arrangement that had started six months earlier and would end in early 2010. The news came out just as Kasparov arrived in Valencia to play his old nemesis Karpov, who had brought several grandmasters to assist him, while Kasparov came only with his wife, his mother, and a companion of hers. When someone doubted this modest entourage, Kasparov countered, “But I just came from a training session with Magnus!” Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, the two best players in the history of the game, first played each other in March 2004 in Reykjavík. Carlsen was thirteen. Carlsen, now 18, was the fourth-ranked player in the world, and the main goal of the training was to bring him to pole position in the coming year. That happened faster than anticipated. A spectacular performance at a tournament in Nanjing, China, where he played at a 3002 rating level (that is, his six wins and four draws at the tournament was equal to the expected score of a player with a theoretical rating of 3002), got him to second place, and then the London Chess Classic in December gave him the last push toward a rating of 2810. That was two points shy of Kasparov’s last published rating, but on January 1, 2010, a month after turning 19, Carlsen was the official world number one. (Fourteen years later, he still is.) In the fall of 2010 fans got to see yet another version of Carlsen: one that started to popularize the game in a broader sense. In a first for the chess world, he became a fashion model, joining the Dutch brand G-Star Raw’s Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn photographed the campaign, and suddenly Magnus could be seen on billboards and fashion magazines in 80 countries. He would also be part of G-Star’s Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole. As the Norwegian writer Arne Danielsen pointed out, it was at this point Magnus Carlsen became a brand, while his fashion activities aligned with the credo of trendwatchers in those days: “Smart is the new sexy.” Carlsen would later embark on further collaborations outside chess, including appearances in The Simpsons and Norway’s Donald Duck comics magazine and in commercials. For several years he was a global ambassador for Unibet; he helped create a special edition shoe for Puma; and in 2013 he took the honorary kickoff in a La Liga game for his favorite club, Real Madrid. In December 2019 he briefly led the official Fantasy Premier League ahead of seven million other players before eventually finishing the season in tenth place. More than any chess player previously, Carlsen has connected with global brands and promoted the game along the way. Three years after becoming the world number one, London was the scene for another special occasion for Carlsen. On December 8, 2012, he broke Garry Kasparov’s 2851 rating record. I filmed him throughout the day and interviewed him in the Hilton London Kensington hotel lobby afterward. “I think that’s pretty cool,” he commented with a smile. “It’s probably the biggest achievement of my career so far because I didn’t think that anyone thought it was going to be broken this soon.” The same interview revealed the kind of honesty about his play that Fischer and Kasparov were known for: “My games haven’t been brilliant. They haven’t been bad, but they haven’t been brilliant either, so it’s just about fighting, I think. And in the end, I believe you always get what you deserve, so to some extent I think I at least deserve this score.” In March 2013, Carlsen participated in what proved simultaneously to be a crucial tournament for his career and one of the most dramatic events in chess history. He was one of the eight participants of the Candidates Tournament, a double round-robin (all eight players faced each other twice) from which the winner would qualify for a world championship match against Viswanathan Anand. A round before the end, Carlsen was in a tie for first place with former world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Carlsen was slightly ahead on number of wins, so only had to match or better Kramnik’s final result. On a final day that couldn’t have been contrived by the best Hollywood scriptwriters, Carlsen and Kramnik both lost their games. As a result, Carlsen won on that tiebreak rule of scoring more wins. “I think a lot of other players would have gone for a draw in the last round or kind of secured the draw,” Carlsen’s father Henrik said. “But he wanted to win the game, to control his own destiny. I was so proud of that.” The Anand–Carlsen world championship started on November 9, 2013, in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chennai, India—a 15-minute drive from Anand’s home. I was among the 150 journalists present (40 from abroad, half of those from Norway), a number I had never seen before at a chess event. “Magnus and I both underestimated the intensity of a match,” Henrik told me. “The thought was, ‘Well, [Magnus] is the best tournament player in the world; he should play like it’s a tournament.’ But when Magnus came to the first game, he was pretty nervous, and before the second game, he was shaking, basically. He was fumbling with his pieces and twice dropped a piece; I had never seen him like that, ever. He was really on the edge. The experience was larger than life in a way, exotic and quite unique.” After four draws, Carlsen was the first to win a game and hit again in the next game. The remainder of the match saw one more win for the challenger and three draws, which in this best-of-12 match was enough for Carlsen to be crowned the 16th World Chess Champion a week before his 23rd birthday. For my news report I used the now iconic photo taken by my Norwegian friend and colleague Tarjei Svensen, who was responsible for Carlsen’s social media at the time. Magnus is standing in the water in a dark suit and white shirt, completely soaked but with two hands victoriously in the air. He had just been thrown into the hotel pool by his sponsors during a victory party with family, friends, former trainers, donors, and fans, including the Norwegian ambassador in India and his wife. Tarjei Svensen’s photograph of Magnus Carlsen, soaking wet but all smiles, as the newly crowned world chess champion who had just been thrown into the hotel pool, November 22, 2013. The next day the new world champion was officially crowned at the closing ceremony, hours after playing basketball with friends, sponsors, and media members. (Embarrassing photos exist of me failing horribly to defend against him.) My publisher insisted on including this picture of me playing basketball with Magnus Carlsen (and Tarjei Svensen, far right), in November 2013 in Chennai. Throughout the match, Carlsen played a lot of soccer and basketball on rest days. He is probably the biggest sports lover among all the top chess players. Since he was small, he has played soccer, tennis, and other ball sports. Skiing is still a favorite pastime when he is in Norway. As a result, he is generally fit, which has helped him in many long games that can take up to seven hours—for example, the crucial sixth game in his world championship match with Ian Nepomniachtchi in Dubai on December 3, 2021, where he won after 136 moves, seven hours, and 46 minutes of play. In late 2023, Carlsen answered the typical sports question concerning what was going through his mind after that marathon game: “I felt good; I was ready to play more! Because that was the key breakthrough, that was the moment I had been waiting for, for the first six games of that match. I remember I was so calm, so focused for the last two and a half hours. I was playing with fairly little time on my clock, but I knew: this is my chance; if I win this game I’m probably winning another world championship, so I knew that was my moment. Afterward I was just so calm, I even told my manager I was ready to go for three more hours.” Back to 2013 and Carlsen’s world championship match against Anand. The chess craze was truly incredible in Norway. The match was covered live on the website of the country’s biggest newspaper VG and on television at prime time. There were close to a million concurrent viewers, while about two and a half million people watched at some point, which is half of Norway’s population. VG declared him “Man of the Year,” and at the national sports gala he clinched the three biggest trophies. The following year Anand won the 2014 Candidates Tournament to qualify for a return match, showing that class is permanent. The Indian legend also lost his second match to Carlsen, in Sochi, Russia. Carlsen played his next two title matches—in 2016 against the Russian Sergey Karjakin and in 2018 against the American Fabiano Caruana—deciding both in the rapid tiebreak after the regular games had ended 6–6. In 2021, he defeated Nepomniachtchi more convincingly, 7½–3½. Meanwhile, he won multiple gold medals at speed chess events, winning the World Blitz Chess Championship seven times and the World Rapid Chess Championship five times. Carlsen holds the longest unbeaten streak in history, going undefeated for 125 classical games between August 2018 and October 2020. His peak classical rating is 2882, which he has reached twice in his career, in May 2014 and August 2019, in two different ways. “Specifically in 2019, I benefited a lot from opening preparation, while in 2013–14, I mostly tried to avoid my opponent’s preparation rather than that being [my] strength,” he said in the summer of 2022. In Chapter 6 we will see how Carlsen changed his approach to the game, becoming stronger also in the opening thanks to remarkable computer developments. Carlsen is a player from the modern era, meaning many of his events have occurred online. He won numerous internet tournaments, first on the platform Chess24, and then, following a merger in 2022, on Chess.com. One of his toughest opponents in very fast online games is the American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, who managed to beat him in the 2022 Speed Chess Championship final (Nakamura is a player we’ll learn more about in Chapter 10). Carlsen took revenge in the 2023 edition but only won narrowly: 13½–12½. In the summer of 2022, Carlsen shocked the chess world by announcing that he wouldn’t be defending his world championship title. “I’m not motivated to play another match. I simply feel that I don’t have a lot to gain,” he said in a Norwegian podcast. Luckily for his many fans, he didn’t retire like Kasparov, or vanish like Fischer. Carlsen is still playing a lot of tournaments, online and offline, and thus far has retained his number-one ranking. His legacy is still being written. Why is Carlsen better than his rivals? Kasparov has said, “Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov, which is very unusual because Fischer’s style was very dynamic, just fighting to the last pawn, just using every resource available. Karpov was very different. He had an unparalleled ability to use every piece with a maximum effect.” Henrik Carlsen suggested that Karpov was closer in style to his son than Fischer, with Magnus taking Karpov’s prowess to the next level: “Fischer had more of Fischer in him than Magnus, but if Karpov had more of Karpov in him than Magnus, I’m not so sure.” Magnus Carlsen during the 2018 Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. I asked the same question, why Carlsen is superior to his rivals, to the Dutch number one, Anish Giri, who’d played Carlsen dozens of times. His answer was insightful: He does what everybody does: a little better here, a little better there. Where he is the best is that he has this insane feel for pattern recognition, which is a subconscious thing, coming from somewhere deep in the trenches of your memory. But you can try to trace it, like, “Where have I seen it?” And then it can be something like: “Ah, it’s actually kind of similar to the Fischer–Taimanov game.” Magnus has the best pattern recognition: the passive, intuitive one where he sees the position, and he knows White is better. His evaluations are spot on, especially for positions that are positional when nothing concrete is there [lacking direct, forcing tactics]. If he has an argument with another top player about a position, I think 29 out of 30 times, he’s right. And then, what is also very impressive is that he will also tell you what it reminds him of right away. So, he knows where the connection comes from. His pattern recognition is not only better, it’s also closer to his consciousness. They are better connected in him. And what impresses me also is the speed of his connections, the consciousness of his subconscious. That he recognizes what it is that he sees so quickly. I think that is talent. Who Is the GOAT? On October 8, 2023, the late Kelvin Kiptum from Kenya set the official world record for marathons at 2:00:35 in Chicago. In 1925, the American Albert Michelsen was the fastest at the Port Chester, New York, marathon with a time of 2:29:01. On February 11, 2024, Pan Zhanle of China swam the 100 meters freestyle in long course (a 50-meter pool) in 46.80 seconds, in Doha. It took the American Johnny Weissmuller 57.4 seconds to finish the same distance in Miami in 1924. In the span of a century, top runners and swimmers have become roughly 20 percent faster. As time progresses, athletes get better and stronger in just about any physical sport, decade after decade. The most famous exception is Bob Beamon, whose long-jump world record of 8.90 meters at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics stood for almost 23 years until it was broken in 1991 by Mike Powell. What Beamon had done was an unbelievable performance, way ahead of his time. New generations of athletes are continuously beating their predecessors because of the progress made in training methods and the accumulated knowledge about nutrition, sleep, and other relevant factors. That also makes it harder, or perhaps nonsensical, to compare contestants from different periods in time. Was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar better than Michael Jordan? Would you prefer to have Shohei Ohtani in your team over Babe Ruth? The times are different; everything is different. Only boxing might be an exception here, where it has been suggested that the greats of the past might be on a par with, or even better than, the greats of today. But what about chess? It would seem that the Elo rating system is the perfect tool for making such comparisons for chess players. We have the numbers to tell us who was the best player, right? Well, there are two problems. For starters, Arpad Elo only introduced his calculations in the 1960s, so we must disregard any great master from before then. A bigger issue stems from the nature of the rating system, which Elo himself pointed out: it doesn’t provide stable numbers of a certain level of play. Instead, it measures the strength of a player as compared with their contemporaries. Regarding our topic, it can only tell us how much someone dominated their peers. As early as 1962, Elo noted that ratings are mere approximates. He compared the calculations to “the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yardstick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind.” In the late 1990s and early 2000s the American statistician Jeff Sonas acknowledged the second problem, but more or less solved the first. Working with his own rating formula, he evaluated the strength of historical tournaments and the performance ratings of players. Based on that, he calculated monthly historical ratings going back to 1843. His main conclusions: Bobby Fischer established the largest gap between the number-one player and the rest of the world, but that lasted only a few months, and then he retired. Emanuel Lasker had the longest reign as world champion (27 years) and was at the top of Sonas’s rating list for most months, but his career included several periods when he hardly played, including during World War I. No, Garry Kasparov was the most dominant player of all time. One of Sonas’s arguments (which refers to his own rating formula, not the official FIDE ratings) is pretty convincing: “For a stretch of 18.5 years, not a single other player even came within ten rating points of Kasparov on any of the monthly lists.” We can now agree that Kasparov beats Fischer in dominance, if only for the longevity that Fischer is missing. But what about Carlsen? We cannot ask Sonas, who stopped looking at this topic after Kasparov’s retirement. Two experts answered the GOAT question more recently, though. At the end of 2020, the grandmasters Jan Gustafsson and Peter Heine Nielsen published their list of the 50 greatest players of all time on Chess24. Their top three: Kasparov, Carlsen, Fischer, in that order. Nielsen said, “There’s just nothing to talk about, it’s as simple as that.” Gustafsson: “The only guy who could match him [Kasparov] is if Magnus has another ten years like the ten years he’s had, then we have something to talk about. That we can do in 2030 when we redo this series.” In 2017, the French researcher Jean-Marc Alliot took a different approach. Instead of going by ratings, he used a chess engine to look at the quality of moves in 26,000 games played by all world champions since Wilhelm Steinitz. His model predicted the results of the games extremely close to actual results, and better than predictions based on Elo scores. Alliot’s list, based on the year when individual players were at their peak, had an interesting number two: 1. Carlsen (best year: 2013); 2. Kramnik (1999); 3. Fischer (1971); 4. Kasparov (2001). In the same year, 2017, Chess.com introduced its Computer Aggregated Precision Score (CAPS), an engine-based tool that evaluates the strength of play for a chess player, or the quality of moves in a chess game. Their top four was similar: 1. Carlsen; 2. Kramnik; 3. Kasparov; 4. Fischer. In August 2023, the American grandmaster Larry Kaufman pointed out that such research needs some tweaking. He noted that players who prioritize not losing and excel in endgames play more draws than those who prioritize winning and excel in attacking, and draws usually show much higher overall quality of moves than decisive games. He did his own research where he excluded draws from the data and limited himself to games that were part of world championship matches and tournaments, Candidates matches or tournaments, and Interzonals. All this didn’t help Kramnik, because Kaufman’s list has Carlsen first, Kasparov second, Fischer third. The conclusion is that of all the players that ever lived, Carlsen has shown the highest objective quality of play. However you want to look at it, and whichever player you prefer, it cannot be denied that the Norwegian superstar has been responsible for the best moves ever played. It’s impossible to say whether he is also the most talented player who ever lived because, like all modern athletes, Carlsen has benefited from greater accumulated knowledge, modern training methods, and the strongest computer engines. (For what it’s worth, Carlsen himself still put Kasparov slightly ahead of him in August 2022, when he said, “Garry generally edges it because of the longevity in the competitive era.”) The “previous GOAT,” Kasparov, was a pioneer when it came to using computers, as we will see in the following chapters. Fischer, however, had to do without machines altogether. In fact, he hardly had any seconds or coaches through most of his career, while his estimated performance rating during his peak period of 1970–72 was over 2800, the level of the absolute top players of today. Just imagine what he could have done in the modern era. John Donaldson believed, “If Bobby Fischer had access to the engines they have now, and ChessBase, and he was exactly the way he was back then, so he would be, like, studying for 12 hours a day, right? I mean, I don’t know, he would come to the tournament, and probably there would be like steam coming from his brain, like fully cooked.” Fischer might not be the objective GOAT by generally accepted criteria, but what he achieved, mostly all by himself, is perhaps still unique, after all—as unique as Bob Beamon was for the long jump. With its 1,500-year history that has left indelible marks on art, literature, and science, chess has established itself as a unique cultural phenomenon. A world without the game of kings is unimaginable. Meanwhile, the kings of the game have left their mark. Fischer, Kasparov, and Carlsen have each played unique roles in shaping the narrative of chess in Western culture. As we will explore in the next two parts of the book, chess eventually became more popular than ever after two giant forces deeply impacted the game—the computer and the internet.",

As we make the 60-kilometer (37-mile) ride from Reykjavík to Selfoss, snow is falling and the road is slippery. Garry Kasparov, however, is determined to continue the drive. The 13th World Chess Champion will be visiting Fischer’s grave, carefully planned on this day, at the small Christian cemetery of Laugardælir church in Selfoss. Dressed appropriately, with dark trousers, a warm black coat, and a dark gray hat to protect him from Iceland’s cold breeze and snow, Kasparov gets out of the car and walks toward the small graveyard, leaving deep footsteps in the thick snow. He takes off his hat and waits respectfully for a moment, at a distance of a few meters, before walking closer to the marble tombstone that says: ROBERT JAMES FISCHER F. 9. MARS 1943 D. 17. JANÚAR 2008 It is a historic moment for chess. The two giants of the game had never met, yet never were they so close. I was honored to be present that day, to witness a unique and touching synergy between two of my biggest heroes. Few players have meant as much for chess as Fischer and Kasparov—until Magnus Carlsen arrived. All three influenced the game’s cultural development enormously, and are also considered the three best players in history. This chapter is about them, what they have in common, and which of them was the Greatest of All Time (GOAT). The Lone American Warrior Robert James Fischer was born in Chicago on March 9, 1943. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was still legally married to a man named Hans Gerhardt Fischer. He was named the father on Bobby’s birth certificate despite never entering the US. Most likely, the real father of the future world champion was the Hungarian mechanical engineer Paul Neményi, who became friendly with Regina in Colorado in 1942 and sent her money regularly after Bobby was born. In any case, Bobby grew up without a father. In 1949, the family moved to Manhattan and a year later to Brooklyn. Soon after Bobby’s sixth birthday, his sister, Joan, bought a $1 plastic chess set at a candy store. It didn’t take long before Bobby beat both her and his mother. After that, he started playing games against himself. In an interview many years later, he quipped, “I usually won.” Bobby soon started frequenting the Brooklyn Chess Club, while a man named Carmine Nigro began to give him lessons at his home on Saturdays. He would also take him to Washington Square Park’s open-air tables in Greenwich Village. Fischer would later say that meeting Nigro was “probably a decisive factor in my going ahead with chess.” Bobby was 12 when he joined the prestigious Manhattan Chess Club, and, about a year later, met with the chess master Jack Collins, who took over the role of trainer/mentor from Nigro. Bobby played thousands of blitz games with many strong players, read the chess books on Collins’s bookshelves, and often stayed for dinner. Bobby was eating, sleeping, and dreaming chess. A young Bobby Fischer, c. 1957. It took a few years before his breakthrough came, but after that his rise to the top was faster than anyone before him. In 1956, he first won a tournament at the Manhattan club and then the US Junior Chess Championship, something that had never been achieved by a 13-year-old. And then, in October of that year, he did something that catapulted his name into fame all over the United States and abroad. At the Rosenwald Memorial, held in the Marshall Chess Club, it was his round-seven game against Donald Byrne that left a deep impression (see annotated game on pages 384–85). With tactical wizardry that included a queen sacrifice, he won in beautiful style. Hans Kmoch, the arbiter at the tournament, called it the “Game of the Century” and wrote, “A stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies.” Some of America’s strongest grandmasters played in the Rosenwald Memorial, and Bobby lost more games than he won. He bridged that gap just 14 months later when he unexpectedly won his first “adult” US championship in 1957–58 without losing a single game, two months before his 15th birthday. Fischer was nothing less than a sensation. With his first-place finish he qualified for the upcoming Interzonal tournament in Portorož, then part of Yugoslavia, in August 1958. It was his first step into the world championship cycle. The top six players at the Interzonal would qualify for the 1959 Candidates Tournament, where the winner would play the world champion. All very nice, but a 15-year-old boy wasn’t going to be among the top six finishers, was he? Well … scoring 12 points from 20 games, Bobby tied for fifth–sixth place and just made it! An incredible achievement about which the Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh wrote, “In Fischer’s play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition, one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess.” Thanks to his result in Portorož, Fischer became the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, six months, and one day—a record that would only be broken three decades later by Judit Polgár. Fischer also became the youngest person to qualify for the Candidates, a record only broken in 2007 by Magnus Carlsen (using a different qualifying system). The 1959 Candidates Tournament in Yugoslavia was too strong for Fischer, but a worthwhile experience. Three years later Fischer again qualified for the Candidates Tournament, held in May 1962 in Curaçao. The now 19-year-old Fischer finished in fourth place among eight participants. After-ward, in an article in Sports Illustrated, he accused the Soviet players of drawing their mutual games quickly, saving energy for their other games, and even helping each other during play. He would remain suspicious of the Russians for the rest of his career. Substantial proof of collusion does not exist, but Viktor Korchnoi, one of the Soviet participants, confirmed Fischer’s suspicions in his 1977 memoir Chess Is My Life. How many times can a player do something unique? Fischer found a new way (and not for the last time) when he played his sixth US championship, the 1963–64 edition, and won all 11 games against top opposition. By now it was clear Fischer was by far the best player in his country, and he made the point rather perspicuously. In tournaments like these, Fischer established his lasting influence on chess as someone who always played to win, even with the black pieces—something we would also see with Kasparov and Carlsen. Since 2009, a $64,000 Fischer Memorial Prize has been at stake for anyone who can sweep the field at America’s national championship, but it hasn’t happened yet. After beating everyone at home, six years later Fischer would start doing the same internationally. The years between 1970 and 1972 bore witness to the most dominant period at the top of the game by a single chess player the world has ever seen—only comparable with how Paul Morphy (1837–84) outclassed the entire European chess community a century earlier. Fischer won several strong tournaments, most importantly the 1970 Interzonal tournament in Palma de Mallorca. He’d failed to qualify for this event by missing the previous US championship, but the Hungarian American Pal Benko stepped aside and let Fischer play instead—a little detail in chess history that had huge consequences. The next stage of the world championship cycle consisted of Candidates matches. Fischer was paired with the Soviet grandmaster Mark Taimanov for a best-of-ten in Vancouver, Canada, and set down an unprecedented 6–0 score. Wow! Below is an eyewitness account from chess editor Daniel Bailey that beautifully describes Fischer’s presence at the board and intense concentration: In the summer of 1971 I went up to Vancouver to see one of the Fischer–Taimanov games. I sat near the front. All I can say is I have never been in the force field of more powerful human concentration. That includes master politicians, superb actors, and consummate concert musicians. Fischer would come on stage from the wings and in three long strides reach the table, sit and start analyzing in one swift seamless motion. Then he’d freeze, his body motionless but his mind no more motionless than a big cat’s riveted on prey. The intensity of his focus bumped up my pulse and blood pressure and made my breath come shallow minute after minute, hour after hour in the dark silence of the hall. I can only imagine what Taimanov must have been feeling from merely across the board. In the next match, held later that year in Denver, Colorado, Fischer defeated the great Dane Bent Larsen, scoring 6–0 again. A whirlwind was ripping through the chess world, following the quickest path to the crown. Winning his last Candidates match 6½–2½ against the former Soviet world champion Tigran Petrosian, Fischer achieved his goal: he would play for the world title. A chess craze started in the US as Fischer became a national hero, appearing on television and in magazines. Among the congratulatory telegrams was one from President Richard Nixon. Set at $250,000 (equivalent to $1.8 million today), the prize fund was higher than all previous world championships combined. Just three years earlier, Boris Spassky had earned $1,400 for winning the championship. The 1972 prize fund was astronomical for its time and, in hindsight, the first proper payout for chess. According to Kasparov, this was Fischer’s biggest legacy: “Fischer—and this is his chief merit—placed chess on a professional footing. He was the first genuine chess pro!” The match started disastrously for the challenger. He lost the first game due to a silly blunder, and then, after a conflict with the organizers about the placement of the TV cameras, Fischer refused to play the second game. In this best-of-24 match, he was 2–0 down. Spassky would have been justified in leaving the battlefield there and then, and was even urged to do so by the Soviet authorities, but he wanted to play. Spassky saved the match, and with that, he determined Fischer’s fate. The third game was played in a back room, away from the cameras, and Fischer scored his first-ever win against Spassky. After this, the players returned to the main stage for the remainder. Fischer won five times in games 4 to 13, some in brilliant style, while Spassky won just one more time. Seven draws followed, and Fischer won the match 12½–8½ to become the 11th World Chess Champion. The mighty Soviet chess machine, which had dominated the game for decades, was defeated by the lone American warrior. Fischer’s sister Joan put it unpolitically: “Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship.” After returning home, Fischer was received by Mayor John Lindsay at New York City Hall. He was the first Western world champion since Dutchman Max Euwe held the title between 1935 and 1937. “I never thought I’d see the day when chess would be all over the front pages here, but confined only to one paragraph in Pravda,” Fischer said in his speech, referring to the Russian newspaper Truth, the official voice of the Soviet Communist Party. By single-handedly defeating the representatives of a Communist country full of chess experts, Fischer instantly became one of the world’s most famous personalities, not just in sports. And, more than anyone before (and perhaps after) him, Fischer popularized the game immensely. Over a million viewers—an incredible number at the time—had tuned in to watch live commentary of the games by the chess teacher Shelby Lyman on the PBS television station Channel 13. One day, a reporter had walked past 21 bars in Manhattan and discovered that 18 of the televisions showed Lyman instead of a New York Mets baseball match that was also underway. The match had been front-page news globally. Chess author and Fischer expert John Donaldson told me, “On the news, there would be Walter Cronkite saying, ‘The war in Vietnam rages on, the stock market is down, oil prices are … ’ and then he’d say: ‘But first we go to Reykjavík!’ ” Fischer once again featured in major newspapers and magazines and on television, appearing on famous show such as The Bob Hope Special, 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and (a third appearance on) The Dick Cavett Show. Richard Nixon again contacted Fischer, this time inviting him to the White House. In subsequent years, chess experienced an international “Fischer Boom.” As sales of chess sets went through the roof, the United States Chess Federation membership doubled in 1972, and similar effects were seen at chess federations worldwide. Fischer meant more to the game than anyone before him. How did Fischer become so good? Talent is obviously part of the equation, while an immense love for the game made him spend most of his time analyzing, playing, and reading chess books and magazines as a child and adolescent. He had ample access to chess literature in New York City, where he found coaches early on. Donaldson wrote in his 2020 book Bobby Fischer and His World: If Bobby had stayed in Mobile, Arizona (35 miles southwest of Phoenix near the Sierra Estrella Mountains), where his family lived for a year (his mother taught school there), it’s almost inconceivable that he would have developed into a world champion. Today, with the internet, databases, computer programs, and tons of chess literature, a player from an isolated area can go far. This was not the case when Bobby was growing up. It was pretty much New York City, or forget it. Fischer’s life would be a true fairytale if the story ended there, but the remainder was altogether different. For starters, he didn’t defend his title: not all of his demands about the format of the match were accepted by FIDE, and he wouldn’t budge. The challenger, Anatoly Karpov, was declared the 12th world champion in 1975 without playing. As the years went by, Fischer lived an increasingly secluded life, and whenever people heard from him, he seemed to display signs of paranoia. He went so far as to suggest that all the Karpov–Kasparov matches were fixed. And then there was the antisemitism. A few hours after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, Fischer called it “wonderful news” on a Philippine radio station, expressing the hope that “the country will be taken over by the military—they’ll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.” It was not altogether new. The Dutch grandmaster Jan Hein Donner wrote about meeting a young Fischer in 1961: “He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of antisemitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.” At the same time, it is known that Fischer had good relations with several Jewish chess players. It might be that, at least when he was still young, he had something against Judaism but not necessarily Jewish people per se. In 1968, he played a tournament in Netanya, Israel, and even visited a kibbutz. There, he told the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree that his former antisemitism was “stupid,” and added, “Besides, I’m half-Jewish myself, so how can I be antisemitic?” But, particularly after his active playing career, Fischer was definitely antisemitic, as he made numerous comments about Jews and denied the Holocaust both publicly and privately. Given that most experts believe Paul Neményi was his father, we now know Fischer had not one, but two Jewish parents. Still, even if his rabid antisemitism only started long after his chess career, his fans are left with an uncomfortable double emotion. We like to remember him as the brilliant chess player that he was—but, at the same time, we cannot ignore his rather unpleasant characteristics. On a more positive note, Fischer’s legacy goes beyond the brilliant results and the many wonderful games he left behind to be studied and admired by students of the game. In the 1990s, Fischer promoted what he called “Fischer Random,” where before the game starts, the pieces are shuffled on the first and eighth rank to avoid opening theory. It is also called “Chess960” (or “Freestyle”), because there are 960 possible starting positions. (As early as 1792, the Dutch chess enthusiast Philip Julius van Zuylen van Nijevelt had a similar idea.) And then there is his chess clock, which he patented in the late 1980s and which became the standard for the chess world. In contrast with older chess clocks, a Fischer time control gives each player a small increment after each completed move, on top of a fixed period at the start of the game. In 1992, Fischer suddenly returned to the chessboard. The shady Yugoslav banker Jezdimir Vasiljević, who would later be convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, had convinced him to play another match with Spassky, exactly 20 years after Reykjavík—and for a prize fund of $5 million. The event occurred in Yugoslavia (partly on Sveti Stefan, an island off the coast of Montenegro, and partly in Belgrade). It was global news, not least because of Fischer’s reaction to the US government’s warning not to play the match as it would violate UN sports sanctions imposed following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Fischer showed the letter to the journalists during a press conference and spat on it. He won the return match 10–5 (with 15 draws) but never returned to the United States, knowing he would be arrested upon arrival. Fischer lived the final years of his life in Iceland, where he died from degenerative kidney failure on January 17, 2008. He was 64 years old—a year for each of the squares on the chessboard. News of his death was released on a Saturday morning—my mother texted me about it while I was in the car on my way to the Wijk aan Zee tournament. I was shocked and felt it in my stomach. At the start of the first round the sad news was announced, and I made a video where I filmed the playing hall with all the top grandmasters and the hundreds of amateurs standing up for a minute of silence, a truly heartbreaking moment. The chess world had lost one of its greatest players. When Kasparov visited Fischer’s grave in 2014, I had the unforgettable opportunity to record a video interview. As I held my Nikon D90 camera, I ensured Fischer’s snow-covered grave and the tombstone were visible in the background. Later, I would edit out my questions and combine Kasparov’s touching words with appropriate background music. Ten years on, the video on YouTube has collected 856,000 views. It might be the one thing I am the proudest of in my career. Kasparov said: I can’t help but think that this is the graveyard also for great, unfulfilled hopes, because so much could be achieved. This is the country where Robert Fischer reached his peak. It was not only his peak, but it was one of the most glorious moments in the history of the game of chess. It could have ended differently. It’s not for us to come up with hypothetical versions of alternative history, but it’s still very sad. It’s as if this graveyard.… We could feel that so many great hopes and expectations have been buried without being realized. It’s all behind us, all the controversies, and what is left is the unique contribution of Robert James Fischer to the game of chess, and I’m here to pay this tribute. The Beast from Baku Garry Kasparov was born Garik Kimovich Weinstein in Baku, Azerbaijan, on April 13, 1963. His Armenian mother, Klara Kasparova, and his Jewish father, Kim Weinstein, were engineers. Garry learned chess from his father at five and beat him a year later. However, like Fischer, he mostly grew up without his father, who sadly died of lymphatic sarcoma at age 39, not long before Garry’s eighth birthday. Four and a half years later, in August 1975, he took his mother’s surname and became Garry Kasparov. His uncle started playing a lot of chess with seven-year-old Garry, and, within three months, he couldn’t beat his nephew any more, so he took him to the Pioneers’ Palace in Baku. In the Soviet Union all big cities had such palaces: institutions designed to engage and educate young people in various extracurricular activities, including sports, arts, cultural programs, and chess. Young Garry’s chess talent was immediately recognized at the Baku Pioneers’ Palace. When he reached the final of the Baku adult blitz championship in June 1972, a newspaper wrote about the nine-year-old, dark-haired boy: “Third-year pupil Garik Weinstein, playing standing up (when sitting he can’t reach all the pieces), achieved the overall best result in the first stage—9 points out of 9.” Even a newspaper in West Germany picked up the story. You could say that in the same summer when Fischer played his last serious chess games, Kasparov entered the arena. In 1973 Kasparov was accepted into the prestigious school of the legendary former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Just a few years later, Kasparov achieved a very high level of play. He became the youngest player ever to win the junior championship of the USSR in 1976, at 13, and then unexpectedly won the 1978 Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk, Belarus, at 14. He scored 3½ points more than was needed to obtain the Soviet master title. He was not an international master yet, as up until that point he had only played in a small number of youth championships abroad. As a chess player (or any sportsman, for that matter), one depended on the whims of the Sports Committee to be allowed to play internationally. The first published photo of Garry Kasparov, at 10 years old already attracting spectators as he defeated grandmaster Yuri Averbakh in 1973 in Moscow. That changed in April 1979, when Kasparov, after helpful talks between Botvinnik and the organizers, was invited to a strong tournament in Banja Luka, in then Yugoslavia. Without holding an international title or rating, Kasparov—again rather unexpectedly—won the 15-round tournament with a two-point margin, ahead of 14 grandmasters. It was a true breakthrough moment in his career. Kasparov’s first official rating, published in January 1980, was a stunning 2595, instantly throwing the 16-year-old schoolboy into the world’s top 20. Only two other players had scored a similar result at that age: Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Even though he was already approaching the world’s top ten, Kasparov decided to participate in the 1981 World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, Germany. He won the tournament—this time surprising no one—with a certain Nigel Short of England taking second place. (The two would play a major role in the chess world 12 years later.) In 1982 Kasparov finally obtained the grandmaster title officially—having demonstrated that level of play for years. In 1983, he defeated three world-class grandmasters (Alexander Beliavsky, Viktor Korchnoi, and Vasily Smyslov) in Candidates matches to become the challenger to the reigning world champion, Anatoly Karpov. The 21-year-old Kasparov, who became the number-one ranked player in the world in January 1984 with a rating of 2710, would prove to be Karpov’s fiercest opponent. Their first match began on September 9, 1984. It started one of the most epic rivalries in sports history, eclipsing contemporary clashes such as Ali versus Frazier, Evert versus Navratilova, or Prost versus Senna. Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov during their 1984 match in Moscow, the longest in the history of the game, lasting five months and 48 games. The winner would be the first to score six wins, with draws not counting. The world championship thus returned to an ancient format (and one that Fischer proposed in 1975), resulting in the longest title match in history. Karpov initially took a 5–0 lead, winning games three, six, seven, and nine (see annotated game on pages 387–88), and, after a string of 17 draws, also game 27. Kasparov, however, refused to throw in the towel. The longer the match progressed, the stronger the player he became, all the while learning from his formidable opponent. Kasparov finally scored a win, his first ever against Karpov, in game 32—94 days into the match! Karpov failed to deliver the final blow in the 14 more draws that followed, while the chess world closely followed this fascinating struggle between the “two Ks.” And then, a bombshell. No, two. With the sword of Damocles hanging above him for weeks on end, Kasparov suddenly won games 47 and 48. The 32-year-old Karpov was collapsing. On February 16, 1985, a week after that 48th game and five months after the start of the match, the players appeared at a press conference alongside Florencio Campomanes, president of the International Chess Federation. Astonishingly, “Campo” stopped the match without a result and announced that a new one would begin in September. Both Karpov and Kasparov wanted to continue, but the FIDE president stuck to his controversial decision, saying the match had “exhausted the physical if not the psychological resources” of the players. Kasparov and many chess experts suggested that this was mostly true for the reigning champion, but Karpov stepped on the stage and retorted, “The reports of my death are exaggerated. I believe we can and should continue.” Kasparov would later write: Later I became convinced that the decision to stop the match was carried out not so much because of any risk to the champion’s health, but rather in view of his psychological exhaustion, confusion, and fear of continuing. No other way of retaining his title was now apparent: had Karpov also lost a fourth game, the only way to complete the match would have been in accordance with the regulations. And the powers which at that time controlled Soviet sport, including chess, decided not to take the risk. This comment also reveals the political aspect of the rivalry: while the closed and compliant Karpov represented the old power, the brash, open-minded and pro-Western Kasparov represented the demise of the Soviet Union. Within one year, the chess world would discover how much stronger Kasparov had become. For the new match, FIDE returned to a format of 24 games. If the result was 12–12, Karpov would retain his title. On November 9, 1985, Kasparov won with a score of 13–11, becoming the 13th and youngest world champion in history at 22. Kasparov and Karpov played three more matches—in 1986, 1987, and 1990—all closely contested, with Kasparov barely managing to keep his title. Over seven years, the two gladiators had played 144 world championship games, with Kasparov scoring 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws. In 1993, Karpov failed to qualify for a sixth clash with Kasparov as he lost a Candidates match to the English number one Nigel Short. Unsatisfied with the $1.38 million FIDE had raised for their upcoming title match, Kasparov and Short decided to play outside FIDE’s jurisdiction. They raised $2.55 million themselves and played under the newly launched Professional Chess Association (PCA). Kasparov convincingly won their match in London, but the two had disrupted the chess world in a way that would have a lasting impact. FIDE stripped Kasparov of its title and organized a match between the highest-placed players in the world championship cycle. Karpov defeated Jan Timman and won back his FIDE world title, but most fans saw Kasparov as the legitimate world champion. It was the start of a very messy situation in chess, which continued to produce multiple world champions until 2006 (see also Chapter 1 on this). Kasparov defeated Viswanathan Anand in 1995, a match in which one of his seconds (the chess term for coach/trainer/assistant) was Vladimir Kramnik. The young Russian grandmaster put his experience to good use, later dethroning his former boss in 2000. After years of failed attempts to organize a new world championship match, Kasparov retired from competitive chess in March 2005. Only in 2006 was the situation resolved when Kramnik won a “reunification match” against the FIDE world champion, Veselin Topalov. In 2009, the old legends Kasparov and Karpov played an exhibition match in Valencia, Spain. This time, Karpov was no match for his opponent in a series of rapid and blitz games. At the press conference the two legends were critical of FIDE and its handling of the world championship cycle over recent years. When I asked whether it might be an idea for the top players to consider starting a new organization altogether, Kasparov reacted as if stung by a bee, saying, “I have apologized many times for what I did in 1993!” Later, he wrote that creating the PCA was the worst blunder of his chess career. Kasparov has remained active in chess as an occasional trainer of upcoming players, including Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. And he still plays a bit, just not official games at a long time control. Every year, the chess legend can be seen in action in St. Louis, where he participates in exhibition events financed by billionaire Rex Sinquefield. I will never forget when I placed my camera about a meter and a half away from Kasparov’s board during the first round of a St. Louis blitz tournament in 2017, his first official (rated) game since 2005. Playing Sergey Karjakin with the white pieces, he employed the King’s Gambit, an ancient, romantic, and somewhat dubious opening he had never played before in his long career. Witnessing Kasparov grab that pawn in front of his king’s bishop and move it up two squares, it felt special just being there, watching it as a chess fan and filming it for the many fans who could soon watch it on YouTube. The game was an eventful draw (see annotated game on pages 398–99). Part of Kasparov’s incredible legacy springs from his books, in particular his famous My Great Predecessors series, published between 2003 and 2006. Over the course of five volumes, he gives a detailed account of the careers of the first 12 world champions, analyzing their most important games and covering the other strong players of their time. It is an extensive and beautiful account of the history of top-level chess in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and an indispensable part of any serious chess fan’s library. Kasparov also wrote books about his matches with Karpov, as well as three vol-umes focusing on his best games, totaling 12 wonderful works. Most of his time, however, is spent on something else. Soon after his retirement, Kasparov became a political activist and a fierce opponent of Vladimir Putin. In the fall of 2007, he briefly ran for president of Russia but the authorities prevented him from participating in the elections, as they did with many other opposition figures. He was jailed for five days for participating in a protest in November of that year. He moved to New York in 2013 and has not returned to Russia since. His 2015 book Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped wasn’t taken seriously enough by Western policymakers; only when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, did it become clear how accurately Kasparov had predicted the future. Kasparov had an incredible chess career. He won the Chess Oscar, an award based on votes by chess journalists, 11 times. He reached the highest-ever Elo rating of 2851 in 1999, a record that stood for 13 years. He still holds the record for the most months (255!) as the number-one rated player in the world (with Kramnik in shared first place in January 1996). He also has the most consecutive professional tournament victories, finishing first or tied for first in a remarkable 15 individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990. (Once, he quipped that he “lost a tournament,” referring to the fact that he did not finish in first place!) How did Kasparov get to dominate his peers? The answer lies in a combination of immense talent, excellent work ethic, and being raised in a good environment for chess. His matches with Anatoly Karpov brought him to another level. And, as we will learn more about in the second part of the book, as soon as computers became strong enough, Kasparov used them to maximum effect for his preparation. Kasparov’s presence at the board was legendary—in fact, it edged toward terrifying. He famously removed his watch from his wrist and placed it on the table at the start of a game. He would put it back only when he knew he had a winning position, by which point the opponent knew they were toast. The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler, who played Kasparov many times, told me, “A game against Garry would always take out all the energy from me; I would be half-dead the next day. I like Garry, I admire Garry a great deal; Garry is somebody I tried to model my chess life and career on, but the words ‘energy vampire’ kind of enter the conversation there a little bit.” Garry Kasparov, at a business-meets-grandmasters exhibition event in Paris in 2018, looking fierce as ever. The Mozart of Chess While the fifth and final match between Kasparov and Karpov was underway, Magnus Øen Carlsen was born on November 30, 1990, in Husvik, on the edge of Tønsberg, Norway’s oldest city. Magnus has one older and two younger sisters. He has in common with Kasparov that his parents, his mother Sigrun and his father Henrik, both graduated as civil engineers. Henrik, a chess lover, taught Magnus the game before he turned five. His son seemed interested, but it was difficult for him. He returned to it when he was seven due to a desire to beat his older sister, Ellen. The young Magnus could spend hours alone with a chess set, playing games against himself, trying to find combinations, or going through games his father had shown him. Later, playing online became part of the routine as well. Magnus spent thousands of hours playing chess, which Henrik emphasized when I asked him about the mystery behind his son’s talent: “I think the answer is a bit boring: he has practiced these capabilities a lot. Chess was something he delved into and tried to discover, find out about, a mystery that he wanted to understand more about.” Having produced just four grandmasters, Norway wasn’t exactly a chess-minded country. Its youth chess infrastructure was in pretty good shape, though, partly thanks to the efforts of the country’s number-one player. The multitalented Simen Agdestein was a strong chess player, ranked number 16 in the world at his best, and a professional soccer player who made eight appearances for the Norwegian national team as a striker. Agdestein had started a chess department at the Norges Toppi-drettsgymnas (Norwegian College of Elite Sport) just two years before Magnus joined, and soon introduced a trainer for him, the International Master Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen. Weekly training sessions, where Hansen discovered his pupil’s great memory and intuition, quickly bore fruit, helping Magnus increase his rating by a thousand points in a year. In July 2000, four months before his tenth birthday, Magnus played in the Norwegian championship for kids under 11. When speaking about it in a podcast in 2022, he still considered it the most satisfying tournament victory of his career, despite everything he achieved later: “At that point, I realized, you know, I could actually be very good at this.” After finishing primary school Carlsen took a year off in 2003–4, as his parents decided to take the family on a big trip. They rented out the house for a year and hit the road with a secondhand Hyundai H-100 van they named “Kassa.” The route meandered through Central and Southeast Europe and then back home to Bærum, Norway, for Christmas. “The focus was on educating the children and getting to know the world, and chess was something Magnus could do along the way,” Henrik explained. “In practice, we made a route that was consistent with him playing a lot of tournaments, but that was not the focus, really.” The first time I saw Magnus was when the family had just started the second part of their trip. In January 2004, I played in the amateur section in Wijk aan Zee and noticed a 13-year-old Norwegian boy playing in Grandmaster Group C. This was the third-highest tournament of the festival, held on stage just meters away from the main event. The tournament saw his international breakthrough. Magnus started with six wins and two draws, before losing one game—but with three more wins and a draw, he won the group with 10½ out of 13. He scored his first grandmaster norm (a tournament score at GM-level; you need three of those and a rating over 2500 to obtain the title) and was promoted to next year’s B group. Meanwhile, his beautiful win against the Dutch grandmaster Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round was published in chess magazines worldwide. He was a true wonderboy, which would be the title of the first biography written about him, by Agdestein in the same year. The Czech-American grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek compared Magnus to the prodigy of all prodigies. “In January 2004, I called Magnus Carlsen the Mozart of chess for the first time,” Kavalek wrote years later. “It was a spontaneous, last-minute decision to meet a deadline for my column in the Washington Post. The name was picked up immediately and spread around quickly. It was used, misused, overused.” The thing is: many past masters, including Morphy, Spassky, and Fischer, were also compared to Mozart. “How rich the chess world is!” noted the Dutch chess writer Hans Ree. “The music lovers have Mozart, but we have at least 11 of them.” Two months later, in March 2004, a rapid tournament in Reyk-javík witnessed a historic moment for chess as Magnus played against Kasparov for the first time (see annotated game on page 394). The time control was 25 minutes per person plus five seconds per move—the now common Fischer increment. Magnus, who had beaten Anatoly Karpov earlier in the tournament, again played brilliantly. He reached a winning position but spoiled it to draw, which was still a good result that made him a national celebrity as all major Norwegian media reported on it. After losing the second game, Magnus was quoted as saying, “I played like a child.” The next month, in April 2004, that child fulfilled all requirements to become the world’s youngest grandmaster at 13 years, four months, and 26 days. At the 2007 tournament in Wijk aan Zee, the first where I worked as a reporter, Carlsen debuted in the highest group. He finished in last place, and the general thought was that this event had come too soon for him. The critics were quickly silenced when he finished in shared second place at another world-class event, Linares, Spain, only a few weeks later. It was a brilliant result for the now 16-year-old Norwegian in a field with seven of the best grandmasters in the world. In September 2009, the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang (VG) broke the news that, in all secrecy, Kasparov was training Carlsen, an arrangement that had started six months earlier and would end in early 2010. The news came out just as Kasparov arrived in Valencia to play his old nemesis Karpov, who had brought several grandmasters to assist him, while Kasparov came only with his wife, his mother, and a companion of hers. When someone doubted this modest entourage, Kasparov countered, “But I just came from a training session with Magnus!” Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, the two best players in the history of the game, first played each other in March 2004 in Reykjavík. Carlsen was thirteen. Carlsen, now 18, was the fourth-ranked player in the world, and the main goal of the training was to bring him to pole position in the coming year. That happened faster than anticipated. A spectacular performance at a tournament in Nanjing, China, where he played at a 3002 rating level (that is, his six wins and four draws at the tournament was equal to the expected score of a player with a theoretical rating of 3002), got him to second place, and then the London Chess Classic in December gave him the last push toward a rating of 2810. That was two points shy of Kasparov’s last published rating, but on January 1, 2010, a month after turning 19, Carlsen was the official world number one. (Fourteen years later, he still is.) In the fall of 2010 fans got to see yet another version of Carlsen: one that started to popularize the game in a broader sense. In a first for the chess world, he became a fashion model, joining the Dutch brand G-Star Raw’s Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn photographed the campaign, and suddenly Magnus could be seen on billboards and fashion magazines in 80 countries. He would also be part of G-Star’s Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole. As the Norwegian writer Arne Danielsen pointed out, it was at this point Magnus Carlsen became a brand, while his fashion activities aligned with the credo of trendwatchers in those days: “Smart is the new sexy.” Carlsen would later embark on further collaborations outside chess, including appearances in The Simpsons and Norway’s Donald Duck comics magazine and in commercials. For several years he was a global ambassador for Unibet; he helped create a special edition shoe for Puma; and in 2013 he took the honorary kickoff in a La Liga game for his favorite club, Real Madrid. In December 2019 he briefly led the official Fantasy Premier League ahead of seven million other players before eventually finishing the season in tenth place. More than any chess player previously, Carlsen has connected with global brands and promoted the game along the way. Three years after becoming the world number one, London was the scene for another special occasion for Carlsen. On December 8, 2012, he broke Garry Kasparov’s 2851 rating record. I filmed him throughout the day and interviewed him in the Hilton London Kensington hotel lobby afterward. “I think that’s pretty cool,” he commented with a smile. “It’s probably the biggest achievement of my career so far because I didn’t think that anyone thought it was going to be broken this soon.” The same interview revealed the kind of honesty about his play that Fischer and Kasparov were known for: “My games haven’t been brilliant. They haven’t been bad, but they haven’t been brilliant either, so it’s just about fighting, I think. And in the end, I believe you always get what you deserve, so to some extent I think I at least deserve this score.” In March 2013, Carlsen participated in what proved simultaneously to be a crucial tournament for his career and one of the most dramatic events in chess history. He was one of the eight participants of the Candidates Tournament, a double round-robin (all eight players faced each other twice) from which the winner would qualify for a world championship match against Viswanathan Anand. A round before the end, Carlsen was in a tie for first place with former world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Carlsen was slightly ahead on number of wins, so only had to match or better Kramnik’s final result. On a final day that couldn’t have been contrived by the best Hollywood scriptwriters, Carlsen and Kramnik both lost their games. As a result, Carlsen won on that tiebreak rule of scoring more wins. “I think a lot of other players would have gone for a draw in the last round or kind of secured the draw,” Carlsen’s father Henrik said. “But he wanted to win the game, to control his own destiny. I was so proud of that.” The Anand–Carlsen world championship started on November 9, 2013, in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chennai, India—a 15-minute drive from Anand’s home. I was among the 150 journalists present (40 from abroad, half of those from Norway), a number I had never seen before at a chess event. “Magnus and I both underestimated the intensity of a match,” Henrik told me. “The thought was, ‘Well, [Magnus] is the best tournament player in the world; he should play like it’s a tournament.’ But when Magnus came to the first game, he was pretty nervous, and before the second game, he was shaking, basically. He was fumbling with his pieces and twice dropped a piece; I had never seen him like that, ever. He was really on the edge. The experience was larger than life in a way, exotic and quite unique.” After four draws, Carlsen was the first to win a game and hit again in the next game. The remainder of the match saw one more win for the challenger and three draws, which in this best-of-12 match was enough for Carlsen to be crowned the 16th World Chess Champion a week before his 23rd birthday. For my news report I used the now iconic photo taken by my Norwegian friend and colleague Tarjei Svensen, who was responsible for Carlsen’s social media at the time. Magnus is standing in the water in a dark suit and white shirt, completely soaked but with two hands victoriously in the air. He had just been thrown into the hotel pool by his sponsors during a victory party with family, friends, former trainers, donors, and fans, including the Norwegian ambassador in India and his wife. Tarjei Svensen’s photograph of Magnus Carlsen, soaking wet but all smiles, as the newly crowned world chess champion who had just been thrown into the hotel pool, November 22, 2013. The next day the new world champion was officially crowned at the closing ceremony, hours after playing basketball with friends, sponsors, and media members. (Embarrassing photos exist of me failing horribly to defend against him.) My publisher insisted on including this picture of me playing basketball with Magnus Carlsen (and Tarjei Svensen, far right), in November 2013 in Chennai. Throughout the match, Carlsen played a lot of soccer and basketball on rest days. He is probably the biggest sports lover among all the top chess players. Since he was small, he has played soccer, tennis, and other ball sports. Skiing is still a favorite pastime when he is in Norway. As a result, he is generally fit, which has helped him in many long games that can take up to seven hours—for example, the crucial sixth game in his world championship match with Ian Nepomniachtchi in Dubai on December 3, 2021, where he won after 136 moves, seven hours, and 46 minutes of play. In late 2023, Carlsen answered the typical sports question concerning what was going through his mind after that marathon game: “I felt good; I was ready to play more! Because that was the key breakthrough, that was the moment I had been waiting for, for the first six games of that match. I remember I was so calm, so focused for the last two and a half hours. I was playing with fairly little time on my clock, but I knew: this is my chance; if I win this game I’m probably winning another world championship, so I knew that was my moment. Afterward I was just so calm, I even told my manager I was ready to go for three more hours.” Back to 2013 and Carlsen’s world championship match against Anand. The chess craze was truly incredible in Norway. The match was covered live on the website of the country’s biggest newspaper VG and on television at prime time. There were close to a million concurrent viewers, while about two and a half million people watched at some point, which is half of Norway’s population. VG declared him “Man of the Year,” and at the national sports gala he clinched the three biggest trophies. The following year Anand won the 2014 Candidates Tournament to qualify for a return match, showing that class is permanent. The Indian legend also lost his second match to Carlsen, in Sochi, Russia. Carlsen played his next two title matches—in 2016 against the Russian Sergey Karjakin and in 2018 against the American Fabiano Caruana—deciding both in the rapid tiebreak after the regular games had ended 6–6. In 2021, he defeated Nepomniachtchi more convincingly, 7½–3½. Meanwhile, he won multiple gold medals at speed chess events, winning the World Blitz Chess Championship seven times and the World Rapid Chess Championship five times. Carlsen holds the longest unbeaten streak in history, going undefeated for 125 classical games between August 2018 and October 2020. His peak classical rating is 2882, which he has reached twice in his career, in May 2014 and August 2019, in two different ways. “Specifically in 2019, I benefited a lot from opening preparation, while in 2013–14, I mostly tried to avoid my opponent’s preparation rather than that being [my] strength,” he said in the summer of 2022. In Chapter 6 we will see how Carlsen changed his approach to the game, becoming stronger also in the opening thanks to remarkable computer developments. Carlsen is a player from the modern era, meaning many of his events have occurred online. He won numerous internet tournaments, first on the platform Chess24, and then, following a merger in 2022, on Chess.com. One of his toughest opponents in very fast online games is the American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, who managed to beat him in the 2022 Speed Chess Championship final (Nakamura is a player we’ll learn more about in Chapter 10). Carlsen took revenge in the 2023 edition but only won narrowly: 13½–12½. In the summer of 2022, Carlsen shocked the chess world by announcing that he wouldn’t be defending his world championship title. “I’m not motivated to play another match. I simply feel that I don’t have a lot to gain,” he said in a Norwegian podcast. Luckily for his many fans, he didn’t retire like Kasparov, or vanish like Fischer. Carlsen is still playing a lot of tournaments, online and offline, and thus far has retained his number-one ranking. His legacy is still being written. Why is Carlsen better than his rivals? Kasparov has said, “Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov, which is very unusual because Fischer’s style was very dynamic, just fighting to the last pawn, just using every resource available. Karpov was very different. He had an unparalleled ability to use every piece with a maximum effect.” Henrik Carlsen suggested that Karpov was closer in style to his son than Fischer, with Magnus taking Karpov’s prowess to the next level: “Fischer had more of Fischer in him than Magnus, but if Karpov had more of Karpov in him than Magnus, I’m not so sure.” Magnus Carlsen during the 2018 Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. I asked the same question, why Carlsen is superior to his rivals, to the Dutch number one, Anish Giri, who’d played Carlsen dozens of times. His answer was insightful: He does what everybody does: a little better here, a little better there. Where he is the best is that he has this insane feel for pattern recognition, which is a subconscious thing, coming from somewhere deep in the trenches of your memory. But you can try to trace it, like, “Where have I seen it?” And then it can be something like: “Ah, it’s actually kind of similar to the Fischer–Taimanov game.” Magnus has the best pattern recognition: the passive, intuitive one where he sees the position, and he knows White is better. His evaluations are spot on, especially for positions that are positional when nothing concrete is there [lacking direct, forcing tactics]. If he has an argument with another top player about a position, I think 29 out of 30 times, he’s right. And then, what is also very impressive is that he will also tell you what it reminds him of right away. So, he knows where the connection comes from. His pattern recognition is not only better, it’s also closer to his consciousness. They are better connected in him. And what impresses me also is the speed of his connections, the consciousness of his subconscious. That he recognizes what it is that he sees so quickly. I think that is talent. Who Is the GOAT? On October 8, 2023, the late Kelvin Kiptum from Kenya set the official world record for marathons at 2:00:35 in Chicago. In 1925, the American Albert Michelsen was the fastest at the Port Chester, New York, marathon with a time of 2:29:01. On February 11, 2024, Pan Zhanle of China swam the 100 meters freestyle in long course (a 50-meter pool) in 46.80 seconds, in Doha. It took the American Johnny Weissmuller 57.4 seconds to finish the same distance in Miami in 1924. In the span of a century, top runners and swimmers have become roughly 20 percent faster. As time progresses, athletes get better and stronger in just about any physical sport, decade after decade. The most famous exception is Bob Beamon, whose long-jump world record of 8.90 meters at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics stood for almost 23 years until it was broken in 1991 by Mike Powell. What Beamon had done was an unbelievable performance, way ahead of his time. New generations of athletes are continuously beating their predecessors because of the progress made in training methods and the accumulated knowledge about nutrition, sleep, and other relevant factors. That also makes it harder, or perhaps nonsensical, to compare contestants from different periods in time. Was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar better than Michael Jordan? Would you prefer to have Shohei Ohtani in your team over Babe Ruth? The times are different; everything is different. Only boxing might be an exception here, where it has been suggested that the greats of the past might be on a par with, or even better than, the greats of today. But what about chess? It would seem that the Elo rating system is the perfect tool for making such comparisons for chess players. We have the numbers to tell us who was the best player, right? Well, there are two problems. For starters, Arpad Elo only introduced his calculations in the 1960s, so we must disregard any great master from before then. A bigger issue stems from the nature of the rating system, which Elo himself pointed out: it doesn’t provide stable numbers of a certain level of play. Instead, it measures the strength of a player as compared with their contemporaries. Regarding our topic, it can only tell us how much someone dominated their peers. As early as 1962, Elo noted that ratings are mere approximates. He compared the calculations to “the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yardstick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind.” In the late 1990s and early 2000s the American statistician Jeff Sonas acknowledged the second problem, but more or less solved the first. Working with his own rating formula, he evaluated the strength of historical tournaments and the performance ratings of players. Based on that, he calculated monthly historical ratings going back to 1843. His main conclusions: Bobby Fischer established the largest gap between the number-one player and the rest of the world, but that lasted only a few months, and then he retired. Emanuel Lasker had the longest reign as world champion (27 years) and was at the top of Sonas’s rating list for most months, but his career included several periods when he hardly played, including during World War I. No, Garry Kasparov was the most dominant player of all time. One of Sonas’s arguments (which refers to his own rating formula, not the official FIDE ratings) is pretty convincing: “For a stretch of 18.5 years, not a single other player even came within ten rating points of Kasparov on any of the monthly lists.” We can now agree that Kasparov beats Fischer in dominance, if only for the longevity that Fischer is missing. But what about Carlsen? We cannot ask Sonas, who stopped looking at this topic after Kasparov’s retirement. Two experts answered the GOAT question more recently, though. At the end of 2020, the grandmasters Jan Gustafsson and Peter Heine Nielsen published their list of the 50 greatest players of all time on Chess24. Their top three: Kasparov, Carlsen, Fischer, in that order. Nielsen said, “There’s just nothing to talk about, it’s as simple as that.” Gustafsson: “The only guy who could match him [Kasparov] is if Magnus has another ten years like the ten years he’s had, then we have something to talk about. That we can do in 2030 when we redo this series.” In 2017, the French researcher Jean-Marc Alliot took a different approach. Instead of going by ratings, he used a chess engine to look at the quality of moves in 26,000 games played by all world champions since Wilhelm Steinitz. His model predicted the results of the games extremely close to actual results, and better than predictions based on Elo scores. Alliot’s list, based on the year when individual players were at their peak, had an interesting number two: 1. Carlsen (best year: 2013); 2. Kramnik (1999); 3. Fischer (1971); 4. Kasparov (2001). In the same year, 2017, Chess.com introduced its Computer Aggregated Precision Score (CAPS), an engine-based tool that evaluates the strength of play for a chess player, or the quality of moves in a chess game. Their top four was similar: 1. Carlsen; 2. Kramnik; 3. Kasparov; 4. Fischer. In August 2023, the American grandmaster Larry Kaufman pointed out that such research needs some tweaking. He noted that players who prioritize not losing and excel in endgames play more draws than those who prioritize winning and excel in attacking, and draws usually show much higher overall quality of moves than decisive games. He did his own research where he excluded draws from the data and limited himself to games that were part of world championship matches and tournaments, Candidates matches or tournaments, and Interzonals. All this didn’t help Kramnik, because Kaufman’s list has Carlsen first, Kasparov second, Fischer third. The conclusion is that of all the players that ever lived, Carlsen has shown the highest objective quality of play. However you want to look at it, and whichever player you prefer, it cannot be denied that the Norwegian superstar has been responsible for the best moves ever played. It’s impossible to say whether he is also the most talented player who ever lived because, like all modern athletes, Carlsen has benefited from greater accumulated knowledge, modern training methods, and the strongest computer engines. (For what it’s worth, Carlsen himself still put Kasparov slightly ahead of him in August 2022, when he said, “Garry generally edges it because of the longevity in the competitive era.”) The “previous GOAT,” Kasparov, was a pioneer when it came to using computers, as we will see in the following chapters. Fischer, however, had to do without machines altogether. In fact, he hardly had any seconds or coaches through most of his career, while his estimated performance rating during his peak period of 1970–72 was over 2800, the level of the absolute top players of today. Just imagine what he could have done in the modern era. John Donaldson believed, “If Bobby Fischer had access to the engines they have now, and ChessBase, and he was exactly the way he was back then, so he would be, like, studying for 12 hours a day, right? I mean, I don’t know, he would come to the tournament, and probably there would be like steam coming from his brain, like fully cooked.” Fischer might not be the objective GOAT by generally accepted criteria, but what he achieved, mostly all by himself, is perhaps still unique, after all—as unique as Bob Beamon was for the long jump. With its 1,500-year history that has left indelible marks on art, literature, and science, chess has established itself as a unique cultural phenomenon. A world without the game of kings is unimaginable. Meanwhile, the kings of the game have left their mark. Fischer, Kasparov, and Carlsen have each played unique roles in shaping the narrative of chess in Western culture. As we will explore in the next two parts of the book, chess eventually became more popular than ever after two giant forces deeply impacted the game—the computer and the internet.",

      "title": "Chapter 5AI and Chess: From Babbage to Deep Blue",
      "content": "Chapter 5AI and Chess: From Babbage to Deep Blue “If we choose to call the [Mechanical Turk] a pure machine we must be prepared to admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the most wonderful of the inventions of mankind.” —Edgar Allan Poe, “Maelzel’s Chess Player,” Southern Literary Messenger, 1836 It’s May 11, 1997, and a drama is unfolding on the 35th floor of the Equitable Center on Seventh Avenue in Midtown, Manhattan. Thirty-four-year-old Garry Kasparov, the best chess player on the planet, sits with his head in his left hand and looks out into the crowd. On the first row, he sees his mother, Klara, who accompanies him to all his important matches. He starts shaking his head. As he takes a few more seconds to accept the inevitable, Kasparov eventually offers his hand to the game operator, quickly signs the scoresheet, and walks straight out of the room with both hands up. The video showing Kasparov’s resignation would be played in news bulletins worldwide as the supercomputer Deep Blue’s win was heralded as the machine’s victory over mankind. The footage went viral a decade before social media became a thing. In his late-night show, David Letterman joked, “Over the weekend, world chess champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by the IBM computer, Deep Blue. Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. In a related story, earlier today, the New York Mets were defeated by a microwave oven.” Deep Blue’s victory against Garry Kasparov in 1997 was a significant milestone for artificial intelligence. At the time, the match symbolized the competition between humans and computers at the highest level of intelligence, setting Deep Blue’s win as a marker of AI’s potential to surpass human performance in complex tasks. It was a legendary match, which had its origins almost 200 years earlier, when a young man marveled at automatons. Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine In 1800, a boy of about nine years old, accompanied by his mother, stepped into the depths of John Joseph Merlin’s Mechanical Museum in the heart of London. It was an enigmatic place filled with gadgets and wonders, such as a gambling machine, perpetual-motion clocks and a collection of alluring music boxes. The boy’s eyes were transfixed, captivated by the mysterious mechanisms before him. Little did he know, on that fateful day in central London, one of the early seeds of artificial intelligence would be planted deep within his young mind. The boy’s name was Charles Babbage. The nineteenth century’s renowned mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer designed his Difference Engine in 1822, an audacious creation to generate error-free logarithmic tables. It was an early example of a mechanical computer, where the term computer should be understood as a machine that can compute or calculate something. Around 1833, Babbage started working on his even more ambitious Analytical Engine. This was a mechanical, general-purpose computer that would use punched cards for programming and have a “store” for memory, a mill for computations, and a control unit for instruction sequencing. It was to perform arithmetic operations, support conditional branching and looping, and store intermediate results. An engraving of a section of Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine No. 1, from the frontispiece of his autobiography Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, 1864. None of Babbage’s engines, which would have been roughly the size of a room and extraordinarily heavy, were completed in his lifetime due to disputes with the engineers and the collapse of the British government’s funding. Still, they laid the foundation for subsequent developments in computing technology in the twentieth century. In his autobiography, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, from 1864, Babbage revealed that he had intended to “test” his Analytical Engine and see whether it could play “a game of purely intellectual skill successfully” such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, or chess. He concluded that theoretically, it should be possible, but that chess encountered practical limitations. “In consequence of this, the whole question of making an automaton play any game depended on the possibility of the machine being able to represent all the myriads of combinations relating to it,” Babbage wrote. That “myriad of combinations” turned out too large for such a machine (and we will soon learn why): “Allowing one hundred moves on each side for the longest game at chess, I found that the combinations involved in the Analytical Engine enormously surpassed any required, even by the game of chess.” He spent more time on tic-tac-toe, but also here, while leaving many design sketches, he could not create an actual machine himself. Although Babbage’s influence on computer chess is limited, there is a link between his Analytical Machine and the earliest computers of the twentieth century. It is, therefore, fascinating to consider that one of the brightest minds of his time was at least thinking along the same lines as the first explorers of artificial intelligence, but more than a century earlier. And, in this case too, chess had played its part. Alan Turing and His Paper Machine If I ask the reader when the first computer chess program was written, you will probably start thinking about the number of years since the first electronic computer appeared. However, the answer may astound you: it was a few years before such a computer was born. The man who wrote it was Alan Turing. Born in 1912 in London, Turing emerged as one of the twentieth century’s most brilliant and visionary minds. His contributions to computer science, his role as a codebreaker during World War II at Bletchley Park, and his pioneering work in artificial intelligence and early computer design have secured his legacy. Oh, and he also liked chess. While working at Bletchley Park, Turing had plenty of opportunities to play during breaks. Among the codebreakers who regularly penetrated and deciphered the coded messages of the Germans, Italians, and Japanese were many strong chess players, including three members of the English team: Conel Hugh O’Donel Alexander (the reigning British champion at the time), Stuart Milner-Barry, and Harry Golombek. In 1948, when Turing was 36, he started writing his chess program. Assisted by his friend David Champernowne, Turing programmed the rules of the game but also created a set of values for the pieces (pawn = 1, knight = 3, bishop = 3½, rook = 5, queen = 10) and some positional evaluation functions, which gave numeric values to things like piece mobility, piece safety, castling, check, and mate. Some of these ideas are still valuable concepts used by modern-day chess programs. Turing and Champernowne called their chess-playing program the “Turochamp,” also known as “Turing’s Paper Machine.” Since a computer capable of running the program did not exist, Turing had to go through the algorithm for each move and calculate Turochamp’s next move with pencil and paper, thus acting as a human central processing unit (CPU). The whole process took more than half an hour per move. At the time, Turing’s chess computer program had evolved from what has been named “the Turing Machine.” He described it in his famous paper “On Computable Numbers,” published in 1936 when he was 24. Turing gave a mathematical description of a universal machine, an abstract model of a computing device capable of processing information. Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” posed a pivotal question that ignites passionate debate to this day: can machines think? In his quest for the answer, Turing first noted that you need definitions of “machine” and “think,” but then suggested something altogether different, which he called “the imitation game.” This notion, portrayed in the 2014 biographical film bearing the same name, is now immortalized as “the Turing Test.” It postulates that when a computer’s response becomes indistinguishable from a human’s, the boundaries of intelligence blur and the computer can be deemed to be thinking. Nowadays, the fundamental importance of the Turing Test in the field of AI is probably somewhat overrated. In fact, instead of a rigorous formal test, Turing himself saw the notion as more like a philosophical idea, a helpful thought experiment. In a podcast in July 2023, the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari described the Turing Test concisely as “a social test, not a logical proof.” Still, what’s nice about Turing’s 1950 paper is that it’s there, within those pages, that chess and AI started their joint journey through the twentieth century and beyond. In his imitation game, Turing gives four example questions (and supposed answers from the computer), two of them related to chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Count me out on this one, I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give an answer) 105621. Q: Do you play chess? A: Yes. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. (If the notation of the chess moves looks odd, that’s because in those days descriptive notation was still more common than today’s standard algebraic notation, which uses coordinates of squares, like in 1.e4, 2.Nf3.) As Garry Kasparov commented in 2012, Turing, in the above dialogue, placed chess somewhere between simple sums and poetry. Not a bad place for our game! This author couldn’t resist the temptation to feed OpenAI’s well-known chat program ChatGPT the same “prompts” to see what the Turing Test gave us in early 2023. The answers I got mainly demonstrated that, at that point in time, the chatbot knew its way among texts but didn’t really know how to play chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Upon the Firth of Forth, a bridge stands tall, A marvel of steel, engineering’s delight. It stands against the storm, will never fall, A beacon in the day, a star at night. Three diamond towers, reaching for the sky, An icon of the North, proud and true. Steel girders forming lines that please the eye, Connecting banks where once a ferry flew. Across the waters, trains in rhythm move, On tracks suspended high above the tide. Each crossing a testament to human groove, Of perseverance, pride, and nation’s stride. So here’s to Forth Bridge, in elegance draped, Man’s triumph over space, in steel shaped. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: The sum of 34957 and 70764 is 105721. Q: Do you play chess? A: As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t actually “play” chess in the sense that humans do. However, I can certainly assist with understanding the game, explaining the rules, discussing strategies, or analyzing moves and positions. If you provide a situation from a game, I can help interpret it or suggest possible moves. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: In the scenario you’ve described, it’s important to prevent the opposing king from moving to a safe position. The best move would be to use your rook to give checkmate. You can do this by moving your rook from R1 to R2. The king on K1 has no legal moves and is in check from the rook on R2, which is supported by your king on K6, resulting in checkmate. Please note that the naming conventions of chess positions can vary based on the system used. ChatGPT’s chess answer included a few correct facts, but its suggested move was nonsensical. I don’t think that’s because ChatGPT got confused by the descriptive notation; it did not understand chess yet. That is still the main issue with large language models (LLMs) at this point in time: they are not ready yet for real understanding like humans do (and hardly anyone understands them!). Initially, I thought that for ChatGPT to be able to think and solve chess problems, it would need to be somehow connected to a chess program, because without it, it is only using language by predicting which next word in the sentence makes the most sense. But, if we could combine that with a chess program, we would have the chess version of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which, according to some experts, might be less than a decade away. However, many months into writing this book, I came across a special version of the now infamous chatbot called “GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct,” released by OpenAI in September 2023. It is a more versatile tool that can be instructed more precisely to complete various tasks or answer questions. And, lo and behold, it also plays chess, at the level of the average club player, without any connection to an actual chess program. How is that possible? In an online article in early January 2024, research engineer Adam Karvonen explained that this model was only trained to predict the next character in chess notation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and was never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess: “Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.” Playing a decent game of chess by predicting the next move from chess notation, thereby learning much more about the actual game, is just incredible. It also shows that LLMs are developing so quickly that any judgment you make about their capabilities today could be out of date tomorrow. Shortly before finishing the first draft of this book, in February 2024, I tried Turing’s last question again, and now ChatGPT (still version 3.5!) answered it perfectly: “In the situation you described, with your king at K1 and no other pieces, and my king at K6 and rook at R1, I would play rook to R8, checkmating your king at K1. This move involves bringing the rook to the eighth rank and delivering checkmate to your king along the back rank.” Claude Shannon and His Number Turing’s lecture for the Royal Astronomical Society in 1947 is considered the earliest public lecture on machine intelligence. With his 1950 paper and chess-playing computer program, he showed for the first time that chess could be a model for mechanical thinking and machine intelligence. In the early 1950s the game was a testing ground for the new and developing area of computer science. In 1943, Turing had spent two months working on speech encryption at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City. There, he met the academic and philosophical engineer Claude Shannon, whose 1948 article “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” would become the founding work for the field of information theory. Like Turing, Shannon worked on cryptanalysis during World War II, and the two distinguished gentlemen shared an interest in chess. Seemingly independent from Turing, Shannon published an article titled “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess” in 1950 based on a lecture he had given to the Institute of Radio Engineers on March 9, 1949—coincidentally, Bobby Fischer’s sixth birthday. “This paper is concerned with the problem of constructing a computing routine or ‘program’ for a modern general-purpose computer which will enable it to play chess,” Shannon opened his article. For him, too, chess was a testing ground that could prove helpful for other areas. While constructing a chess computer program was “perhaps of no practical importance,” he wrote, “the question is of theoretical interest, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem will act as a wedge in attacking other problems of a similar nature and of greater significance.” Shannon also explained why chess was so valuable: The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require “thinking” for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of “thinking”; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers. Shannon theorized that each position in a chess game has three possible evaluations: a won position for White; a drawn position; or a won position for Black. To play a perfect game, without errors, all the program needs to do is calculate from the starting position till the moment of checkmate or a drawn position, and see which result follows in deciding which first move it needs to make. Easy? Well, there is a bit of an issue with this approach. The thing is: there are a lot of possible games to calculate. Like, a lot. In the first chapter, we saw the power of exponential growth explained by the legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, and here’s it no different. As famously noted, the number of possible chess games is bigger than the number of atoms in the universe, and Shannon was the first to point this out. Here’s why. In the starting position, White has 20 possible opening moves (eight pawns can be pushed either one square or two, and each knight, the only piece allowed to jump over other pieces or pawns, can go to two different squares). Black has the same 20 options, meaning 20 × 20 = 400 possible ways to start a chess game with one move for each side. If we give White one more move, the number of variations quickly grows to 8,902, and adding a second move for Black means there are 197,281 different possible starts. As the game progresses, the tree of possibilities grows at an exponential rate that is impossible to comprehend. Based on an average of about a thousand (103) possibilities for a pair of moves and a typical game lasting for about 40 such pairs of moves, Shannon concluded that there are 10120 variations (possible games) to be calculated from the initial position, which is a one followed by 120 zeroes. This is known as the Shannon number. And it happens to be much (much!) bigger than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which is estimated between 1078 and 1082, give or take. Like Babbage, Shannon realized chess is a rather complex game. Okay, so what do we do? We may be too ambitious, and playing the perfect chess game sets the bar somewhat high. Magnus Carlsen would be the first to admit that he became a world champion while playing far from perfect chess. Instead, Shannon set the task to create a program that can play “a skillful game, perhaps comparable to that of a good human player.” He worked toward creating a strategy: choosing from the possible legal moves in a chess position based on the evaluation of the position. Just like Turing and Champernowne, Shannon mentioned the relative value of the chess pieces (such as that the rook is worth about five pawns) as well as king safety while also speaking about more sophisticated concepts like “open files” and “weak pawns.” But how do we make sure that a computer chooses, from the infinite universe of possibilities, a decent move without thinking for too long? Also here, Shannon has been instrumental in developing computer chess by distinguishing two types of searching for the best move in a position. Type A is known as the “brute-force search,” looking at every variation to a given depth—say, three moves for each side—and then deciding. The alternative method, Type B, is “selective search”: here, the computer, instead of looking at all possible moves each time, looks at important branches of the tree only; namely, the branches that include, for example, checks, captures, and attacking moves. A year later Turing presented similar ideas in his article “Digital Computers Applied to Games” (1951), published independently from Shannon. Therefore, Shannon gets the credit for being the first to put on paper a strategy for a computer to meticulously select its moves, while Turing will always be known as the architect of the first-ever chess algorithm. Early Chess Programs Around the same time Turing and Shannon wrote their groundbreaking papers on chess and computer intelligence, the first generation of electronic computers was born. Between 1935 and 1945 the first digital computing machines were built, largely thanks to the need for warfare-related mathematical computations. These machines were created for table-making, ballistics calculations, and codebreaking tasks. Chess was still too complex for the early electronic computers that appeared in the 1950s, but that didn’t stop humans from attempting to program chess into the giant mainframe machines that took up the space of a large living room. (Apart from their improvements in speed and memory, the most striking part of the evolution of computers in the second half of the twentieth century was their change in size.) The challenge was just too exciting to let go of, as chess, the famous board game that had kept its prestige throughout the centuries, was seen as a representative measure of intelligence. And if chess was “too big to handle,” they would just make it … smaller. That’s what a team of scientists did at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, where the atomic bomb had been invented. The laboratory obtained the state-of-the-art MANIAC I computer to help with the necessary computations for nuclear weapons. In their spare time, when not occupied with further developing the most murderous weapon in history, the researchers created a chess program that could play on a smaller chessboard, with only 6 × 6 squares and no bishops. Why? Because even the MANIAC was too limited in memory and computing power to deal with 8 × 8 squares and 32 pieces. In any case, this “handicapped” computer chess program worked, and it is said to have won a game in 1956 against someone who had just learned the rules a week earlier, making it the first machine to beat a human fair and square in (a form of) chess. The American technology company International Business Machines was involved with computer chess much earlier than its famous matches with Kasparov in the 1990s. In fact, IBM had already set a record four decades before it would beat the world champion in chess. In 1957, an IBM 704 mainframe computer, a 9.7-ton vacuum tube machine, was the first that could run a fully automated chess engine, playing the game with no limitations. The program was written by IBM’s engineer and mathematician Alex Bernstein, and it took about eight minutes to make a move. On the Computer History Museum website, you can see wonderful footage of Bernstein sitting behind a chess set next to a giant machine full of lights, buttons, and levers. As the voiceover notes, the chess-playing program was given to the computer on a reel of magnetic tape. While Bernstein executed the moves for both sides on the chess set, he communicated them to the 704 by pressing down about a dozen levers and lifting them again in a specific order. The machine printed out the new position following each move, and after calculating its new move, it printed that out too. How deep was this computer thinking? Well, let’s listen to the film voiceover: Los Alamos physicist Paul Stein, left, and MANIAC project leader Nicholas Metropolis, right, play 6 × 6 chess against MANIAC, without bishops, 1956. In calculating its moves, the machine considers the board square by square. Is the square occupied? By whose men? Is it under attack? Can it be defended? Can it be occupied? All this is taking a long time by computer standards: one-tenth of a second. Now the computer proceeds to select its move. It has about 30 possible moves. After asking eight preliminary questions about each of them, it selects seven of the 30 for further analysis. It tests each of the seven through four moves ahead, considering its opponent’s possible replies and its own possible counter-responses in each case. It examines 2,800 positions in eight minutes. As it turns out, Bernstein’s program was a prototype of Shannon’s Type B kind of thinking because, in addition to brute-force calculation, there was some form of selective search. However, if he played the same moves in a new game, the computer would make the same moves and lose in the exact same way. The film footage ends with: “Someday, though not soon, Mr. Bernstein feels a program may be designed that will enable the computer to profit by its own mistakes and improve its chess game on the basis of its experience against human opponents.” It would take another 60 years for AlphaZero to appear on the scene (we’ll meet this computer program in the next chapter) and for reinforcement learning, alongside artificial neural networks, to become a key factor in chess engine improvement. Building on Bernstein’s landmark chess program, Alan Kotok and four of his classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created an improved version in 1962, which also ran on a newer computer: the IBM 7090. Since we’re keeping track of records, I mention Kotok’s program primarily for being the first-ever chess computer to lose to another chess computer. That story begins with a visit by the computer scientist John McCarthy (famously the first to coin the term artificial intelligence in 1956) to the Soviet Union in 1965. The Soviets hadn’t been sitting still, having created not only their own atomic bomb but also their own chess-playing program. In Moscow, McCarthy talked about his student Kotok and his chess program, after which he was challenged to a chess match against their chess program. Then, a year later, half a decade before Fischer–Spassky, a US versus USSR computer chess match was played by telegraph in 1966–67, and was won by the Soviet program. (Not that I want to suggest any type of violation of fair play, but it should be noted that the Russian team was advised by a certain Mr. Mikhail Botvinnik, who had a PhD in electrical engineering but also happened to be a former world chess champion.) The Soviet chess program was further developed into Kaissa, the first Computer Chess World Championship winner in 1974. By then, about 200 chess programs had already been developed, and special world championship tournaments for chess computers started to be organized every three years. During that first official championship, held in Stockholm, Sweden, Kaissa could not run on a local machine because of its unique Soviet operating system. It ran on a machine in Moscow instead, and the moves were communicated by telephone. Out of fear that the Soviets might cheat with their program and have someone interfere with the moves, the organizers had made sure someone was in the computer room to oversee the relay of moves. The Levy Bet The English chess master David Levy was instrumental in organizing those early computer chess tournaments in the 1970s and remained a key figure in the computer chess world for decades. In August 1968, Levy attended a machine intelligence workshop at Edinburgh University. He won a casual chess game at a cocktail party against John McCarthy, who then worked at Stanford. After the game, McCarthy said, “Well, David, you might be able to beat me, but I’m sure that in ten years there will be a computer program that will be able to beat you!” The optimism among computer pioneers was remarkable in those days. A decade earlier, in 1957, the American economist and political scientist Herbert Simon, who also worked in computer science, had proclaimed that a digital computer would beat the world chess champion within ten years. That was three decades off the mark. It should be noted that chess players did much better in the prediction game. The famous Russian grandmaster Yuri Averbakh, who was for many years the oldest grandmaster in the world until he died in May 2022, aged 100, appeared in a Moscow television show in 1963 and predicted that a computer would beat the world chess champion in 1998. Pretty close! But, back to that cocktail party in 1968. Levy, the reigning Scottish champion, thought John McCarthy’s prediction was utter nonsense and put up a bet of £500 (then worth $1,250), which was more than half his annual salary. McCarthy called over to Donald Michie—a British computer scientist who had worked with Alan Turing and others at Bletchley Park—who was also in the room. Upon hearing it, Michie said, “Can I take half the bet?” In subsequent years, a few more machine intelligence researchers joined and added to the bet until it had grown to £1,250 ($2,925) in 1974. It wasn’t until 1977 that a chess program was strong enough to put up a decent fight and seriously test the bet. Levy played a two-game match against CHESS 4.5, a program created by Larry Atkin, Keith Gorlen, and David Slate, computer scientists at Northwestern University. The program had participated successfully in human events and even won the 1977 Minnesota Open. The way Levy describes the match in his 1980 book More Chess and Computers echoes the sentiment of Kasparov upon facing Deep Blue almost twenty years later: “It was time for me to face up to my responsibilities and to defend the human race against the coming invasion.” Levy won the first game, after which the second game was not played because the best the computer could possibly do was tie the two-game match. In the following months, Levy won a few more matches, including one against Mac Hack, a program created by Richard Greenblatt at MIT. The program, also known as the Greenblatt Chess Program, had played against Bobby Fischer in spring 1977. (See annotated game on pages 385–86. Fischer crushed the chess program in three games and sent the notation to the Computer Chess Newsletter. These were Fischer’s first published games since his match with Boris Spassky in 1972, and the last until their rematch in 1992.) Then shortly before the ten-year deadline of the bet, in August–September 1978, Levy played a six-game match against CHESS 4.7, Slate and Atkins’s latest version, which ran on a CDC Cyber 176 mainframe computer located in Minneapolis (see annotated game on pages 386–87). Playing in a tuxedo in a soundproof booth at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Levy also won this match, but this time the computer managed to draw one game and win another. The world had witnessed the first computer victory against a human master in a serious event! Levy called the whole affair the end of an era in the annals of computer chess: “I had proved that my 1968 assessment had been correct, but, on the other hand, my opponent in this match was very, very much stronger than I had believed possible when I started the bet.” Shortly after winning the bet, Levy, in turn, offered a prize of $1,000 to the first programming team that would write a program capable of beating him in a four- or six-game match—to which the magazine Omni added another $4,000. It took some years (and one more failed attempt by the program Cray Blitz in 1984), but by 1989 the time had come. The program Deep Thought managed to beat Levy in a four-game match, winning all four games—the true end of an era. Well, Levy’s era. “I was quite happy,” he said much later. “I’d had a good run for my money: 21 years against an original bet of ten years. I think I sort of held out the human end versus machine struggles in chess pretty well. I got a lot of publicity; it was very good for my career.” While computer engineers were hopelessly optimistic in the 1960s and 1970s, chess grandmasters were eager to point that out, if only to defend their special status as intelligent thinkers. And they were right: those early chess programs were, simply put, rather terrible at chess. Another factor was that their progress was plodding. Back then, computers gained less than 200 rating points in strength per decade—a gap that humans can often bridge with a few years of studying and playing the game. In his famous 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, a discussion about the development of chess computers inspired Douglas Hofstadter to coin “Hofstadter’s Law”: “It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.” According to Hofstadter, Herbert Simon’s flawed prediction in 1957 was “just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter’s Law.” Although it would take some more years before humans had reasons to be worried, a small revolution did take place in the computer chess world in 1980, when the program Belle won the Computer World Chess Championship in Linz, Austria, ahead of 17 other programs. Developed by Ken Thompson, Belle was named after Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Bell Labs), where Thompson worked four decades after Turing. Thompson is a legendary name within computer science: as the developer of multiple programming languages and as one of the two creators (alongside Dennis Ritchie) of the Unix operating system—the foundation of Apple computers and Android phones. “Ken is the smartest person I ever met,” the German computer chess expert Frederic Friedel told me. Thompson wrote his first chess program to work in Unix in 1971, which saw many different iterations over the following years. It grew particularly strong after Joe Condon, a colleague of Thompson’s at Bell Labs, implemented a hardware-based move generator to be used with the software version of Belle. In 1980, running on an LSI-11 computer with that special piece of “chess hardware,” it could calculate 100,000 to 200,000 moves per second. Computer programs were now also participating in human tournaments, making them eligible for an Elo rating. In 1983 Belle became the first computer to attain the rating of a “master” under the terms of the United States Chess Federation (USCF) titles system. Kasparov–Deep Blue, 1996 On June 5, 1985, five months before he beat Anatoly Karpov and became the 13th World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov played a remarkable simultaneous exhibition in Hamburg, Germany. All of his opponents were microcomputers. The four leading companies of the time that produced chess computers for the consumer market, Hegener & Glaser, Fidelity Electronics, Novag, and SciSys, all participated with their strongest four models. Kasparov won all games: 32–0. He likes to refer to this time as “the good old days of computer chess,” and it’s understandable why. The 1980s would be the last decade in which humans could still laugh at computers playing chess. Incidentally, in that same year of 1985, three computer science graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—Feng-Hsiung Hsu, Thomas Anantharaman, and Murray Campbell—created a chess program called ChipTest. It was based on new Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) technology that allowed millions of transistors to be placed onto a single chip. Hsu had worked on a special chess-move generator chip—in other words, a chip specially designed to do one thing: play chess. Such chips were then duplicated and used in parallel, and, as a result, his early program could search approximately 50,000 moves per second. “I had the basic blueprint to build the mother of all chess machines, a machine that could defeat the world champion. In other words, I had a chance to pursue one of the oldest holy grails in computer science and possibly make history,” the Taiwan-born Hsu would later write. Further development improved ChipTest significantly in terms of programming and search, and in 1988 it was renamed Deep Thought, after the supercomputer in Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. A year later, now capable of searching 720,000 moves per second, Deep Thought won the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship with a perfect 5–0 score. It attracted even more attention when it participated in an open tournament in Long Beach, California, and became the first computer to beat a human grandmaster in an official tournament. The victim was none other than Bent Larsen, a former world championship candidate from Denmark. Later that year, Deep Thought defeated David Levy, who made the wager described earlier in the chapter, 4–0. Meanwhile, Kasparov had made friends with the aforementioned Friedel, who had co-organized the computer simul that Kasparov played in 1985. Based on correspondence between Friedel and the Deep Thought team, it’s interesting to see Kasparov’s thoughts on computers back then: Beginning of 1988: “Computers will never beat grandmasters.” Mid-1988: “Computers will never beat strong grandmasters.” End of 1988: “Okay, yes, Bent [Larsen] is a strong grandmaster. But a computer will never beat Karpov or me.” Kasparov played Deep Thought a bit later, in October 1989, at the New York Academy of Art. He won both games easily, which was only the start of IBM’s journey. Murray Campbell had joined the company in September, and Hsu joined a month later after defending his thesis at Carnegie Mellon. Hsu worked as a system architect and chip designer at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in Westchester County until 1999. How he and Campbell ended up at IBM is a great story. Peter Brown, who had earned his PhD in computer science at Carnegie Mellon, was working at IBM’s speech group, developing computer software to transcribe spoken text. Brown had heard about Hsu’s team and project. In his 2002 book Behind Deep Blue, Hsu wrote: Peter happened to be in the men’s room with Abe Peled, the IBM Research Vice President of Computer Science. They started talking about how expensive the Super Bowl TV commercial spots were. Peter suggested that he knew a way to gain much greater publicity at a far lower cost. He knew this group of graduate students working on computer chess at Carnegie Mellon, and he believed that this team would create the first chess machine to beat the world champion. Given the historical significance of the quest and the latent public interest, IBM could stand to gain huge advertising value from the endeavor. Oh, yes, members of the team were world-class people that IBM would be interested in hiring anyway. Abe got interested and asked Peter to look into it. In early 1996, the time had come for the biggest man versus machine clash in history. Finally, the world chess champion himself would sit down at the board facing a silicon opponent with, literally, nerves of steel. Kasparov had agreed to play IBM’s latest iteration, now named Deep Blue (after IBM’s nickname Big Blue), in a six-game match that would celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was played February 10–17 at the Philadelphia Convention Center for a $500,000 prize fund, with $400,000 going to the winner. Deep Blue was running on an IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer. Located in a lab in Yorktown Heights, New York, the 36-way machine consisted of 16-CPU frames plus four workstations, with 216 chess chips working together, and using an opening book developed by the American grandmaster Joel Benjamin. This meant that during the opening phase, the machine didn’t need to think but could rely on pre-programmed moves that were known to be good from human grandmaster practice. Six and a half years after its younger brother Deep Thought lost without a chance against Kasparov, Deep Blue proved up to the task: it won the first game (see annotated game on pages 389–90). It was a historic first victory for the computer against the strongest human player in a long time control game. Apart from the incredible search speed of 100 million positions per second, there was another reason why this computer was so strong. Hsu explained that the special chess chips evaluated the game positions more thoroughly than any other chess program: “Almost all the evaluation function terms were computed directly on chip.” As the computer scored its first win, the match was instantly front-page news, covered by outlets such as the New York Times and USA Today, and on television by The Tonight Show, Late Night with David Letterman, and Saturday Night Live. The interest in the match exceeded all expectations. “The IBM match website quickly turned into the most popular website up to that point in time, exceeding even the Super Bowl website and the Swimsuit Edition website of Sports Illustrated,” wrote Hsu. Chess fans had trouble accessing the site, and IBM dedicated another IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer, identical to the one running Deep Blue, to handle the server load. During a walk with Friedel on the streets of Philadelphia on the evening of that first game, Kasparov asked his friend: “Frederic, what if this thing is invincible?” It wasn’t yet. In the second game, Kasparov immediately took revenge, after which two draws followed. The score was equal, but Kasparov finished with two wins to win the match convincingly—not knowing this would be the last time a human ever won a multi-game match against a computer. The 1997 Match: The Holy Grail With all the media attention the match had attracted, it didn’t take long for IBM to suggest a return match the following year, and Kasparov agreed. This historic encounter for chess and AI was held May 3–11, 1997, in the Equitable Center in New York City, then headquarters of the Equitable Insurance firm. All over Manhattan there were posters on billboards with a portrait of Kasparov watching over chess pieces, and the tagline: “How do you make a computer blink?” The spectators watched from a 480-seat auditorium in the basement, with grandmaster Yasser Seirawan, then international master (now grandmaster) Maurice Ashley, and computer expert and international master Mike Valvo as commentators. Incidentally, they had access to Fritz 4, so they could pick another silicon brain whenever they wanted. There were three huge projection screens at the front. The left screen showed live footage from a studio on the 35th floor, where the games were played. For this rematch, IBM developed a new RS/6000 SP supercomputer with double the CPU speed, 480 new chess chips and a new evaluation function based on training games with grandmasters. Its calculation speed had also doubled to a staggering 200 million positions per second. The machine weighed over 1.5 tons and cost $10 million to construct. The prize fund was $1.1 million, with $700,000 for the winner, but both sides knew much more was at stake. Unlike the first match, this time the media attention was huge from the very start. Two hundred journalists showed up for the opening press conference, including the crews of TV networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox, and the BBC. As the match progressed, more and more reporters arrived, and the press conferences had to be moved to a bigger room. The media labeled the match as a clash between man and machine, with Newsweek’s cover calling it “The Brain’s Last Stand.” Six years later, Hsu wrote in his book that he saw it differently: as a match between “man as a performer and man as a toolmaker.” Kasparov playing the black pieces in one of the games of his 1997 rematch with Deep Blue, this day operated by IBM system architect Feng-Hsiung Hsu, right. Over the first four games, the match score completely mirrored the year before. This time, the 34-year-old Kasparov started with a win but then lost the second game, followed by two draws. His victory in the first game went surprisingly easily, but the Deep Blue team was quite content afterward. They were happy with the overall level of play they had seen and knew they only needed slight adjustments to fix the issues from game one, mostly related to the correct evaluation of king safety. Then came the second game—in hindsight, the key game for the whole match (see annotated game on pages 390–91). Deep Blue played remarkably well in a fairly “closed” middlegame, meaning a position with a blocked pawn formation in the center. Normally speaking, humans were better in those types of positions that required long-term maneuvering. Kasparov didn’t know that Joel Benjamin had trained the machine for months, especially for such positions. The computer had more space and skillfully used a potential open file, doubling its rooks before opening it. This reminded me of a famous maneuver by Kasparov’s nemesis Anatoly Karpov, who once used a bishop to “close off” a file before taking control of it. The programmers were happy that a recent update to their evaluation function of Deep Blue, which appreciated open files more, came to fruition. Unexpectedly, the computer opened a new front on the kingside (a move that felt strangely human!) before entering with its pieces on the queenside. Kasparov decided to sacrifice a pawn, but Deep Blue surprised everyone again by not accepting the sacrifice. It played a quiet bishop move instead—another move reminiscent of the chess played by Kasparov’s greatest human rival. “Maybe they gave Karpov a call in Moscow,” joked one of the commentators during the game. The move was subtle but lethal, and, a few moves later, Kasparov threw in the towel. It was the best game ever played by a computer: real chess, played in human style. It had passed the Turing Test gloriously! But there was one issue: Deep Blue’s last move wasn’t good at all. You could even call it a blunder. Later that evening, the English journalist and organizer Malcolm Pein, who was in close contact with both IBM and the Kasparov team, received a phone call from the Norwegian American grandmaster and reporter Jonathan Tisdall. “I think I have a story, but nobody wants to use it,” Tisdall said. “Did you see Ferret’s analysis? It gives zeros!” Tisdall was referring to the analysis engine of the Internet Chess Club (more on that in Chapter 8), which also suggested the final position to be equal. “I thought that was a mistake, but after Tisdall’s call, I gave it a closer look,” said Pein. “And then I broke the story in the Daily Telegraph: ‘Kasparov Resigns in Drawn Position.’ ” As it turned out, Kasparov could have entered White’s position with his queen and played for perpetual check (endless checks, out of which there is no escape, leading to a move repetition). Friedel came to the same conclusion after analyzing the position with his chess engine Fritz, and the next morning he told the Russian grandmaster Yury Dokhoian, Kasparov’s main chess assistant. Dokhoian was shocked to realize that it could be true. Of course, he had discussed that final position with Kasparov the night before, but they had overlooked an important possibility that was part of Friedel’s analysis. When the team went for a walk to have lunch, Dokhoian told Kasparov the bad news. Friedel wrote, “Garry clutched his head and froze in the middle of Fifth Avenue. There were no expletives, no cursing, just stunned silence.” It was a combination of disbelief and confusion. How could a computer that strong, from a position with an overwhelming advantage, suddenly allow a draw? According to Hsu, Deep Blue’s strange choice resulted from some kind of bug, but this crucial piece of information was only revealed six years later. To Kasparov, the difference between Deep Blue’s level of play in games one and two was night and day, which further fueled his suspicions that something was off. Two draws followed, and the mirrored score with the 1996 match ended when the fifth game was also drawn. With a tied score, the sixth and last game would decide everything. Minutes before the start of that final game, fans were still trying to get into the Equitable Center. Hsu wrote, “The official price for a place in the 500-seat auditorium was $25, but spare tickets are changing hands for as much as $100. It’s the hottest gig in town.” In the opening, a Caro–Kann defense, Kasparov played a risky move order, which allowed White to play a promising piece sacrifice based on long-term compensation. If the computer decided against it, Kasparov would have an easy game—the expected scenario. The sacrifice was supposed to be too long-term for a computer to evaluate properly and something only humans would play unless it were part of the machine’s opening book (Deep Blue’s “homework” created by IBM’s grandmasters’ team). Kasparov must have estimated the odds of that almost zero since he rarely played the Caro–Kann. Without spending time on the clock, Deep Blue gave up its knight instantly, shocking Kasparov and viewers across the globe. Kasparov’s king was soon deprived of the right to castle and had to run for safety. Deep Blue continued the game with simple developing moves to fully mobilize its army and threw in some powerful pawn pushes on the queenside to reach a winning position as early as move 19. It was suddenly all over: Kasparov was blown off the board. He had lost the match (see annotated game on pages 391–92). How could Deep Blue know it had to sacrifice its knight? In his 2002 book, Hsu wrote that the move was indeed part of the opening book: “The position on the playing board had actually shown up in our lab about a month earlier when the other grandmasters were working on Deep Blue’s opening book. At the time, the grandmasters did not bother to play out the position either; they just looked at Deep Blue’s evaluation of the position and moved to other work.” In a controversial interview in 2009, one of the team members, the Spanish grandmaster Miguel Illescas, shared a different version of what happened: White’s crucial eighth move had been included in the opening book the morning before the game was played. According to Kasparov, who wrote down his thoughts on the match in his 2017 book Deep Thinking, that was too much of a coincidence: “The odds of winning the lottery are quite attractive in comparison to those of the Deep Blue team entering a specific variation I had never played before in my life into the computer’s book on the very same day it appeared on the board in the final game.” It should be noted that another Deep Blue team member, Joel Benjamin, later said that Illescas’s statement was simply not true; White’s eighth move had been part of the computer’s opening book for a long time. I decided to double-check with Illescas for this book. He replied in an email, saying he agreed with Joel, who “knew better about the Caro–Kann.” Malcolm Pein has his own theory about what happened. “It still annoys me to this day,” he told me in December 2023. “They [Kasparov’s team] were convinced that Deep Blue was taking its opening moves from Richard Lang’s ChessGenius program, a popular engine at the time, and asked me to buy a copy. I told them I was a hundred percent certain it wasn’t using that, but they were convinced. I spent quite a sum of money at the chess shop near Huntington Station and gave them the program. They were misled. They misled themselves.” After his resignation, Kasparov’s mother convinced her son to take the elevator to the 50th floor for the post-match press conference, where he faced hundreds of photographers and reporters. Hsu: “He stared into the middle-distance, over everyone’s head, avoiding eye contact and scarcely blinking, looking like he might spontaneously combust. There was only mild applause when the winning Deep Blue team arrived; it was as though everyone was slightly embarrassed or perhaps afraid to cheer for fear of offending the mighty Garry.” People applauded when he took the microphone, though, and as soon as he started talking, Kasparov started to dominate the conversation. He wasn’t happy. “I’m sorry, I haven’t deserved that, and I have to apologize for today’s performance, but I don’t think it has anything to do with chess or the match. I had no real strength to fight, and I think the result of the so-called ‘game’ today was justified,” he stated. Standing among the reporters, the members of the Deep Blue team had been told by the company’s PR people not to smile. As Kasparov continued, they didn’t have much reason to anyway. “I think it’s time for Deep Blue to start playing real chess, and I personally assure you, everybody here, that if Deep Blue will start playing competitive chess, I personally guarantee you I’ll tear it into pieces, with no question,” Kasparov said fiercely. He then pointed his arrows to the several grandmasters who had helped the Deep Blue programmers: “How many players they will hire, they have to put more players, of course, on the bench because some of them are probably too shy to show up; they can hire the entire [grandmaster] force of the United States of America, it will not help because we know how a machine plays.” He wasn’t holding back: Kasparov thought the match had been unfair. “Put it in competitive chess, put it in a fair contest, not that one, make IBM a player, not a sponsor at the same time. I will see what’s going to happen, and I think it’s just the beginning,” he said. But within days, IBM announced there wouldn’t be a third match. And why would there be? For them, there was hardly anything to gain. Their match victory led to incredible global media coverage and did only good for the company’s value. Some have suggested it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars in PR. IBM claimed that the entire Deep Blue project had cost them $20 million, and after the second match their market capitalization increased by billions overnight. Remember IBM’s Peter Brown complaining about the cost of a Super Bowl advertisement in the men’s room and realizing the potential of those chess developers to create something of bigger value? Well, that kind of came about, didn’t it? In another funny twist, during the 2001 Super Bowl television broadcast, Pepsi ran a spot featuring Kasparov, clearly inspired by the match. This time, Kasparov defeated the computer (modeled on HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation of 2001: A Space Odyssey) but then got troubled by an elevator and a Pepsi vending machine, the machines taking revenge. The price for a 30-second Super Bowl ad was roughly $2.2 million at the time. Most experts believe Kasparov was still stronger than Deep Blue in 1997—so why did he lose the match? Because he was human. Already during the match, Kasparov admitted that he got carried away, in an interview with the English grandmaster Daniel King that was included in King’s 1997 book on the match. The day after the fourth game, Kasparov told King: “Game 2 took a lot of energy out of me; afterward I was really furious. I couldn’t prepare normally. I played games 3 and 4 in a big crisis.” One of the things Kasparov was not happy about was that IBM had declined his request to see the logs of the played games. Some of Deep Blue’s moves seemed overly human (such as not accepting his pawn sacrifice in the second game), so he wanted to see the exact lines of what it had been thinking about. In his 2002 book, Hsu would call this “a request for an unfair advantage,” adding that the match “would have been a sham if he were given free access.” In any case, Kasparov’s psychological state wasn’t where it should have been. In hindsight, he forecasted his demise in that conversation with King before the fifth game: “Whatever happens in this match, I know Deep Blue can be beaten unless the man—in this case me—is not in the right mental condition. It can only win because of human weakness.” Those turned out to be prophetic words. One of Kasparov’s strategies in the match was that he played more quiet openings than usual because he felt Deep Blue would struggle more against those. It has been suggested that Kasparov would have fared better if he had used his normal openings, but I feel that his mindset was a much more decisive factor. Kasparov is a rather emotional human being. There’s nothing wrong with that, but as soon as all the suspicions about human interference and other negative thoughts started to dominate his mind, he could no longer play his best chess. I also think Kasparov could have beaten Deep Blue in that second match if only he had played his best chess. After winning the first match in 1996, Kasparov had estimated the computer’s strength at roughly 2700, and it had taken IBM six years to reach that, being rated roughly 2550 in 1990. “I had trouble believing they could get it up to my 2800 level without a few more years of development,” was Kasparov’s position then. Besides the fact that IBM was going to invest millions—having seen what this match did in PR terms and what potential a possible victory had—what Kasparov underestimated was that there was also a chance for him not to perform at 2800 level the next year. Because of the enormous pressure, because of this particular opponent, one which lacked emotion, and because the match was only six games, a psychological disturbance could change a lot—and that’s what happened. Kasparov self-destructed. Was Deep Blue Intelligent? With each new product of AI research—from IBM’s Deep Blue to their Watson, which defeated human opponents at Jeopardy!, to ChatGPT—the same old question pops up: “Is it intelligent?” After winning his first match against Deep Blue in 1996, Kasparov wrote an article in TIME magazine titled “The Day I Sensed a New Kind of Intelligence,” where he reflected on the fact that, for the first time, he felt that a computer had played in a rather human manner. However, the way it figured out those human moves was not the same. Kasparov wondered: “So the question is, if the computer makes the same move that I would make for completely different reasons, has it made an ‘intelligent’ move? Is the intelligence of an action dependent on who (or what) takes it?” At that point, he felt he might have a few more years left before a computer would beat him, but it turned out to be only 15 months more. In his 2017 book Deep Thinking, Kasparov firmly said no to the notion that he had lost to an intelligent entity: “Deep Blue was intelligent the way your programmable alarm clock is intelligent. Not that losing to a $10 million alarm clock made me feel any better.” Deep Blue’s main programmer, Feng-Hsiung Hsu, agreed here, noting subtly, “It is only a finely crafted tool that exhibits intelligent behavior in a limited domain. Garry lost the match, but he was the player with the real intelligence—Deep Blue would never be able to come up with the imaginative accusations.” Two decades after losing the match, Kasparov elaborated on his point about losing to an alarm clock. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman in 2019, the 13th World Chess Champion said: Considering chess as the sort of pinnacle of intellectual activities was our mistake because we just thought, “Oh, it’s a game of the highest intellect, you have to be intelligent, and you could see things that the ordinary mortals could not see …” It’s a game. All machines had to do with this game was to make fewer mistakes, not to solve the game. Because the game cannot be solved … I think that is what we have to learn from the 1997 experience and from further encounters with computers and sort of the current state of affairs with AlphaZero beating other machines. The idea that we can compete with computers in so-called intellectual fields: it was wrong from the very beginning. Kasparov already knew in 1997 that computers would soon take over from humans, but he played the match anyway because he felt (and rightly so) that he was still capable of postponing the inevitable a little longer. The insight he had gained two decades later was that in the long run, computers will always be better than humans at avoiding mistakes in closed games with perfect information, which forms only a small subcategory of what we call intelligence. Game six of the 1997 match was Deep Blue’s last official game. After dismantling, it was separated into two halves, with one sent to the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC. IBM held onto the other half for a few years before donating it to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Deep Blue’s victory over Kasparov didn’t stop humans from playing chess against computers right away. In fact, it would take almost a decade for everyone to agree that computers were better chess players than humans, as we will see in the next chapter. There, we will also learn about another pivotal moment for AI and chess—the appearance of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, and what it meant for the game.",

Thirty-four-year-old Garry Kasparov, the best chess player on the planet, sits with his head in his left hand and looks out into the crowd. On the first row, he sees his mother, Klara, who accompanies him to all his important matches. He starts shaking his head. As he takes a few more seconds to accept the inevitable, Kasparov eventually offers his hand to the game operator, quickly signs the scoresheet, and walks straight out of the room with both hands up. The video showing Kasparov’s resignation would be played in news bulletins worldwide as the supercomputer Deep Blue’s win was heralded as the machine’s victory over mankind. The footage went viral a decade before social media became a thing. In his late-night show, David Letterman joked, “Over the weekend, world chess champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by the IBM computer, Deep Blue. Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. In a related story, earlier today, the New York Mets were defeated by a microwave oven.” Deep Blue’s victory against Garry Kasparov in 1997 was a significant milestone for artificial intelligence. At the time, the match symbolized the competition between humans and computers at the highest level of intelligence, setting Deep Blue’s win as a marker of AI’s potential to surpass human performance in complex tasks. It was a legendary match, which had its origins almost 200 years earlier, when a young man marveled at automatons. Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine In 1800, a boy of about nine years old, accompanied by his mother, stepped into the depths of John Joseph Merlin’s Mechanical Museum in the heart of London. It was an enigmatic place filled with gadgets and wonders, such as a gambling machine, perpetual-motion clocks and a collection of alluring music boxes. The boy’s eyes were transfixed, captivated by the mysterious mechanisms before him. Little did he know, on that fateful day in central London, one of the early seeds of artificial intelligence would be planted deep within his young mind. The boy’s name was Charles Babbage. The nineteenth century’s renowned mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer designed his Difference Engine in 1822, an audacious creation to generate error-free logarithmic tables. It was an early example of a mechanical computer, where the term computer should be understood as a machine that can compute or calculate something. Around 1833, Babbage started working on his even more ambitious Analytical Engine. This was a mechanical, general-purpose computer that would use punched cards for programming and have a “store” for memory, a mill for computations, and a control unit for instruction sequencing. It was to perform arithmetic operations, support conditional branching and looping, and store intermediate results. An engraving of a section of Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine No. 1, from the frontispiece of his autobiography Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, 1864. None of Babbage’s engines, which would have been roughly the size of a room and extraordinarily heavy, were completed in his lifetime due to disputes with the engineers and the collapse of the British government’s funding. Still, they laid the foundation for subsequent developments in computing technology in the twentieth century. In his autobiography, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, from 1864, Babbage revealed that he had intended to “test” his Analytical Engine and see whether it could play “a game of purely intellectual skill successfully” such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, or chess. He concluded that theoretically, it should be possible, but that chess encountered practical limitations. “In consequence of this, the whole question of making an automaton play any game depended on the possibility of the machine being able to represent all the myriads of combinations relating to it,” Babbage wrote. That “myriad of combinations” turned out too large for such a machine (and we will soon learn why): “Allowing one hundred moves on each side for the longest game at chess, I found that the combinations involved in the Analytical Engine enormously surpassed any required, even by the game of chess.” He spent more time on tic-tac-toe, but also here, while leaving many design sketches, he could not create an actual machine himself. Although Babbage’s influence on computer chess is limited, there is a link between his Analytical Machine and the earliest computers of the twentieth century. It is, therefore, fascinating to consider that one of the brightest minds of his time was at least thinking along the same lines as the first explorers of artificial intelligence, but more than a century earlier. And, in this case too, chess had played its part. Alan Turing and His Paper Machine If I ask the reader when the first computer chess program was written, you will probably start thinking about the number of years since the first electronic computer appeared. However, the answer may astound you: it was a few years before such a computer was born. The man who wrote it was Alan Turing. Born in 1912 in London, Turing emerged as one of the twentieth century’s most brilliant and visionary minds. His contributions to computer science, his role as a codebreaker during World War II at Bletchley Park, and his pioneering work in artificial intelligence and early computer design have secured his legacy. Oh, and he also liked chess. While working at Bletchley Park, Turing had plenty of opportunities to play during breaks. Among the codebreakers who regularly penetrated and deciphered the coded messages of the Germans, Italians, and Japanese were many strong chess players, including three members of the English team: Conel Hugh O’Donel Alexander (the reigning British champion at the time), Stuart Milner-Barry, and Harry Golombek. In 1948, when Turing was 36, he started writing his chess program. Assisted by his friend David Champernowne, Turing programmed the rules of the game but also created a set of values for the pieces (pawn = 1, knight = 3, bishop = 3½, rook = 5, queen = 10) and some positional evaluation functions, which gave numeric values to things like piece mobility, piece safety, castling, check, and mate. Some of these ideas are still valuable concepts used by modern-day chess programs. Turing and Champernowne called their chess-playing program the “Turochamp,” also known as “Turing’s Paper Machine.” Since a computer capable of running the program did not exist, Turing had to go through the algorithm for each move and calculate Turochamp’s next move with pencil and paper, thus acting as a human central processing unit (CPU). The whole process took more than half an hour per move. At the time, Turing’s chess computer program had evolved from what has been named “the Turing Machine.” He described it in his famous paper “On Computable Numbers,” published in 1936 when he was 24. Turing gave a mathematical description of a universal machine, an abstract model of a computing device capable of processing information. Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” posed a pivotal question that ignites passionate debate to this day: can machines think? In his quest for the answer, Turing first noted that you need definitions of “machine” and “think,” but then suggested something altogether different, which he called “the imitation game.” This notion, portrayed in the 2014 biographical film bearing the same name, is now immortalized as “the Turing Test.” It postulates that when a computer’s response becomes indistinguishable from a human’s, the boundaries of intelligence blur and the computer can be deemed to be thinking. Nowadays, the fundamental importance of the Turing Test in the field of AI is probably somewhat overrated. In fact, instead of a rigorous formal test, Turing himself saw the notion as more like a philosophical idea, a helpful thought experiment. In a podcast in July 2023, the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari described the Turing Test concisely as “a social test, not a logical proof.” Still, what’s nice about Turing’s 1950 paper is that it’s there, within those pages, that chess and AI started their joint journey through the twentieth century and beyond. In his imitation game, Turing gives four example questions (and supposed answers from the computer), two of them related to chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Count me out on this one, I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give an answer) 105621. Q: Do you play chess? A: Yes. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. (If the notation of the chess moves looks odd, that’s because in those days descriptive notation was still more common than today’s standard algebraic notation, which uses coordinates of squares, like in 1.e4, 2.Nf3.) As Garry Kasparov commented in 2012, Turing, in the above dialogue, placed chess somewhere between simple sums and poetry. Not a bad place for our game! This author couldn’t resist the temptation to feed OpenAI’s well-known chat program ChatGPT the same “prompts” to see what the Turing Test gave us in early 2023. The answers I got mainly demonstrated that, at that point in time, the chatbot knew its way among texts but didn’t really know how to play chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Upon the Firth of Forth, a bridge stands tall, A marvel of steel, engineering’s delight. It stands against the storm, will never fall, A beacon in the day, a star at night. Three diamond towers, reaching for the sky, An icon of the North, proud and true. Steel girders forming lines that please the eye, Connecting banks where once a ferry flew. Across the waters, trains in rhythm move, On tracks suspended high above the tide. Each crossing a testament to human groove, Of perseverance, pride, and nation’s stride. So here’s to Forth Bridge, in elegance draped, Man’s triumph over space, in steel shaped. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: The sum of 34957 and 70764 is 105721. Q: Do you play chess? A: As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t actually “play” chess in the sense that humans do. However, I can certainly assist with understanding the game, explaining the rules, discussing strategies, or analyzing moves and positions. If you provide a situation from a game, I can help interpret it or suggest possible moves. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: In the scenario you’ve described, it’s important to prevent the opposing king from moving to a safe position. The best move would be to use your rook to give checkmate. You can do this by moving your rook from R1 to R2. The king on K1 has no legal moves and is in check from the rook on R2, which is supported by your king on K6, resulting in checkmate. Please note that the naming conventions of chess positions can vary based on the system used. ChatGPT’s chess answer included a few correct facts, but its suggested move was nonsensical. I don’t think that’s because ChatGPT got confused by the descriptive notation; it did not understand chess yet. That is still the main issue with large language models (LLMs) at this point in time: they are not ready yet for real understanding like humans do (and hardly anyone understands them!). Initially, I thought that for ChatGPT to be able to think and solve chess problems, it would need to be somehow connected to a chess program, because without it, it is only using language by predicting which next word in the sentence makes the most sense. But, if we could combine that with a chess program, we would have the chess version of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which, according to some experts, might be less than a decade away. However, many months into writing this book, I came across a special version of the now infamous chatbot called “GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct,” released by OpenAI in September 2023. It is a more versatile tool that can be instructed more precisely to complete various tasks or answer questions. And, lo and behold, it also plays chess, at the level of the average club player, without any connection to an actual chess program. How is that possible? In an online article in early January 2024, research engineer Adam Karvonen explained that this model was only trained to predict the next character in chess notation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and was never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess: “Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.” Playing a decent game of chess by predicting the next move from chess notation, thereby learning much more about the actual game, is just incredible. It also shows that LLMs are developing so quickly that any judgment you make about their capabilities today could be out of date tomorrow. Shortly before finishing the first draft of this book, in February 2024, I tried Turing’s last question again, and now ChatGPT (still version 3.5!) answered it perfectly: “In the situation you described, with your king at K1 and no other pieces, and my king at K6 and rook at R1, I would play rook to R8, checkmating your king at K1. This move involves bringing the rook to the eighth rank and delivering checkmate to your king along the back rank.” Claude Shannon and His Number Turing’s lecture for the Royal Astronomical Society in 1947 is considered the earliest public lecture on machine intelligence. With his 1950 paper and chess-playing computer program, he showed for the first time that chess could be a model for mechanical thinking and machine intelligence. In the early 1950s the game was a testing ground for the new and developing area of computer science. In 1943, Turing had spent two months working on speech encryption at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City. There, he met the academic and philosophical engineer Claude Shannon, whose 1948 article “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” would become the founding work for the field of information theory. Like Turing, Shannon worked on cryptanalysis during World War II, and the two distinguished gentlemen shared an interest in chess. Seemingly independent from Turing, Shannon published an article titled “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess” in 1950 based on a lecture he had given to the Institute of Radio Engineers on March 9, 1949—coincidentally, Bobby Fischer’s sixth birthday. “This paper is concerned with the problem of constructing a computing routine or ‘program’ for a modern general-purpose computer which will enable it to play chess,” Shannon opened his article. For him, too, chess was a testing ground that could prove helpful for other areas. While constructing a chess computer program was “perhaps of no practical importance,” he wrote, “the question is of theoretical interest, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem will act as a wedge in attacking other problems of a similar nature and of greater significance.” Shannon also explained why chess was so valuable: The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require “thinking” for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of “thinking”; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers. Shannon theorized that each position in a chess game has three possible evaluations: a won position for White; a drawn position; or a won position for Black. To play a perfect game, without errors, all the program needs to do is calculate from the starting position till the moment of checkmate or a drawn position, and see which result follows in deciding which first move it needs to make. Easy? Well, there is a bit of an issue with this approach. The thing is: there are a lot of possible games to calculate. Like, a lot. In the first chapter, we saw the power of exponential growth explained by the legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, and here’s it no different. As famously noted, the number of possible chess games is bigger than the number of atoms in the universe, and Shannon was the first to point this out. Here’s why. In the starting position, White has 20 possible opening moves (eight pawns can be pushed either one square or two, and each knight, the only piece allowed to jump over other pieces or pawns, can go to two different squares). Black has the same 20 options, meaning 20 × 20 = 400 possible ways to start a chess game with one move for each side. If we give White one more move, the number of variations quickly grows to 8,902, and adding a second move for Black means there are 197,281 different possible starts. As the game progresses, the tree of possibilities grows at an exponential rate that is impossible to comprehend. Based on an average of about a thousand (103) possibilities for a pair of moves and a typical game lasting for about 40 such pairs of moves, Shannon concluded that there are 10120 variations (possible games) to be calculated from the initial position, which is a one followed by 120 zeroes. This is known as the Shannon number. And it happens to be much (much!) bigger than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which is estimated between 1078 and 1082, give or take. Like Babbage, Shannon realized chess is a rather complex game. Okay, so what do we do? We may be too ambitious, and playing the perfect chess game sets the bar somewhat high. Magnus Carlsen would be the first to admit that he became a world champion while playing far from perfect chess. Instead, Shannon set the task to create a program that can play “a skillful game, perhaps comparable to that of a good human player.” He worked toward creating a strategy: choosing from the possible legal moves in a chess position based on the evaluation of the position. Just like Turing and Champernowne, Shannon mentioned the relative value of the chess pieces (such as that the rook is worth about five pawns) as well as king safety while also speaking about more sophisticated concepts like “open files” and “weak pawns.” But how do we make sure that a computer chooses, from the infinite universe of possibilities, a decent move without thinking for too long? Also here, Shannon has been instrumental in developing computer chess by distinguishing two types of searching for the best move in a position. Type A is known as the “brute-force search,” looking at every variation to a given depth—say, three moves for each side—and then deciding. The alternative method, Type B, is “selective search”: here, the computer, instead of looking at all possible moves each time, looks at important branches of the tree only; namely, the branches that include, for example, checks, captures, and attacking moves. A year later Turing presented similar ideas in his article “Digital Computers Applied to Games” (1951), published independently from Shannon. Therefore, Shannon gets the credit for being the first to put on paper a strategy for a computer to meticulously select its moves, while Turing will always be known as the architect of the first-ever chess algorithm. Early Chess Programs Around the same time Turing and Shannon wrote their groundbreaking papers on chess and computer intelligence, the first generation of electronic computers was born. Between 1935 and 1945 the first digital computing machines were built, largely thanks to the need for warfare-related mathematical computations. These machines were created for table-making, ballistics calculations, and codebreaking tasks. Chess was still too complex for the early electronic computers that appeared in the 1950s, but that didn’t stop humans from attempting to program chess into the giant mainframe machines that took up the space of a large living room. (Apart from their improvements in speed and memory, the most striking part of the evolution of computers in the second half of the twentieth century was their change in size.) The challenge was just too exciting to let go of, as chess, the famous board game that had kept its prestige throughout the centuries, was seen as a representative measure of intelligence. And if chess was “too big to handle,” they would just make it … smaller. That’s what a team of scientists did at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, where the atomic bomb had been invented. The laboratory obtained the state-of-the-art MANIAC I computer to help with the necessary computations for nuclear weapons. In their spare time, when not occupied with further developing the most murderous weapon in history, the researchers created a chess program that could play on a smaller chessboard, with only 6 × 6 squares and no bishops. Why? Because even the MANIAC was too limited in memory and computing power to deal with 8 × 8 squares and 32 pieces. In any case, this “handicapped” computer chess program worked, and it is said to have won a game in 1956 against someone who had just learned the rules a week earlier, making it the first machine to beat a human fair and square in (a form of) chess. The American technology company International Business Machines was involved with computer chess much earlier than its famous matches with Kasparov in the 1990s. In fact, IBM had already set a record four decades before it would beat the world champion in chess. In 1957, an IBM 704 mainframe computer, a 9.7-ton vacuum tube machine, was the first that could run a fully automated chess engine, playing the game with no limitations. The program was written by IBM’s engineer and mathematician Alex Bernstein, and it took about eight minutes to make a move. On the Computer History Museum website, you can see wonderful footage of Bernstein sitting behind a chess set next to a giant machine full of lights, buttons, and levers. As the voiceover notes, the chess-playing program was given to the computer on a reel of magnetic tape. While Bernstein executed the moves for both sides on the chess set, he communicated them to the 704 by pressing down about a dozen levers and lifting them again in a specific order. The machine printed out the new position following each move, and after calculating its new move, it printed that out too. How deep was this computer thinking? Well, let’s listen to the film voiceover: Los Alamos physicist Paul Stein, left, and MANIAC project leader Nicholas Metropolis, right, play 6 × 6 chess against MANIAC, without bishops, 1956. In calculating its moves, the machine considers the board square by square. Is the square occupied? By whose men? Is it under attack? Can it be defended? Can it be occupied? All this is taking a long time by computer standards: one-tenth of a second. Now the computer proceeds to select its move. It has about 30 possible moves. After asking eight preliminary questions about each of them, it selects seven of the 30 for further analysis. It tests each of the seven through four moves ahead, considering its opponent’s possible replies and its own possible counter-responses in each case. It examines 2,800 positions in eight minutes. As it turns out, Bernstein’s program was a prototype of Shannon’s Type B kind of thinking because, in addition to brute-force calculation, there was some form of selective search. However, if he played the same moves in a new game, the computer would make the same moves and lose in the exact same way. The film footage ends with: “Someday, though not soon, Mr. Bernstein feels a program may be designed that will enable the computer to profit by its own mistakes and improve its chess game on the basis of its experience against human opponents.” It would take another 60 years for AlphaZero to appear on the scene (we’ll meet this computer program in the next chapter) and for reinforcement learning, alongside artificial neural networks, to become a key factor in chess engine improvement. Building on Bernstein’s landmark chess program, Alan Kotok and four of his classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created an improved version in 1962, which also ran on a newer computer: the IBM 7090. Since we’re keeping track of records, I mention Kotok’s program primarily for being the first-ever chess computer to lose to another chess computer. That story begins with a visit by the computer scientist John McCarthy (famously the first to coin the term artificial intelligence in 1956) to the Soviet Union in 1965. The Soviets hadn’t been sitting still, having created not only their own atomic bomb but also their own chess-playing program. In Moscow, McCarthy talked about his student Kotok and his chess program, after which he was challenged to a chess match against their chess program. Then, a year later, half a decade before Fischer–Spassky, a US versus USSR computer chess match was played by telegraph in 1966–67, and was won by the Soviet program. (Not that I want to suggest any type of violation of fair play, but it should be noted that the Russian team was advised by a certain Mr. Mikhail Botvinnik, who had a PhD in electrical engineering but also happened to be a former world chess champion.) The Soviet chess program was further developed into Kaissa, the first Computer Chess World Championship winner in 1974. By then, about 200 chess programs had already been developed, and special world championship tournaments for chess computers started to be organized every three years. During that first official championship, held in Stockholm, Sweden, Kaissa could not run on a local machine because of its unique Soviet operating system. It ran on a machine in Moscow instead, and the moves were communicated by telephone. Out of fear that the Soviets might cheat with their program and have someone interfere with the moves, the organizers had made sure someone was in the computer room to oversee the relay of moves. The Levy Bet The English chess master David Levy was instrumental in organizing those early computer chess tournaments in the 1970s and remained a key figure in the computer chess world for decades. In August 1968, Levy attended a machine intelligence workshop at Edinburgh University. He won a casual chess game at a cocktail party against John McCarthy, who then worked at Stanford. After the game, McCarthy said, “Well, David, you might be able to beat me, but I’m sure that in ten years there will be a computer program that will be able to beat you!” The optimism among computer pioneers was remarkable in those days. A decade earlier, in 1957, the American economist and political scientist Herbert Simon, who also worked in computer science, had proclaimed that a digital computer would beat the world chess champion within ten years. That was three decades off the mark. It should be noted that chess players did much better in the prediction game. The famous Russian grandmaster Yuri Averbakh, who was for many years the oldest grandmaster in the world until he died in May 2022, aged 100, appeared in a Moscow television show in 1963 and predicted that a computer would beat the world chess champion in 1998. Pretty close! But, back to that cocktail party in 1968. Levy, the reigning Scottish champion, thought John McCarthy’s prediction was utter nonsense and put up a bet of £500 (then worth $1,250), which was more than half his annual salary. McCarthy called over to Donald Michie—a British computer scientist who had worked with Alan Turing and others at Bletchley Park—who was also in the room. Upon hearing it, Michie said, “Can I take half the bet?” In subsequent years, a few more machine intelligence researchers joined and added to the bet until it had grown to £1,250 ($2,925) in 1974. It wasn’t until 1977 that a chess program was strong enough to put up a decent fight and seriously test the bet. Levy played a two-game match against CHESS 4.5, a program created by Larry Atkin, Keith Gorlen, and David Slate, computer scientists at Northwestern University. The program had participated successfully in human events and even won the 1977 Minnesota Open. The way Levy describes the match in his 1980 book More Chess and Computers echoes the sentiment of Kasparov upon facing Deep Blue almost twenty years later: “It was time for me to face up to my responsibilities and to defend the human race against the coming invasion.” Levy won the first game, after which the second game was not played because the best the computer could possibly do was tie the two-game match. In the following months, Levy won a few more matches, including one against Mac Hack, a program created by Richard Greenblatt at MIT. The program, also known as the Greenblatt Chess Program, had played against Bobby Fischer in spring 1977. (See annotated game on pages 385–86. Fischer crushed the chess program in three games and sent the notation to the Computer Chess Newsletter. These were Fischer’s first published games since his match with Boris Spassky in 1972, and the last until their rematch in 1992.) Then shortly before the ten-year deadline of the bet, in August–September 1978, Levy played a six-game match against CHESS 4.7, Slate and Atkins’s latest version, which ran on a CDC Cyber 176 mainframe computer located in Minneapolis (see annotated game on pages 386–87). Playing in a tuxedo in a soundproof booth at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Levy also won this match, but this time the computer managed to draw one game and win another. The world had witnessed the first computer victory against a human master in a serious event! Levy called the whole affair the end of an era in the annals of computer chess: “I had proved that my 1968 assessment had been correct, but, on the other hand, my opponent in this match was very, very much stronger than I had believed possible when I started the bet.” Shortly after winning the bet, Levy, in turn, offered a prize of $1,000 to the first programming team that would write a program capable of beating him in a four- or six-game match—to which the magazine Omni added another $4,000. It took some years (and one more failed attempt by the program Cray Blitz in 1984), but by 1989 the time had come. The program Deep Thought managed to beat Levy in a four-game match, winning all four games—the true end of an era. Well, Levy’s era. “I was quite happy,” he said much later. “I’d had a good run for my money: 21 years against an original bet of ten years. I think I sort of held out the human end versus machine struggles in chess pretty well. I got a lot of publicity; it was very good for my career.” While computer engineers were hopelessly optimistic in the 1960s and 1970s, chess grandmasters were eager to point that out, if only to defend their special status as intelligent thinkers. And they were right: those early chess programs were, simply put, rather terrible at chess. Another factor was that their progress was plodding. Back then, computers gained less than 200 rating points in strength per decade—a gap that humans can often bridge with a few years of studying and playing the game. In his famous 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, a discussion about the development of chess computers inspired Douglas Hofstadter to coin “Hofstadter’s Law”: “It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.” According to Hofstadter, Herbert Simon’s flawed prediction in 1957 was “just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter’s Law.” Although it would take some more years before humans had reasons to be worried, a small revolution did take place in the computer chess world in 1980, when the program Belle won the Computer World Chess Championship in Linz, Austria, ahead of 17 other programs. Developed by Ken Thompson, Belle was named after Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Bell Labs), where Thompson worked four decades after Turing. Thompson is a legendary name within computer science: as the developer of multiple programming languages and as one of the two creators (alongside Dennis Ritchie) of the Unix operating system—the foundation of Apple computers and Android phones. “Ken is the smartest person I ever met,” the German computer chess expert Frederic Friedel told me. Thompson wrote his first chess program to work in Unix in 1971, which saw many different iterations over the following years. It grew particularly strong after Joe Condon, a colleague of Thompson’s at Bell Labs, implemented a hardware-based move generator to be used with the software version of Belle. In 1980, running on an LSI-11 computer with that special piece of “chess hardware,” it could calculate 100,000 to 200,000 moves per second. Computer programs were now also participating in human tournaments, making them eligible for an Elo rating. In 1983 Belle became the first computer to attain the rating of a “master” under the terms of the United States Chess Federation (USCF) titles system. Kasparov–Deep Blue, 1996 On June 5, 1985, five months before he beat Anatoly Karpov and became the 13th World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov played a remarkable simultaneous exhibition in Hamburg, Germany. All of his opponents were microcomputers. The four leading companies of the time that produced chess computers for the consumer market, Hegener & Glaser, Fidelity Electronics, Novag, and SciSys, all participated with their strongest four models. Kasparov won all games: 32–0. He likes to refer to this time as “the good old days of computer chess,” and it’s understandable why. The 1980s would be the last decade in which humans could still laugh at computers playing chess. Incidentally, in that same year of 1985, three computer science graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—Feng-Hsiung Hsu, Thomas Anantharaman, and Murray Campbell—created a chess program called ChipTest. It was based on new Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) technology that allowed millions of transistors to be placed onto a single chip. Hsu had worked on a special chess-move generator chip—in other words, a chip specially designed to do one thing: play chess. Such chips were then duplicated and used in parallel, and, as a result, his early program could search approximately 50,000 moves per second. “I had the basic blueprint to build the mother of all chess machines, a machine that could defeat the world champion. In other words, I had a chance to pursue one of the oldest holy grails in computer science and possibly make history,” the Taiwan-born Hsu would later write. Further development improved ChipTest significantly in terms of programming and search, and in 1988 it was renamed Deep Thought, after the supercomputer in Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. A year later, now capable of searching 720,000 moves per second, Deep Thought won the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship with a perfect 5–0 score. It attracted even more attention when it participated in an open tournament in Long Beach, California, and became the first computer to beat a human grandmaster in an official tournament. The victim was none other than Bent Larsen, a former world championship candidate from Denmark. Later that year, Deep Thought defeated David Levy, who made the wager described earlier in the chapter, 4–0. Meanwhile, Kasparov had made friends with the aforementioned Friedel, who had co-organized the computer simul that Kasparov played in 1985. Based on correspondence between Friedel and the Deep Thought team, it’s interesting to see Kasparov’s thoughts on computers back then: Beginning of 1988: “Computers will never beat grandmasters.” Mid-1988: “Computers will never beat strong grandmasters.” End of 1988: “Okay, yes, Bent [Larsen] is a strong grandmaster. But a computer will never beat Karpov or me.” Kasparov played Deep Thought a bit later, in October 1989, at the New York Academy of Art. He won both games easily, which was only the start of IBM’s journey. Murray Campbell had joined the company in September, and Hsu joined a month later after defending his thesis at Carnegie Mellon. Hsu worked as a system architect and chip designer at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in Westchester County until 1999. How he and Campbell ended up at IBM is a great story. Peter Brown, who had earned his PhD in computer science at Carnegie Mellon, was working at IBM’s speech group, developing computer software to transcribe spoken text. Brown had heard about Hsu’s team and project. In his 2002 book Behind Deep Blue, Hsu wrote: Peter happened to be in the men’s room with Abe Peled, the IBM Research Vice President of Computer Science. They started talking about how expensive the Super Bowl TV commercial spots were. Peter suggested that he knew a way to gain much greater publicity at a far lower cost. He knew this group of graduate students working on computer chess at Carnegie Mellon, and he believed that this team would create the first chess machine to beat the world champion. Given the historical significance of the quest and the latent public interest, IBM could stand to gain huge advertising value from the endeavor. Oh, yes, members of the team were world-class people that IBM would be interested in hiring anyway. Abe got interested and asked Peter to look into it. In early 1996, the time had come for the biggest man versus machine clash in history. Finally, the world chess champion himself would sit down at the board facing a silicon opponent with, literally, nerves of steel. Kasparov had agreed to play IBM’s latest iteration, now named Deep Blue (after IBM’s nickname Big Blue), in a six-game match that would celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was played February 10–17 at the Philadelphia Convention Center for a $500,000 prize fund, with $400,000 going to the winner. Deep Blue was running on an IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer. Located in a lab in Yorktown Heights, New York, the 36-way machine consisted of 16-CPU frames plus four workstations, with 216 chess chips working together, and using an opening book developed by the American grandmaster Joel Benjamin. This meant that during the opening phase, the machine didn’t need to think but could rely on pre-programmed moves that were known to be good from human grandmaster practice. Six and a half years after its younger brother Deep Thought lost without a chance against Kasparov, Deep Blue proved up to the task: it won the first game (see annotated game on pages 389–90). It was a historic first victory for the computer against the strongest human player in a long time control game. Apart from the incredible search speed of 100 million positions per second, there was another reason why this computer was so strong. Hsu explained that the special chess chips evaluated the game positions more thoroughly than any other chess program: “Almost all the evaluation function terms were computed directly on chip.” As the computer scored its first win, the match was instantly front-page news, covered by outlets such as the New York Times and USA Today, and on television by The Tonight Show, Late Night with David Letterman, and Saturday Night Live. The interest in the match exceeded all expectations. “The IBM match website quickly turned into the most popular website up to that point in time, exceeding even the Super Bowl website and the Swimsuit Edition website of Sports Illustrated,” wrote Hsu. Chess fans had trouble accessing the site, and IBM dedicated another IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer, identical to the one running Deep Blue, to handle the server load. During a walk with Friedel on the streets of Philadelphia on the evening of that first game, Kasparov asked his friend: “Frederic, what if this thing is invincible?” It wasn’t yet. In the second game, Kasparov immediately took revenge, after which two draws followed. The score was equal, but Kasparov finished with two wins to win the match convincingly—not knowing this would be the last time a human ever won a multi-game match against a computer. The 1997 Match: The Holy Grail With all the media attention the match had attracted, it didn’t take long for IBM to suggest a return match the following year, and Kasparov agreed. This historic encounter for chess and AI was held May 3–11, 1997, in the Equitable Center in New York City, then headquarters of the Equitable Insurance firm. All over Manhattan there were posters on billboards with a portrait of Kasparov watching over chess pieces, and the tagline: “How do you make a computer blink?” The spectators watched from a 480-seat auditorium in the basement, with grandmaster Yasser Seirawan, then international master (now grandmaster) Maurice Ashley, and computer expert and international master Mike Valvo as commentators. Incidentally, they had access to Fritz 4, so they could pick another silicon brain whenever they wanted. There were three huge projection screens at the front. The left screen showed live footage from a studio on the 35th floor, where the games were played. For this rematch, IBM developed a new RS/6000 SP supercomputer with double the CPU speed, 480 new chess chips and a new evaluation function based on training games with grandmasters. Its calculation speed had also doubled to a staggering 200 million positions per second. The machine weighed over 1.5 tons and cost $10 million to construct. The prize fund was $1.1 million, with $700,000 for the winner, but both sides knew much more was at stake. Unlike the first match, this time the media attention was huge from the very start. Two hundred journalists showed up for the opening press conference, including the crews of TV networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox, and the BBC. As the match progressed, more and more reporters arrived, and the press conferences had to be moved to a bigger room. The media labeled the match as a clash between man and machine, with Newsweek’s cover calling it “The Brain’s Last Stand.” Six years later, Hsu wrote in his book that he saw it differently: as a match between “man as a performer and man as a toolmaker.” Kasparov playing the black pieces in one of the games of his 1997 rematch with Deep Blue, this day operated by IBM system architect Feng-Hsiung Hsu, right. Over the first four games, the match score completely mirrored the year before. This time, the 34-year-old Kasparov started with a win but then lost the second game, followed by two draws. His victory in the first game went surprisingly easily, but the Deep Blue team was quite content afterward. They were happy with the overall level of play they had seen and knew they only needed slight adjustments to fix the issues from game one, mostly related to the correct evaluation of king safety. Then came the second game—in hindsight, the key game for the whole match (see annotated game on pages 390–91). Deep Blue played remarkably well in a fairly “closed” middlegame, meaning a position with a blocked pawn formation in the center. Normally speaking, humans were better in those types of positions that required long-term maneuvering. Kasparov didn’t know that Joel Benjamin had trained the machine for months, especially for such positions. The computer had more space and skillfully used a potential open file, doubling its rooks before opening it. This reminded me of a famous maneuver by Kasparov’s nemesis Anatoly Karpov, who once used a bishop to “close off” a file before taking control of it. The programmers were happy that a recent update to their evaluation function of Deep Blue, which appreciated open files more, came to fruition. Unexpectedly, the computer opened a new front on the kingside (a move that felt strangely human!) before entering with its pieces on the queenside. Kasparov decided to sacrifice a pawn, but Deep Blue surprised everyone again by not accepting the sacrifice. It played a quiet bishop move instead—another move reminiscent of the chess played by Kasparov’s greatest human rival. “Maybe they gave Karpov a call in Moscow,” joked one of the commentators during the game. The move was subtle but lethal, and, a few moves later, Kasparov threw in the towel. It was the best game ever played by a computer: real chess, played in human style. It had passed the Turing Test gloriously! But there was one issue: Deep Blue’s last move wasn’t good at all. You could even call it a blunder. Later that evening, the English journalist and organizer Malcolm Pein, who was in close contact with both IBM and the Kasparov team, received a phone call from the Norwegian American grandmaster and reporter Jonathan Tisdall. “I think I have a story, but nobody wants to use it,” Tisdall said. “Did you see Ferret’s analysis? It gives zeros!” Tisdall was referring to the analysis engine of the Internet Chess Club (more on that in Chapter 8), which also suggested the final position to be equal. “I thought that was a mistake, but after Tisdall’s call, I gave it a closer look,” said Pein. “And then I broke the story in the Daily Telegraph: ‘Kasparov Resigns in Drawn Position.’ ” As it turned out, Kasparov could have entered White’s position with his queen and played for perpetual check (endless checks, out of which there is no escape, leading to a move repetition). Friedel came to the same conclusion after analyzing the position with his chess engine Fritz, and the next morning he told the Russian grandmaster Yury Dokhoian, Kasparov’s main chess assistant. Dokhoian was shocked to realize that it could be true. Of course, he had discussed that final position with Kasparov the night before, but they had overlooked an important possibility that was part of Friedel’s analysis. When the team went for a walk to have lunch, Dokhoian told Kasparov the bad news. Friedel wrote, “Garry clutched his head and froze in the middle of Fifth Avenue. There were no expletives, no cursing, just stunned silence.” It was a combination of disbelief and confusion. How could a computer that strong, from a position with an overwhelming advantage, suddenly allow a draw? According to Hsu, Deep Blue’s strange choice resulted from some kind of bug, but this crucial piece of information was only revealed six years later. To Kasparov, the difference between Deep Blue’s level of play in games one and two was night and day, which further fueled his suspicions that something was off. Two draws followed, and the mirrored score with the 1996 match ended when the fifth game was also drawn. With a tied score, the sixth and last game would decide everything. Minutes before the start of that final game, fans were still trying to get into the Equitable Center. Hsu wrote, “The official price for a place in the 500-seat auditorium was $25, but spare tickets are changing hands for as much as $100. It’s the hottest gig in town.” In the opening, a Caro–Kann defense, Kasparov played a risky move order, which allowed White to play a promising piece sacrifice based on long-term compensation. If the computer decided against it, Kasparov would have an easy game—the expected scenario. The sacrifice was supposed to be too long-term for a computer to evaluate properly and something only humans would play unless it were part of the machine’s opening book (Deep Blue’s “homework” created by IBM’s grandmasters’ team). Kasparov must have estimated the odds of that almost zero since he rarely played the Caro–Kann. Without spending time on the clock, Deep Blue gave up its knight instantly, shocking Kasparov and viewers across the globe. Kasparov’s king was soon deprived of the right to castle and had to run for safety. Deep Blue continued the game with simple developing moves to fully mobilize its army and threw in some powerful pawn pushes on the queenside to reach a winning position as early as move 19. It was suddenly all over: Kasparov was blown off the board. He had lost the match (see annotated game on pages 391–92). How could Deep Blue know it had to sacrifice its knight? In his 2002 book, Hsu wrote that the move was indeed part of the opening book: “The position on the playing board had actually shown up in our lab about a month earlier when the other grandmasters were working on Deep Blue’s opening book. At the time, the grandmasters did not bother to play out the position either; they just looked at Deep Blue’s evaluation of the position and moved to other work.” In a controversial interview in 2009, one of the team members, the Spanish grandmaster Miguel Illescas, shared a different version of what happened: White’s crucial eighth move had been included in the opening book the morning before the game was played. According to Kasparov, who wrote down his thoughts on the match in his 2017 book Deep Thinking, that was too much of a coincidence: “The odds of winning the lottery are quite attractive in comparison to those of the Deep Blue team entering a specific variation I had never played before in my life into the computer’s book on the very same day it appeared on the board in the final game.” It should be noted that another Deep Blue team member, Joel Benjamin, later said that Illescas’s statement was simply not true; White’s eighth move had been part of the computer’s opening book for a long time. I decided to double-check with Illescas for this book. He replied in an email, saying he agreed with Joel, who “knew better about the Caro–Kann.” Malcolm Pein has his own theory about what happened. “It still annoys me to this day,” he told me in December 2023. “They [Kasparov’s team] were convinced that Deep Blue was taking its opening moves from Richard Lang’s ChessGenius program, a popular engine at the time, and asked me to buy a copy. I told them I was a hundred percent certain it wasn’t using that, but they were convinced. I spent quite a sum of money at the chess shop near Huntington Station and gave them the program. They were misled. They misled themselves.” After his resignation, Kasparov’s mother convinced her son to take the elevator to the 50th floor for the post-match press conference, where he faced hundreds of photographers and reporters. Hsu: “He stared into the middle-distance, over everyone’s head, avoiding eye contact and scarcely blinking, looking like he might spontaneously combust. There was only mild applause when the winning Deep Blue team arrived; it was as though everyone was slightly embarrassed or perhaps afraid to cheer for fear of offending the mighty Garry.” People applauded when he took the microphone, though, and as soon as he started talking, Kasparov started to dominate the conversation. He wasn’t happy. “I’m sorry, I haven’t deserved that, and I have to apologize for today’s performance, but I don’t think it has anything to do with chess or the match. I had no real strength to fight, and I think the result of the so-called ‘game’ today was justified,” he stated. Standing among the reporters, the members of the Deep Blue team had been told by the company’s PR people not to smile. As Kasparov continued, they didn’t have much reason to anyway. “I think it’s time for Deep Blue to start playing real chess, and I personally assure you, everybody here, that if Deep Blue will start playing competitive chess, I personally guarantee you I’ll tear it into pieces, with no question,” Kasparov said fiercely. He then pointed his arrows to the several grandmasters who had helped the Deep Blue programmers: “How many players they will hire, they have to put more players, of course, on the bench because some of them are probably too shy to show up; they can hire the entire [grandmaster] force of the United States of America, it will not help because we know how a machine plays.” He wasn’t holding back: Kasparov thought the match had been unfair. “Put it in competitive chess, put it in a fair contest, not that one, make IBM a player, not a sponsor at the same time. I will see what’s going to happen, and I think it’s just the beginning,” he said. But within days, IBM announced there wouldn’t be a third match. And why would there be? For them, there was hardly anything to gain. Their match victory led to incredible global media coverage and did only good for the company’s value. Some have suggested it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars in PR. IBM claimed that the entire Deep Blue project had cost them $20 million, and after the second match their market capitalization increased by billions overnight. Remember IBM’s Peter Brown complaining about the cost of a Super Bowl advertisement in the men’s room and realizing the potential of those chess developers to create something of bigger value? Well, that kind of came about, didn’t it? In another funny twist, during the 2001 Super Bowl television broadcast, Pepsi ran a spot featuring Kasparov, clearly inspired by the match. This time, Kasparov defeated the computer (modeled on HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation of 2001: A Space Odyssey) but then got troubled by an elevator and a Pepsi vending machine, the machines taking revenge. The price for a 30-second Super Bowl ad was roughly $2.2 million at the time. Most experts believe Kasparov was still stronger than Deep Blue in 1997—so why did he lose the match? Because he was human. Already during the match, Kasparov admitted that he got carried away, in an interview with the English grandmaster Daniel King that was included in King’s 1997 book on the match. The day after the fourth game, Kasparov told King: “Game 2 took a lot of energy out of me; afterward I was really furious. I couldn’t prepare normally. I played games 3 and 4 in a big crisis.” One of the things Kasparov was not happy about was that IBM had declined his request to see the logs of the played games. Some of Deep Blue’s moves seemed overly human (such as not accepting his pawn sacrifice in the second game), so he wanted to see the exact lines of what it had been thinking about. In his 2002 book, Hsu would call this “a request for an unfair advantage,” adding that the match “would have been a sham if he were given free access.” In any case, Kasparov’s psychological state wasn’t where it should have been. In hindsight, he forecasted his demise in that conversation with King before the fifth game: “Whatever happens in this match, I know Deep Blue can be beaten unless the man—in this case me—is not in the right mental condition. It can only win because of human weakness.” Those turned out to be prophetic words. One of Kasparov’s strategies in the match was that he played more quiet openings than usual because he felt Deep Blue would struggle more against those. It has been suggested that Kasparov would have fared better if he had used his normal openings, but I feel that his mindset was a much more decisive factor. Kasparov is a rather emotional human being. There’s nothing wrong with that, but as soon as all the suspicions about human interference and other negative thoughts started to dominate his mind, he could no longer play his best chess. I also think Kasparov could have beaten Deep Blue in that second match if only he had played his best chess. After winning the first match in 1996, Kasparov had estimated the computer’s strength at roughly 2700, and it had taken IBM six years to reach that, being rated roughly 2550 in 1990. “I had trouble believing they could get it up to my 2800 level without a few more years of development,” was Kasparov’s position then. Besides the fact that IBM was going to invest millions—having seen what this match did in PR terms and what potential a possible victory had—what Kasparov underestimated was that there was also a chance for him not to perform at 2800 level the next year. Because of the enormous pressure, because of this particular opponent, one which lacked emotion, and because the match was only six games, a psychological disturbance could change a lot—and that’s what happened. Kasparov self-destructed. Was Deep Blue Intelligent? With each new product of AI research—from IBM’s Deep Blue to their Watson, which defeated human opponents at Jeopardy!, to ChatGPT—the same old question pops up: “Is it intelligent?” After winning his first match against Deep Blue in 1996, Kasparov wrote an article in TIME magazine titled “The Day I Sensed a New Kind of Intelligence,” where he reflected on the fact that, for the first time, he felt that a computer had played in a rather human manner. However, the way it figured out those human moves was not the same. Kasparov wondered: “So the question is, if the computer makes the same move that I would make for completely different reasons, has it made an ‘intelligent’ move? Is the intelligence of an action dependent on who (or what) takes it?” At that point, he felt he might have a few more years left before a computer would beat him, but it turned out to be only 15 months more. In his 2017 book Deep Thinking, Kasparov firmly said no to the notion that he had lost to an intelligent entity: “Deep Blue was intelligent the way your programmable alarm clock is intelligent. Not that losing to a $10 million alarm clock made me feel any better.” Deep Blue’s main programmer, Feng-Hsiung Hsu, agreed here, noting subtly, “It is only a finely crafted tool that exhibits intelligent behavior in a limited domain. Garry lost the match, but he was the player with the real intelligence—Deep Blue would never be able to come up with the imaginative accusations.” Two decades after losing the match, Kasparov elaborated on his point about losing to an alarm clock. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman in 2019, the 13th World Chess Champion said: Considering chess as the sort of pinnacle of intellectual activities was our mistake because we just thought, “Oh, it’s a game of the highest intellect, you have to be intelligent, and you could see things that the ordinary mortals could not see …” It’s a game. All machines had to do with this game was to make fewer mistakes, not to solve the game. Because the game cannot be solved … I think that is what we have to learn from the 1997 experience and from further encounters with computers and sort of the current state of affairs with AlphaZero beating other machines. The idea that we can compete with computers in so-called intellectual fields: it was wrong from the very beginning. Kasparov already knew in 1997 that computers would soon take over from humans, but he played the match anyway because he felt (and rightly so) that he was still capable of postponing the inevitable a little longer. The insight he had gained two decades later was that in the long run, computers will always be better than humans at avoiding mistakes in closed games with perfect information, which forms only a small subcategory of what we call intelligence. Game six of the 1997 match was Deep Blue’s last official game. After dismantling, it was separated into two halves, with one sent to the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC. IBM held onto the other half for a few years before donating it to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Deep Blue’s victory over Kasparov didn’t stop humans from playing chess against computers right away. In fact, it would take almost a decade for everyone to agree that computers were better chess players than humans, as we will see in the next chapter. There, we will also learn about another pivotal moment for AI and chess—the appearance of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, and what it meant for the game.",

Thirty-four-year-old Garry Kasparov, the best chess player on the planet, sits with his head in his left hand and looks out into the crowd. On the first row, he sees his mother, Klara, who accompanies him to all his important matches. He starts shaking his head. As he takes a few more seconds to accept the inevitable, Kasparov eventually offers his hand to the game operator, quickly signs the scoresheet, and walks straight out of the room with both hands up. The video showing Kasparov’s resignation would be played in news bulletins worldwide as the supercomputer Deep Blue’s win was heralded as the machine’s victory over mankind. The footage went viral a decade before social media became a thing. In his late-night show, David Letterman joked, “Over the weekend, world chess champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by the IBM computer, Deep Blue. Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. In a related story, earlier today, the New York Mets were defeated by a microwave oven.” Deep Blue’s victory against Garry Kasparov in 1997 was a significant milestone for artificial intelligence. At the time, the match symbolized the competition between humans and computers at the highest level of intelligence, setting Deep Blue’s win as a marker of AI’s potential to surpass human performance in complex tasks. It was a legendary match, which had its origins almost 200 years earlier, when a young man marveled at automatons. Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine In 1800, a boy of about nine years old, accompanied by his mother, stepped into the depths of John Joseph Merlin’s Mechanical Museum in the heart of London. It was an enigmatic place filled with gadgets and wonders, such as a gambling machine, perpetual-motion clocks and a collection of alluring music boxes. The boy’s eyes were transfixed, captivated by the mysterious mechanisms before him. Little did he know, on that fateful day in central London, one of the early seeds of artificial intelligence would be planted deep within his young mind. The boy’s name was Charles Babbage. The nineteenth century’s renowned mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer designed his Difference Engine in 1822, an audacious creation to generate error-free logarithmic tables. It was an early example of a mechanical computer, where the term computer should be understood as a machine that can compute or calculate something. Around 1833, Babbage started working on his even more ambitious Analytical Engine. This was a mechanical, general-purpose computer that would use punched cards for programming and have a “store” for memory, a mill for computations, and a control unit for instruction sequencing. It was to perform arithmetic operations, support conditional branching and looping, and store intermediate results. An engraving of a section of Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine No. 1, from the frontispiece of his autobiography Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, 1864. None of Babbage’s engines, which would have been roughly the size of a room and extraordinarily heavy, were completed in his lifetime due to disputes with the engineers and the collapse of the British government’s funding. Still, they laid the foundation for subsequent developments in computing technology in the twentieth century. In his autobiography, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, from 1864, Babbage revealed that he had intended to “test” his Analytical Engine and see whether it could play “a game of purely intellectual skill successfully” such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, or chess. He concluded that theoretically, it should be possible, but that chess encountered practical limitations. “In consequence of this, the whole question of making an automaton play any game depended on the possibility of the machine being able to represent all the myriads of combinations relating to it,” Babbage wrote. That “myriad of combinations” turned out too large for such a machine (and we will soon learn why): “Allowing one hundred moves on each side for the longest game at chess, I found that the combinations involved in the Analytical Engine enormously surpassed any required, even by the game of chess.” He spent more time on tic-tac-toe, but also here, while leaving many design sketches, he could not create an actual machine himself. Although Babbage’s influence on computer chess is limited, there is a link between his Analytical Machine and the earliest computers of the twentieth century. It is, therefore, fascinating to consider that one of the brightest minds of his time was at least thinking along the same lines as the first explorers of artificial intelligence, but more than a century earlier. And, in this case too, chess had played its part. Alan Turing and His Paper Machine If I ask the reader when the first computer chess program was written, you will probably start thinking about the number of years since the first electronic computer appeared. However, the answer may astound you: it was a few years before such a computer was born. The man who wrote it was Alan Turing. Born in 1912 in London, Turing emerged as one of the twentieth century’s most brilliant and visionary minds. His contributions to computer science, his role as a codebreaker during World War II at Bletchley Park, and his pioneering work in artificial intelligence and early computer design have secured his legacy. Oh, and he also liked chess. While working at Bletchley Park, Turing had plenty of opportunities to play during breaks. Among the codebreakers who regularly penetrated and deciphered the coded messages of the Germans, Italians, and Japanese were many strong chess players, including three members of the English team: Conel Hugh O’Donel Alexander (the reigning British champion at the time), Stuart Milner-Barry, and Harry Golombek. In 1948, when Turing was 36, he started writing his chess program. Assisted by his friend David Champernowne, Turing programmed the rules of the game but also created a set of values for the pieces (pawn = 1, knight = 3, bishop = 3½, rook = 5, queen = 10) and some positional evaluation functions, which gave numeric values to things like piece mobility, piece safety, castling, check, and mate. Some of these ideas are still valuable concepts used by modern-day chess programs. Turing and Champernowne called their chess-playing program the “Turochamp,” also known as “Turing’s Paper Machine.” Since a computer capable of running the program did not exist, Turing had to go through the algorithm for each move and calculate Turochamp’s next move with pencil and paper, thus acting as a human central processing unit (CPU). The whole process took more than half an hour per move. At the time, Turing’s chess computer program had evolved from what has been named “the Turing Machine.” He described it in his famous paper “On Computable Numbers,” published in 1936 when he was 24. Turing gave a mathematical description of a universal machine, an abstract model of a computing device capable of processing information. Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” posed a pivotal question that ignites passionate debate to this day: can machines think? In his quest for the answer, Turing first noted that you need definitions of “machine” and “think,” but then suggested something altogether different, which he called “the imitation game.” This notion, portrayed in the 2014 biographical film bearing the same name, is now immortalized as “the Turing Test.” It postulates that when a computer’s response becomes indistinguishable from a human’s, the boundaries of intelligence blur and the computer can be deemed to be thinking. Nowadays, the fundamental importance of the Turing Test in the field of AI is probably somewhat overrated. In fact, instead of a rigorous formal test, Turing himself saw the notion as more like a philosophical idea, a helpful thought experiment. In a podcast in July 2023, the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari described the Turing Test concisely as “a social test, not a logical proof.” Still, what’s nice about Turing’s 1950 paper is that it’s there, within those pages, that chess and AI started their joint journey through the twentieth century and beyond. In his imitation game, Turing gives four example questions (and supposed answers from the computer), two of them related to chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Count me out on this one, I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give an answer) 105621. Q: Do you play chess? A: Yes. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. (If the notation of the chess moves looks odd, that’s because in those days descriptive notation was still more common than today’s standard algebraic notation, which uses coordinates of squares, like in 1.e4, 2.Nf3.) As Garry Kasparov commented in 2012, Turing, in the above dialogue, placed chess somewhere between simple sums and poetry. Not a bad place for our game! This author couldn’t resist the temptation to feed OpenAI’s well-known chat program ChatGPT the same “prompts” to see what the Turing Test gave us in early 2023. The answers I got mainly demonstrated that, at that point in time, the chatbot knew its way among texts but didn’t really know how to play chess: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Upon the Firth of Forth, a bridge stands tall, A marvel of steel, engineering’s delight. It stands against the storm, will never fall, A beacon in the day, a star at night. Three diamond towers, reaching for the sky, An icon of the North, proud and true. Steel girders forming lines that please the eye, Connecting banks where once a ferry flew. Across the waters, trains in rhythm move, On tracks suspended high above the tide. Each crossing a testament to human groove, Of perseverance, pride, and nation’s stride. So here’s to Forth Bridge, in elegance draped, Man’s triumph over space, in steel shaped. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: The sum of 34957 and 70764 is 105721. Q: Do you play chess? A: As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t actually “play” chess in the sense that humans do. However, I can certainly assist with understanding the game, explaining the rules, discussing strategies, or analyzing moves and positions. If you provide a situation from a game, I can help interpret it or suggest possible moves. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: In the scenario you’ve described, it’s important to prevent the opposing king from moving to a safe position. The best move would be to use your rook to give checkmate. You can do this by moving your rook from R1 to R2. The king on K1 has no legal moves and is in check from the rook on R2, which is supported by your king on K6, resulting in checkmate. Please note that the naming conventions of chess positions can vary based on the system used. ChatGPT’s chess answer included a few correct facts, but its suggested move was nonsensical. I don’t think that’s because ChatGPT got confused by the descriptive notation; it did not understand chess yet. That is still the main issue with large language models (LLMs) at this point in time: they are not ready yet for real understanding like humans do (and hardly anyone understands them!). Initially, I thought that for ChatGPT to be able to think and solve chess problems, it would need to be somehow connected to a chess program, because without it, it is only using language by predicting which next word in the sentence makes the most sense. But, if we could combine that with a chess program, we would have the chess version of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which, according to some experts, might be less than a decade away. However, many months into writing this book, I came across a special version of the now infamous chatbot called “GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct,” released by OpenAI in September 2023. It is a more versatile tool that can be instructed more precisely to complete various tasks or answer questions. And, lo and behold, it also plays chess, at the level of the average club player, without any connection to an actual chess program. How is that possible? In an online article in early January 2024, research engineer Adam Karvonen explained that this model was only trained to predict the next character in chess notation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and was never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess: “Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.” Playing a decent game of chess by predicting the next move from chess notation, thereby learning much more about the actual game, is just incredible. It also shows that LLMs are developing so quickly that any judgment you make about their capabilities today could be out of date tomorrow. Shortly before finishing the first draft of this book, in February 2024, I tried Turing’s last question again, and now ChatGPT (still version 3.5!) answered it perfectly: “In the situation you described, with your king at K1 and no other pieces, and my king at K6 and rook at R1, I would play rook to R8, checkmating your king at K1. This move involves bringing the rook to the eighth rank and delivering checkmate to your king along the back rank.” Claude Shannon and His Number Turing’s lecture for the Royal Astronomical Society in 1947 is considered the earliest public lecture on machine intelligence. With his 1950 paper and chess-playing computer program, he showed for the first time that chess could be a model for mechanical thinking and machine intelligence. In the early 1950s the game was a testing ground for the new and developing area of computer science. In 1943, Turing had spent two months working on speech encryption at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City. There, he met the academic and philosophical engineer Claude Shannon, whose 1948 article “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” would become the founding work for the field of information theory. Like Turing, Shannon worked on cryptanalysis during World War II, and the two distinguished gentlemen shared an interest in chess. Seemingly independent from Turing, Shannon published an article titled “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess” in 1950 based on a lecture he had given to the Institute of Radio Engineers on March 9, 1949—coincidentally, Bobby Fischer’s sixth birthday. “This paper is concerned with the problem of constructing a computing routine or ‘program’ for a modern general-purpose computer which will enable it to play chess,” Shannon opened his article. For him, too, chess was a testing ground that could prove helpful for other areas. While constructing a chess computer program was “perhaps of no practical importance,” he wrote, “the question is of theoretical interest, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem will act as a wedge in attacking other problems of a similar nature and of greater significance.” Shannon also explained why chess was so valuable: The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require “thinking” for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of “thinking”; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers. Shannon theorized that each position in a chess game has three possible evaluations: a won position for White; a drawn position; or a won position for Black. To play a perfect game, without errors, all the program needs to do is calculate from the starting position till the moment of checkmate or a drawn position, and see which result follows in deciding which first move it needs to make. Easy? Well, there is a bit of an issue with this approach. The thing is: there are a lot of possible games to calculate. Like, a lot. In the first chapter, we saw the power of exponential growth explained by the legend about the grains of wheat and the chessboard, and here’s it no different. As famously noted, the number of possible chess games is bigger than the number of atoms in the universe, and Shannon was the first to point this out. Here’s why. In the starting position, White has 20 possible opening moves (eight pawns can be pushed either one square or two, and each knight, the only piece allowed to jump over other pieces or pawns, can go to two different squares). Black has the same 20 options, meaning 20 × 20 = 400 possible ways to start a chess game with one move for each side. If we give White one more move, the number of variations quickly grows to 8,902, and adding a second move for Black means there are 197,281 different possible starts. As the game progresses, the tree of possibilities grows at an exponential rate that is impossible to comprehend. Based on an average of about a thousand (103) possibilities for a pair of moves and a typical game lasting for about 40 such pairs of moves, Shannon concluded that there are 10120 variations (possible games) to be calculated from the initial position, which is a one followed by 120 zeroes. This is known as the Shannon number. And it happens to be much (much!) bigger than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which is estimated between 1078 and 1082, give or take. Like Babbage, Shannon realized chess is a rather complex game. Okay, so what do we do? We may be too ambitious, and playing the perfect chess game sets the bar somewhat high. Magnus Carlsen would be the first to admit that he became a world champion while playing far from perfect chess. Instead, Shannon set the task to create a program that can play “a skillful game, perhaps comparable to that of a good human player.” He worked toward creating a strategy: choosing from the possible legal moves in a chess position based on the evaluation of the position. Just like Turing and Champernowne, Shannon mentioned the relative value of the chess pieces (such as that the rook is worth about five pawns) as well as king safety while also speaking about more sophisticated concepts like “open files” and “weak pawns.” But how do we make sure that a computer chooses, from the infinite universe of possibilities, a decent move without thinking for too long? Also here, Shannon has been instrumental in developing computer chess by distinguishing two types of searching for the best move in a position. Type A is known as the “brute-force search,” looking at every variation to a given depth—say, three moves for each side—and then deciding. The alternative method, Type B, is “selective search”: here, the computer, instead of looking at all possible moves each time, looks at important branches of the tree only; namely, the branches that include, for example, checks, captures, and attacking moves. A year later Turing presented similar ideas in his article “Digital Computers Applied to Games” (1951), published independently from Shannon. Therefore, Shannon gets the credit for being the first to put on paper a strategy for a computer to meticulously select its moves, while Turing will always be known as the architect of the first-ever chess algorithm. Early Chess Programs Around the same time Turing and Shannon wrote their groundbreaking papers on chess and computer intelligence, the first generation of electronic computers was born. Between 1935 and 1945 the first digital computing machines were built, largely thanks to the need for warfare-related mathematical computations. These machines were created for table-making, ballistics calculations, and codebreaking tasks. Chess was still too complex for the early electronic computers that appeared in the 1950s, but that didn’t stop humans from attempting to program chess into the giant mainframe machines that took up the space of a large living room. (Apart from their improvements in speed and memory, the most striking part of the evolution of computers in the second half of the twentieth century was their change in size.) The challenge was just too exciting to let go of, as chess, the famous board game that had kept its prestige throughout the centuries, was seen as a representative measure of intelligence. And if chess was “too big to handle,” they would just make it … smaller. That’s what a team of scientists did at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, where the atomic bomb had been invented. The laboratory obtained the state-of-the-art MANIAC I computer to help with the necessary computations for nuclear weapons. In their spare time, when not occupied with further developing the most murderous weapon in history, the researchers created a chess program that could play on a smaller chessboard, with only 6 × 6 squares and no bishops. Why? Because even the MANIAC was too limited in memory and computing power to deal with 8 × 8 squares and 32 pieces. In any case, this “handicapped” computer chess program worked, and it is said to have won a game in 1956 against someone who had just learned the rules a week earlier, making it the first machine to beat a human fair and square in (a form of) chess. The American technology company International Business Machines was involved with computer chess much earlier than its famous matches with Kasparov in the 1990s. In fact, IBM had already set a record four decades before it would beat the world champion in chess. In 1957, an IBM 704 mainframe computer, a 9.7-ton vacuum tube machine, was the first that could run a fully automated chess engine, playing the game with no limitations. The program was written by IBM’s engineer and mathematician Alex Bernstein, and it took about eight minutes to make a move. On the Computer History Museum website, you can see wonderful footage of Bernstein sitting behind a chess set next to a giant machine full of lights, buttons, and levers. As the voiceover notes, the chess-playing program was given to the computer on a reel of magnetic tape. While Bernstein executed the moves for both sides on the chess set, he communicated them to the 704 by pressing down about a dozen levers and lifting them again in a specific order. The machine printed out the new position following each move, and after calculating its new move, it printed that out too. How deep was this computer thinking? Well, let’s listen to the film voiceover: Los Alamos physicist Paul Stein, left, and MANIAC project leader Nicholas Metropolis, right, play 6 × 6 chess against MANIAC, without bishops, 1956. In calculating its moves, the machine considers the board square by square. Is the square occupied? By whose men? Is it under attack? Can it be defended? Can it be occupied? All this is taking a long time by computer standards: one-tenth of a second. Now the computer proceeds to select its move. It has about 30 possible moves. After asking eight preliminary questions about each of them, it selects seven of the 30 for further analysis. It tests each of the seven through four moves ahead, considering its opponent’s possible replies and its own possible counter-responses in each case. It examines 2,800 positions in eight minutes. As it turns out, Bernstein’s program was a prototype of Shannon’s Type B kind of thinking because, in addition to brute-force calculation, there was some form of selective search. However, if he played the same moves in a new game, the computer would make the same moves and lose in the exact same way. The film footage ends with: “Someday, though not soon, Mr. Bernstein feels a program may be designed that will enable the computer to profit by its own mistakes and improve its chess game on the basis of its experience against human opponents.” It would take another 60 years for AlphaZero to appear on the scene (we’ll meet this computer program in the next chapter) and for reinforcement learning, alongside artificial neural networks, to become a key factor in chess engine improvement. Building on Bernstein’s landmark chess program, Alan Kotok and four of his classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created an improved version in 1962, which also ran on a newer computer: the IBM 7090. Since we’re keeping track of records, I mention Kotok’s program primarily for being the first-ever chess computer to lose to another chess computer. That story begins with a visit by the computer scientist John McCarthy (famously the first to coin the term artificial intelligence in 1956) to the Soviet Union in 1965. The Soviets hadn’t been sitting still, having created not only their own atomic bomb but also their own chess-playing program. In Moscow, McCarthy talked about his student Kotok and his chess program, after which he was challenged to a chess match against their chess program. Then, a year later, half a decade before Fischer–Spassky, a US versus USSR computer chess match was played by telegraph in 1966–67, and was won by the Soviet program. (Not that I want to suggest any type of violation of fair play, but it should be noted that the Russian team was advised by a certain Mr. Mikhail Botvinnik, who had a PhD in electrical engineering but also happened to be a former world chess champion.) The Soviet chess program was further developed into Kaissa, the first Computer Chess World Championship winner in 1974. By then, about 200 chess programs had already been developed, and special world championship tournaments for chess computers started to be organized every three years. During that first official championship, held in Stockholm, Sweden, Kaissa could not run on a local machine because of its unique Soviet operating system. It ran on a machine in Moscow instead, and the moves were communicated by telephone. Out of fear that the Soviets might cheat with their program and have someone interfere with the moves, the organizers had made sure someone was in the computer room to oversee the relay of moves. The Levy Bet The English chess master David Levy was instrumental in organizing those early computer chess tournaments in the 1970s and remained a key figure in the computer chess world for decades. In August 1968, Levy attended a machine intelligence workshop at Edinburgh University. He won a casual chess game at a cocktail party against John McCarthy, who then worked at Stanford. After the game, McCarthy said, “Well, David, you might be able to beat me, but I’m sure that in ten years there will be a computer program that will be able to beat you!” The optimism among computer pioneers was remarkable in those days. A decade earlier, in 1957, the American economist and political scientist Herbert Simon, who also worked in computer science, had proclaimed that a digital computer would beat the world chess champion within ten years. That was three decades off the mark. It should be noted that chess players did much better in the prediction game. The famous Russian grandmaster Yuri Averbakh, who was for many years the oldest grandmaster in the world until he died in May 2022, aged 100, appeared in a Moscow television show in 1963 and predicted that a computer would beat the world chess champion in 1998. Pretty close! But, back to that cocktail party in 1968. Levy, the reigning Scottish champion, thought John McCarthy’s prediction was utter nonsense and put up a bet of £500 (then worth $1,250), which was more than half his annual salary. McCarthy called over to Donald Michie—a British computer scientist who had worked with Alan Turing and others at Bletchley Park—who was also in the room. Upon hearing it, Michie said, “Can I take half the bet?” In subsequent years, a few more machine intelligence researchers joined and added to the bet until it had grown to £1,250 ($2,925) in 1974. It wasn’t until 1977 that a chess program was strong enough to put up a decent fight and seriously test the bet. Levy played a two-game match against CHESS 4.5, a program created by Larry Atkin, Keith Gorlen, and David Slate, computer scientists at Northwestern University. The program had participated successfully in human events and even won the 1977 Minnesota Open. The way Levy describes the match in his 1980 book More Chess and Computers echoes the sentiment of Kasparov upon facing Deep Blue almost twenty years later: “It was time for me to face up to my responsibilities and to defend the human race against the coming invasion.” Levy won the first game, after which the second game was not played because the best the computer could possibly do was tie the two-game match. In the following months, Levy won a few more matches, including one against Mac Hack, a program created by Richard Greenblatt at MIT. The program, also known as the Greenblatt Chess Program, had played against Bobby Fischer in spring 1977. (See annotated game on pages 385–86. Fischer crushed the chess program in three games and sent the notation to the Computer Chess Newsletter. These were Fischer’s first published games since his match with Boris Spassky in 1972, and the last until their rematch in 1992.) Then shortly before the ten-year deadline of the bet, in August–September 1978, Levy played a six-game match against CHESS 4.7, Slate and Atkins’s latest version, which ran on a CDC Cyber 176 mainframe computer located in Minneapolis (see annotated game on pages 386–87). Playing in a tuxedo in a soundproof booth at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Levy also won this match, but this time the computer managed to draw one game and win another. The world had witnessed the first computer victory against a human master in a serious event! Levy called the whole affair the end of an era in the annals of computer chess: “I had proved that my 1968 assessment had been correct, but, on the other hand, my opponent in this match was very, very much stronger than I had believed possible when I started the bet.” Shortly after winning the bet, Levy, in turn, offered a prize of $1,000 to the first programming team that would write a program capable of beating him in a four- or six-game match—to which the magazine Omni added another $4,000. It took some years (and one more failed attempt by the program Cray Blitz in 1984), but by 1989 the time had come. The program Deep Thought managed to beat Levy in a four-game match, winning all four games—the true end of an era. Well, Levy’s era. “I was quite happy,” he said much later. “I’d had a good run for my money: 21 years against an original bet of ten years. I think I sort of held out the human end versus machine struggles in chess pretty well. I got a lot of publicity; it was very good for my career.” While computer engineers were hopelessly optimistic in the 1960s and 1970s, chess grandmasters were eager to point that out, if only to defend their special status as intelligent thinkers. And they were right: those early chess programs were, simply put, rather terrible at chess. Another factor was that their progress was plodding. Back then, computers gained less than 200 rating points in strength per decade—a gap that humans can often bridge with a few years of studying and playing the game. In his famous 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, a discussion about the development of chess computers inspired Douglas Hofstadter to coin “Hofstadter’s Law”: “It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.” According to Hofstadter, Herbert Simon’s flawed prediction in 1957 was “just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter’s Law.” Although it would take some more years before humans had reasons to be worried, a small revolution did take place in the computer chess world in 1980, when the program Belle won the Computer World Chess Championship in Linz, Austria, ahead of 17 other programs. Developed by Ken Thompson, Belle was named after Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Bell Labs), where Thompson worked four decades after Turing. Thompson is a legendary name within computer science: as the developer of multiple programming languages and as one of the two creators (alongside Dennis Ritchie) of the Unix operating system—the foundation of Apple computers and Android phones. “Ken is the smartest person I ever met,” the German computer chess expert Frederic Friedel told me. Thompson wrote his first chess program to work in Unix in 1971, which saw many different iterations over the following years. It grew particularly strong after Joe Condon, a colleague of Thompson’s at Bell Labs, implemented a hardware-based move generator to be used with the software version of Belle. In 1980, running on an LSI-11 computer with that special piece of “chess hardware,” it could calculate 100,000 to 200,000 moves per second. Computer programs were now also participating in human tournaments, making them eligible for an Elo rating. In 1983 Belle became the first computer to attain the rating of a “master” under the terms of the United States Chess Federation (USCF) titles system. Kasparov–Deep Blue, 1996 On June 5, 1985, five months before he beat Anatoly Karpov and became the 13th World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov played a remarkable simultaneous exhibition in Hamburg, Germany. All of his opponents were microcomputers. The four leading companies of the time that produced chess computers for the consumer market, Hegener & Glaser, Fidelity Electronics, Novag, and SciSys, all participated with their strongest four models. Kasparov won all games: 32–0. He likes to refer to this time as “the good old days of computer chess,” and it’s understandable why. The 1980s would be the last decade in which humans could still laugh at computers playing chess. Incidentally, in that same year of 1985, three computer science graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—Feng-Hsiung Hsu, Thomas Anantharaman, and Murray Campbell—created a chess program called ChipTest. It was based on new Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) technology that allowed millions of transistors to be placed onto a single chip. Hsu had worked on a special chess-move generator chip—in other words, a chip specially designed to do one thing: play chess. Such chips were then duplicated and used in parallel, and, as a result, his early program could search approximately 50,000 moves per second. “I had the basic blueprint to build the mother of all chess machines, a machine that could defeat the world champion. In other words, I had a chance to pursue one of the oldest holy grails in computer science and possibly make history,” the Taiwan-born Hsu would later write. Further development improved ChipTest significantly in terms of programming and search, and in 1988 it was renamed Deep Thought, after the supercomputer in Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. A year later, now capable of searching 720,000 moves per second, Deep Thought won the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship with a perfect 5–0 score. It attracted even more attention when it participated in an open tournament in Long Beach, California, and became the first computer to beat a human grandmaster in an official tournament. The victim was none other than Bent Larsen, a former world championship candidate from Denmark. Later that year, Deep Thought defeated David Levy, who made the wager described earlier in the chapter, 4–0. Meanwhile, Kasparov had made friends with the aforementioned Friedel, who had co-organized the computer simul that Kasparov played in 1985. Based on correspondence between Friedel and the Deep Thought team, it’s interesting to see Kasparov’s thoughts on computers back then: Beginning of 1988: “Computers will never beat grandmasters.” Mid-1988: “Computers will never beat strong grandmasters.” End of 1988: “Okay, yes, Bent [Larsen] is a strong grandmaster. But a computer will never beat Karpov or me.” Kasparov played Deep Thought a bit later, in October 1989, at the New York Academy of Art. He won both games easily, which was only the start of IBM’s journey. Murray Campbell had joined the company in September, and Hsu joined a month later after defending his thesis at Carnegie Mellon. Hsu worked as a system architect and chip designer at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in Westchester County until 1999. How he and Campbell ended up at IBM is a great story. Peter Brown, who had earned his PhD in computer science at Carnegie Mellon, was working at IBM’s speech group, developing computer software to transcribe spoken text. Brown had heard about Hsu’s team and project. In his 2002 book Behind Deep Blue, Hsu wrote: Peter happened to be in the men’s room with Abe Peled, the IBM Research Vice President of Computer Science. They started talking about how expensive the Super Bowl TV commercial spots were. Peter suggested that he knew a way to gain much greater publicity at a far lower cost. He knew this group of graduate students working on computer chess at Carnegie Mellon, and he believed that this team would create the first chess machine to beat the world champion. Given the historical significance of the quest and the latent public interest, IBM could stand to gain huge advertising value from the endeavor. Oh, yes, members of the team were world-class people that IBM would be interested in hiring anyway. Abe got interested and asked Peter to look into it. In early 1996, the time had come for the biggest man versus machine clash in history. Finally, the world chess champion himself would sit down at the board facing a silicon opponent with, literally, nerves of steel. Kasparov had agreed to play IBM’s latest iteration, now named Deep Blue (after IBM’s nickname Big Blue), in a six-game match that would celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was played February 10–17 at the Philadelphia Convention Center for a $500,000 prize fund, with $400,000 going to the winner. Deep Blue was running on an IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer. Located in a lab in Yorktown Heights, New York, the 36-way machine consisted of 16-CPU frames plus four workstations, with 216 chess chips working together, and using an opening book developed by the American grandmaster Joel Benjamin. This meant that during the opening phase, the machine didn’t need to think but could rely on pre-programmed moves that were known to be good from human grandmaster practice. Six and a half years after its younger brother Deep Thought lost without a chance against Kasparov, Deep Blue proved up to the task: it won the first game (see annotated game on pages 389–90). It was a historic first victory for the computer against the strongest human player in a long time control game. Apart from the incredible search speed of 100 million positions per second, there was another reason why this computer was so strong. Hsu explained that the special chess chips evaluated the game positions more thoroughly than any other chess program: “Almost all the evaluation function terms were computed directly on chip.” As the computer scored its first win, the match was instantly front-page news, covered by outlets such as the New York Times and USA Today, and on television by The Tonight Show, Late Night with David Letterman, and Saturday Night Live. The interest in the match exceeded all expectations. “The IBM match website quickly turned into the most popular website up to that point in time, exceeding even the Super Bowl website and the Swimsuit Edition website of Sports Illustrated,” wrote Hsu. Chess fans had trouble accessing the site, and IBM dedicated another IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer, identical to the one running Deep Blue, to handle the server load. During a walk with Friedel on the streets of Philadelphia on the evening of that first game, Kasparov asked his friend: “Frederic, what if this thing is invincible?” It wasn’t yet. In the second game, Kasparov immediately took revenge, after which two draws followed. The score was equal, but Kasparov finished with two wins to win the match convincingly—not knowing this would be the last time a human ever won a multi-game match against a computer. The 1997 Match: The Holy Grail With all the media attention the match had attracted, it didn’t take long for IBM to suggest a return match the following year, and Kasparov agreed. This historic encounter for chess and AI was held May 3–11, 1997, in the Equitable Center in New York City, then headquarters of the Equitable Insurance firm. All over Manhattan there were posters on billboards with a portrait of Kasparov watching over chess pieces, and the tagline: “How do you make a computer blink?” The spectators watched from a 480-seat auditorium in the basement, with grandmaster Yasser Seirawan, then international master (now grandmaster) Maurice Ashley, and computer expert and international master Mike Valvo as commentators. Incidentally, they had access to Fritz 4, so they could pick another silicon brain whenever they wanted. There were three huge projection screens at the front. The left screen showed live footage from a studio on the 35th floor, where the games were played. For this rematch, IBM developed a new RS/6000 SP supercomputer with double the CPU speed, 480 new chess chips and a new evaluation function based on training games with grandmasters. Its calculation speed had also doubled to a staggering 200 million positions per second. The machine weighed over 1.5 tons and cost $10 million to construct. The prize fund was $1.1 million, with $700,000 for the winner, but both sides knew much more was at stake. Unlike the first match, this time the media attention was huge from the very start. Two hundred journalists showed up for the opening press conference, including the crews of TV networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox, and the BBC. As the match progressed, more and more reporters arrived, and the press conferences had to be moved to a bigger room. The media labeled the match as a clash between man and machine, with Newsweek’s cover calling it “The Brain’s Last Stand.” Six years later, Hsu wrote in his book that he saw it differently: as a match between “man as a performer and man as a toolmaker.” Kasparov playing the black pieces in one of the games of his 1997 rematch with Deep Blue, this day operated by IBM system architect Feng-Hsiung Hsu, right. Over the first four games, the match score completely mirrored the year before. This time, the 34-year-old Kasparov started with a win but then lost the second game, followed by two draws. His victory in the first game went surprisingly easily, but the Deep Blue team was quite content afterward. They were happy with the overall level of play they had seen and knew they only needed slight adjustments to fix the issues from game one, mostly related to the correct evaluation of king safety. Then came the second game—in hindsight, the key game for the whole match (see annotated game on pages 390–91). Deep Blue played remarkably well in a fairly “closed” middlegame, meaning a position with a blocked pawn formation in the center. Normally speaking, humans were better in those types of positions that required long-term maneuvering. Kasparov didn’t know that Joel Benjamin had trained the machine for months, especially for such positions. The computer had more space and skillfully used a potential open file, doubling its rooks before opening it. This reminded me of a famous maneuver by Kasparov’s nemesis Anatoly Karpov, who once used a bishop to “close off” a file before taking control of it. The programmers were happy that a recent update to their evaluation function of Deep Blue, which appreciated open files more, came to fruition. Unexpectedly, the computer opened a new front on the kingside (a move that felt strangely human!) before entering with its pieces on the queenside. Kasparov decided to sacrifice a pawn, but Deep Blue surprised everyone again by not accepting the sacrifice. It played a quiet bishop move instead—another move reminiscent of the chess played by Kasparov’s greatest human rival. “Maybe they gave Karpov a call in Moscow,” joked one of the commentators during the game. The move was subtle but lethal, and, a few moves later, Kasparov threw in the towel. It was the best game ever played by a computer: real chess, played in human style. It had passed the Turing Test gloriously! But there was one issue: Deep Blue’s last move wasn’t good at all. You could even call it a blunder. Later that evening, the English journalist and organizer Malcolm Pein, who was in close contact with both IBM and the Kasparov team, received a phone call from the Norwegian American grandmaster and reporter Jonathan Tisdall. “I think I have a story, but nobody wants to use it,” Tisdall said. “Did you see Ferret’s analysis? It gives zeros!” Tisdall was referring to the analysis engine of the Internet Chess Club (more on that in Chapter 8), which also suggested the final position to be equal. “I thought that was a mistake, but after Tisdall’s call, I gave it a closer look,” said Pein. “And then I broke the story in the Daily Telegraph: ‘Kasparov Resigns in Drawn Position.’ ” As it turned out, Kasparov could have entered White’s position with his queen and played for perpetual check (endless checks, out of which there is no escape, leading to a move repetition). Friedel came to the same conclusion after analyzing the position with his chess engine Fritz, and the next morning he told the Russian grandmaster Yury Dokhoian, Kasparov’s main chess assistant. Dokhoian was shocked to realize that it could be true. Of course, he had discussed that final position with Kasparov the night before, but they had overlooked an important possibility that was part of Friedel’s analysis. When the team went for a walk to have lunch, Dokhoian told Kasparov the bad news. Friedel wrote, “Garry clutched his head and froze in the middle of Fifth Avenue. There were no expletives, no cursing, just stunned silence.” It was a combination of disbelief and confusion. How could a computer that strong, from a position with an overwhelming advantage, suddenly allow a draw? According to Hsu, Deep Blue’s strange choice resulted from some kind of bug, but this crucial piece of information was only revealed six years later. To Kasparov, the difference between Deep Blue’s level of play in games one and two was night and day, which further fueled his suspicions that something was off. Two draws followed, and the mirrored score with the 1996 match ended when the fifth game was also drawn. With a tied score, the sixth and last game would decide everything. Minutes before the start of that final game, fans were still trying to get into the Equitable Center. Hsu wrote, “The official price for a place in the 500-seat auditorium was $25, but spare tickets are changing hands for as much as $100. It’s the hottest gig in town.” In the opening, a Caro–Kann defense, Kasparov played a risky move order, which allowed White to play a promising piece sacrifice based on long-term compensation. If the computer decided against it, Kasparov would have an easy game—the expected scenario. The sacrifice was supposed to be too long-term for a computer to evaluate properly and something only humans would play unless it were part of the machine’s opening book (Deep Blue’s “homework” created by IBM’s grandmasters’ team). Kasparov must have estimated the odds of that almost zero since he rarely played the Caro–Kann. Without spending time on the clock, Deep Blue gave up its knight instantly, shocking Kasparov and viewers across the globe. Kasparov’s king was soon deprived of the right to castle and had to run for safety. Deep Blue continued the game with simple developing moves to fully mobilize its army and threw in some powerful pawn pushes on the queenside to reach a winning position as early as move 19. It was suddenly all over: Kasparov was blown off the board. He had lost the match (see annotated game on pages 391–92). How could Deep Blue know it had to sacrifice its knight? In his 2002 book, Hsu wrote that the move was indeed part of the opening book: “The position on the playing board had actually shown up in our lab about a month earlier when the other grandmasters were working on Deep Blue’s opening book. At the time, the grandmasters did not bother to play out the position either; they just looked at Deep Blue’s evaluation of the position and moved to other work.” In a controversial interview in 2009, one of the team members, the Spanish grandmaster Miguel Illescas, shared a different version of what happened: White’s crucial eighth move had been included in the opening book the morning before the game was played. According to Kasparov, who wrote down his thoughts on the match in his 2017 book Deep Thinking, that was too much of a coincidence: “The odds of winning the lottery are quite attractive in comparison to those of the Deep Blue team entering a specific variation I had never played before in my life into the computer’s book on the very same day it appeared on the board in the final game.” It should be noted that another Deep Blue team member, Joel Benjamin, later said that Illescas’s statement was simply not true; White’s eighth move had been part of the computer’s opening book for a long time. I decided to double-check with Illescas for this book. He replied in an email, saying he agreed with Joel, who “knew better about the Caro–Kann.” Malcolm Pein has his own theory about what happened. “It still annoys me to this day,” he told me in December 2023. “They [Kasparov’s team] were convinced that Deep Blue was taking its opening moves from Richard Lang’s ChessGenius program, a popular engine at the time, and asked me to buy a copy. I told them I was a hundred percent certain it wasn’t using that, but they were convinced. I spent quite a sum of money at the chess shop near Huntington Station and gave them the program. They were misled. They misled themselves.” After his resignation, Kasparov’s mother convinced her son to take the elevator to the 50th floor for the post-match press conference, where he faced hundreds of photographers and reporters. Hsu: “He stared into the middle-distance, over everyone’s head, avoiding eye contact and scarcely blinking, looking like he might spontaneously combust. There was only mild applause when the winning Deep Blue team arrived; it was as though everyone was slightly embarrassed or perhaps afraid to cheer for fear of offending the mighty Garry.” People applauded when he took the microphone, though, and as soon as he started talking, Kasparov started to dominate the conversation. He wasn’t happy. “I’m sorry, I haven’t deserved that, and I have to apologize for today’s performance, but I don’t think it has anything to do with chess or the match. I had no real strength to fight, and I think the result of the so-called ‘game’ today was justified,” he stated. Standing among the reporters, the members of the Deep Blue team had been told by the company’s PR people not to smile. As Kasparov continued, they didn’t have much reason to anyway. “I think it’s time for Deep Blue to start playing real chess, and I personally assure you, everybody here, that if Deep Blue will start playing competitive chess, I personally guarantee you I’ll tear it into pieces, with no question,” Kasparov said fiercely. He then pointed his arrows to the several grandmasters who had helped the Deep Blue programmers: “How many players they will hire, they have to put more players, of course, on the bench because some of them are probably too shy to show up; they can hire the entire [grandmaster] force of the United States of America, it will not help because we know how a machine plays.” He wasn’t holding back: Kasparov thought the match had been unfair. “Put it in competitive chess, put it in a fair contest, not that one, make IBM a player, not a sponsor at the same time. I will see what’s going to happen, and I think it’s just the beginning,” he said. But within days, IBM announced there wouldn’t be a third match. And why would there be? For them, there was hardly anything to gain. Their match victory led to incredible global media coverage and did only good for the company’s value. Some have suggested it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars in PR. IBM claimed that the entire Deep Blue project had cost them $20 million, and after the second match their market capitalization increased by billions overnight. Remember IBM’s Peter Brown complaining about the cost of a Super Bowl advertisement in the men’s room and realizing the potential of those chess developers to create something of bigger value? Well, that kind of came about, didn’t it? In another funny twist, during the 2001 Super Bowl television broadcast, Pepsi ran a spot featuring Kasparov, clearly inspired by the match. This time, Kasparov defeated the computer (modeled on HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation of 2001: A Space Odyssey) but then got troubled by an elevator and a Pepsi vending machine, the machines taking revenge. The price for a 30-second Super Bowl ad was roughly $2.2 million at the time. Most experts believe Kasparov was still stronger than Deep Blue in 1997—so why did he lose the match? Because he was human. Already during the match, Kasparov admitted that he got carried away, in an interview with the English grandmaster Daniel King that was included in King’s 1997 book on the match. The day after the fourth game, Kasparov told King: “Game 2 took a lot of energy out of me; afterward I was really furious. I couldn’t prepare normally. I played games 3 and 4 in a big crisis.” One of the things Kasparov was not happy about was that IBM had declined his request to see the logs of the played games. Some of Deep Blue’s moves seemed overly human (such as not accepting his pawn sacrifice in the second game), so he wanted to see the exact lines of what it had been thinking about. In his 2002 book, Hsu would call this “a request for an unfair advantage,” adding that the match “would have been a sham if he were given free access.” In any case, Kasparov’s psychological state wasn’t where it should have been. In hindsight, he forecasted his demise in that conversation with King before the fifth game: “Whatever happens in this match, I know Deep Blue can be beaten unless the man—in this case me—is not in the right mental condition. It can only win because of human weakness.” Those turned out to be prophetic words. One of Kasparov’s strategies in the match was that he played more quiet openings than usual because he felt Deep Blue would struggle more against those. It has been suggested that Kasparov would have fared better if he had used his normal openings, but I feel that his mindset was a much more decisive factor. Kasparov is a rather emotional human being. There’s nothing wrong with that, but as soon as all the suspicions about human interference and other negative thoughts started to dominate his mind, he could no longer play his best chess. I also think Kasparov could have beaten Deep Blue in that second match if only he had played his best chess. After winning the first match in 1996, Kasparov had estimated the computer’s strength at roughly 2700, and it had taken IBM six years to reach that, being rated roughly 2550 in 1990. “I had trouble believing they could get it up to my 2800 level without a few more years of development,” was Kasparov’s position then. Besides the fact that IBM was going to invest millions—having seen what this match did in PR terms and what potential a possible victory had—what Kasparov underestimated was that there was also a chance for him not to perform at 2800 level the next year. Because of the enormous pressure, because of this particular opponent, one which lacked emotion, and because the match was only six games, a psychological disturbance could change a lot—and that’s what happened. Kasparov self-destructed. Was Deep Blue Intelligent? With each new product of AI research—from IBM’s Deep Blue to their Watson, which defeated human opponents at Jeopardy!, to ChatGPT—the same old question pops up: “Is it intelligent?” After winning his first match against Deep Blue in 1996, Kasparov wrote an article in TIME magazine titled “The Day I Sensed a New Kind of Intelligence,” where he reflected on the fact that, for the first time, he felt that a computer had played in a rather human manner. However, the way it figured out those human moves was not the same. Kasparov wondered: “So the question is, if the computer makes the same move that I would make for completely different reasons, has it made an ‘intelligent’ move? Is the intelligence of an action dependent on who (or what) takes it?” At that point, he felt he might have a few more years left before a computer would beat him, but it turned out to be only 15 months more. In his 2017 book Deep Thinking, Kasparov firmly said no to the notion that he had lost to an intelligent entity: “Deep Blue was intelligent the way your programmable alarm clock is intelligent. Not that losing to a $10 million alarm clock made me feel any better.” Deep Blue’s main programmer, Feng-Hsiung Hsu, agreed here, noting subtly, “It is only a finely crafted tool that exhibits intelligent behavior in a limited domain. Garry lost the match, but he was the player with the real intelligence—Deep Blue would never be able to come up with the imaginative accusations.” Two decades after losing the match, Kasparov elaborated on his point about losing to an alarm clock. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman in 2019, the 13th World Chess Champion said: Considering chess as the sort of pinnacle of intellectual activities was our mistake because we just thought, “Oh, it’s a game of the highest intellect, you have to be intelligent, and you could see things that the ordinary mortals could not see …” It’s a game. All machines had to do with this game was to make fewer mistakes, not to solve the game. Because the game cannot be solved … I think that is what we have to learn from the 1997 experience and from further encounters with computers and sort of the current state of affairs with AlphaZero beating other machines. The idea that we can compete with computers in so-called intellectual fields: it was wrong from the very beginning. Kasparov already knew in 1997 that computers would soon take over from humans, but he played the match anyway because he felt (and rightly so) that he was still capable of postponing the inevitable a little longer. The insight he had gained two decades later was that in the long run, computers will always be better than humans at avoiding mistakes in closed games with perfect information, which forms only a small subcategory of what we call intelligence. Game six of the 1997 match was Deep Blue’s last official game. After dismantling, it was separated into two halves, with one sent to the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC. IBM held onto the other half for a few years before donating it to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Deep Blue’s victory over Kasparov didn’t stop humans from playing chess against computers right away. In fact, it would take almost a decade for everyone to agree that computers were better chess players than humans, as we will see in the next chapter. There, we will also learn about another pivotal moment for AI and chess—the appearance of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, and what it meant for the game.",

      "content": "Chapter 6Beyond Deep Blue: Age of the Neural Networks “The current top 100 would completely annihilate the top 100 from 50 years ago. They are extremely tougher, tactically more adept, and understand more positions, thanks to computers but also in general terms.” —Erwin l’Ami, grandmaster, 2023 One afternoon in the spring of 2000, the Dutch grandmaster Paul van der Sterren’s phone rang. On the other end of the line was Sytze Faber, a member of the board of the Dutch Chess Federation. Shortly before the call, Van der Sterren had received his official invitation to the upcoming Dutch championship, which would take place in May of that year and, for the fourth time in a row, in Rotterdam. But this time, everything would be different. Faber notified him of a remarkable plan: he wanted to have a computer participate in the tournament. “I still remember exactly where I was standing in my living room when I got that phone call,” Van der Sterren told me during a conversation for this book. “He informed me about this plan, and I felt the floor below me crumbling away. ‘What the hell is this? This cannot be true,’ I thought. But soon, I realized he was serious.” Van der Sterren protested, but Faber had already decided: “Sorry, Paul, but it’s going to happen.” Although Deep Blue retired after the 1997 match, programmers of other chess engines, running on ordinary machines instead of $10 million supercomputers, still tried their luck for a few more years against human opponents. Or was it the humans who were trying their luck? As long as they could still put up a fight, man versus machine chess remained exciting and provided opportunities for publicity. At least, that was what Faber must have thought when he arranged for one of the 12 participants of the Dutch championship to be a special edition of ChessBase’s program Fritz, called Fritz SSS*. It was the first and only time in the long history of chess that a computer had participated in an official national championship. The whole situation was highly controversial, if not bizarre, and was covered in international chess magazines. Two local journalists gave the same verdict independently of one another in their newspaper columns: “out of their minds” and “everyone has gone mad.” But it all went according to Faber’s plan. Except for Van der Sterren, the participants were persuaded to participate and play the computer in one of the rounds thanks to a sizeable increase in the prize fund from 100,000 to 170,000 guilders (equivalent to roughly €77,000 or $70,000 today; this was two years before the Netherlands adopted the euro). The money came from multiple sponsors, many related to the computer world, while ChessBase had somehow managed to set up an excellent deal as it only had to pay 12,000 guilders ($5,500). Meanwhile, several angry chess fans set up a website under the name Chess Protest, where the name of the computer program was changed to “Fritz $$$” and which received many statements of support against Fritz’s participation. Wasn’t a Dutch championship supposed to determine who was the country’s best human player? Van der Sterren said, “I found it absolutely unethical to have a computer playing in a human championship, which would then be a disrupting factor. It just wasn’t fair, a kind of distortion of competition. I wanted to keep the tournament pure.” Paul van der Sterren in action during the 1986 Dutch Championship. The organizers had decided that if one player didn’t want to play against Fritz, they would receive zero points for that game and not share in the 70 percent extra prize money. If two players didn’t want to play, the whole thing would be put off, and Fritz wouldn’t participate. Besides Van der Sterren, two other players expressed unhappiness about the situation but played anyway. One participant, international master Manuel Bosboom, did sit down at the board against Fritz but resigned after four moves. It was not that he wanted to make his point without losing his money; he realized that if he didn’t play either, none of the participants would earn the extra money. Van der Sterren, who lived in Amsterdam, didn’t even bother to make the trip to Rotterdam. His clock was started, and, after an hour, his game was declared a win for Fritz (following regulations) without a single move being played. Van der Sterren was praised by chess journalists and received many messages of support from all over the country. Several media requested interviews, including the popular talk show Barend en Van Dorp, but Van der Sterren refused. He didn’t want to join the hype and give the sponsors their desired publicity. Fritz SSS* beat four players (besides Van der Sterren), drew with four others, and lost two games. Many Dutch Chess Federation officials were unhappy with the situation and, after the tournament ended, they decided that this computer stunt was a case of “once but never again.” Within a few weeks, Van der Sterren noticed financial compensation of a few thousand guilders in his bank account. End of an Era: The Last Man vs. Machine Matches Humans played against computers for only a few more years. Vladimir Kramnik, the Russian player who dethroned Kasparov in 2000 to become the 14th World Chess Champion, tied a match with Deep Fritz 7 in Bahrain in 2002. Kasparov tied two matches against the programs X3D Fritz and Deep Junior in 2003. Three years later, the writing was on the wall when Kramnik lost a match to Deep Fritz 4–2, one that went down in history after witnessing the biggest blunder ever committed by a reigning world champion. Kramnik allowed a checkmate in one move in game two; an incredible oversight (see annotated game on pages 395–96). Soon afterward, ChessBase started advertising their latest program, Fritz 10, with the tagline: “Ask Kramnik how it feels!” As if Kramnik’s loss wasn’t enough, humanity had suffered another, even bigger loss a year earlier. Playing from the Wembley Conference Center in London, the top English grandmaster Michael Adams didn’t stand a chance against a computer called Hydra, backed by Abu Dhabi money. It ran on a 64-way cluster computer: basically, 64 computers connected and operating like a single machine. Hydra was a true monster, aptly named after the multiheaded serpent-like creature from Greek mythology. It won the match with a devastating 5½–½ score. Adams had barely scraped a single draw and lost five games. Looking back at the history of man versus machine matches, I feel Adams–Hydra signaled the moment when computers truly conquered mankind. In those years, the top engines Fritz, Junior, and Shredder were probably already stronger than Deep Blue, but with the appearance of Hydra, all doubt disappeared. At the time, the English grandmaster David Norwood reached the same conclusion: “Last week saw the end of humanity. When Deep Blue beat Kasparov eight years ago, there was still a great deal of doubt. If a top human grandmaster focused on the weaknesses of their artificial opponents, they could still win. The Wembley match between Britain’s Michael Adams and Hydra finally buried that notion. The Terminators have won.” Organizing further man versus machine matches became entirely pointless as the years went by. To borrow Kasparov’s comparison, who would want to see Usain Bolt try his luck against a Ferrari? Occasionally, odds matches have been held, where the computer is handicapped in different ways to see what it does to its level and whether a grandmaster would have a chance. Like taking one of the wheels off that Ferrari, the computer would play without one or two pawns, or start without its queen’s rook, while the human played without its queen’s knight. In most cases, the human grandmasters would still struggle against the computer. Where humans had to throw in the towel long ago, computers still compete against computers. Unlike those early tournaments in the 1970s, today’s programs run in the cloud and compete on online servers. The TCEC (Top Chess Engine Championship) is a well-known competition, while Chess.com runs its own Computer Chess Championship. Such computer versus computer games are the highest-level chess you’ll encounter on this planet. Still, most fans can’t be bothered with it, just as they wouldn’t watch two soccer teams with perfect defenses who therefore almost always played out 0–0 draws against each other. They prefer watching humans play other humans. Beauty lies in imperfection. There are, for example, many theoretical endgames where it wouldn’t make sense to watch computers play it out since the result would already be known because of their flawless play. The same endgames played among humans are often still fascinating to watch. “Do they know this position? Do they remember all the details? Can they find the narrow path to the win with just a few minutes left on the clock?” Identifying with that struggle as a viewer while the grandmasters are sweating at the board is what sport is about. Early Computer Preparation These days, Kasparov is much more interested in working with AI instead of against it. Soon after his last match with Deep Blue, he was already wondering: “What if the combination of a human and machine would play chess? Wouldn’t that lead to the highest possible level of play?” Kasparov tried it out in 1998 when he played an unusual match with the top Bulgarian player Veselin Topalov in León, Spain. He called it “Advanced Chess.” During the game, alongside the chess set and clock, both players had a PC available at their table, running on Pentium II 333 MHz processors and using the chess program of their choice. It was the complete opposite of what is allowed in serious tournaments or online chess. Two conclusions were drawn from this match, which ended in a tie. First, the games were far from the perfection the organizers and participants sought, as the time to choose the moves was limited to an hour per player. Also, Kasparov’s superiority in tactical play over Topalov was nullified as the assistance of the computer likely benefited Topalov more. The Advanced Chess experiment was only organized five times. Still, the co-operation between humans and computers has changed chess as a sport dramatically, but in a different way. I am talking about an essential aspect of chess here: preparation for the opening phase. As soon as the computer started beating grandmasters, it became a powerful tool for analyzing games and positions. Amateurs and grandmasters affectionately began to refer to their chess program as “my silicon friend.” An early adopter, Kasparov remained ahead of his peers in computer preparation for years. At one point, he called himself “the best-prepared player in the history of chess.” Even strong opponents sometimes avoided playing their favorite openings against him, fearing a powerful “novelty,” a home-cooked new move that would push them into unexplored territories where only Kasparov knew the way. In 1999 he said, “There is a computer, and you should not ignore that fact but adjust to it. It’s something you must do, whether you like it or not.” This is true indeed, especially nowadays, so in that sense, Kasparov was a pioneer. A famous example of Kasparov’s domination in the opening came in game ten of his world championship match against Viswanathan Anand in 1995 (see annotated game on pages 388–89). On move 14, Kasparov played a stunning theoretical novelty in the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez opening. He sacrificed a pawn, followed by a rook. Although Anand defended admirably, he couldn’t avoid a loss. Afterward, Kasparov revealed that he had analyzed the rook sacrifice extensively with the engine Fritz. It was the first time the computer had helped a player win a chess game at the highest level. But working with the computer might have harmed Kasparov five years later. He lost his world title to Vladimir Kramnik in 2000 after the latter continuously played the infamous Berlin defense against his Ruy Lopez. It is a variation where the queens are traded early; play kind of skips the middlegame and moves straight into the endgame. White game after White game, Kasparov kept trying to tear down his opponent’s “Berlin Wall” but he failed to win this endgame even once. (In world championship matches, players alternate playing as White and Black. The advantage of being White is somewhat similar to being the player to serve in tennis. Following this analogy, Kasparov could only tie his service games.) “Kasparov has never been open about it, but I believe one of the reasons he was so obsessed with this endgame was because the computer was giving him an advantage,” the top Dutch grandmaster Anish Giri told me. In other words, Kasparov put too much faith in the computer’s positive evaluation of the endgame. Giri: “He kept thinking, ‘I must be better.’ And kept digging through that endgame. He kept going for it, and then he would offer a draw very early because he would realize during the game, ‘Okay, I don’t understand why I’m better.’ I think a massive issue was that the computer wrongly said that White is better.” Nowadays, top grandmasters consider the move suggestions made by modern chess programs to be something rather close to the Ultimate Truth. During that Kasparov–Kramnik match, and for a few years afterward, computers were considered helpful tools, but ones that couldn’t be fully trusted yet. It was Kramnik’s turn to end up on the wrong side in his 2004 world championship match when he faced a bright talent of the new generation: the Hungarian Peter Leko. The match was played in Brissago, Switzerland, for a $1.2 million prize fund. After seven games, the score was equal. The day before his fourth turn with the white pieces, Kramnik told his team that he was ready to fight Leko’s Marshall Gambit, another variation in the Ruy Lopez where Black sacrifices a pawn for activity. His team wasn’t fully ready yet, and one of his helpers, the Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler, stayed up all night analyzing with a computer engine. He shared his work with Kramnik the next morning. Eighteen moves into the game, Leko had only 17 minutes left on the clock to reach move 40, meaning he had less than one minute on average for his next 19 moves. Having made prepared moves only, Kramnik had a hundred minutes left for his next 19 moves. But something was wrong. Vladimir Kramnik, left, and Peter Leko, right, during Game 2 of their 2004 world championship match in Brissago, Switzerland. Back in his hotel room, Svidler was following the game on his laptop. The more it progressed, the more worried he became for his boss. “I lay down and, for some reason, couldn’t get to sleep, although we hadn’t slept all night. Something was nagging inside me …” Svidler was quoted in the 2007 book From London to Elista by Ilia Levitov and Evgeny Bareev, and soon it would become clear what it was: a glaring error. A small but crucial part of the analysis that he had provided in the morning contained a big hole. And, now that the game was underway, the only person who could save Kramnik from falling into the ditch was Kramnik himself—but that day, he was too optimistic. For his 19th move, Kramnik made the rational decision to do something … irrational. “I understood that if I wanted to win this game, then a move—no matter how different—needed to be made quickly,” Kramnik said in From London to Elista. He had a choice of more or less forcing the game to end in a draw or playing a dangerous move, and, backed by Svidler’s computer prep, he confidently went for the latter. He explained his decision with gambling terminology: “And I took the decision to play for a win, enlisting the support of the computer. I played va banque, it’s hard to blame anyone here, even myself. I didn’t make a mistake, one could say that I placed ‘everything on zero.’ ” Kramnik went for a risky line that involved the sacrifice of his queen. He would then promote one of his pawns to get a new queen, and Leko’s counterplay would come too late—was the idea. As it turned out, Kramnik put too much faith in the computer. Sitting at the board and using his human brain, Leko refuted his opponent’s computer homework and demonstrated that his counterplay was on time. While Kramnik’s pawn was on its way to becoming a queen, his king was getting checkmated. Leko won in 32 moves (see annotated game on pages 394–95) and took the lead in the match, which he maintained for five more games. The computer accident could have had historic implications. It was only in game 14, the last game of the match, that Kramnik beat Leko in a must-win game, leveling the score to 7–7 and retaining his world title. (It would be the last time a world championship match was played without a tiebreak.) What went wrong exactly? Was Leko a better calculator than the computer? Not really, unless the computer wasn’t given enough time to calculate. Because of the enormous number of positions that had to be checked overnight, Svidler had given the engine perhaps only a minute or two to calculate what turned out to be the critical position in the game—much less than Leko had at his disposal behind the board. It was later discovered that if Svidler had given the computer about 30 seconds more to look at that critical position, the engine would have changed its evaluation in favor of Black, and Kramnik would not have lost the game. Modern Preparation An indication of how strong chess engines have become over the last two decades can be gleaned once you realize that, in 2024, an engine like Stockfish will tell you the correct evaluation of the Kramnik–Leko position in less than a second. Modern-day engines are simply too strong to allow such accidents to occur. As a result, the quality of grandmaster preparation is exceptionally high these days. At the same time, preparation is not as enjoyable as it used to be, at least according to two world-class “preparation experts”: both the Dutch grandmaster Erwin l’Ami (who was part of Veselin Topalov’s team of seconds before and during the 2010 World Chess Championship, and who now works for Anish Giri), and also Peter Heine Nielsen (a second to both Viswanathan Anand, between 2005 and 2013, and Magnus Carlsen, from 2013 till present). “Back in the early 2000s, chess computers would be okay tactically, but positionally there was still much left to be desired,” explained l’Ami. “This meant that the human part of the work was more significant, and analyzing was more interesting. It is less enjoyable these days because your own input is not so important any more. Especially in major openings like the Ruy Lopez or the Catalan, you can hardly make headway.” In the early days, developing new ideas in complicated positions and catching opponents off-guard was still possible. L’Ami once won a game entirely thanks to preparation when he played the Ukrainian grandmaster Vadim Malakhatko in 2003 (see annotated game on pages 393–94). He had devised a new idea, analyzed it with an engine, and memorized it all in his head. Because Malakhatko played exactly as predicted, l’Ami got to play his idea and didn’t need to think at all. The time control was 90 minutes for the whole game and a 30-second “Fischer bonus” per move. At the start of the game, l’Ami’s clock showed 1:30; at the end it was 1:41. He had made so many moves without thinking that he had gained 11 minutes on the clock by the time Malakhatko resigned. Nielsen told me, “Back then, computers were quite weak, so if you used them properly you had a massive advantage over your opponent. You would try to dominate your opponent with preparation, and you could do it successfully.” Strong preparation meant checking the opponent’s games, having more knowledge than them, having more ideas, and finding holes in the opponent’s opening repertoire. “When I play in the Bundesliga [the German chess league] these days,” continued Nielsen, “I feel I no longer have an advantage over weaker players because preparation has become too easy. Twenty years ago, I felt I had a massive advantage simply because the technology was weaker. You could still use it, but you had to use it very intelligently and aggressively, while nowadays it’s almost automatic. The tool has become too good, becoming a big equalizer.” According to Nielsen, chess preparation used to be closer to science, where you could put a human hypothesis to the empirical “computer test.” It was much more of a cooperation between man and machine, similar to Kasparov’s Advanced Chess idea. These days, it’s much more practical; it’s about finding which moves are the most unpleasant for the opponent. “The practical component is always to try to win a chess game. I now fully look at it from a sports perspective,” said Nielsen. The higher levels of opening preparation these days have led to a higher level and perhaps even more interesting type of play, according to grandmaster and chess commentator Maurice Ashley: The players have benefited enormously from what AI has done, showing how to defend better, knowing when you can actually sacrifice a pawn for the initiative. Before, people were just doing it cavalierly. But now you have to really have super-refined judgment around this sort of thing. And now they are even entering worlds that no one would enter before, positions that are almost impossible for humans to play. It’s so chaotic. But people can study it carefully and enter complicated openings. So I think the level of chess is elevated dramatically as a result, and we’re seeing more and more interesting positions, far beyond what we could have seen before. There is one caveat, though. Everyone has access to the same super-strong computer engines, so if you find a remarkable tactical idea, you can be sure your opponent has found the same idea. You must find other areas to make life difficult for your opponent. Two common methods are trying to surprise your opponent or test their memory. Almost all top players play a wide range of openings, so there are always opportunities to play something the opponent doesn’t fully expect. As White, players can play the pawn in front of their queenside bishop, their queen’s pawn, or their king’s pawn, while moving the king’s knight toward the center is another good first move. You just cannot predict any more what they will do. This is entirely different from, for example, the times of Bobby Fischer, who spent almost his entire career only playing his king’s pawn on the first move. Today, players can play a lot more openings and variations than in the old days because the computer has shown them to be playable, as Anish Giri explained to me: “The stronger the engine gets, the more it shows that variations that were considered bad before are no longer bad because the engine is able to defend them. Even what used to be a dubious opening turns out to be playable if you defend accurately and the engine shows how to defend. The King’s Gambit is an extreme example, but it doesn’t lose. Nothing loses.” While playing many different opening systems, players tend to go for long and complicated variations regularly, hoping their opponent doesn’t remember all the details. Both at the top and at amateur level, chess has become a bit of a memory game in the opening phase. There are many examples to be found in top-level chess. In a game Giri played against the US grandmaster Fabiano Caruana at the Superbet Chess Classic, held in May 2023 in Bucharest, Romania, the players agreed to a draw after 26 moves. The opening was the popular Italian Game but became highly complex early on, with Giri having to calculate a queen sacrifice that would eventually lead to a draw by move repetition. The Dutchman spent about an hour and ten minutes calculating (or rather, digging up from his memory) the moves, while Caruana, like l’Ami in the above example, ended the game with more time on his clock than he started with. He had done his homework, and Giri had passed the memory test (see annotated game on page 400). Another reason why players have to memorize so much more than they used to is down to the internet, which we’ll talk about much more in the third part of the book. Because of the enormous increase in online tournaments, players are playing hundreds of games a year more (at faster time controls) than they used to. “I play like 700 games a year now,” said Giri. “In many of those games, I play something that is an opening that I looked at, so relevant things, and my colleagues also did that. So now the database is flooded with games and all sorts of different openings, and you’re not even able to digest all the games.” At my chess club, many young players study chess openings fanatically. Amateur players tend to exaggerate the importance of memory, says Giri: “You have to realize that memory is only relevant between two players of approximately equal strength. If you are an amateur and memorize everything, but you are bad at chess, then you might not be good enough to hold it, and you will lose any final position you managed to recall. But if you have two top players, they’re so good that by the time they reach the final position of their analysis, they might be able to play it out well. So it’s just a memory game among top players, but not elsewhere; you cannot replace top level with memory.” In 2010, when l’Ami and Nielsen were part of the opposing teams in the Anand–Topalov world championship match, the memory aspect played a role from the get-go. A difficult middlegame position came on the board that both teams had looked at before the match, where Topalov sacrificed a pawn in return for an attack on Anand’s king. The Indian, who was defending his title in this match, knew that, at some point, he had to make a king move toward the direction of the center of the board, but he couldn’t remember at which exact moment. He played it one move too early and lost the game instead of drawing it. Anand had failed the memory test, but would end up winning the match (see annotated game on pages 396–97). Because of the tsunami of available information on chess openings, the most recent development is that top players tend to avoid playing variations that require deep memory. “It seems that there isn’t a memory savant in top chess right now,” said Giri. “None of the top players have an insane memory, even for people with the so-called best memory, like Magnus. I can show you countless examples of him misremembering things. So they started changing strategies and you see that players are not all playing the same forcing lines any more. People change strategy.” The Arrival of AlphaZero On December 5, 2017, a watershed moment in the history of computer chess occurred. It was the day Google DeepMind released a preprint paper introducing their chess-playing computer AlphaZero. At that time, the strongest chess engine was Stockfish, an open-source program originally developed by Tord Romstad from Norway and Marco Costalba from Italy. Costalba had come up with the name Stockfish. It refers to the unsalted fish dried on wooden racks in Norway by cold air and wind, which is also exported in large amounts to the Veneto region of northern Italy, where Costalba lives. His explanation: like the fish, the chess engine is an original Norwegian product further developed in Italy. The DeepMind paper revealed that this little fish had experienced a close encounter with a giant chess-playing shark—a hundred-game match between AlphaZero and Stockfish 8—which had not even been close. The shark had beaten—no, obliterated—Stockfish by scoring 28 wins, 72 draws, and not a single loss. AlphaZero was ridiculously strong. The other thing was how it got so strong. Without being fed any knowledge except for the chess rules, AlphaZero had reached a superhuman level in just four hours of playing games against itself. My colleague and friend Mike Klein found a good metaphor in his story for Chess.com at the time: “This would be akin to a robot being given access to thousands of metal bits and parts, but no knowledge of a combustion engine. Then it experiments numerous times with every combination possible until it builds a Ferrari. All that in less [than half the] time than it takes to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The program had four hours to play itself many, many times, thereby becoming its own teacher.” When I spoke to him for this book, Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad added a little nuance: “This four-hour claim is kind of true, but at the same time also kind of ridiculous, because they were using an immense amount of hardware, like thousands of machines training in parallel. If you wanted to do this at home, it would take about 40 years.” Even so, the news about AlphaZero was just mind-blowing, and over the next few weeks the chess world was talking about nothing else. I attended the London Chess Classic as a journalist that first week of December 2017, with Mike, which allowed us to interview a few strong players and get their first reactions to the news. Magnus Carlsen’s assistant Peter Heine Nielsen said: “After reading the paper but especially seeing the games, I thought … well, I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they play chess. I feel now I know.” Garry Kasparov, who had quite a bit of experience with computers himself, already saw broader implications: “We have always assumed that chess required too much empirical knowledge for a machine to play so well from scratch, with no human knowledge added at all. Of course, I’ll be fascinated to see what we can learn about chess from AlphaZero since that is the great promise of machine learning in general—machines figuring out rules that humans cannot detect. But, obviously, the implications are wonderful, far beyond chess and other games. The ability of a machine to replicate and surpass centuries of human knowledge in complex closed systems is a world-changing tool.” Hassabis and DeepMind Google DeepMind’s CEO, Demis Hassabis, was a fanatic chess player in his youth and nothing less than a child prodigy. As a teenager, he used some of his prize money to buy himself his first computer, and soon he was creating his own programs. He cofounded DeepMind in 2010. From the start, DeepMind has focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence, combining it with neuroscientific insights and new computer hardware developments. In his introduction to the 2019 book Game Changer, a fascinating, chess-technical exploration of the style of AlphaZero, Hassabis formulated his company’s ambition: “To build intelligent systems that can learn to solve any complex task by themselves, and then use this technology to help find solutions to some of society’s biggest challenges and unanswered questions.” Hassabis has stated in many interviews that he wants to “solve intelligence” and then use intelligence “to solve everything else.” Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis at the 2018 London Chess Classic. DeepMind’s first notable success came in December 2013 when its learning algorithm Deep Q-Network (DQN) achieved expert-level scores in Atari games by teaching itself using only the raw pixels on the screen as inputs. A year after Google (now Alphabet) purchased DeepMind for a reported £400 million ($650 million) in 2014, Hassabis’s company pulled off something more significant. Their neural network algorithm AlphaGo became the first machine to beat a world champion in the board game Go, an achievement that, according to experts, came decades ahead of its time. As Go is even more complex than chess (see page 32), creating an engine that plays on the level of strong human players is even more difficult. An evaluation function is hard to build because the many possible moves on each turn make it harder to use brute-force calculation, the type that looks at every possible move in the tree of possibilities. For humans, Go is a rather intuitive game. Computers can do a lot, but they lack intuition, right? DeepMind approached this challenge differently from existing Go-playing programs (and AlphaGo quickly defeated those programs before taking on humans). AlphaGo utilized deep neural networks, a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. Like the brain, it uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure. The mathematical relationships between those layers are constantly updated during data training. In this case, AlphaGo was trained on a large dataset of expert Go games, enabling it to learn from human knowledge and patterns. Another aspect involved reinforcement learning: AlphaGo played numerous games against different versions of itself, thus gathering data and refining its strategies over time. (Neural networks are very versatile, and by training them they can learn to perform many different tasks, such as recognizing cats and dogs by looking at thousands of labeled examples.) Yet another innovative technique was the use of a value network (reducing the depth of the tree search) and a policy network (reducing the breadth of the search) to efficiently evaluate positions and make decisions based on what it had learned previously. It also ran on powerful hardware infrastructure, including multiple high-performance GPUs, to process all possible moves and positions quickly. One factor behind AlphaGo’s success wasn’t new: the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic search algorithm that simulates random sequences of moves that are part of the search tree. As it goes with artificial intelligence, at some point, the moment comes when the best humans need to be challenged and defeated. Go experienced its Kasparov–Deep Blue moment in May 2016, when a five-game match was played in Seoul, South Korea, between AlphaGo and the South Korean top Go player Lee Sedol, one of the few on the planet who had reached the highest level there is, 9 dan. Before the match, Sedol had shown confidence, expressing that he expected to win without losing a single game. It went quite differently: he lost the first three games, then won one, but also lost the last game to go down 1–4. Three and a half years later, Lee announced his retirement from playing Go: “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated.” Apart from crushing a world-class player, which was a complete sensation, the style in which AlphaGo played was highly remarkable—to the extent that several books were subsequently written on the topic (something that would happen with AlphaZero too). In particular, AlphaGo’s 37th move in the second match game went down in history as truly special. “It was a move so unthinkable that some of the world’s top Go players who were live commentating thought there must have been some sort of mistake, and yet more than a hundred moves later, this stone turned out to be in the perfect strategic place to decide the outcome of the game,” wrote Hassabis. After their resounding success at Go, the next step for the DeepMind researchers was to work on the notion of generality: they wanted to create a single system that was able to perform well in any type of two-player, perfect information game. DeepMind’s December 2017 draft research paper demonstrated that their latest algorithm AlphaZero could reach a superhuman level without receiving human knowledge but just by playing against itself in three different board games: chess, shogi (Japanese chess), and Go. Like with AlphaGo two years earlier, AlphaZero’s chess style was applauded. It played aggressively, sacrificing pieces and pawns to enter super-complicated positions, demonstrating the style of former world champions such as Mikhail Tal or Garry Kasparov. The latter wrote: “I was quite happy to see AlphaZero’s dynamic sacrificial style. Not only because it mirrored my own, but because it could play like this and win against a fearsomely accurate elite program.” Interestingly, AlphaZero searched roughly 80,000 positions per second, a far cry from the 200 million positions per second that Deep Blue was capable of in 1997. AlphaZero’s search, therefore, had to be more efficient. How exactly AlphaZero was “thinking” was something even the people at DeepMind found hard to explain. The program did have an evaluation function, but not based on human input, only on “personal” chess experience. How it valued aspects of chess positions “remains a bit of a mystery,” said one of the developers. Another one described it as “developing something akin to ‘intuition.’ ” What is clear, though, is that the general approach to chess computers has come full circle. Turing and Shannon knew that the computers of their time could not be successful with a brute-force, look-at-all-moves-all-the-time approach, so they suggested selective (“Type B”) search that focuses on the most relevant moves. They couldn’t know how quickly computers would grow faster. For them, it was impossible to predict that brute-force calculation would remain a successful approach for so long, used in all the major chess computers, including Ken Thompson’s Belle, IBM’s Deep Blue, and other programs that followed. And now, although it does run on highly sophisticated hardware, AlphaZero looks for its moves in a way that is smarter than ever before, in a way Turing and Shannon had in mind. There is another parallel with those early days of AI. Turing and Shannon were the first to admit that developing a well-playing chess program was not a goal but a means to solve problems of “greater significance.” It is precisely this approach that we see with Demis Hassabis and his colleagues at DeepMind, who, step by step, move from game-specific algorithms based on imitation learning to general, fully self-supervised learning systems. AlphaGo learned to play Go by looking at human games, and then AlphaGo Zero learned by just playing against itself. AlphaZero became more generic as it taught itself to play, only by playing against itself, multiple board games. The next step was MuZero, a computer program DeepMind launched in 2019 that can learn games without knowing the rules. Apart from managing to (once again) become super-strong in chess, shogi, and Go, MuZero also taught itself 57 Atari games from scratch. Another step followed in late 2022 when DeepNash was launched. DeepMind’s latest AI agent could play Stratego at a human expert level, winning nearly all the matches it played against other AIs and scoring an 84 percent overall win rate when competing against human players in online games. What was new this time was that AI was doing well in a game with imperfect information: in Stratego, the players are hiding which pieces are placed where. DeepMind have applied their experience with board and computer games, and their increasingly abstract, self-supervised learning systems, in many different areas of society. For instance, ideas similar to AlphaZero have been used to control the cooling systems in Google’s enormous data centers, saving a lot of energy. The best example, in terms of helping to solve problems of “greater significance,” however, is AlphaFold, DeepMind’s AI program, which performs predictions of 3D protein structures. Described by Hassabis as “Fermat’s Last Theorem applied to biology,” the computational algorithm analyzes the amino-acid sequence of a protein. It uses a deep-learning neural network to predict how that sequence folds into a 3D shape. As a result, AlphaFold has pro-vided biologists with invaluable insights into the functions and interactions of proteins, which is beneficial to the discovery and development of new drugs, can assist in things like pandemic preparedness, and helps in understanding how the human body works. While Hassabis feels that AlphaFold is the most complex and meaningful system DeepMind has built, his ambition is unlimited. He says he is thinking about some of the biggest challenges in science today, such as a room-temperature superconductor, virtual cells, and quantum simulation. DeepMind’s ultimate goal? To create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that learns to perform any intellectual task humans can. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT was the first to reach global fame, major companies like Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are all developing their own large-language models that are seen as a big step toward AGI. DeepMind’s AI system, called “Gemini,” was first released in December 2023. It uses techniques from AlphaGo. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman, recorded in July 2022, Hassabis told the story of his last meeting with Stephen Hawking not long before the theoretical physicist passed away. Hawking was interested in DeepMind’s work, and the two spoke for hours. Hawking said goodbye to Hassabis with the words: “I wish you the best of luck, but not too much.” Fruit Fly We have seen that chess has played a key role in developing AI research from its infancy to the present day. From Turing to Hassabis, important researchers used the game of chess as a stepping stone toward more important areas—but, it should be noted, sometimes in the face of opposition. If a professor and their team of students are using their valuable time and resources to create a machine that can play chess, you can imagine there will be people thinking: “Are these guys just having fun?” AI’s “founding father,” John McCarthy, addressed this issue during a presentation he delivered in 1989 to the Conference of the Canadian Information Processing Society in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He noted that the famous comparison (also mentioned in Chapter 3) between chess and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), often attributed to McCarthy himself, is not his but was first made by the Soviet mathematician and computer scientist Aleksandr Kronrod. In the 1950s and 1960s, Kronrod was the director of the mathematics division at the Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Kronrod was interested in artificial intelligence and indirectly involved in his laboratory’s chess research. McCarthy suggested that Kronrod might have used the comparison between chess and the fruit fly “as a defense against physicists when they complained that he used so much of their precious computer time in a mere chess match.” Alas, the defense didn’t hold up for long, and in 1968 Kronrod lost his directorship as higher functionaries were indeed skeptical of the research group’s focus on chess and other games. Kronrod’s analogy was prophetic, as chess would become highly important for developing the AI research area, similar to the fruit fly dominating the history of genetic sciences. Both chess and the fruit fly formed an experimental platform that provided a consistent and controlled environment for investigating different hypotheses. The analogy didn’t hold up for long either. From that similar starting point, chess and the fruit fly went different ways in their respective fields. Whereas Drosophila research “matured” over the decades—starting from chromosome mapping, then expanding with the investigation of new wild varieties of flies, to eventually become an important area for the study of patterns of inheritance and population genetics—chess research remained a somewhat limited field of AI. Because brute-force techniques (Shannon’s Type-A thinking) kept being so successful, there was no need for research into Type-B thinking, which would have developed AI more broadly at an earlier stage. McCarthy was a good sport after losing his bet to David Levy in 1978. When he sent his check, he wrote in his letter that he wasn’t too unhappy about losing the bet. He had hoped that Levy would lose to an intelligent program, but the progress made so far was mostly in computer programs relying on the brute-force calculation approach. After Kasparov’s loss to Deep Blue, McCarthy wrote in an article in Science in the same year: “Computer chess has developed much as genetics might have if the geneticists had concentrated their efforts starting in 1910 on breeding racing drosophila. We would have some science, but mainly we would have very fast fruit flies.” Nathan Ensmenger, an associate professor at Indiana University, Bloomington, wrote a paper in 2012 where he pointed out: “Unlike Drosophila, however, and despite its apparent productivity as an experimental technology, computer chess ultimately produced little in terms of fundamental theoretical insights.” That was three years before AlphaGo arrived; five before AlphaZero. I spoke to Ensmenger for this book, and he agreed that the latest developments in computer chess are fundamentally different and have resulted in much more useful ideas (some of which will be discussed in this chapter). If McCarthy were still alive, he would probably have changed his mind too. Chess and Neural Networks Seven years after AlphaZero arrived on the scene, the chess world is heavily influenced by this new type of chess computer based on neural networks and reinforcement learning. While DeepMind did not develop AlphaZero further, the open-source community, spearheaded by programmer Gary Linscott, continued to work on its own neural network-based engine, Leela Chess Zero (Lc0)—announced in January 2018, just one month after DeepMind had published its first preprint paper on AlphaZero. AlphaZero was never made available to the public, but Lc0 quickly became an invaluable tool for professional players. Well, the ones who knew about it. Peter Heine Nielsen told me about his early experience with Leela that year, admitting he was late to the party. He’d checked it out a few months before Magnus Carlsen’s world championship match against Fabiano Caruana, which took place in November 2018 in London. He was not impressed. “I thought it was too weird. It wasn’t developed enough yet and seemed quite weak tactically,” said Nielsen. “Caruana was using it, but we were not. That was probably a mistake but not a real disaster.” A few months into 2019, Nielsen could appreciate Leela’s uniqueness: “Its understanding of chess is just amazing. In early 2019 it was my impression that some of us were using it—for example, Anish Giri—and some of us were not. Those who were not using it were getting completely trashed in the opening.” Giri’s second, Erwin l’Ami, said, “Leela somehow understands chess as we do. By playing these millions of games against itself, it knows what space is, what a ‘bad bishop’ is. It can evaluate a position properly in a fraction of a second.” To be among the early adopters of Leela was like having inside information on the stock market. Nielsen: “For half a year, nobody would talk about this until it became clear that everybody knew about it.” The edge given to players who used both Leela and Stockfish probably deserves some explanation. Say you had two top players, Carlsen and Giri, who had to play each other the next day in a big tournament. Both were using the latest version of Stockfish, but only Carlsen’s team was running Leela simultaneously. This meant that team Carlsen knew exactly what Giri’s team were looking at (accessing the same Stockfish analysis), as well as having the extra information from Leela. Each time Leela’s evaluation would be more accurate than Stockfish’s, Carlsen would have a big edge in the analysis because Leela knew Giri’s weak spots and how to tackle them. Stockfish and Leela together form a strong tandem for analysts, with Stockfish being super-strong in pure calculation and Leela coming up with “human” ideas regarding long-term positional play. The Stockfish developers were paying close attention. In the summer of 2020 they announced that they would incorporate an efficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) into a new version of their program. Stockfish 12, or Stockfish NNUE, was released in September 2020 and combined the brute-force computing approach of the traditional Stockfish with the advanced evaluation capabilities of neural network chess engines such as AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero. The evaluation function of the traditional Stockfish was stripped out and replaced with a neural network evaluation function. The result was spectacular: according to the developers, Stockfish 12 was a whopping 100 Elo points stronger than Stockfish 11. At the time of writing, Stockfish has won the last nine seasons of the Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC) main league event and dominated most of the Computer Chess Championships on Chess.com. As of June 2024, Stockfish tops the Computer Chess Rating List (CCRL) with a stratospheric 3641 rating. What does it mean for a human to analyze chess with a computer that strong? Are these engines now finally telling the absolute truth about chess positions? Nielsen thinks so: “We have said that before in the past, and we were wrong. But now I think we are right. If you had asked me in 2017, I would have said that technology is near-perfect. I mean, Stockfish was already incredibly strong. But then it got completely crushed by AlphaZero. I cannot imagine today’s Stockfish getting crushed that way.” Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad still isn’t certain his engine has plateaued: “That’s a very good question, and I’m not confident about my reply because I keep getting surprised. When I started, I thought the chess engines were playing very close to perfectly, but much later, around the Stockfish 8 times, I thought, ‘Surely you couldn’t make something much better?’ so it had to be close to perfect now. But I keep getting surprised. There never seems to be a ceiling.” The English grandmaster Matthew Sadler, co-author of several books about neural network chess engines, has a hard time believing that we’ll see another huge jump in strength due to new technology. “It’s hard to imagine,” he told me. “But that’s what we said about the classic Stockfish as well, some years back. But it is hard to think that there is much more space in chess to find something absolutely amazing.” Asked if he feels that the modern engines understand the game of chess, Sadler replied negatively: “They don’t understand any-thing; they don’t even know they’re playing chess, really. Still, it feels that way. Their pieces are going on great squares. The thing about neural nets is that they maximize mobility. They’re never letting themselves get into positions where their mobility is restricted, and [they] take actions from miles ahead to avoid that. When they’re playing, their pieces are glowing with power, somehow.” I agree with Sadler that the chess played by these modern programs is truly something special. For instance, when analyzing chess openings, they suggest the strangest moves as early as move three, as if they are playing chess from another galaxy. It feels like the chess we have played as humans for centuries is being reinvented almost from scratch. I can hardly imagine that I will encounter such an experience again in my lifetime, but you never know. A New Style of Playing Chess Apart from reaping the benefits from analyzing and preparing with them, top chess players have also been influenced in their playing style by neural-network chess computers. As noted before, AlphaZero’s style was quite attractive, and its open-source offspring Lc0 and the new Stockfish have inherited similar traits. They taught human players lessons unknown in the 1,500 years that the game had existed, and modern-day grandmasters are using those lessons in their tournament play. A clear case is Magnus Carlsen himself. In January 2019, the Norwegian star—still the classical world champion then—got hold of the book Game Changer. Few chess players have read as many chess books as Carlsen, and few chess books have directly impacted Carlsen’s play more than this book. The authors, Sadler and Natasha Regan, investigated more than 2,000 previously unpublished AlphaZero games and revealed its revolutionary thinking process. They presented stunning discoveries in areas like opening play, piece mobility, initiative, attacking techniques, and long-term sacrifices. The book’s title was not an exaggeration but prophetic: AlphaZero changed how chess is played at the top level. Carlsen has claimed he became a different player, inspired by the remarkable AlphaZero games. His second, Nielsen, wrote an article for New in Chess magazine where he demonstrated how Carlsen had adopted themes from AlphaZero, such as running up the board with a pawn on the outer edge, sacrificing pawns, and being more flexible with the concept of king safety—a truly inspiring story for any chess fan. As always, new generations are adapting more quickly to new technologies. In chess, the young, rising stars use computers better than older players. This became all the more clear when I interviewed the Bosnian-Dutch grandmaster Ivan Sokolov in the summer of 2022, shortly after he had captained the young Uzbekistan team to victory at the Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India. Born in 1968, Sokolov is a classical player and trainer who gained knowledge from reading books, studying top grandmaster games, and, of course, from his experience as a top player in the 1990s and early 2000s. But working with, for example, the Iranian-French prodigy Alireza Firouzja (born in 2003), opened his eyes regarding computers: What I faced, not only with Alireza but also with some other young players that I worked with, is that, for example, they come up with a proposal that is very unconventional for a known type of position—unconventional based on old knowledge. I would usually say, “If this works, I need to quote my friend Jan Timman, who said, ‘If it works, I need to learn chess again!’ ” But then I would get a comment like, “Yes, but the computer loves it.” Then we would do some analysis, and sometimes it would turn out that the computer was wrong, in the sense that the evaluation only works if computers are playing. For humans, the assessment can be different. Top-level chess has also become more concrete. Where, in the old days, grandmasters would dismiss certain moves because they would “look ugly” or “cannot be right in this type of structure,” young players think more in terms of, “If it works, it works.” Sokolov: You can have two approaches. First, you can have a mindset that you try to evaluate a position based on common knowledge, so pawn structure, space, bishop pair, king safety, potential of pawn breaks, possible trade of pieces—do I get a better ending, do I get a worse ending? Once you are done with all these elements, you calculate to try to find the best move and justify your judgment. But, of course, it can also go vice versa: that you calculate, and based on the variations that you calculate, you try to come up with an assessment of the position. I belong to the first school of thought, and I still believe this way is more justified, and it makes it easier for you in practical play to handle the position. But the direct element has become much more important than it ever was, and for this, we can thank computers. My understanding of this is that in the classical method a player judges a position based on their pattern recognition and intuition, and then tries to back up their evaluation by calculation. In the modern method, calculation comes first and dictates judgement, which allows for a more liberal, flexible way of looking at chess, without prejudice toward what has been common belief about how the game should be played. Matthew Sadler also feels strongly that modern chess engines are great teachers and are making the new generation of players stronger than ever before. In our conversation, he boldly stated that humans can break the 3000 Elo rating barrier, a gap of more than a hundred points with Carlsen’s peak rating. Sadler’s reasoning? All previous generations have been educated with books written by humans, and he has realized that most of those aren’t that good. “Take me, a 50-year-old grandmaster,” he explained. “I’ve been brought up with pretty crappy material. There were lots of books that were just wrong, where they said, ‘This is the theme in the position,’ but it wasn’t. Modern engines are showing that a lot of the time, the emphasis is all wrong. What you see is said to be the main theme, but it’s not. There’s some extra inner logic that’s important. If you train youngsters on really good material from the beginning and get their evaluation function really strong, you can certainly add another hundred Elo points to the current players’ level.” Where Hassabis hopes to have AI eventually explain us humans and the universe, Sadler sees AI helping humans to reach a higher understanding of their beloved game. Once again, chess is at the beginning of the next stages of AI development. Do We Need to Worry? In the November 1964 edition of USSR, a monthly illustrated magazine, the Latvian grandmaster Mikhail Tal, arguably the most “artistic” of all the world chess champions, spoke about the possibility of a “chess robot.” Tal wasn’t very optimistic: “I don’t think chess players need one. Chess would soon die if a robot turned up that could play better than anybody else, could play so well, in fact, as to be theoretically incapable of making a mistake. Poetry would die if a machine should suddenly appear that wrote better verses than humans. Chess not only implies creativity but performance too, and the most skillful performance would lose all meaning in such an event.” Tal’s remarks are similar to a quote I came across in January 2023, when the Bad Seeds frontman Nick Cave responded to a fan who had sent him a song that ChatGPT had generated “in the style of Nick Cave.” I can understand his reaction: The apocalypse is well on its way. What ChatGPT is, in this instance, is replication as travesty. It could perhaps in time create a song that is, on the surface, indistinguishable from an original, but it will always be a replication, a kind of burlesque.… Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don’t feel. Data doesn’t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn’t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. We cannot deny that there are also downsides to artificial intelligence’s effects on chess. The most obvious one will be discussed in the next chapter: computers have made it much easier to cheat. But even the legitimate use of chess engines has indirectly led to a negative development at the top level. The 2021 world championship match in Dubai between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi was Carlsen’s last world championship. On the podcast The Magnus Effect, on July 19, 2022, he had shocked the chess world by stating that he would no longer defend his world title. The main reason was that he wasn’t happy with the format any more. Due to the intense computer preparation with the top engines, his opponents could maintain a high level just by memory for 15 to 20 moves. With a lot of thinking time on the clock, they were becoming hard to beat in the remainder of the game. Carlsen felt that classical chess, with games that last several hours, was not the best way to determine the best player any more. At the same time, just as our society will need to adapt to even smarter versions of ChatGPT and the possible emergence of AGI, chess players and organizers will need to adapt to the new reality these super-strong chess engines bring to the table nowadays. Chess grandmasters have started playing many different openings with both colors, so that the surprise effect can nullify some of their opponent’s preparation. Amateurs like myself, who are also increasingly relying on engine-based preparation, are starting to do the same, and we might become better players because of it. Overall, I think most of what artificial intelligence has brought has been positive for chess. If we look at what’s happening with generative AI in the world of music or art, or the impact ChatGPT is having on society in general, it seems that chess stands out favorably compared to those other areas. In the chess world, we have learned to adapt to how AI has developed in our field, and, if we treat it well, the benefit from AI will outweigh any fear. More than a quarter of a century since man lost the battle to the machine, humans still play and enjoy chess games—even those played between computers. AI did not make chess irrelevant. On the contrary, chess still entertains and teaches us. The human aspect is still fully alive, and AI does not stop us from enjoying chess but helps us to appreciate it more—and so, in a way, it helps us in what it means to be human.",

They are extremely tougher, tactically more adept, and understand more positions, thanks to computers but also in general terms.” —Erwin l’Ami, grandmaster, 2023 One afternoon in the spring of 2000, the Dutch grandmaster Paul van der Sterren’s phone rang. On the other end of the line was Sytze Faber, a member of the board of the Dutch Chess Federation. Shortly before the call, Van der Sterren had received his official invitation to the upcoming Dutch championship, which would take place in May of that year and, for the fourth time in a row, in Rotterdam. But this time, everything would be different. Faber notified him of a remarkable plan: he wanted to have a computer participate in the tournament. “I still remember exactly where I was standing in my living room when I got that phone call,” Van der Sterren told me during a conversation for this book. “He informed me about this plan, and I felt the floor below me crumbling away. ‘What the hell is this? This cannot be true,’ I thought. But soon, I realized he was serious.” Van der Sterren protested, but Faber had already decided: “Sorry, Paul, but it’s going to happen.” Although Deep Blue retired after the 1997 match, programmers of other chess engines, running on ordinary machines instead of $10 million supercomputers, still tried their luck for a few more years against human opponents. Or was it the humans who were trying their luck? As long as they could still put up a fight, man versus machine chess remained exciting and provided opportunities for publicity. At least, that was what Faber must have thought when he arranged for one of the 12 participants of the Dutch championship to be a special edition of ChessBase’s program Fritz, called Fritz SSS*. It was the first and only time in the long history of chess that a computer had participated in an official national championship. The whole situation was highly controversial, if not bizarre, and was covered in international chess magazines. Two local journalists gave the same verdict independently of one another in their newspaper columns: “out of their minds” and “everyone has gone mad.” But it all went according to Faber’s plan. Except for Van der Sterren, the participants were persuaded to participate and play the computer in one of the rounds thanks to a sizeable increase in the prize fund from 100,000 to 170,000 guilders (equivalent to roughly €77,000 or $70,000 today; this was two years before the Netherlands adopted the euro). The money came from multiple sponsors, many related to the computer world, while ChessBase had somehow managed to set up an excellent deal as it only had to pay 12,000 guilders ($5,500). Meanwhile, several angry chess fans set up a website under the name Chess Protest, where the name of the computer program was changed to “Fritz $$$” and which received many statements of support against Fritz’s participation. Wasn’t a Dutch championship supposed to determine who was the country’s best human player? Van der Sterren said, “I found it absolutely unethical to have a computer playing in a human championship, which would then be a disrupting factor. It just wasn’t fair, a kind of distortion of competition. I wanted to keep the tournament pure.” Paul van der Sterren in action during the 1986 Dutch Championship. The organizers had decided that if one player didn’t want to play against Fritz, they would receive zero points for that game and not share in the 70 percent extra prize money. If two players didn’t want to play, the whole thing would be put off, and Fritz wouldn’t participate. Besides Van der Sterren, two other players expressed unhappiness about the situation but played anyway. One participant, international master Manuel Bosboom, did sit down at the board against Fritz but resigned after four moves. It was not that he wanted to make his point without losing his money; he realized that if he didn’t play either, none of the participants would earn the extra money. Van der Sterren, who lived in Amsterdam, didn’t even bother to make the trip to Rotterdam. His clock was started, and, after an hour, his game was declared a win for Fritz (following regulations) without a single move being played. Van der Sterren was praised by chess journalists and received many messages of support from all over the country. Several media requested interviews, including the popular talk show Barend en Van Dorp, but Van der Sterren refused. He didn’t want to join the hype and give the sponsors their desired publicity. Fritz SSS* beat four players (besides Van der Sterren), drew with four others, and lost two games. Many Dutch Chess Federation officials were unhappy with the situation and, after the tournament ended, they decided that this computer stunt was a case of “once but never again.” Within a few weeks, Van der Sterren noticed financial compensation of a few thousand guilders in his bank account. End of an Era: The Last Man vs. Machine Matches Humans played against computers for only a few more years. Vladimir Kramnik, the Russian player who dethroned Kasparov in 2000 to become the 14th World Chess Champion, tied a match with Deep Fritz 7 in Bahrain in 2002. Kasparov tied two matches against the programs X3D Fritz and Deep Junior in 2003. Three years later, the writing was on the wall when Kramnik lost a match to Deep Fritz 4–2, one that went down in history after witnessing the biggest blunder ever committed by a reigning world champion. Kramnik allowed a checkmate in one move in game two; an incredible oversight (see annotated game on pages 395–96). Soon afterward, ChessBase started advertising their latest program, Fritz 10, with the tagline: “Ask Kramnik how it feels!” As if Kramnik’s loss wasn’t enough, humanity had suffered another, even bigger loss a year earlier. Playing from the Wembley Conference Center in London, the top English grandmaster Michael Adams didn’t stand a chance against a computer called Hydra, backed by Abu Dhabi money. It ran on a 64-way cluster computer: basically, 64 computers connected and operating like a single machine. Hydra was a true monster, aptly named after the multiheaded serpent-like creature from Greek mythology. It won the match with a devastating 5½–½ score. Adams had barely scraped a single draw and lost five games. Looking back at the history of man versus machine matches, I feel Adams–Hydra signaled the moment when computers truly conquered mankind. In those years, the top engines Fritz, Junior, and Shredder were probably already stronger than Deep Blue, but with the appearance of Hydra, all doubt disappeared. At the time, the English grandmaster David Norwood reached the same conclusion: “Last week saw the end of humanity. When Deep Blue beat Kasparov eight years ago, there was still a great deal of doubt. If a top human grandmaster focused on the weaknesses of their artificial opponents, they could still win. The Wembley match between Britain’s Michael Adams and Hydra finally buried that notion. The Terminators have won.” Organizing further man versus machine matches became entirely pointless as the years went by. To borrow Kasparov’s comparison, who would want to see Usain Bolt try his luck against a Ferrari? Occasionally, odds matches have been held, where the computer is handicapped in different ways to see what it does to its level and whether a grandmaster would have a chance. Like taking one of the wheels off that Ferrari, the computer would play without one or two pawns, or start without its queen’s rook, while the human played without its queen’s knight. In most cases, the human grandmasters would still struggle against the computer. Where humans had to throw in the towel long ago, computers still compete against computers. Unlike those early tournaments in the 1970s, today’s programs run in the cloud and compete on online servers. The TCEC (Top Chess Engine Championship) is a well-known competition, while Chess.com runs its own Computer Chess Championship. Such computer versus computer games are the highest-level chess you’ll encounter on this planet. Still, most fans can’t be bothered with it, just as they wouldn’t watch two soccer teams with perfect defenses who therefore almost always played out 0–0 draws against each other. They prefer watching humans play other humans. Beauty lies in imperfection. There are, for example, many theoretical endgames where it wouldn’t make sense to watch computers play it out since the result would already be known because of their flawless play. The same endgames played among humans are often still fascinating to watch. “Do they know this position? Do they remember all the details? Can they find the narrow path to the win with just a few minutes left on the clock?” Identifying with that struggle as a viewer while the grandmasters are sweating at the board is what sport is about. Early Computer Preparation These days, Kasparov is much more interested in working with AI instead of against it. Soon after his last match with Deep Blue, he was already wondering: “What if the combination of a human and machine would play chess? Wouldn’t that lead to the highest possible level of play?” Kasparov tried it out in 1998 when he played an unusual match with the top Bulgarian player Veselin Topalov in León, Spain. He called it “Advanced Chess.” During the game, alongside the chess set and clock, both players had a PC available at their table, running on Pentium II 333 MHz processors and using the chess program of their choice. It was the complete opposite of what is allowed in serious tournaments or online chess. Two conclusions were drawn from this match, which ended in a tie. First, the games were far from the perfection the organizers and participants sought, as the time to choose the moves was limited to an hour per player. Also, Kasparov’s superiority in tactical play over Topalov was nullified as the assistance of the computer likely benefited Topalov more. The Advanced Chess experiment was only organized five times. Still, the co-operation between humans and computers has changed chess as a sport dramatically, but in a different way. I am talking about an essential aspect of chess here: preparation for the opening phase. As soon as the computer started beating grandmasters, it became a powerful tool for analyzing games and positions. Amateurs and grandmasters affectionately began to refer to their chess program as “my silicon friend.” An early adopter, Kasparov remained ahead of his peers in computer preparation for years. At one point, he called himself “the best-prepared player in the history of chess.” Even strong opponents sometimes avoided playing their favorite openings against him, fearing a powerful “novelty,” a home-cooked new move that would push them into unexplored territories where only Kasparov knew the way. In 1999 he said, “There is a computer, and you should not ignore that fact but adjust to it. It’s something you must do, whether you like it or not.” This is true indeed, especially nowadays, so in that sense, Kasparov was a pioneer. A famous example of Kasparov’s domination in the opening came in game ten of his world championship match against Viswanathan Anand in 1995 (see annotated game on pages 388–89). On move 14, Kasparov played a stunning theoretical novelty in the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez opening. He sacrificed a pawn, followed by a rook. Although Anand defended admirably, he couldn’t avoid a loss. Afterward, Kasparov revealed that he had analyzed the rook sacrifice extensively with the engine Fritz. It was the first time the computer had helped a player win a chess game at the highest level. But working with the computer might have harmed Kasparov five years later. He lost his world title to Vladimir Kramnik in 2000 after the latter continuously played the infamous Berlin defense against his Ruy Lopez. It is a variation where the queens are traded early; play kind of skips the middlegame and moves straight into the endgame. White game after White game, Kasparov kept trying to tear down his opponent’s “Berlin Wall” but he failed to win this endgame even once. (In world championship matches, players alternate playing as White and Black. The advantage of being White is somewhat similar to being the player to serve in tennis. Following this analogy, Kasparov could only tie his service games.) “Kasparov has never been open about it, but I believe one of the reasons he was so obsessed with this endgame was because the computer was giving him an advantage,” the top Dutch grandmaster Anish Giri told me. In other words, Kasparov put too much faith in the computer’s positive evaluation of the endgame. Giri: “He kept thinking, ‘I must be better.’ And kept digging through that endgame. He kept going for it, and then he would offer a draw very early because he would realize during the game, ‘Okay, I don’t understand why I’m better.’ I think a massive issue was that the computer wrongly said that White is better.” Nowadays, top grandmasters consider the move suggestions made by modern chess programs to be something rather close to the Ultimate Truth. During that Kasparov–Kramnik match, and for a few years afterward, computers were considered helpful tools, but ones that couldn’t be fully trusted yet. It was Kramnik’s turn to end up on the wrong side in his 2004 world championship match when he faced a bright talent of the new generation: the Hungarian Peter Leko. The match was played in Brissago, Switzerland, for a $1.2 million prize fund. After seven games, the score was equal. The day before his fourth turn with the white pieces, Kramnik told his team that he was ready to fight Leko’s Marshall Gambit, another variation in the Ruy Lopez where Black sacrifices a pawn for activity. His team wasn’t fully ready yet, and one of his helpers, the Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler, stayed up all night analyzing with a computer engine. He shared his work with Kramnik the next morning. Eighteen moves into the game, Leko had only 17 minutes left on the clock to reach move 40, meaning he had less than one minute on average for his next 19 moves. Having made prepared moves only, Kramnik had a hundred minutes left for his next 19 moves. But something was wrong. Vladimir Kramnik, left, and Peter Leko, right, during Game 2 of their 2004 world championship match in Brissago, Switzerland. Back in his hotel room, Svidler was following the game on his laptop. The more it progressed, the more worried he became for his boss. “I lay down and, for some reason, couldn’t get to sleep, although we hadn’t slept all night. Something was nagging inside me …” Svidler was quoted in the 2007 book From London to Elista by Ilia Levitov and Evgeny Bareev, and soon it would become clear what it was: a glaring error. A small but crucial part of the analysis that he had provided in the morning contained a big hole. And, now that the game was underway, the only person who could save Kramnik from falling into the ditch was Kramnik himself—but that day, he was too optimistic. For his 19th move, Kramnik made the rational decision to do something … irrational. “I understood that if I wanted to win this game, then a move—no matter how different—needed to be made quickly,” Kramnik said in From London to Elista. He had a choice of more or less forcing the game to end in a draw or playing a dangerous move, and, backed by Svidler’s computer prep, he confidently went for the latter. He explained his decision with gambling terminology: “And I took the decision to play for a win, enlisting the support of the computer. I played va banque, it’s hard to blame anyone here, even myself. I didn’t make a mistake, one could say that I placed ‘everything on zero.’ ” Kramnik went for a risky line that involved the sacrifice of his queen. He would then promote one of his pawns to get a new queen, and Leko’s counterplay would come too late—was the idea. As it turned out, Kramnik put too much faith in the computer. Sitting at the board and using his human brain, Leko refuted his opponent’s computer homework and demonstrated that his counterplay was on time. While Kramnik’s pawn was on its way to becoming a queen, his king was getting checkmated. Leko won in 32 moves (see annotated game on pages 394–95) and took the lead in the match, which he maintained for five more games. The computer accident could have had historic implications. It was only in game 14, the last game of the match, that Kramnik beat Leko in a must-win game, leveling the score to 7–7 and retaining his world title. (It would be the last time a world championship match was played without a tiebreak.) What went wrong exactly? Was Leko a better calculator than the computer? Not really, unless the computer wasn’t given enough time to calculate. Because of the enormous number of positions that had to be checked overnight, Svidler had given the engine perhaps only a minute or two to calculate what turned out to be the critical position in the game—much less than Leko had at his disposal behind the board. It was later discovered that if Svidler had given the computer about 30 seconds more to look at that critical position, the engine would have changed its evaluation in favor of Black, and Kramnik would not have lost the game. Modern Preparation An indication of how strong chess engines have become over the last two decades can be gleaned once you realize that, in 2024, an engine like Stockfish will tell you the correct evaluation of the Kramnik–Leko position in less than a second. Modern-day engines are simply too strong to allow such accidents to occur. As a result, the quality of grandmaster preparation is exceptionally high these days. At the same time, preparation is not as enjoyable as it used to be, at least according to two world-class “preparation experts”: both the Dutch grandmaster Erwin l’Ami (who was part of Veselin Topalov’s team of seconds before and during the 2010 World Chess Championship, and who now works for Anish Giri), and also Peter Heine Nielsen (a second to both Viswanathan Anand, between 2005 and 2013, and Magnus Carlsen, from 2013 till present). “Back in the early 2000s, chess computers would be okay tactically, but positionally there was still much left to be desired,” explained l’Ami. “This meant that the human part of the work was more significant, and analyzing was more interesting. It is less enjoyable these days because your own input is not so important any more. Especially in major openings like the Ruy Lopez or the Catalan, you can hardly make headway.” In the early days, developing new ideas in complicated positions and catching opponents off-guard was still possible. L’Ami once won a game entirely thanks to preparation when he played the Ukrainian grandmaster Vadim Malakhatko in 2003 (see annotated game on pages 393–94). He had devised a new idea, analyzed it with an engine, and memorized it all in his head. Because Malakhatko played exactly as predicted, l’Ami got to play his idea and didn’t need to think at all. The time control was 90 minutes for the whole game and a 30-second “Fischer bonus” per move. At the start of the game, l’Ami’s clock showed 1:30; at the end it was 1:41. He had made so many moves without thinking that he had gained 11 minutes on the clock by the time Malakhatko resigned. Nielsen told me, “Back then, computers were quite weak, so if you used them properly you had a massive advantage over your opponent. You would try to dominate your opponent with preparation, and you could do it successfully.” Strong preparation meant checking the opponent’s games, having more knowledge than them, having more ideas, and finding holes in the opponent’s opening repertoire. “When I play in the Bundesliga [the German chess league] these days,” continued Nielsen, “I feel I no longer have an advantage over weaker players because preparation has become too easy. Twenty years ago, I felt I had a massive advantage simply because the technology was weaker. You could still use it, but you had to use it very intelligently and aggressively, while nowadays it’s almost automatic. The tool has become too good, becoming a big equalizer.” According to Nielsen, chess preparation used to be closer to science, where you could put a human hypothesis to the empirical “computer test.” It was much more of a cooperation between man and machine, similar to Kasparov’s Advanced Chess idea. These days, it’s much more practical; it’s about finding which moves are the most unpleasant for the opponent. “The practical component is always to try to win a chess game. I now fully look at it from a sports perspective,” said Nielsen. The higher levels of opening preparation these days have led to a higher level and perhaps even more interesting type of play, according to grandmaster and chess commentator Maurice Ashley: The players have benefited enormously from what AI has done, showing how to defend better, knowing when you can actually sacrifice a pawn for the initiative. Before, people were just doing it cavalierly. But now you have to really have super-refined judgment around this sort of thing. And now they are even entering worlds that no one would enter before, positions that are almost impossible for humans to play. It’s so chaotic. But people can study it carefully and enter complicated openings. So I think the level of chess is elevated dramatically as a result, and we’re seeing more and more interesting positions, far beyond what we could have seen before. There is one caveat, though. Everyone has access to the same super-strong computer engines, so if you find a remarkable tactical idea, you can be sure your opponent has found the same idea. You must find other areas to make life difficult for your opponent. Two common methods are trying to surprise your opponent or test their memory. Almost all top players play a wide range of openings, so there are always opportunities to play something the opponent doesn’t fully expect. As White, players can play the pawn in front of their queenside bishop, their queen’s pawn, or their king’s pawn, while moving the king’s knight toward the center is another good first move. You just cannot predict any more what they will do. This is entirely different from, for example, the times of Bobby Fischer, who spent almost his entire career only playing his king’s pawn on the first move. Today, players can play a lot more openings and variations than in the old days because the computer has shown them to be playable, as Anish Giri explained to me: “The stronger the engine gets, the more it shows that variations that were considered bad before are no longer bad because the engine is able to defend them. Even what used to be a dubious opening turns out to be playable if you defend accurately and the engine shows how to defend. The King’s Gambit is an extreme example, but it doesn’t lose. Nothing loses.” While playing many different opening systems, players tend to go for long and complicated variations regularly, hoping their opponent doesn’t remember all the details. Both at the top and at amateur level, chess has become a bit of a memory game in the opening phase. There are many examples to be found in top-level chess. In a game Giri played against the US grandmaster Fabiano Caruana at the Superbet Chess Classic, held in May 2023 in Bucharest, Romania, the players agreed to a draw after 26 moves. The opening was the popular Italian Game but became highly complex early on, with Giri having to calculate a queen sacrifice that would eventually lead to a draw by move repetition. The Dutchman spent about an hour and ten minutes calculating (or rather, digging up from his memory) the moves, while Caruana, like l’Ami in the above example, ended the game with more time on his clock than he started with. He had done his homework, and Giri had passed the memory test (see annotated game on page 400). Another reason why players have to memorize so much more than they used to is down to the internet, which we’ll talk about much more in the third part of the book. Because of the enormous increase in online tournaments, players are playing hundreds of games a year more (at faster time controls) than they used to. “I play like 700 games a year now,” said Giri. “In many of those games, I play something that is an opening that I looked at, so relevant things, and my colleagues also did that. So now the database is flooded with games and all sorts of different openings, and you’re not even able to digest all the games.” At my chess club, many young players study chess openings fanatically. Amateur players tend to exaggerate the importance of memory, says Giri: “You have to realize that memory is only relevant between two players of approximately equal strength. If you are an amateur and memorize everything, but you are bad at chess, then you might not be good enough to hold it, and you will lose any final position you managed to recall. But if you have two top players, they’re so good that by the time they reach the final position of their analysis, they might be able to play it out well. So it’s just a memory game among top players, but not elsewhere; you cannot replace top level with memory.” In 2010, when l’Ami and Nielsen were part of the opposing teams in the Anand–Topalov world championship match, the memory aspect played a role from the get-go. A difficult middlegame position came on the board that both teams had looked at before the match, where Topalov sacrificed a pawn in return for an attack on Anand’s king. The Indian, who was defending his title in this match, knew that, at some point, he had to make a king move toward the direction of the center of the board, but he couldn’t remember at which exact moment. He played it one move too early and lost the game instead of drawing it. Anand had failed the memory test, but would end up winning the match (see annotated game on pages 396–97). Because of the tsunami of available information on chess openings, the most recent development is that top players tend to avoid playing variations that require deep memory. “It seems that there isn’t a memory savant in top chess right now,” said Giri. “None of the top players have an insane memory, even for people with the so-called best memory, like Magnus. I can show you countless examples of him misremembering things. So they started changing strategies and you see that players are not all playing the same forcing lines any more. People change strategy.” The Arrival of AlphaZero On December 5, 2017, a watershed moment in the history of computer chess occurred. It was the day Google DeepMind released a preprint paper introducing their chess-playing computer AlphaZero. At that time, the strongest chess engine was Stockfish, an open-source program originally developed by Tord Romstad from Norway and Marco Costalba from Italy. Costalba had come up with the name Stockfish. It refers to the unsalted fish dried on wooden racks in Norway by cold air and wind, which is also exported in large amounts to the Veneto region of northern Italy, where Costalba lives. His explanation: like the fish, the chess engine is an original Norwegian product further developed in Italy. The DeepMind paper revealed that this little fish had experienced a close encounter with a giant chess-playing shark—a hundred-game match between AlphaZero and Stockfish 8—which had not even been close. The shark had beaten—no, obliterated—Stockfish by scoring 28 wins, 72 draws, and not a single loss. AlphaZero was ridiculously strong. The other thing was how it got so strong. Without being fed any knowledge except for the chess rules, AlphaZero had reached a superhuman level in just four hours of playing games against itself. My colleague and friend Mike Klein found a good metaphor in his story for Chess.com at the time: “This would be akin to a robot being given access to thousands of metal bits and parts, but no knowledge of a combustion engine. Then it experiments numerous times with every combination possible until it builds a Ferrari. All that in less [than half the] time than it takes to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The program had four hours to play itself many, many times, thereby becoming its own teacher.” When I spoke to him for this book, Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad added a little nuance: “This four-hour claim is kind of true, but at the same time also kind of ridiculous, because they were using an immense amount of hardware, like thousands of machines training in parallel. If you wanted to do this at home, it would take about 40 years.” Even so, the news about AlphaZero was just mind-blowing, and over the next few weeks the chess world was talking about nothing else. I attended the London Chess Classic as a journalist that first week of December 2017, with Mike, which allowed us to interview a few strong players and get their first reactions to the news. Magnus Carlsen’s assistant Peter Heine Nielsen said: “After reading the paper but especially seeing the games, I thought … well, I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they play chess. I feel now I know.” Garry Kasparov, who had quite a bit of experience with computers himself, already saw broader implications: “We have always assumed that chess required too much empirical knowledge for a machine to play so well from scratch, with no human knowledge added at all. Of course, I’ll be fascinated to see what we can learn about chess from AlphaZero since that is the great promise of machine learning in general—machines figuring out rules that humans cannot detect. But, obviously, the implications are wonderful, far beyond chess and other games. The ability of a machine to replicate and surpass centuries of human knowledge in complex closed systems is a world-changing tool.” Hassabis and DeepMind Google DeepMind’s CEO, Demis Hassabis, was a fanatic chess player in his youth and nothing less than a child prodigy. As a teenager, he used some of his prize money to buy himself his first computer, and soon he was creating his own programs. He cofounded DeepMind in 2010. From the start, DeepMind has focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence, combining it with neuroscientific insights and new computer hardware developments. In his introduction to the 2019 book Game Changer, a fascinating, chess-technical exploration of the style of AlphaZero, Hassabis formulated his company’s ambition: “To build intelligent systems that can learn to solve any complex task by themselves, and then use this technology to help find solutions to some of society’s biggest challenges and unanswered questions.” Hassabis has stated in many interviews that he wants to “solve intelligence” and then use intelligence “to solve everything else.” Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis at the 2018 London Chess Classic. DeepMind’s first notable success came in December 2013 when its learning algorithm Deep Q-Network (DQN) achieved expert-level scores in Atari games by teaching itself using only the raw pixels on the screen as inputs. A year after Google (now Alphabet) purchased DeepMind for a reported £400 million ($650 million) in 2014, Hassabis’s company pulled off something more significant. Their neural network algorithm AlphaGo became the first machine to beat a world champion in the board game Go, an achievement that, according to experts, came decades ahead of its time. As Go is even more complex than chess (see page 32), creating an engine that plays on the level of strong human players is even more difficult. An evaluation function is hard to build because the many possible moves on each turn make it harder to use brute-force calculation, the type that looks at every possible move in the tree of possibilities. For humans, Go is a rather intuitive game. Computers can do a lot, but they lack intuition, right? DeepMind approached this challenge differently from existing Go-playing programs (and AlphaGo quickly defeated those programs before taking on humans). AlphaGo utilized deep neural networks, a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. Like the brain, it uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure. The mathematical relationships between those layers are constantly updated during data training. In this case, AlphaGo was trained on a large dataset of expert Go games, enabling it to learn from human knowledge and patterns. Another aspect involved reinforcement learning: AlphaGo played numerous games against different versions of itself, thus gathering data and refining its strategies over time. (Neural networks are very versatile, and by training them they can learn to perform many different tasks, such as recognizing cats and dogs by looking at thousands of labeled examples.) Yet another innovative technique was the use of a value network (reducing the depth of the tree search) and a policy network (reducing the breadth of the search) to efficiently evaluate positions and make decisions based on what it had learned previously. It also ran on powerful hardware infrastructure, including multiple high-performance GPUs, to process all possible moves and positions quickly. One factor behind AlphaGo’s success wasn’t new: the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic search algorithm that simulates random sequences of moves that are part of the search tree. As it goes with artificial intelligence, at some point, the moment comes when the best humans need to be challenged and defeated. Go experienced its Kasparov–Deep Blue moment in May 2016, when a five-game match was played in Seoul, South Korea, between AlphaGo and the South Korean top Go player Lee Sedol, one of the few on the planet who had reached the highest level there is, 9 dan. Before the match, Sedol had shown confidence, expressing that he expected to win without losing a single game. It went quite differently: he lost the first three games, then won one, but also lost the last game to go down 1–4. Three and a half years later, Lee announced his retirement from playing Go: “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated.” Apart from crushing a world-class player, which was a complete sensation, the style in which AlphaGo played was highly remarkable—to the extent that several books were subsequently written on the topic (something that would happen with AlphaZero too). In particular, AlphaGo’s 37th move in the second match game went down in history as truly special. “It was a move so unthinkable that some of the world’s top Go players who were live commentating thought there must have been some sort of mistake, and yet more than a hundred moves later, this stone turned out to be in the perfect strategic place to decide the outcome of the game,” wrote Hassabis. After their resounding success at Go, the next step for the DeepMind researchers was to work on the notion of generality: they wanted to create a single system that was able to perform well in any type of two-player, perfect information game. DeepMind’s December 2017 draft research paper demonstrated that their latest algorithm AlphaZero could reach a superhuman level without receiving human knowledge but just by playing against itself in three different board games: chess, shogi (Japanese chess), and Go. Like with AlphaGo two years earlier, AlphaZero’s chess style was applauded. It played aggressively, sacrificing pieces and pawns to enter super-complicated positions, demonstrating the style of former world champions such as Mikhail Tal or Garry Kasparov. The latter wrote: “I was quite happy to see AlphaZero’s dynamic sacrificial style. Not only because it mirrored my own, but because it could play like this and win against a fearsomely accurate elite program.” Interestingly, AlphaZero searched roughly 80,000 positions per second, a far cry from the 200 million positions per second that Deep Blue was capable of in 1997. AlphaZero’s search, therefore, had to be more efficient. How exactly AlphaZero was “thinking” was something even the people at DeepMind found hard to explain. The program did have an evaluation function, but not based on human input, only on “personal” chess experience. How it valued aspects of chess positions “remains a bit of a mystery,” said one of the developers. Another one described it as “developing something akin to ‘intuition.’ ” What is clear, though, is that the general approach to chess computers has come full circle. Turing and Shannon knew that the computers of their time could not be successful with a brute-force, look-at-all-moves-all-the-time approach, so they suggested selective (“Type B”) search that focuses on the most relevant moves. They couldn’t know how quickly computers would grow faster. For them, it was impossible to predict that brute-force calculation would remain a successful approach for so long, used in all the major chess computers, including Ken Thompson’s Belle, IBM’s Deep Blue, and other programs that followed. And now, although it does run on highly sophisticated hardware, AlphaZero looks for its moves in a way that is smarter than ever before, in a way Turing and Shannon had in mind. There is another parallel with those early days of AI. Turing and Shannon were the first to admit that developing a well-playing chess program was not a goal but a means to solve problems of “greater significance.” It is precisely this approach that we see with Demis Hassabis and his colleagues at DeepMind, who, step by step, move from game-specific algorithms based on imitation learning to general, fully self-supervised learning systems. AlphaGo learned to play Go by looking at human games, and then AlphaGo Zero learned by just playing against itself. AlphaZero became more generic as it taught itself to play, only by playing against itself, multiple board games. The next step was MuZero, a computer program DeepMind launched in 2019 that can learn games without knowing the rules. Apart from managing to (once again) become super-strong in chess, shogi, and Go, MuZero also taught itself 57 Atari games from scratch. Another step followed in late 2022 when DeepNash was launched. DeepMind’s latest AI agent could play Stratego at a human expert level, winning nearly all the matches it played against other AIs and scoring an 84 percent overall win rate when competing against human players in online games. What was new this time was that AI was doing well in a game with imperfect information: in Stratego, the players are hiding which pieces are placed where. DeepMind have applied their experience with board and computer games, and their increasingly abstract, self-supervised learning systems, in many different areas of society. For instance, ideas similar to AlphaZero have been used to control the cooling systems in Google’s enormous data centers, saving a lot of energy. The best example, in terms of helping to solve problems of “greater significance,” however, is AlphaFold, DeepMind’s AI program, which performs predictions of 3D protein structures. Described by Hassabis as “Fermat’s Last Theorem applied to biology,” the computational algorithm analyzes the amino-acid sequence of a protein. It uses a deep-learning neural network to predict how that sequence folds into a 3D shape. As a result, AlphaFold has pro-vided biologists with invaluable insights into the functions and interactions of proteins, which is beneficial to the discovery and development of new drugs, can assist in things like pandemic preparedness, and helps in understanding how the human body works. While Hassabis feels that AlphaFold is the most complex and meaningful system DeepMind has built, his ambition is unlimited. He says he is thinking about some of the biggest challenges in science today, such as a room-temperature superconductor, virtual cells, and quantum simulation. DeepMind’s ultimate goal? To create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that learns to perform any intellectual task humans can. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT was the first to reach global fame, major companies like Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are all developing their own large-language models that are seen as a big step toward AGI. DeepMind’s AI system, called “Gemini,” was first released in December 2023. It uses techniques from AlphaGo. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman, recorded in July 2022, Hassabis told the story of his last meeting with Stephen Hawking not long before the theoretical physicist passed away. Hawking was interested in DeepMind’s work, and the two spoke for hours. Hawking said goodbye to Hassabis with the words: “I wish you the best of luck, but not too much.” Fruit Fly We have seen that chess has played a key role in developing AI research from its infancy to the present day. From Turing to Hassabis, important researchers used the game of chess as a stepping stone toward more important areas—but, it should be noted, sometimes in the face of opposition. If a professor and their team of students are using their valuable time and resources to create a machine that can play chess, you can imagine there will be people thinking: “Are these guys just having fun?” AI’s “founding father,” John McCarthy, addressed this issue during a presentation he delivered in 1989 to the Conference of the Canadian Information Processing Society in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He noted that the famous comparison (also mentioned in Chapter 3) between chess and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), often attributed to McCarthy himself, is not his but was first made by the Soviet mathematician and computer scientist Aleksandr Kronrod. In the 1950s and 1960s, Kronrod was the director of the mathematics division at the Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Kronrod was interested in artificial intelligence and indirectly involved in his laboratory’s chess research. McCarthy suggested that Kronrod might have used the comparison between chess and the fruit fly “as a defense against physicists when they complained that he used so much of their precious computer time in a mere chess match.” Alas, the defense didn’t hold up for long, and in 1968 Kronrod lost his directorship as higher functionaries were indeed skeptical of the research group’s focus on chess and other games. Kronrod’s analogy was prophetic, as chess would become highly important for developing the AI research area, similar to the fruit fly dominating the history of genetic sciences. Both chess and the fruit fly formed an experimental platform that provided a consistent and controlled environment for investigating different hypotheses. The analogy didn’t hold up for long either. From that similar starting point, chess and the fruit fly went different ways in their respective fields. Whereas Drosophila research “matured” over the decades—starting from chromosome mapping, then expanding with the investigation of new wild varieties of flies, to eventually become an important area for the study of patterns of inheritance and population genetics—chess research remained a somewhat limited field of AI. Because brute-force techniques (Shannon’s Type-A thinking) kept being so successful, there was no need for research into Type-B thinking, which would have developed AI more broadly at an earlier stage. McCarthy was a good sport after losing his bet to David Levy in 1978. When he sent his check, he wrote in his letter that he wasn’t too unhappy about losing the bet. He had hoped that Levy would lose to an intelligent program, but the progress made so far was mostly in computer programs relying on the brute-force calculation approach. After Kasparov’s loss to Deep Blue, McCarthy wrote in an article in Science in the same year: “Computer chess has developed much as genetics might have if the geneticists had concentrated their efforts starting in 1910 on breeding racing drosophila. We would have some science, but mainly we would have very fast fruit flies.” Nathan Ensmenger, an associate professor at Indiana University, Bloomington, wrote a paper in 2012 where he pointed out: “Unlike Drosophila, however, and despite its apparent productivity as an experimental technology, computer chess ultimately produced little in terms of fundamental theoretical insights.” That was three years before AlphaGo arrived; five before AlphaZero. I spoke to Ensmenger for this book, and he agreed that the latest developments in computer chess are fundamentally different and have resulted in much more useful ideas (some of which will be discussed in this chapter). If McCarthy were still alive, he would probably have changed his mind too. Chess and Neural Networks Seven years after AlphaZero arrived on the scene, the chess world is heavily influenced by this new type of chess computer based on neural networks and reinforcement learning. While DeepMind did not develop AlphaZero further, the open-source community, spearheaded by programmer Gary Linscott, continued to work on its own neural network-based engine, Leela Chess Zero (Lc0)—announced in January 2018, just one month after DeepMind had published its first preprint paper on AlphaZero. AlphaZero was never made available to the public, but Lc0 quickly became an invaluable tool for professional players. Well, the ones who knew about it. Peter Heine Nielsen told me about his early experience with Leela that year, admitting he was late to the party. He’d checked it out a few months before Magnus Carlsen’s world championship match against Fabiano Caruana, which took place in November 2018 in London. He was not impressed. “I thought it was too weird. It wasn’t developed enough yet and seemed quite weak tactically,” said Nielsen. “Caruana was using it, but we were not. That was probably a mistake but not a real disaster.” A few months into 2019, Nielsen could appreciate Leela’s uniqueness: “Its understanding of chess is just amazing. In early 2019 it was my impression that some of us were using it—for example, Anish Giri—and some of us were not. Those who were not using it were getting completely trashed in the opening.” Giri’s second, Erwin l’Ami, said, “Leela somehow understands chess as we do. By playing these millions of games against itself, it knows what space is, what a ‘bad bishop’ is. It can evaluate a position properly in a fraction of a second.” To be among the early adopters of Leela was like having inside information on the stock market. Nielsen: “For half a year, nobody would talk about this until it became clear that everybody knew about it.” The edge given to players who used both Leela and Stockfish probably deserves some explanation. Say you had two top players, Carlsen and Giri, who had to play each other the next day in a big tournament. Both were using the latest version of Stockfish, but only Carlsen’s team was running Leela simultaneously. This meant that team Carlsen knew exactly what Giri’s team were looking at (accessing the same Stockfish analysis), as well as having the extra information from Leela. Each time Leela’s evaluation would be more accurate than Stockfish’s, Carlsen would have a big edge in the analysis because Leela knew Giri’s weak spots and how to tackle them. Stockfish and Leela together form a strong tandem for analysts, with Stockfish being super-strong in pure calculation and Leela coming up with “human” ideas regarding long-term positional play. The Stockfish developers were paying close attention. In the summer of 2020 they announced that they would incorporate an efficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) into a new version of their program. Stockfish 12, or Stockfish NNUE, was released in September 2020 and combined the brute-force computing approach of the traditional Stockfish with the advanced evaluation capabilities of neural network chess engines such as AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero. The evaluation function of the traditional Stockfish was stripped out and replaced with a neural network evaluation function. The result was spectacular: according to the developers, Stockfish 12 was a whopping 100 Elo points stronger than Stockfish 11. At the time of writing, Stockfish has won the last nine seasons of the Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC) main league event and dominated most of the Computer Chess Championships on Chess.com. As of June 2024, Stockfish tops the Computer Chess Rating List (CCRL) with a stratospheric 3641 rating. What does it mean for a human to analyze chess with a computer that strong? Are these engines now finally telling the absolute truth about chess positions? Nielsen thinks so: “We have said that before in the past, and we were wrong. But now I think we are right. If you had asked me in 2017, I would have said that technology is near-perfect. I mean, Stockfish was already incredibly strong. But then it got completely crushed by AlphaZero. I cannot imagine today’s Stockfish getting crushed that way.” Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad still isn’t certain his engine has plateaued: “That’s a very good question, and I’m not confident about my reply because I keep getting surprised. When I started, I thought the chess engines were playing very close to perfectly, but much later, around the Stockfish 8 times, I thought, ‘Surely you couldn’t make something much better?’ so it had to be close to perfect now. But I keep getting surprised. There never seems to be a ceiling.” The English grandmaster Matthew Sadler, co-author of several books about neural network chess engines, has a hard time believing that we’ll see another huge jump in strength due to new technology. “It’s hard to imagine,” he told me. “But that’s what we said about the classic Stockfish as well, some years back. But it is hard to think that there is much more space in chess to find something absolutely amazing.” Asked if he feels that the modern engines understand the game of chess, Sadler replied negatively: “They don’t understand any-thing; they don’t even know they’re playing chess, really. Still, it feels that way. Their pieces are going on great squares. The thing about neural nets is that they maximize mobility. They’re never letting themselves get into positions where their mobility is restricted, and [they] take actions from miles ahead to avoid that. When they’re playing, their pieces are glowing with power, somehow.” I agree with Sadler that the chess played by these modern programs is truly something special. For instance, when analyzing chess openings, they suggest the strangest moves as early as move three, as if they are playing chess from another galaxy. It feels like the chess we have played as humans for centuries is being reinvented almost from scratch. I can hardly imagine that I will encounter such an experience again in my lifetime, but you never know. A New Style of Playing Chess Apart from reaping the benefits from analyzing and preparing with them, top chess players have also been influenced in their playing style by neural-network chess computers. As noted before, AlphaZero’s style was quite attractive, and its open-source offspring Lc0 and the new Stockfish have inherited similar traits. They taught human players lessons unknown in the 1,500 years that the game had existed, and modern-day grandmasters are using those lessons in their tournament play. A clear case is Magnus Carlsen himself. In January 2019, the Norwegian star—still the classical world champion then—got hold of the book Game Changer. Few chess players have read as many chess books as Carlsen, and few chess books have directly impacted Carlsen’s play more than this book. The authors, Sadler and Natasha Regan, investigated more than 2,000 previously unpublished AlphaZero games and revealed its revolutionary thinking process. They presented stunning discoveries in areas like opening play, piece mobility, initiative, attacking techniques, and long-term sacrifices. The book’s title was not an exaggeration but prophetic: AlphaZero changed how chess is played at the top level. Carlsen has claimed he became a different player, inspired by the remarkable AlphaZero games. His second, Nielsen, wrote an article for New in Chess magazine where he demonstrated how Carlsen had adopted themes from AlphaZero, such as running up the board with a pawn on the outer edge, sacrificing pawns, and being more flexible with the concept of king safety—a truly inspiring story for any chess fan. As always, new generations are adapting more quickly to new technologies. In chess, the young, rising stars use computers better than older players. This became all the more clear when I interviewed the Bosnian-Dutch grandmaster Ivan Sokolov in the summer of 2022, shortly after he had captained the young Uzbekistan team to victory at the Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India. Born in 1968, Sokolov is a classical player and trainer who gained knowledge from reading books, studying top grandmaster games, and, of course, from his experience as a top player in the 1990s and early 2000s. But working with, for example, the Iranian-French prodigy Alireza Firouzja (born in 2003), opened his eyes regarding computers: What I faced, not only with Alireza but also with some other young players that I worked with, is that, for example, they come up with a proposal that is very unconventional for a known type of position—unconventional based on old knowledge. I would usually say, “If this works, I need to quote my friend Jan Timman, who said, ‘If it works, I need to learn chess again!’ ” But then I would get a comment like, “Yes, but the computer loves it.” Then we would do some analysis, and sometimes it would turn out that the computer was wrong, in the sense that the evaluation only works if computers are playing. For humans, the assessment can be different. Top-level chess has also become more concrete. Where, in the old days, grandmasters would dismiss certain moves because they would “look ugly” or “cannot be right in this type of structure,” young players think more in terms of, “If it works, it works.” Sokolov: You can have two approaches. First, you can have a mindset that you try to evaluate a position based on common knowledge, so pawn structure, space, bishop pair, king safety, potential of pawn breaks, possible trade of pieces—do I get a better ending, do I get a worse ending? Once you are done with all these elements, you calculate to try to find the best move and justify your judgment. But, of course, it can also go vice versa: that you calculate, and based on the variations that you calculate, you try to come up with an assessment of the position. I belong to the first school of thought, and I still believe this way is more justified, and it makes it easier for you in practical play to handle the position. But the direct element has become much more important than it ever was, and for this, we can thank computers. My understanding of this is that in the classical method a player judges a position based on their pattern recognition and intuition, and then tries to back up their evaluation by calculation. In the modern method, calculation comes first and dictates judgement, which allows for a more liberal, flexible way of looking at chess, without prejudice toward what has been common belief about how the game should be played. Matthew Sadler also feels strongly that modern chess engines are great teachers and are making the new generation of players stronger than ever before. In our conversation, he boldly stated that humans can break the 3000 Elo rating barrier, a gap of more than a hundred points with Carlsen’s peak rating. Sadler’s reasoning? All previous generations have been educated with books written by humans, and he has realized that most of those aren’t that good. “Take me, a 50-year-old grandmaster,” he explained. “I’ve been brought up with pretty crappy material. There were lots of books that were just wrong, where they said, ‘This is the theme in the position,’ but it wasn’t. Modern engines are showing that a lot of the time, the emphasis is all wrong. What you see is said to be the main theme, but it’s not. There’s some extra inner logic that’s important. If you train youngsters on really good material from the beginning and get their evaluation function really strong, you can certainly add another hundred Elo points to the current players’ level.” Where Hassabis hopes to have AI eventually explain us humans and the universe, Sadler sees AI helping humans to reach a higher understanding of their beloved game. Once again, chess is at the beginning of the next stages of AI development. Do We Need to Worry? In the November 1964 edition of USSR, a monthly illustrated magazine, the Latvian grandmaster Mikhail Tal, arguably the most “artistic” of all the world chess champions, spoke about the possibility of a “chess robot.” Tal wasn’t very optimistic: “I don’t think chess players need one. Chess would soon die if a robot turned up that could play better than anybody else, could play so well, in fact, as to be theoretically incapable of making a mistake. Poetry would die if a machine should suddenly appear that wrote better verses than humans. Chess not only implies creativity but performance too, and the most skillful performance would lose all meaning in such an event.” Tal’s remarks are similar to a quote I came across in January 2023, when the Bad Seeds frontman Nick Cave responded to a fan who had sent him a song that ChatGPT had generated “in the style of Nick Cave.” I can understand his reaction: The apocalypse is well on its way. What ChatGPT is, in this instance, is replication as travesty. It could perhaps in time create a song that is, on the surface, indistinguishable from an original, but it will always be a replication, a kind of burlesque.… Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don’t feel. Data doesn’t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn’t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. We cannot deny that there are also downsides to artificial intelligence’s effects on chess. The most obvious one will be discussed in the next chapter: computers have made it much easier to cheat. But even the legitimate use of chess engines has indirectly led to a negative development at the top level. The 2021 world championship match in Dubai between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi was Carlsen’s last world championship. On the podcast The Magnus Effect, on July 19, 2022, he had shocked the chess world by stating that he would no longer defend his world title. The main reason was that he wasn’t happy with the format any more. Due to the intense computer preparation with the top engines, his opponents could maintain a high level just by memory for 15 to 20 moves. With a lot of thinking time on the clock, they were becoming hard to beat in the remainder of the game. Carlsen felt that classical chess, with games that last several hours, was not the best way to determine the best player any more. At the same time, just as our society will need to adapt to even smarter versions of ChatGPT and the possible emergence of AGI, chess players and organizers will need to adapt to the new reality these super-strong chess engines bring to the table nowadays. Chess grandmasters have started playing many different openings with both colors, so that the surprise effect can nullify some of their opponent’s preparation. Amateurs like myself, who are also increasingly relying on engine-based preparation, are starting to do the same, and we might become better players because of it. Overall, I think most of what artificial intelligence has brought has been positive for chess. If we look at what’s happening with generative AI in the world of music or art, or the impact ChatGPT is having on society in general, it seems that chess stands out favorably compared to those other areas. In the chess world, we have learned to adapt to how AI has developed in our field, and, if we treat it well, the benefit from AI will outweigh any fear. More than a quarter of a century since man lost the battle to the machine, humans still play and enjoy chess games—even those played between computers. AI did not make chess irrelevant. On the contrary, chess still entertains and teaches us. The human aspect is still fully alive, and AI does not stop us from enjoying chess but helps us to appreciate it more—and so, in a way, it helps us in what it means to be human.",

They are extremely tougher, tactically more adept, and understand more positions, thanks to computers but also in general terms.” —Erwin l’Ami, grandmaster, 2023 One afternoon in the spring of 2000, the Dutch grandmaster Paul van der Sterren’s phone rang. On the other end of the line was Sytze Faber, a member of the board of the Dutch Chess Federation. Shortly before the call, Van der Sterren had received his official invitation to the upcoming Dutch championship, which would take place in May of that year and, for the fourth time in a row, in Rotterdam. But this time, everything would be different. Faber notified him of a remarkable plan: he wanted to have a computer participate in the tournament. “I still remember exactly where I was standing in my living room when I got that phone call,” Van der Sterren told me during a conversation for this book. “He informed me about this plan, and I felt the floor below me crumbling away. ‘What the hell is this? This cannot be true,’ I thought. But soon, I realized he was serious.” Van der Sterren protested, but Faber had already decided: “Sorry, Paul, but it’s going to happen.” Although Deep Blue retired after the 1997 match, programmers of other chess engines, running on ordinary machines instead of $10 million supercomputers, still tried their luck for a few more years against human opponents. Or was it the humans who were trying their luck? As long as they could still put up a fight, man versus machine chess remained exciting and provided opportunities for publicity. At least, that was what Faber must have thought when he arranged for one of the 12 participants of the Dutch championship to be a special edition of ChessBase’s program Fritz, called Fritz SSS*. It was the first and only time in the long history of chess that a computer had participated in an official national championship. The whole situation was highly controversial, if not bizarre, and was covered in international chess magazines. Two local journalists gave the same verdict independently of one another in their newspaper columns: “out of their minds” and “everyone has gone mad.” But it all went according to Faber’s plan. Except for Van der Sterren, the participants were persuaded to participate and play the computer in one of the rounds thanks to a sizeable increase in the prize fund from 100,000 to 170,000 guilders (equivalent to roughly €77,000 or $70,000 today; this was two years before the Netherlands adopted the euro). The money came from multiple sponsors, many related to the computer world, while ChessBase had somehow managed to set up an excellent deal as it only had to pay 12,000 guilders ($5,500). Meanwhile, several angry chess fans set up a website under the name Chess Protest, where the name of the computer program was changed to “Fritz $$$” and which received many statements of support against Fritz’s participation. Wasn’t a Dutch championship supposed to determine who was the country’s best human player? Van der Sterren said, “I found it absolutely unethical to have a computer playing in a human championship, which would then be a disrupting factor. It just wasn’t fair, a kind of distortion of competition. I wanted to keep the tournament pure.” Paul van der Sterren in action during the 1986 Dutch Championship. The organizers had decided that if one player didn’t want to play against Fritz, they would receive zero points for that game and not share in the 70 percent extra prize money. If two players didn’t want to play, the whole thing would be put off, and Fritz wouldn’t participate. Besides Van der Sterren, two other players expressed unhappiness about the situation but played anyway. One participant, international master Manuel Bosboom, did sit down at the board against Fritz but resigned after four moves. It was not that he wanted to make his point without losing his money; he realized that if he didn’t play either, none of the participants would earn the extra money. Van der Sterren, who lived in Amsterdam, didn’t even bother to make the trip to Rotterdam. His clock was started, and, after an hour, his game was declared a win for Fritz (following regulations) without a single move being played. Van der Sterren was praised by chess journalists and received many messages of support from all over the country. Several media requested interviews, including the popular talk show Barend en Van Dorp, but Van der Sterren refused. He didn’t want to join the hype and give the sponsors their desired publicity. Fritz SSS* beat four players (besides Van der Sterren), drew with four others, and lost two games. Many Dutch Chess Federation officials were unhappy with the situation and, after the tournament ended, they decided that this computer stunt was a case of “once but never again.” Within a few weeks, Van der Sterren noticed financial compensation of a few thousand guilders in his bank account. End of an Era: The Last Man vs. Machine Matches Humans played against computers for only a few more years. Vladimir Kramnik, the Russian player who dethroned Kasparov in 2000 to become the 14th World Chess Champion, tied a match with Deep Fritz 7 in Bahrain in 2002. Kasparov tied two matches against the programs X3D Fritz and Deep Junior in 2003. Three years later, the writing was on the wall when Kramnik lost a match to Deep Fritz 4–2, one that went down in history after witnessing the biggest blunder ever committed by a reigning world champion. Kramnik allowed a checkmate in one move in game two; an incredible oversight (see annotated game on pages 395–96). Soon afterward, ChessBase started advertising their latest program, Fritz 10, with the tagline: “Ask Kramnik how it feels!” As if Kramnik’s loss wasn’t enough, humanity had suffered another, even bigger loss a year earlier. Playing from the Wembley Conference Center in London, the top English grandmaster Michael Adams didn’t stand a chance against a computer called Hydra, backed by Abu Dhabi money. It ran on a 64-way cluster computer: basically, 64 computers connected and operating like a single machine. Hydra was a true monster, aptly named after the multiheaded serpent-like creature from Greek mythology. It won the match with a devastating 5½–½ score. Adams had barely scraped a single draw and lost five games. Looking back at the history of man versus machine matches, I feel Adams–Hydra signaled the moment when computers truly conquered mankind. In those years, the top engines Fritz, Junior, and Shredder were probably already stronger than Deep Blue, but with the appearance of Hydra, all doubt disappeared. At the time, the English grandmaster David Norwood reached the same conclusion: “Last week saw the end of humanity. When Deep Blue beat Kasparov eight years ago, there was still a great deal of doubt. If a top human grandmaster focused on the weaknesses of their artificial opponents, they could still win. The Wembley match between Britain’s Michael Adams and Hydra finally buried that notion. The Terminators have won.” Organizing further man versus machine matches became entirely pointless as the years went by. To borrow Kasparov’s comparison, who would want to see Usain Bolt try his luck against a Ferrari? Occasionally, odds matches have been held, where the computer is handicapped in different ways to see what it does to its level and whether a grandmaster would have a chance. Like taking one of the wheels off that Ferrari, the computer would play without one or two pawns, or start without its queen’s rook, while the human played without its queen’s knight. In most cases, the human grandmasters would still struggle against the computer. Where humans had to throw in the towel long ago, computers still compete against computers. Unlike those early tournaments in the 1970s, today’s programs run in the cloud and compete on online servers. The TCEC (Top Chess Engine Championship) is a well-known competition, while Chess.com runs its own Computer Chess Championship. Such computer versus computer games are the highest-level chess you’ll encounter on this planet. Still, most fans can’t be bothered with it, just as they wouldn’t watch two soccer teams with perfect defenses who therefore almost always played out 0–0 draws against each other. They prefer watching humans play other humans. Beauty lies in imperfection. There are, for example, many theoretical endgames where it wouldn’t make sense to watch computers play it out since the result would already be known because of their flawless play. The same endgames played among humans are often still fascinating to watch. “Do they know this position? Do they remember all the details? Can they find the narrow path to the win with just a few minutes left on the clock?” Identifying with that struggle as a viewer while the grandmasters are sweating at the board is what sport is about. Early Computer Preparation These days, Kasparov is much more interested in working with AI instead of against it. Soon after his last match with Deep Blue, he was already wondering: “What if the combination of a human and machine would play chess? Wouldn’t that lead to the highest possible level of play?” Kasparov tried it out in 1998 when he played an unusual match with the top Bulgarian player Veselin Topalov in León, Spain. He called it “Advanced Chess.” During the game, alongside the chess set and clock, both players had a PC available at their table, running on Pentium II 333 MHz processors and using the chess program of their choice. It was the complete opposite of what is allowed in serious tournaments or online chess. Two conclusions were drawn from this match, which ended in a tie. First, the games were far from the perfection the organizers and participants sought, as the time to choose the moves was limited to an hour per player. Also, Kasparov’s superiority in tactical play over Topalov was nullified as the assistance of the computer likely benefited Topalov more. The Advanced Chess experiment was only organized five times. Still, the co-operation between humans and computers has changed chess as a sport dramatically, but in a different way. I am talking about an essential aspect of chess here: preparation for the opening phase. As soon as the computer started beating grandmasters, it became a powerful tool for analyzing games and positions. Amateurs and grandmasters affectionately began to refer to their chess program as “my silicon friend.” An early adopter, Kasparov remained ahead of his peers in computer preparation for years. At one point, he called himself “the best-prepared player in the history of chess.” Even strong opponents sometimes avoided playing their favorite openings against him, fearing a powerful “novelty,” a home-cooked new move that would push them into unexplored territories where only Kasparov knew the way. In 1999 he said, “There is a computer, and you should not ignore that fact but adjust to it. It’s something you must do, whether you like it or not.” This is true indeed, especially nowadays, so in that sense, Kasparov was a pioneer. A famous example of Kasparov’s domination in the opening came in game ten of his world championship match against Viswanathan Anand in 1995 (see annotated game on pages 388–89). On move 14, Kasparov played a stunning theoretical novelty in the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez opening. He sacrificed a pawn, followed by a rook. Although Anand defended admirably, he couldn’t avoid a loss. Afterward, Kasparov revealed that he had analyzed the rook sacrifice extensively with the engine Fritz. It was the first time the computer had helped a player win a chess game at the highest level. But working with the computer might have harmed Kasparov five years later. He lost his world title to Vladimir Kramnik in 2000 after the latter continuously played the infamous Berlin defense against his Ruy Lopez. It is a variation where the queens are traded early; play kind of skips the middlegame and moves straight into the endgame. White game after White game, Kasparov kept trying to tear down his opponent’s “Berlin Wall” but he failed to win this endgame even once. (In world championship matches, players alternate playing as White and Black. The advantage of being White is somewhat similar to being the player to serve in tennis. Following this analogy, Kasparov could only tie his service games.) “Kasparov has never been open about it, but I believe one of the reasons he was so obsessed with this endgame was because the computer was giving him an advantage,” the top Dutch grandmaster Anish Giri told me. In other words, Kasparov put too much faith in the computer’s positive evaluation of the endgame. Giri: “He kept thinking, ‘I must be better.’ And kept digging through that endgame. He kept going for it, and then he would offer a draw very early because he would realize during the game, ‘Okay, I don’t understand why I’m better.’ I think a massive issue was that the computer wrongly said that White is better.” Nowadays, top grandmasters consider the move suggestions made by modern chess programs to be something rather close to the Ultimate Truth. During that Kasparov–Kramnik match, and for a few years afterward, computers were considered helpful tools, but ones that couldn’t be fully trusted yet. It was Kramnik’s turn to end up on the wrong side in his 2004 world championship match when he faced a bright talent of the new generation: the Hungarian Peter Leko. The match was played in Brissago, Switzerland, for a $1.2 million prize fund. After seven games, the score was equal. The day before his fourth turn with the white pieces, Kramnik told his team that he was ready to fight Leko’s Marshall Gambit, another variation in the Ruy Lopez where Black sacrifices a pawn for activity. His team wasn’t fully ready yet, and one of his helpers, the Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler, stayed up all night analyzing with a computer engine. He shared his work with Kramnik the next morning. Eighteen moves into the game, Leko had only 17 minutes left on the clock to reach move 40, meaning he had less than one minute on average for his next 19 moves. Having made prepared moves only, Kramnik had a hundred minutes left for his next 19 moves. But something was wrong. Vladimir Kramnik, left, and Peter Leko, right, during Game 2 of their 2004 world championship match in Brissago, Switzerland. Back in his hotel room, Svidler was following the game on his laptop. The more it progressed, the more worried he became for his boss. “I lay down and, for some reason, couldn’t get to sleep, although we hadn’t slept all night. Something was nagging inside me …” Svidler was quoted in the 2007 book From London to Elista by Ilia Levitov and Evgeny Bareev, and soon it would become clear what it was: a glaring error. A small but crucial part of the analysis that he had provided in the morning contained a big hole. And, now that the game was underway, the only person who could save Kramnik from falling into the ditch was Kramnik himself—but that day, he was too optimistic. For his 19th move, Kramnik made the rational decision to do something … irrational. “I understood that if I wanted to win this game, then a move—no matter how different—needed to be made quickly,” Kramnik said in From London to Elista. He had a choice of more or less forcing the game to end in a draw or playing a dangerous move, and, backed by Svidler’s computer prep, he confidently went for the latter. He explained his decision with gambling terminology: “And I took the decision to play for a win, enlisting the support of the computer. I played va banque, it’s hard to blame anyone here, even myself. I didn’t make a mistake, one could say that I placed ‘everything on zero.’ ” Kramnik went for a risky line that involved the sacrifice of his queen. He would then promote one of his pawns to get a new queen, and Leko’s counterplay would come too late—was the idea. As it turned out, Kramnik put too much faith in the computer. Sitting at the board and using his human brain, Leko refuted his opponent’s computer homework and demonstrated that his counterplay was on time. While Kramnik’s pawn was on its way to becoming a queen, his king was getting checkmated. Leko won in 32 moves (see annotated game on pages 394–95) and took the lead in the match, which he maintained for five more games. The computer accident could have had historic implications. It was only in game 14, the last game of the match, that Kramnik beat Leko in a must-win game, leveling the score to 7–7 and retaining his world title. (It would be the last time a world championship match was played without a tiebreak.) What went wrong exactly? Was Leko a better calculator than the computer? Not really, unless the computer wasn’t given enough time to calculate. Because of the enormous number of positions that had to be checked overnight, Svidler had given the engine perhaps only a minute or two to calculate what turned out to be the critical position in the game—much less than Leko had at his disposal behind the board. It was later discovered that if Svidler had given the computer about 30 seconds more to look at that critical position, the engine would have changed its evaluation in favor of Black, and Kramnik would not have lost the game. Modern Preparation An indication of how strong chess engines have become over the last two decades can be gleaned once you realize that, in 2024, an engine like Stockfish will tell you the correct evaluation of the Kramnik–Leko position in less than a second. Modern-day engines are simply too strong to allow such accidents to occur. As a result, the quality of grandmaster preparation is exceptionally high these days. At the same time, preparation is not as enjoyable as it used to be, at least according to two world-class “preparation experts”: both the Dutch grandmaster Erwin l’Ami (who was part of Veselin Topalov’s team of seconds before and during the 2010 World Chess Championship, and who now works for Anish Giri), and also Peter Heine Nielsen (a second to both Viswanathan Anand, between 2005 and 2013, and Magnus Carlsen, from 2013 till present). “Back in the early 2000s, chess computers would be okay tactically, but positionally there was still much left to be desired,” explained l’Ami. “This meant that the human part of the work was more significant, and analyzing was more interesting. It is less enjoyable these days because your own input is not so important any more. Especially in major openings like the Ruy Lopez or the Catalan, you can hardly make headway.” In the early days, developing new ideas in complicated positions and catching opponents off-guard was still possible. L’Ami once won a game entirely thanks to preparation when he played the Ukrainian grandmaster Vadim Malakhatko in 2003 (see annotated game on pages 393–94). He had devised a new idea, analyzed it with an engine, and memorized it all in his head. Because Malakhatko played exactly as predicted, l’Ami got to play his idea and didn’t need to think at all. The time control was 90 minutes for the whole game and a 30-second “Fischer bonus” per move. At the start of the game, l’Ami’s clock showed 1:30; at the end it was 1:41. He had made so many moves without thinking that he had gained 11 minutes on the clock by the time Malakhatko resigned. Nielsen told me, “Back then, computers were quite weak, so if you used them properly you had a massive advantage over your opponent. You would try to dominate your opponent with preparation, and you could do it successfully.” Strong preparation meant checking the opponent’s games, having more knowledge than them, having more ideas, and finding holes in the opponent’s opening repertoire. “When I play in the Bundesliga [the German chess league] these days,” continued Nielsen, “I feel I no longer have an advantage over weaker players because preparation has become too easy. Twenty years ago, I felt I had a massive advantage simply because the technology was weaker. You could still use it, but you had to use it very intelligently and aggressively, while nowadays it’s almost automatic. The tool has become too good, becoming a big equalizer.” According to Nielsen, chess preparation used to be closer to science, where you could put a human hypothesis to the empirical “computer test.” It was much more of a cooperation between man and machine, similar to Kasparov’s Advanced Chess idea. These days, it’s much more practical; it’s about finding which moves are the most unpleasant for the opponent. “The practical component is always to try to win a chess game. I now fully look at it from a sports perspective,” said Nielsen. The higher levels of opening preparation these days have led to a higher level and perhaps even more interesting type of play, according to grandmaster and chess commentator Maurice Ashley: The players have benefited enormously from what AI has done, showing how to defend better, knowing when you can actually sacrifice a pawn for the initiative. Before, people were just doing it cavalierly. But now you have to really have super-refined judgment around this sort of thing. And now they are even entering worlds that no one would enter before, positions that are almost impossible for humans to play. It’s so chaotic. But people can study it carefully and enter complicated openings. So I think the level of chess is elevated dramatically as a result, and we’re seeing more and more interesting positions, far beyond what we could have seen before. There is one caveat, though. Everyone has access to the same super-strong computer engines, so if you find a remarkable tactical idea, you can be sure your opponent has found the same idea. You must find other areas to make life difficult for your opponent. Two common methods are trying to surprise your opponent or test their memory. Almost all top players play a wide range of openings, so there are always opportunities to play something the opponent doesn’t fully expect. As White, players can play the pawn in front of their queenside bishop, their queen’s pawn, or their king’s pawn, while moving the king’s knight toward the center is another good first move. You just cannot predict any more what they will do. This is entirely different from, for example, the times of Bobby Fischer, who spent almost his entire career only playing his king’s pawn on the first move. Today, players can play a lot more openings and variations than in the old days because the computer has shown them to be playable, as Anish Giri explained to me: “The stronger the engine gets, the more it shows that variations that were considered bad before are no longer bad because the engine is able to defend them. Even what used to be a dubious opening turns out to be playable if you defend accurately and the engine shows how to defend. The King’s Gambit is an extreme example, but it doesn’t lose. Nothing loses.” While playing many different opening systems, players tend to go for long and complicated variations regularly, hoping their opponent doesn’t remember all the details. Both at the top and at amateur level, chess has become a bit of a memory game in the opening phase. There are many examples to be found in top-level chess. In a game Giri played against the US grandmaster Fabiano Caruana at the Superbet Chess Classic, held in May 2023 in Bucharest, Romania, the players agreed to a draw after 26 moves. The opening was the popular Italian Game but became highly complex early on, with Giri having to calculate a queen sacrifice that would eventually lead to a draw by move repetition. The Dutchman spent about an hour and ten minutes calculating (or rather, digging up from his memory) the moves, while Caruana, like l’Ami in the above example, ended the game with more time on his clock than he started with. He had done his homework, and Giri had passed the memory test (see annotated game on page 400). Another reason why players have to memorize so much more than they used to is down to the internet, which we’ll talk about much more in the third part of the book. Because of the enormous increase in online tournaments, players are playing hundreds of games a year more (at faster time controls) than they used to. “I play like 700 games a year now,” said Giri. “In many of those games, I play something that is an opening that I looked at, so relevant things, and my colleagues also did that. So now the database is flooded with games and all sorts of different openings, and you’re not even able to digest all the games.” At my chess club, many young players study chess openings fanatically. Amateur players tend to exaggerate the importance of memory, says Giri: “You have to realize that memory is only relevant between two players of approximately equal strength. If you are an amateur and memorize everything, but you are bad at chess, then you might not be good enough to hold it, and you will lose any final position you managed to recall. But if you have two top players, they’re so good that by the time they reach the final position of their analysis, they might be able to play it out well. So it’s just a memory game among top players, but not elsewhere; you cannot replace top level with memory.” In 2010, when l’Ami and Nielsen were part of the opposing teams in the Anand–Topalov world championship match, the memory aspect played a role from the get-go. A difficult middlegame position came on the board that both teams had looked at before the match, where Topalov sacrificed a pawn in return for an attack on Anand’s king. The Indian, who was defending his title in this match, knew that, at some point, he had to make a king move toward the direction of the center of the board, but he couldn’t remember at which exact moment. He played it one move too early and lost the game instead of drawing it. Anand had failed the memory test, but would end up winning the match (see annotated game on pages 396–97). Because of the tsunami of available information on chess openings, the most recent development is that top players tend to avoid playing variations that require deep memory. “It seems that there isn’t a memory savant in top chess right now,” said Giri. “None of the top players have an insane memory, even for people with the so-called best memory, like Magnus. I can show you countless examples of him misremembering things. So they started changing strategies and you see that players are not all playing the same forcing lines any more. People change strategy.” The Arrival of AlphaZero On December 5, 2017, a watershed moment in the history of computer chess occurred. It was the day Google DeepMind released a preprint paper introducing their chess-playing computer AlphaZero. At that time, the strongest chess engine was Stockfish, an open-source program originally developed by Tord Romstad from Norway and Marco Costalba from Italy. Costalba had come up with the name Stockfish. It refers to the unsalted fish dried on wooden racks in Norway by cold air and wind, which is also exported in large amounts to the Veneto region of northern Italy, where Costalba lives. His explanation: like the fish, the chess engine is an original Norwegian product further developed in Italy. The DeepMind paper revealed that this little fish had experienced a close encounter with a giant chess-playing shark—a hundred-game match between AlphaZero and Stockfish 8—which had not even been close. The shark had beaten—no, obliterated—Stockfish by scoring 28 wins, 72 draws, and not a single loss. AlphaZero was ridiculously strong. The other thing was how it got so strong. Without being fed any knowledge except for the chess rules, AlphaZero had reached a superhuman level in just four hours of playing games against itself. My colleague and friend Mike Klein found a good metaphor in his story for Chess.com at the time: “This would be akin to a robot being given access to thousands of metal bits and parts, but no knowledge of a combustion engine. Then it experiments numerous times with every combination possible until it builds a Ferrari. All that in less [than half the] time than it takes to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The program had four hours to play itself many, many times, thereby becoming its own teacher.” When I spoke to him for this book, Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad added a little nuance: “This four-hour claim is kind of true, but at the same time also kind of ridiculous, because they were using an immense amount of hardware, like thousands of machines training in parallel. If you wanted to do this at home, it would take about 40 years.” Even so, the news about AlphaZero was just mind-blowing, and over the next few weeks the chess world was talking about nothing else. I attended the London Chess Classic as a journalist that first week of December 2017, with Mike, which allowed us to interview a few strong players and get their first reactions to the news. Magnus Carlsen’s assistant Peter Heine Nielsen said: “After reading the paper but especially seeing the games, I thought … well, I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they play chess. I feel now I know.” Garry Kasparov, who had quite a bit of experience with computers himself, already saw broader implications: “We have always assumed that chess required too much empirical knowledge for a machine to play so well from scratch, with no human knowledge added at all. Of course, I’ll be fascinated to see what we can learn about chess from AlphaZero since that is the great promise of machine learning in general—machines figuring out rules that humans cannot detect. But, obviously, the implications are wonderful, far beyond chess and other games. The ability of a machine to replicate and surpass centuries of human knowledge in complex closed systems is a world-changing tool.” Hassabis and DeepMind Google DeepMind’s CEO, Demis Hassabis, was a fanatic chess player in his youth and nothing less than a child prodigy. As a teenager, he used some of his prize money to buy himself his first computer, and soon he was creating his own programs. He cofounded DeepMind in 2010. From the start, DeepMind has focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence, combining it with neuroscientific insights and new computer hardware developments. In his introduction to the 2019 book Game Changer, a fascinating, chess-technical exploration of the style of AlphaZero, Hassabis formulated his company’s ambition: “To build intelligent systems that can learn to solve any complex task by themselves, and then use this technology to help find solutions to some of society’s biggest challenges and unanswered questions.” Hassabis has stated in many interviews that he wants to “solve intelligence” and then use intelligence “to solve everything else.” Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis at the 2018 London Chess Classic. DeepMind’s first notable success came in December 2013 when its learning algorithm Deep Q-Network (DQN) achieved expert-level scores in Atari games by teaching itself using only the raw pixels on the screen as inputs. A year after Google (now Alphabet) purchased DeepMind for a reported £400 million ($650 million) in 2014, Hassabis’s company pulled off something more significant. Their neural network algorithm AlphaGo became the first machine to beat a world champion in the board game Go, an achievement that, according to experts, came decades ahead of its time. As Go is even more complex than chess (see page 32), creating an engine that plays on the level of strong human players is even more difficult. An evaluation function is hard to build because the many possible moves on each turn make it harder to use brute-force calculation, the type that looks at every possible move in the tree of possibilities. For humans, Go is a rather intuitive game. Computers can do a lot, but they lack intuition, right? DeepMind approached this challenge differently from existing Go-playing programs (and AlphaGo quickly defeated those programs before taking on humans). AlphaGo utilized deep neural networks, a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. Like the brain, it uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure. The mathematical relationships between those layers are constantly updated during data training. In this case, AlphaGo was trained on a large dataset of expert Go games, enabling it to learn from human knowledge and patterns. Another aspect involved reinforcement learning: AlphaGo played numerous games against different versions of itself, thus gathering data and refining its strategies over time. (Neural networks are very versatile, and by training them they can learn to perform many different tasks, such as recognizing cats and dogs by looking at thousands of labeled examples.) Yet another innovative technique was the use of a value network (reducing the depth of the tree search) and a policy network (reducing the breadth of the search) to efficiently evaluate positions and make decisions based on what it had learned previously. It also ran on powerful hardware infrastructure, including multiple high-performance GPUs, to process all possible moves and positions quickly. One factor behind AlphaGo’s success wasn’t new: the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic search algorithm that simulates random sequences of moves that are part of the search tree. As it goes with artificial intelligence, at some point, the moment comes when the best humans need to be challenged and defeated. Go experienced its Kasparov–Deep Blue moment in May 2016, when a five-game match was played in Seoul, South Korea, between AlphaGo and the South Korean top Go player Lee Sedol, one of the few on the planet who had reached the highest level there is, 9 dan. Before the match, Sedol had shown confidence, expressing that he expected to win without losing a single game. It went quite differently: he lost the first three games, then won one, but also lost the last game to go down 1–4. Three and a half years later, Lee announced his retirement from playing Go: “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated.” Apart from crushing a world-class player, which was a complete sensation, the style in which AlphaGo played was highly remarkable—to the extent that several books were subsequently written on the topic (something that would happen with AlphaZero too). In particular, AlphaGo’s 37th move in the second match game went down in history as truly special. “It was a move so unthinkable that some of the world’s top Go players who were live commentating thought there must have been some sort of mistake, and yet more than a hundred moves later, this stone turned out to be in the perfect strategic place to decide the outcome of the game,” wrote Hassabis. After their resounding success at Go, the next step for the DeepMind researchers was to work on the notion of generality: they wanted to create a single system that was able to perform well in any type of two-player, perfect information game. DeepMind’s December 2017 draft research paper demonstrated that their latest algorithm AlphaZero could reach a superhuman level without receiving human knowledge but just by playing against itself in three different board games: chess, shogi (Japanese chess), and Go. Like with AlphaGo two years earlier, AlphaZero’s chess style was applauded. It played aggressively, sacrificing pieces and pawns to enter super-complicated positions, demonstrating the style of former world champions such as Mikhail Tal or Garry Kasparov. The latter wrote: “I was quite happy to see AlphaZero’s dynamic sacrificial style. Not only because it mirrored my own, but because it could play like this and win against a fearsomely accurate elite program.” Interestingly, AlphaZero searched roughly 80,000 positions per second, a far cry from the 200 million positions per second that Deep Blue was capable of in 1997. AlphaZero’s search, therefore, had to be more efficient. How exactly AlphaZero was “thinking” was something even the people at DeepMind found hard to explain. The program did have an evaluation function, but not based on human input, only on “personal” chess experience. How it valued aspects of chess positions “remains a bit of a mystery,” said one of the developers. Another one described it as “developing something akin to ‘intuition.’ ” What is clear, though, is that the general approach to chess computers has come full circle. Turing and Shannon knew that the computers of their time could not be successful with a brute-force, look-at-all-moves-all-the-time approach, so they suggested selective (“Type B”) search that focuses on the most relevant moves. They couldn’t know how quickly computers would grow faster. For them, it was impossible to predict that brute-force calculation would remain a successful approach for so long, used in all the major chess computers, including Ken Thompson’s Belle, IBM’s Deep Blue, and other programs that followed. And now, although it does run on highly sophisticated hardware, AlphaZero looks for its moves in a way that is smarter than ever before, in a way Turing and Shannon had in mind. There is another parallel with those early days of AI. Turing and Shannon were the first to admit that developing a well-playing chess program was not a goal but a means to solve problems of “greater significance.” It is precisely this approach that we see with Demis Hassabis and his colleagues at DeepMind, who, step by step, move from game-specific algorithms based on imitation learning to general, fully self-supervised learning systems. AlphaGo learned to play Go by looking at human games, and then AlphaGo Zero learned by just playing against itself. AlphaZero became more generic as it taught itself to play, only by playing against itself, multiple board games. The next step was MuZero, a computer program DeepMind launched in 2019 that can learn games without knowing the rules. Apart from managing to (once again) become super-strong in chess, shogi, and Go, MuZero also taught itself 57 Atari games from scratch. Another step followed in late 2022 when DeepNash was launched. DeepMind’s latest AI agent could play Stratego at a human expert level, winning nearly all the matches it played against other AIs and scoring an 84 percent overall win rate when competing against human players in online games. What was new this time was that AI was doing well in a game with imperfect information: in Stratego, the players are hiding which pieces are placed where. DeepMind have applied their experience with board and computer games, and their increasingly abstract, self-supervised learning systems, in many different areas of society. For instance, ideas similar to AlphaZero have been used to control the cooling systems in Google’s enormous data centers, saving a lot of energy. The best example, in terms of helping to solve problems of “greater significance,” however, is AlphaFold, DeepMind’s AI program, which performs predictions of 3D protein structures. Described by Hassabis as “Fermat’s Last Theorem applied to biology,” the computational algorithm analyzes the amino-acid sequence of a protein. It uses a deep-learning neural network to predict how that sequence folds into a 3D shape. As a result, AlphaFold has pro-vided biologists with invaluable insights into the functions and interactions of proteins, which is beneficial to the discovery and development of new drugs, can assist in things like pandemic preparedness, and helps in understanding how the human body works. While Hassabis feels that AlphaFold is the most complex and meaningful system DeepMind has built, his ambition is unlimited. He says he is thinking about some of the biggest challenges in science today, such as a room-temperature superconductor, virtual cells, and quantum simulation. DeepMind’s ultimate goal? To create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that learns to perform any intellectual task humans can. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT was the first to reach global fame, major companies like Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are all developing their own large-language models that are seen as a big step toward AGI. DeepMind’s AI system, called “Gemini,” was first released in December 2023. It uses techniques from AlphaGo. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman, recorded in July 2022, Hassabis told the story of his last meeting with Stephen Hawking not long before the theoretical physicist passed away. Hawking was interested in DeepMind’s work, and the two spoke for hours. Hawking said goodbye to Hassabis with the words: “I wish you the best of luck, but not too much.” Fruit Fly We have seen that chess has played a key role in developing AI research from its infancy to the present day. From Turing to Hassabis, important researchers used the game of chess as a stepping stone toward more important areas—but, it should be noted, sometimes in the face of opposition. If a professor and their team of students are using their valuable time and resources to create a machine that can play chess, you can imagine there will be people thinking: “Are these guys just having fun?” AI’s “founding father,” John McCarthy, addressed this issue during a presentation he delivered in 1989 to the Conference of the Canadian Information Processing Society in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He noted that the famous comparison (also mentioned in Chapter 3) between chess and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), often attributed to McCarthy himself, is not his but was first made by the Soviet mathematician and computer scientist Aleksandr Kronrod. In the 1950s and 1960s, Kronrod was the director of the mathematics division at the Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Kronrod was interested in artificial intelligence and indirectly involved in his laboratory’s chess research. McCarthy suggested that Kronrod might have used the comparison between chess and the fruit fly “as a defense against physicists when they complained that he used so much of their precious computer time in a mere chess match.” Alas, the defense didn’t hold up for long, and in 1968 Kronrod lost his directorship as higher functionaries were indeed skeptical of the research group’s focus on chess and other games. Kronrod’s analogy was prophetic, as chess would become highly important for developing the AI research area, similar to the fruit fly dominating the history of genetic sciences. Both chess and the fruit fly formed an experimental platform that provided a consistent and controlled environment for investigating different hypotheses. The analogy didn’t hold up for long either. From that similar starting point, chess and the fruit fly went different ways in their respective fields. Whereas Drosophila research “matured” over the decades—starting from chromosome mapping, then expanding with the investigation of new wild varieties of flies, to eventually become an important area for the study of patterns of inheritance and population genetics—chess research remained a somewhat limited field of AI. Because brute-force techniques (Shannon’s Type-A thinking) kept being so successful, there was no need for research into Type-B thinking, which would have developed AI more broadly at an earlier stage. McCarthy was a good sport after losing his bet to David Levy in 1978. When he sent his check, he wrote in his letter that he wasn’t too unhappy about losing the bet. He had hoped that Levy would lose to an intelligent program, but the progress made so far was mostly in computer programs relying on the brute-force calculation approach. After Kasparov’s loss to Deep Blue, McCarthy wrote in an article in Science in the same year: “Computer chess has developed much as genetics might have if the geneticists had concentrated their efforts starting in 1910 on breeding racing drosophila. We would have some science, but mainly we would have very fast fruit flies.” Nathan Ensmenger, an associate professor at Indiana University, Bloomington, wrote a paper in 2012 where he pointed out: “Unlike Drosophila, however, and despite its apparent productivity as an experimental technology, computer chess ultimately produced little in terms of fundamental theoretical insights.” That was three years before AlphaGo arrived; five before AlphaZero. I spoke to Ensmenger for this book, and he agreed that the latest developments in computer chess are fundamentally different and have resulted in much more useful ideas (some of which will be discussed in this chapter). If McCarthy were still alive, he would probably have changed his mind too. Chess and Neural Networks Seven years after AlphaZero arrived on the scene, the chess world is heavily influenced by this new type of chess computer based on neural networks and reinforcement learning. While DeepMind did not develop AlphaZero further, the open-source community, spearheaded by programmer Gary Linscott, continued to work on its own neural network-based engine, Leela Chess Zero (Lc0)—announced in January 2018, just one month after DeepMind had published its first preprint paper on AlphaZero. AlphaZero was never made available to the public, but Lc0 quickly became an invaluable tool for professional players. Well, the ones who knew about it. Peter Heine Nielsen told me about his early experience with Leela that year, admitting he was late to the party. He’d checked it out a few months before Magnus Carlsen’s world championship match against Fabiano Caruana, which took place in November 2018 in London. He was not impressed. “I thought it was too weird. It wasn’t developed enough yet and seemed quite weak tactically,” said Nielsen. “Caruana was using it, but we were not. That was probably a mistake but not a real disaster.” A few months into 2019, Nielsen could appreciate Leela’s uniqueness: “Its understanding of chess is just amazing. In early 2019 it was my impression that some of us were using it—for example, Anish Giri—and some of us were not. Those who were not using it were getting completely trashed in the opening.” Giri’s second, Erwin l’Ami, said, “Leela somehow understands chess as we do. By playing these millions of games against itself, it knows what space is, what a ‘bad bishop’ is. It can evaluate a position properly in a fraction of a second.” To be among the early adopters of Leela was like having inside information on the stock market. Nielsen: “For half a year, nobody would talk about this until it became clear that everybody knew about it.” The edge given to players who used both Leela and Stockfish probably deserves some explanation. Say you had two top players, Carlsen and Giri, who had to play each other the next day in a big tournament. Both were using the latest version of Stockfish, but only Carlsen’s team was running Leela simultaneously. This meant that team Carlsen knew exactly what Giri’s team were looking at (accessing the same Stockfish analysis), as well as having the extra information from Leela. Each time Leela’s evaluation would be more accurate than Stockfish’s, Carlsen would have a big edge in the analysis because Leela knew Giri’s weak spots and how to tackle them. Stockfish and Leela together form a strong tandem for analysts, with Stockfish being super-strong in pure calculation and Leela coming up with “human” ideas regarding long-term positional play. The Stockfish developers were paying close attention. In the summer of 2020 they announced that they would incorporate an efficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) into a new version of their program. Stockfish 12, or Stockfish NNUE, was released in September 2020 and combined the brute-force computing approach of the traditional Stockfish with the advanced evaluation capabilities of neural network chess engines such as AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero. The evaluation function of the traditional Stockfish was stripped out and replaced with a neural network evaluation function. The result was spectacular: according to the developers, Stockfish 12 was a whopping 100 Elo points stronger than Stockfish 11. At the time of writing, Stockfish has won the last nine seasons of the Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC) main league event and dominated most of the Computer Chess Championships on Chess.com. As of June 2024, Stockfish tops the Computer Chess Rating List (CCRL) with a stratospheric 3641 rating. What does it mean for a human to analyze chess with a computer that strong? Are these engines now finally telling the absolute truth about chess positions? Nielsen thinks so: “We have said that before in the past, and we were wrong. But now I think we are right. If you had asked me in 2017, I would have said that technology is near-perfect. I mean, Stockfish was already incredibly strong. But then it got completely crushed by AlphaZero. I cannot imagine today’s Stockfish getting crushed that way.” Stockfish programmer Tord Romstad still isn’t certain his engine has plateaued: “That’s a very good question, and I’m not confident about my reply because I keep getting surprised. When I started, I thought the chess engines were playing very close to perfectly, but much later, around the Stockfish 8 times, I thought, ‘Surely you couldn’t make something much better?’ so it had to be close to perfect now. But I keep getting surprised. There never seems to be a ceiling.” The English grandmaster Matthew Sadler, co-author of several books about neural network chess engines, has a hard time believing that we’ll see another huge jump in strength due to new technology. “It’s hard to imagine,” he told me. “But that’s what we said about the classic Stockfish as well, some years back. But it is hard to think that there is much more space in chess to find something absolutely amazing.” Asked if he feels that the modern engines understand the game of chess, Sadler replied negatively: “They don’t understand any-thing; they don’t even know they’re playing chess, really. Still, it feels that way. Their pieces are going on great squares. The thing about neural nets is that they maximize mobility. They’re never letting themselves get into positions where their mobility is restricted, and [they] take actions from miles ahead to avoid that. When they’re playing, their pieces are glowing with power, somehow.” I agree with Sadler that the chess played by these modern programs is truly something special. For instance, when analyzing chess openings, they suggest the strangest moves as early as move three, as if they are playing chess from another galaxy. It feels like the chess we have played as humans for centuries is being reinvented almost from scratch. I can hardly imagine that I will encounter such an experience again in my lifetime, but you never know. A New Style of Playing Chess Apart from reaping the benefits from analyzing and preparing with them, top chess players have also been influenced in their playing style by neural-network chess computers. As noted before, AlphaZero’s style was quite attractive, and its open-source offspring Lc0 and the new Stockfish have inherited similar traits. They taught human players lessons unknown in the 1,500 years that the game had existed, and modern-day grandmasters are using those lessons in their tournament play. A clear case is Magnus Carlsen himself. In January 2019, the Norwegian star—still the classical world champion then—got hold of the book Game Changer. Few chess players have read as many chess books as Carlsen, and few chess books have directly impacted Carlsen’s play more than this book. The authors, Sadler and Natasha Regan, investigated more than 2,000 previously unpublished AlphaZero games and revealed its revolutionary thinking process. They presented stunning discoveries in areas like opening play, piece mobility, initiative, attacking techniques, and long-term sacrifices. The book’s title was not an exaggeration but prophetic: AlphaZero changed how chess is played at the top level. Carlsen has claimed he became a different player, inspired by the remarkable AlphaZero games. His second, Nielsen, wrote an article for New in Chess magazine where he demonstrated how Carlsen had adopted themes from AlphaZero, such as running up the board with a pawn on the outer edge, sacrificing pawns, and being more flexible with the concept of king safety—a truly inspiring story for any chess fan. As always, new generations are adapting more quickly to new technologies. In chess, the young, rising stars use computers better than older players. This became all the more clear when I interviewed the Bosnian-Dutch grandmaster Ivan Sokolov in the summer of 2022, shortly after he had captained the young Uzbekistan team to victory at the Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India. Born in 1968, Sokolov is a classical player and trainer who gained knowledge from reading books, studying top grandmaster games, and, of course, from his experience as a top player in the 1990s and early 2000s. But working with, for example, the Iranian-French prodigy Alireza Firouzja (born in 2003), opened his eyes regarding computers: What I faced, not only with Alireza but also with some other young players that I worked with, is that, for example, they come up with a proposal that is very unconventional for a known type of position—unconventional based on old knowledge. I would usually say, “If this works, I need to quote my friend Jan Timman, who said, ‘If it works, I need to learn chess again!’ ” But then I would get a comment like, “Yes, but the computer loves it.” Then we would do some analysis, and sometimes it would turn out that the computer was wrong, in the sense that the evaluation only works if computers are playing. For humans, the assessment can be different. Top-level chess has also become more concrete. Where, in the old days, grandmasters would dismiss certain moves because they would “look ugly” or “cannot be right in this type of structure,” young players think more in terms of, “If it works, it works.” Sokolov: You can have two approaches. First, you can have a mindset that you try to evaluate a position based on common knowledge, so pawn structure, space, bishop pair, king safety, potential of pawn breaks, possible trade of pieces—do I get a better ending, do I get a worse ending? Once you are done with all these elements, you calculate to try to find the best move and justify your judgment. But, of course, it can also go vice versa: that you calculate, and based on the variations that you calculate, you try to come up with an assessment of the position. I belong to the first school of thought, and I still believe this way is more justified, and it makes it easier for you in practical play to handle the position. But the direct element has become much more important than it ever was, and for this, we can thank computers. My understanding of this is that in the classical method a player judges a position based on their pattern recognition and intuition, and then tries to back up their evaluation by calculation. In the modern method, calculation comes first and dictates judgement, which allows for a more liberal, flexible way of looking at chess, without prejudice toward what has been common belief about how the game should be played. Matthew Sadler also feels strongly that modern chess engines are great teachers and are making the new generation of players stronger than ever before. In our conversation, he boldly stated that humans can break the 3000 Elo rating barrier, a gap of more than a hundred points with Carlsen’s peak rating. Sadler’s reasoning? All previous generations have been educated with books written by humans, and he has realized that most of those aren’t that good. “Take me, a 50-year-old grandmaster,” he explained. “I’ve been brought up with pretty crappy material. There were lots of books that were just wrong, where they said, ‘This is the theme in the position,’ but it wasn’t. Modern engines are showing that a lot of the time, the emphasis is all wrong. What you see is said to be the main theme, but it’s not. There’s some extra inner logic that’s important. If you train youngsters on really good material from the beginning and get their evaluation function really strong, you can certainly add another hundred Elo points to the current players’ level.” Where Hassabis hopes to have AI eventually explain us humans and the universe, Sadler sees AI helping humans to reach a higher understanding of their beloved game. Once again, chess is at the beginning of the next stages of AI development. Do We Need to Worry? In the November 1964 edition of USSR, a monthly illustrated magazine, the Latvian grandmaster Mikhail Tal, arguably the most “artistic” of all the world chess champions, spoke about the possibility of a “chess robot.” Tal wasn’t very optimistic: “I don’t think chess players need one. Chess would soon die if a robot turned up that could play better than anybody else, could play so well, in fact, as to be theoretically incapable of making a mistake. Poetry would die if a machine should suddenly appear that wrote better verses than humans. Chess not only implies creativity but performance too, and the most skillful performance would lose all meaning in such an event.” Tal’s remarks are similar to a quote I came across in January 2023, when the Bad Seeds frontman Nick Cave responded to a fan who had sent him a song that ChatGPT had generated “in the style of Nick Cave.” I can understand his reaction: The apocalypse is well on its way. What ChatGPT is, in this instance, is replication as travesty. It could perhaps in time create a song that is, on the surface, indistinguishable from an original, but it will always be a replication, a kind of burlesque.… Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don’t feel. Data doesn’t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn’t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. We cannot deny that there are also downsides to artificial intelligence’s effects on chess. The most obvious one will be discussed in the next chapter: computers have made it much easier to cheat. But even the legitimate use of chess engines has indirectly led to a negative development at the top level. The 2021 world championship match in Dubai between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi was Carlsen’s last world championship. On the podcast The Magnus Effect, on July 19, 2022, he had shocked the chess world by stating that he would no longer defend his world title. The main reason was that he wasn’t happy with the format any more. Due to the intense computer preparation with the top engines, his opponents could maintain a high level just by memory for 15 to 20 moves. With a lot of thinking time on the clock, they were becoming hard to beat in the remainder of the game. Carlsen felt that classical chess, with games that last several hours, was not the best way to determine the best player any more. At the same time, just as our society will need to adapt to even smarter versions of ChatGPT and the possible emergence of AGI, chess players and organizers will need to adapt to the new reality these super-strong chess engines bring to the table nowadays. Chess grandmasters have started playing many different openings with both colors, so that the surprise effect can nullify some of their opponent’s preparation. Amateurs like myself, who are also increasingly relying on engine-based preparation, are starting to do the same, and we might become better players because of it. Overall, I think most of what artificial intelligence has brought has been positive for chess. If we look at what’s happening with generative AI in the world of music or art, or the impact ChatGPT is having on society in general, it seems that chess stands out favorably compared to those other areas. In the chess world, we have learned to adapt to how AI has developed in our field, and, if we treat it well, the benefit from AI will outweigh any fear. More than a quarter of a century since man lost the battle to the machine, humans still play and enjoy chess games—even those played between computers. AI did not make chess irrelevant. On the contrary, chess still entertains and teaches us. The human aspect is still fully alive, and AI does not stop us from enjoying chess but helps us to appreciate it more—and so, in a way, it helps us in what it means to be human.",

      "title": "Chapter 7The Dark Side: Cheating in Chess",
      "content": "Chapter 7The Dark Side: Cheating in Chess “Chess must be established as a thoroughly straightforward and honest game first of all before it can be made a real gentlemanly one, and unscrupulous trickery, deception and fraud must be ‘warned off the track.’ But it requires a strong arm to accomplish that, and war on dishonest chessists cannot be made with rose water.” —Wilhelm Steinitz, International Chess Magazine, 1887 Holding a hotel key card in one hand and a pack of chewing gum in the other, American grandmaster Hans Niemann raises his arms as the tournament arbiter moves a Garrett handheld metal detector across his body. As it gets close to the chewing gum, the detector blinks a red light. Niemann smiles and opens the packet, which the arbiter puts aside for a moment as he continues his search. He then switches the Garrett for a smaller radio-frequency scanner and meticulously moves down Niemann’s dark blazer and trousers, carefully checking his tanned leather shoes before going up again. This is not an airport but the entrance to a chess tournament. A pre-game check for electronic devices such as mobile phones or smartwatches—not allowed on a player’s body during gameplay—is becoming standard in top chess. This particular check, however, is taking longer than usual. The clock on the TV screen shows 12:59 p.m. in St. Louis on Monday, September 5, 2022. The fourth round of the Sinquefield Cup is about to start. The annual ten-player super-tournament, among the most prestigious on the chess calendar and backed by Missouri-based billionaire Rex Sinquefield, is being held for the ninth time. The 19-year-old Niemann, from Connecticut, is a highly talented junior chess player who made a big jump in the world rankings during the COVID-19 pandemic. But he isn’t even among the world’s top 40 players. He has no business winning this one. None-theless, Niemann is the sole leader three rounds into the event after a spectacular result the day before, when he beat none other than Magnus Carlsen (see annotated game on pages 399–400), the world champion, the 31-year-old superstar from Norway. The GOAT? Carlsen the Mighty went unbeaten for 125 games between 2019 and 2020. In 2022 he had built another impressive streak: he hadn’t suffered a single loss in his previous 53 games. Until St. Louis. With his typical, unfiltered voice, Niemann commented after their game, “It must be embarrassing for the world champion to lose to me.” At the exact moment when the arbiter finishes his security check and Niemann walks into the playing hall, Carlsen sends out a tweet that shocks the chess world. “I’ve withdrawn from the tournament. I’ve always enjoyed playing in the @STLChessClub, and hope to be back in the future,” he wrote. Wait, what? Carlsen had once prematurely left a press conference, but never before had he stepped out of a tournament. The number of times a top grandmaster has deliberately withdrawn from an ongoing tournament can be counted on the fingers of one hand. In 1967, the erratic American and future world champion Bobby Fischer left the Sousse Interzonal Tournament after a dispute with the organizers over the scheduling of his games. In 2018 the Chinese number-one player and future world champion Ding Liren was forced to withdraw from the Norway Chess tournament after he broke his hip during a fateful bicycle ride. Carlsen’s decision was something the chess world had rarely seen before. “I am sitting here in a bit of a stunned silence; I don’t really know how to react to this,” said the popular commentator and top grandmaster Peter Svidler, perplexed about this unique moment for chess. “There will be some developments, I assume,” he added. It was the understatement of the year, considering what would happen in the months ahead. Carlsen’s tweet opened a Pandora’s box of speculation, primarily because of a video clip that he had attached to it. In it, soccer manager José Mourinho said, “I prefer, really, not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble.” The clip was a well-known soccer meme from 2014, when the Portuguese trainer, then the coach of Chelsea, was interviewed following his team’s loss to Aston Villa in the English Premier League. Mourinho was furious about some of the decisions by the referee but preferred not to speak for fear of retroactive punishment from the Football Association. What Mourinho wanted to say wasn’t immediately clear at the time (although he seemed to be suggesting mistakes from the referee), so what did Carlsen, a big soccer fan himself, mean by using this meme? Speculation started instantly on social media and wouldn’t stop for weeks. Mainstream media worldwide would report on what was to become the biggest scandal chess had ever seen. Chess had hit the fan. The Chess Speaks for Itself The narrative kind of started three weeks before the Sinquefield Cup when Carlsen and Niemann played each other four times in faster games at a tournament in Miami. Niemann, the lowest seed and an outspoken and confident newcomer, had started with a surprising win against the favorite before losing the next three games and their mini-match 1–3. Asked for a summary of that first game, the American teenager replied, “The chess speaks for itself.” He walked away from the camera, ignoring the follow-up question and perplexing the interviewer. It was the chess version of dropping the mic. The phrase “speaks for itself” became a meme, instantly added to the vocabulary of chess players and fans on social media. Niemann had quickly positioned himself off the board as the Conor McGregor of chess as he spoke with a bravado that evoked both cringe and delight. He was brimming with confidence, supported by his quick rise to the top. Less than two years after earning the grandmaster title at the age of 17, he had recently entered the world’s top hundred. Niemann’s ascent was aided by the fact that he was one of the most active grandmasters in the world, having played a string of tournaments almost back-to-back in Spain, Serbia, Italy, Montenegro, the US (Las Vegas, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cherry Hill), Portugal, Serbia again, the United Arab Emirates, Latvia, Uzbekistan, and Spain again. He was a one-man band on tour, his computer was his roadie, and his Uber Eats account his stage manager. In March 2022, Niemann was a guest on the popular Perpetual Chess Podcast, where he explained his regimen: “The time that I’m investing is a minimum of ten to 12 hours a day. I’m working very hard; I don’t have much of a social life, you could say. I don’t indulge in any distractions other than chess.” He didn’t hide his ambition and confidence: “The goal is to be the best in the world. I think it’s absolutely impossible for me to fail at this point because I am really just doing everything that I need to do, and I am investing every second of every day into improving my chess.” How important chess had become for him was revealed when he said, “If I do not reach the top ten, I think I will assess my chess career as a failure. I think [then] my life is a failure as well, if you wanna get deep.” He spoke with the same intensity as that other legendary American prodigy who famously became the chess world champion in 1972. “Just look at how Fischer lived his life before insanity,” said Niemann. “That’s the right way to do it, right? Before things went haywire, the way that he approached the game was absolutely inspiring. He was working entirely alone, he had a set regimen, and he was in great physical shape. He had no romance, no distractions. He was totally focused. And it paid dividends.” This 19-year-old brat: could he be the new Bobby Fischer? Carlsen, for one, didn’t think so. He hadn’t accused Niemann of wrongdoing by tweeting his goodbye to the Sinquefield Cup with that José Mourinho clip. At the same time, it was clear that he was implying it. But what point was Carlsen making, exactly? That Niemann had beaten him thanks to cheating? In a live stream on Twitch, the American top grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura was the first to say what Carlsen had only suggested while discussing the tournament’s fourth round, particularly Carlsen’s withdrawal. Nakamura had been streaming chess for four years (more about that in Chapter 10), was one of the biggest chess streamers in the world, with more than a million followers on Twitch and a million and a half subscribers on YouTube. When he talks—whether it’s about his games, a brewing scandal, or sushi—the world listens. Nakamura said, “I think Magnus believes that Hans probably is cheating.” Magnus Carlsen, left, and Hans Niemann, right, during their fateful game in the third round of the 2022 Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. While the scandal was getting bigger by the day inside the chess world, it soon became clear that it was rippling out into the mainstream media too. On Tuesday, September 20, 15 days after Carlsen’s tweet, one of the editors of the Dutch comedy radio show Spijkers met Koppen contacted me via a DM on Twitter (now called X). Would I be interested in talking about the chess cheating scandal in their next show? Four days later, I found myself in the studio in front of a live audience. More media would reach out to me in the days to come, something that hadn’t happened to me in over 16 years of covering chess. I realized how big this story was. Poker player Robbi Jade Lew was suspected of foul play after winning a $269,000 hand against poker pro Garrett Adelstein on an episode of the popular YouTube show Hustler Casino Live. She denied the allegations and an investigation into the matter concluded with no findings of wrongdoing. Two fishermen seeking a $29,000 first prize were disqualified from the Lake Erie Walleye Trail tournament after their fish turned out to be stuffed with lead weights. Both of these events happened in the fall of 2022 but neither got nearly as much media coverage as the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Why was that? One reason was because it was chess—the ancient, intelligent and highly respected board game had suddenly been connected to something as shady as cheating. Apart from that, there was the often thought-provoking communication (or lack thereof) by the main protagonists, and the endless speculation by fans, experts, and so-called experts. Oh, and then there was Elon Musk. Elon Musk and the Anal Beads The 30-year-old Canadian grandmaster and streamer Eric Hansen involuntarily played a crucial role in the story. In one of his streams in September 2022, viewers asked the question on everyone’s mind: how do you cheat over the board at a top tournament? Hansen said he didn’t know and mentioned the strict anti-cheating measures at the Saint Louis Chess Club. And then, it happened. A question popped up in the chat that would ultimately be the primary catalyst for this brewing scandal to explode into a global media frenzy. The subscriber asked: “What if he was hiding something in his butt?” Without hesitating, Hansen responded in his stream: “That’s probably a good one. An anal bead would probably beat the thing, the engine. I don’t know.” Later, Hansen would say he was joking, but the genie was out of the bottle. A theory was born: Niemann could have hidden something up his rectum, a device small enough to fit in that place where the sun doesn’t shine, but sophisticated enough to be connected to a chess engine and vibrate the information needed to make very strong chess moves. Really? Hansen’s theory would probably have been quickly forgotten if it hadn’t been picked up by none other than Elon Musk, the world-famous business magnate. Musk came across the anal bead theory and retweeted it to his 110 million followers on Twitter. With his retweet, Musk commented: “Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one sees (cause it’s in ur butt):—Schopenhauer.” He then also tweeted a screenshot from a lengthy comment on Reddit with the bizarre claim that Carlsen(!) had played with anal beads for years, and wrote in that tweet: “My version of Occam’s Razor: most entertaining outcome is most likely …” Musk followed up: “You can almost hear that snap of the rubber glove before chess match cavity searches.” It was thanks to these tweets (which were deleted a few weeks later, around the time Musk was completing his takeover of Twitter) that just about every single mainstream newspaper, magazine, TV and radio show, blog, or podcast in almost the entire Western world would, at one point or another, cover the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Popular non-chess streamers were picking up the story, such as Charlie White Jr., a.k.a. penguinz0, who at the time had over 11 million subscribers on YouTube. It was also discussed on The Joe Rogan Experience, the most popular podcast worldwide in 2022. Everyone was talking about it. Trevor Noah joked on The Daily Show: “I get why someone would use vibrating anal beads to cheat. Because, even if you lose, you still kind of win, you know?” In the same week, The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert briefly covered the story as well, and, in December, it featured on Saturday Night Live. On January 23, 2023, Niemann appeared as an answer on Jeopardy!—to “His name signifies ‘newcomer,’ and this relative newcomer sparked accusations of cheating after a 2022 upset of champ Magnus Carlsen.” In June 2023 an episode of the sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia starring Danny DeVito was entirely inspired by the saga. And in May 2024, the American film industry’s news website Hollywood Reporter announced plans for a movie titled Checkmate about Carlsen–Niemann with Nathan Fielder as director and Emma Stone as co-producer. It will be based on a 12-page book proposal from Ben Mezrich, the author of books adapted into films such as The Social Network and Dumb Money. Meanwhile, the chess world remained divided into two camps. While many held up the presumption of innocence and believed Niemann should be left alone until proven guilty, a majority was willing to give Carlsen the benefit of the doubt. The world champion had a flawless record of sportsmanship throughout his career and was known to be brutally honest and often self-critical. The army of Carlsen believers grew fast due to interviews Niemann gave in the official Sinquefield Cup broadcast. It seemed he had expected Carlsen to play a defense he hadn’t used in years, and Niemann’s explanation wasn’t all too convincing: “By some miracle, I had checked this today. It was such a ridiculous miracle that I don’t even remember why I checked it.” The French top grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave gave a very sensible comment after round five of the St. Louis tournament: “[Given] the information I have until now, I would say: no cheating. But then, of course, Magnus is also not known for going on witch-hunts and stuff like that. Maybe he has solid arguments, but I would like to see them.” Garry Kasparov, a member of the board of the Grand Chess Tour, of which the Sinquefield Cup was part, chimed in on Twitter: “Carlsen’s withdrawal was a blow to chess fans, his colleagues at the tournament, the organizers, and, as the rumors and negative publicity swirl in a vacuum, to the game. The world title has its responsibilities, and a public statement is the least of them here.” In an interview conducted a few weeks later, Kasparov was even more critical of his successor: “I think his behaviour was unacceptable.” Niemann Admits to Online Cheating It was after the fifth round when Niemann first commented about Carlsen’s hidden allegation. He gave a long monologue in defense of himself, addressing all the topics discussed on social media and elsewhere, one by one. It was one of the most extraordinary interviews given by a chess player. Why? Because he suddenly admitted to cheating, live, on camera. “When I was 12 years old, I was with a friend, and I was playing Titled Tuesday,” Niemann started, referring to a well-known weekly blitz tournament on Chess.com, where only players with a title (such as grandmasters or international masters) can play. He revealed that, while playing, his friend was feeding him moves based on a chess engine running on an iPad. “I was a child; I had no idea what happened,” he said. “This happened once in an online tournament. I was just a child, and nothing happened then. Now, four years later, when I was 16 years old during my streaming career, in an absolutely ridiculous mistake, in an unrated game.… Other than that, after I was 12, I have never, ever in my life cheated in an over-the-board game, in an online tournament. They were unrated games, and I’m admitting this.” Although he was emphasizing the insignificance of his cheating as a minor, his revelation showed what, for many, was a key aspect of the story: that Niemann had been willing to cheat. Suddenly it was easier to believe he could have done it again, perhaps even over the board—which was the opposite of what he wanted to achieve. After apologizing several times, saying he was “deeply ashamed” about his online cheating, Niemann launched a direct attack on Chess.com, the biggest among several online chess platforms. He revealed that he had received an email saying that the company had privately removed access to his account and that he had been uninvited from Chess.com’s Global Chess Championship (GCC). This $1 million series of online top events had started earlier in the year with online qualifiers and had reached the stage where top grandmasters were added to the field on an invitation basis. Niemann had personally been invited by Chess.com’s “Chief Chess Officer” (CCO) Danny Rensch a month earlier, so being removed shocked Niemann: “Right when I beat Magnus, they decide to remove my account and not let me play in the tournaments. This is absolutely ridiculous, and they’ve only done this because of what Magnus has said, what Hikaru says, and the entire social media and chess world is completely attacking me and undermining me.” In the end, Niemann said that the whole affair fueled him. He now wanted to win the tournament even more, even if demonstrating he was not using a device meant he had to play without clothes: “If they want me to strip fully naked, I’ll do it. I don’t care because I know that I’m clean, and I’m willing to subject myself.’ As there was a certain charm in the way Niemann expressed himself, the chess world still wasn’t sure what to believe. Perhaps there was only one way to find out, as the top American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana jokingly tweeted: “New chess format concept in light of recent controversy: The Speedo Speed Chess Championship. Thoughts?” Shortly after Niemann’s interviews, Chess.com came out with a statement signed by CCO Danny Rensch. It said the company had privately contacted Niemann to explain their decision to remove him from Chess.com and their events. The key part of the statement read: “We have shared detailed evidence with him concerning our decision, including information that contradicts his statements regarding the amount and seriousness of his cheating on Chess.com.” Did that mean Niemann had cheated more often than he had admitted to, and perhaps in more important games than he suggested? These questions remained unanswered for a while, and things calmed down somewhat during the second half of the tournament, where Niemann finished with three draws and two losses in the remaining rounds. Niemann wasn’t without supporters during this time. At the start of the eighth round, four young ladies were seen outside the Saint Louis Chess Club entrance on Maryland Avenue. They had come to cheer for Niemann and were holding up signs that said: “We LOVE Hans!,” “Gen Z’s LOVE Hans!,” “Hans Has Cool Hair” and “Hans Has an Awesome Accent.” More authoritative support came from Kenneth Regan in the Wall Street Journal. As an associate professor at the University at Buffalo, Regan has advised FIDE on anti-cheating matters for two decades, using an algorithm for statistical tests to identify computer-assisted chess cheating. Regan had looked at Niemann’s games and found nothing unusual. After the tournament ended, the debate continued on social media, where all kinds of theories were suggested regarding Niemann’s potential cheating in over-the-board play. Among these, some people claimed to have found strong evidence in some of Niemann’s games of him playing a suspiciously high number of moves approved by computer engines. Others pointed out methodological flaws in the research of these armchair statisticians. However, one analysis of Niemann’s games came with an authority that was hard to ignore. When a former world number two and the 2018 world championship challenger says something about chess, you take it seriously. In his newly launched C-Squared Podcast, Caruana commented on one game Niemann had played in 2022: “This game, to me, is quite extraordinary. It’s either the game of a genius or something fishy.” Carlsen Resigns It’s Monday, September 19, 2022, 10:00 a.m. on the West Coast of America; 7:00 p.m. in central Europe. The sixth round of the Julius Baer Generation Cup is about to start. The online tournament involves 16 strong grandmasters of different generations and is the seventh event in the $1.6 million Meltwater Champions Chess Tour. Fate has it that Carlsen is paired with Niemann on this day, and fans are on the edge of their seats. The online broadcast shows a big chessboard on the left of the screen and the faces of Niemann and Carlsen through their webcams. The renowned Hungarian commentator and former top grandmaster Peter Leko starts providing energetic commentary from the get-go: “D4. Because this is his main move. Knight f6, c4. Yeah, definitely. And … WHAT? No …” Co-commentator and international master Tania Sachdev of India quietly says, “What happened?” before she utters a loud “WHAT?” With the commentators still in disbelief, Carlsen turns off his webcam. It turns out he has resigned the game after making his first move, making it clear that he doesn’t want to play a game of chess against Hans Niemann. It’s a matter of principle. For the second time in a month, the world champion has shocked the chess world. This time, the reactions were less sympathetic toward the world champion. While some pointed out that he was affecting other players in the tournament by giving his opponent a free point, others demanded that Carlsen issue a statement. “It looks like he is clearly insinuating something, but until you catch someone, you cannot do anything,” said the Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, who was also competing in the tournament. “It just looks very odd now. Clearly, it all makes sense if, supposedly, Hans is cheating and he doesn’t want to play him. But if he isn’t, then it is really very wrong.” While FIDE refrained from commenting publicly, its president Arkady Dvorkovich issued a “personal statement” (though he used the first person plural) on September 23. It was openly critical of Carlsen’s decisions to withdraw from one tournament and resign after one move in another: “We strongly believe that the world champion has a moral responsibility attached to his status since he is viewed as a global ambassador of the game,” wrote Dvorkovich. “His actions impact the reputation of his colleagues, sportive results, and eventually can be damaging to our game. We strongly believe that there were better ways to handle this situation.” The president also noted that FIDE shared Carlsen’s “deep concerns about the damage that cheating brings to chess” and announced that it would task its Fair Play Commission with a thorough investigation. About a week later FIDE announced on its website that an investigatory panel had been formed to investigate the Carlsen–Niemann situation. On September 27, three weeks into the affair, Carlsen finally published a much-anticipated statement. He said he was as “frustrated” about the situation as the chess community. For the first time, he used the c-word, finally becoming more concrete after that mysterious Mourinho tweet he sent on September 5: “I believe that Niemann has cheated more—and more recently—than he has publicly admitted. His over-the-board progress has been unusual, and throughout our game in the Sinquefield Cup I had the impression that he wasn’t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as Black in a way I think only a handful of players can do. This game contributed to changing my perspective.” Carlsen’s remarks about Niemann’s demeanor during their game didn’t seem convincing, if only because, according to the experts, he hadn’t played his best chess himself in the encounter. At the same time, the biggest question remained unanswered: did the world champion possess hard evidence that showed Niemann had cheated? Carlsen’s use of language was obviously restricted for legal reasons when he wrote: “Unfortunately, at this time, I am limited in what I can say without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly.” Did Niemann need to give permission to get himself buried completely? The next big moment in the saga happened on October 5 when Chess.com published a 72-page document titled “Hans Niemann Report” on its website, signed off by CEO Erik Allebest, CCO Danny Rensch, and the company’s Fair Play team. The report had been shared with the Wall Street Journal shortly before publication and, on the face of it, dealt Niemann a heavy blow as the revelations seemed quite damaging. The company claimed he had “likely cheated in more than 100 online chess games, including several prize money events.” Chess.com listed 11 events between 2015 and 2020, including multiple Titled Tuesday events, Speed Chess Championship Qualifiers, the PRO Chess League, and several individual matches against highly rated, well-known figures in the chess community, each pointing to multiple games where Niemann “likely cheated.” Importantly, the report noted that, contrary to Niemann’s claims in his interviews, several of the games in which he was alleged to have cheated on Chess.com were rated and played in tournaments. In Niemann’s lawsuit this claim was described as “false.” Whereas anti-cheating expert Kenneth Regan hadn’t found suspicious data in Niemann’s over-the-board games, he agreed with Chess.com on their conclusions of Niemann’s online play. Chess.com’s tools to detect cheating are specifically intended for looking at online chess with fast time controls, so it was somewhat surprising that their report also discussed Niemann’s sharp increase in playing strength in over-the-board chess. This part of their report was mostly criticized afterward (for instance, it was pointed out that the Armenian American grandmaster Levon Aronian had shown similar progress as a teenager) and did not always coincide with Ken Regan’s conclusions regarding Niemann’s over-the-board play. But the Chess.com report was applauded almost universally for one thing: for the first time, the company allowed a peek into their anti-cheating kitchen. In order not to make it easier for future cheaters, the company couldn’t go into detail, but they did enlighten the chess world: The basic concept of cheat detection, particularly at the top level of chess, is both statistical and manual, involving: comparing the moves made to engine recommended moves, removing some moves (opening, some endgame), focusing on key/critical moves, discussing with a panel of trained analysts and strong players, comparing player past performance and known strength profile, comparing a player’s performance to performances of comparable peers, looking at the statistical significance of the results (ex. “one in a million chance of happening naturally”), looking at if there are behavioral factors at play (ex. “browser behavior”), and reviewing time usage when compared to the difficulty of the moves on the board. Other chess platforms also use some of these methods, but there are differences. Lichess, Chess.com’s biggest rival in the online chess market, published a blog post in August 2022 pointing out that they use different kinds of AI, including a neural network that detects “suspicious patterns in online play, and crucially doesn’t need to do an engine analysis on a sample of games to spot those patterns.” In suspicious but not clear-cut cases, games are sent for further review by human moderators. Online cheating is becoming increasingly problematic. In 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, over-the-board chess was impossible but online chess grew enormously, and so did cheating. In their report, Chess.com noted that over the course of more than 15 years of their existence, they had “closed the accounts of many non-professional online players, hundreds of titled players, dozens of GMs.” They had elicited cheating confessions from over 300 players, four of whom were in the FIDE top 100. In blog posts from September 2020 and February 2024, Chess.com revealed more numbers. Where, monthly, between five and six thousand players were banned from Chess.com in 2019, about 17,000 were banned in August 2020 alone. By the end of 2022 roughly 600,000 accounts had been closed. Lichess, back then about eight times smaller than Chess.com, had flagged more than 61,000 accounts around that time for using illegal external assistance, as noted in their “End of Year Update 2022.” In 2023 alone, after it had witnessed a significant growth in members, Chess.com closed just over a million of its 60 million active accounts. The company averaged more than 2,700 closures per day for engine use and another 258 closures per day for other types of fair play violations. Of these closed accounts, 89 belonged to titled players, including 11 grandmasters. Early in the pandemic, Chess.com hired three new employees to their Fair Play team that now consisted of a total of nine full-time employees: three statisticians, four cheat detectives, and two titled-player manual review experts. Three and a half years later, the team had grown to 17 members. The Australian grandmaster and scientist David Smerdon, whom we met in Chapter 3, conducted an online survey in 2020 with about a thousand respondents: anonymous chess players of different levels who provided information about cheating. One of the most striking results was that about one-fifth of the respondents admitted that they had cheated at some point in their lives. Two-thirds of those who admitted to cheating had used chess engines; the others found help in books or friends. The good news was that it only happened once in most cases, as most of them felt awful afterward. Also, if Chess.com caught them and gave them a second chance, the incidence of reoffending was very low. From this survey, the number of elite professional players who repeatedly cheated was just a fraction of 1 percent. While the methods used today to cheat are new (and even newer methods are likely to appear), cheating itself has a long and sorry history in chess. Before we wrap up the Carlsen–Niemann case, let’s first dive into this fascinating history. A Brief History of Cheating in Chess In the spring of 1770, the 36-year-old Austrian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen made a special appearance at Maria Theresa’s court in Vienna. The Habsburg empress and her entourage were eagerly awaiting a spectacle they had been promised six months earlier, and they were not disappointed. What Von Kempelen showed them that day would make an indelible impression and amaze audiences for decades to come. Tom Standage set the scene in his 2002 book The Turk: “When Maria Theresa indicated that he could begin, Kempelen brought his automaton in from a side room and wheeled it forward for closer scrutiny. It consisted of a wooden cabinet, behind which was seated a life-size figure of a man, made of carved wood, wearing an ermine-trimmed robe, loose trousers, and a turban—the traditional costume of an oriental sorcerer.” The cabinet was about four feet (1.2 meters) long, two and a half feet (76 centimeters) deep, and three feet (91 centimeters) high, and had a large chessboard screwed on its tabletop. Von Kempelen announced that he had created the first automaton that could … play chess. Before embarking on the first game, Von Kempelen opened several doors in front of and on the side of the cabinet, which revealed all sorts of wheels, cogs, levers, and clockwork-like machinery. He also made sure that the spectators could see right through the cabinet. After this inspection, he placed a set of chess pieces on the board and found a volunteer, a courtier called Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, who would be the Mechanical Turk’s first-ever opponent. Adding to the spectacle, Von Kempelen wound up the clockwork mechanism “with a loud ratcheting sound” (Standage), something he would repeat a few times during games. The figure behind the cabinet suddenly came to life, moved its head, and made the first move with its left hand. When it attacked the opponent’s queen, it would nod its head twice, and if it put the king in check, it nodded three times. If the opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, put back the piece, and make a move of its own. This automaton could not only play chess, it could play rather well. Cobenzl was easily defeated, and so were the other opponents that day. And the Turk could do even more. At the end of the show, it entertained the crowds by solving what is known as the Knight’s Tour, a mathematical puzzle where one single knight has to make a full circuit of the whole board, visiting all 64 squares just once. Von Kempelen gave more performances at the court for many distinguished international guests and toured through Europe with his Mechanical Turk in the mid-1780s. One of its opponents in Paris was Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman. As we know, Franklin was a passionate chess player, but he stood no chance against the machine. Eventually, the Turk played and lost to Philidor, the strongest player in the world at the time. It wasn’t an easy victory for Philidor, who believed his opponent to be genuine. After Von Kempelen died in 1804, his son sold the Turk to the German musician, inventor, and showman Johann Nepomuk Maelzel. It was the start of a second career for the chess-playing automaton that would eclipse the first. The most famous opponent of the Turk under Maelzel’s care was Napoleon Bonaparte (see annotated game on page 381). The French emperor also didn’t stand much of a chance. After Maelzel died in 1838, the Turk eventually ended up in the possession of John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, who repaired it and was the last to perform public shows. The Turk was then donated to the Chinese Museum in Baltimore, where it was destroyed in a fire on July 5, 1854. How did the Turk play chess? During its lifespan of more than 80 years, many reports appeared in newspapers and magazines with both simple suggestions and elaborate theories. One of those contributions came from 27-year-old writer Edgar Allan Poe in his essay “Maelzel’s Chess Player,” published in April 1836 in Richmond’s Southern Literary Messenger. Poe had seen the Turk in action in December of the previous year in Richmond, Virginia. He was not wrong when he declared that “It is quite certain that the operations of the automaton are regulated by mind, and by nothing else.… The only question is of the manner by which human agency is brought to bear.” The secret was that a human operator had always been in control, hidden inside the cabinet, and responsible for all those strong chess moves executed by the mechanical left arm of the Turk. The machinery and clockwork behind the cabinet’s doors were fake and intended to distract the audience, and the operator could easily hide thanks to a sliding seat. Over the years, several strong players acted as operators. The strongest was probably the Viennese chess master and theoretician Johann Baptist Allgaier, who happened to be operating when the Turk faced Napoleon. An image from a 1789 book by German baron Joseph Friedrich zu Racknitz that supposedly revealed the secret behind the Mechanical Turk. All this was revealed only in 1857, when the son of the Turk’s last owner, Silas Weir Mitchell, published a series of articles titled “Last of a Veteran Chess Player” in the New York magazine Chess Monthly. More than a century later, in 1989, the accuracy of Mitchell’s account was mostly confirmed when John Gaughan, aprop builder for professional magicians and an automata collector, finished a complete reconstruction of the Turk in Los Angeles. The case of the chess-cheating automaton was finally solved. Cheating is as old as the game of chess. One of the earliest examples had deadly consequences. The story goes that the eleventh-century rulers Cnut, King of the North Sea Empire, and Ulf Jarl, the regent of Denmark and Cnut’s brother-in-law, played a game of chess. The king made a losing move and insisted on taking it back, whereupon a quarrel followed until Cnut angrily overturned the chessboard. The next morning, on Christmas Day 1026, the king ordered Ulf to be killed. A drawing from Eleanor Means Hull’s 1913 book The Northmen in Britain depicting the game of chess played between eleventh-century Danish rulers Cnut and Ulf Jarl—likely the latter’s last game. Luis Ramírez de Lucena (c. 1465–c. 1530), a Spanish player who published the oldest surviving printed book on chess, suggested a mild form of, let’s say, influencing the game to your advantage. He recommended placing your opponent with the sun in their eyes if you play by day and with the candle at their right hand if you play by night (presumably to make it harder for right-handed players to execute their moves). He added that it would be even worse for your opponent if they had just eaten and drunk freely. Before the computer became a factor, cheating in chess usually meant that a player could obtain illegal access to other forms of assistance during a game. Even at the highest level, there have been allegations that players were somehow given information during play. For instance, during the Fischer–Spassky world championship match in 1972 in Reykjavík, the Russian delegation accused the Americans of using chemical and electronic means to try to beat Spassky unfairly. In a statement prepared independently from Spassky, they inquired about the lighting in the playing hall and Fischer’s chair. The organizers brought in a chemist and an electronics engineer and had the chairs of both players X-rayed, but found nothing. Inside the lamps, all that could be found were two dead flies. Writing for the New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg noted that some people suggested dissecting the flies: “Did they die a natural death? Or had an American death ray put an end to them? Or was their death a result of tasting the Poisoned Pawn Sicilian?” In the next World Chess Championship match, which took place in 1978 in Baguio City in the Philippines, cheating allegations went a step further. The backdrop of the Cold War played a role once again. Soviet representative Anatoly Karpov, who ultimately won the match, faced Viktor Korchnoi, an enemy of the Soviet state since he had defected in 1976 to become a Swiss citizen. This title match is mainly remembered for the many scandals surrounding it, which is a pity because the chess played was fantastic. But we must stay true to our theme, so there’s no way not to talk about Dr. Zukhar and a cup of blueberry yogurt. Viktor Korchnoi, left, and Anatoly Karpov, right, playing their world championship match in July 1978 in Baguio, Philippines. After the first game, Korchnoi filed an official complaint that members of Karpov’s team had handed the 12th World Chess Champion yogurt during play. According to the rules, contact between Karpov and anyone in the auditorium was forbidden during games. The Soviet press officer called it “a storm in a yogurt cup.” Still, the chief arbiter took a measure: from now on, the yogurt could only be handed to Karpov at a specific time to avoid any suggestions that it could be a means of communication. Korchnoi was never wholly reassured. After the match, he wrote, “I noticed that after this ‘yogurt,’ Karpov would often start playing like a machine gun! It wouldn’t have been a bad thing to take away this ‘yogurt’ for chemical analysis.” I am not sure if Karpov ever bothered to respond to this bizarre suggestion of doping. And then there was the infamous psychologist Vladimir Zukhar, part of Karpov’s team. Zukhar suddenly appeared in the playing hall in Baguio during the fourth game, where he sat still near the stage for hours, staring directly at Korchnoi. The Korchnoi team imagined him a parapsychologist attempting hypnosis but failed to have Zukhar removed. Korchnoi then brought his own psychologist, but only for a few days before reaching a compromise: Zukhar would sit elsewhere in the hall while Korchnoi would get rid of the reflective sunglasses he had been wearing. A few days later, Korchnoi brought two volunteer assistants, yoga practitioners who sat down in the playing hall in lotus postures, to counter any influence Zukhar might still radiate. Of course, the Soviet team protested, and soon the two yogis were barred from the playing hall. Cheating in chess reached a whole new level after the appearance of the chess computer—the actual Mechanical Turk without a hidden human being inside. The first example occurred in August 1980, in the Alsterdorfer Sports Hall in Hamburg, Germany. The German grandmaster Dr. Helmut Pfleger, a popular commentator on national television, gave a simultaneous exhibition but wasn’t aware that, in this simul, not all of his 26 opponents were human. Three participants were “simultaneously” participating in a scientific experiment, where they were helped by computers that could play chess—a fairly new development at the time. Someone holding binoculars observed the boards and pieces from a vantage point above the tournament hall. The moves were fed to three chess computers, and they were communicated back to the accomplices in the simul (two women, one man), who all had hair long enough to hide microphones and wireless receivers. As they kept their poker faces while making their moves, Pfleger had no idea what was happening. One of the three computers managed to beat the grandmaster. It was actually thousands of miles away, because that particular game was being communicated by telephone to Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, where Ken Thompson was feeding his chess program Belle the moves and sending its answers back to Hamburg. After the event was over and Pfleger was informed of the trickery, he laughed and said, “I’m really surprised. These things are now playing quite well!” We know from Chapter 5 that Kasparov considered his loss to Deep Blue in 1997 as less than fair and square. When speaking to the press about the infamous second game, Kasparov did something quite similar to what Magnus Carlsen would do a quarter of a century later: he accused his opponent of cheating without accusing it of cheating. In this case, it was also the exact opposite of what happened in the Carlsen–Niemann case. Instead of suspecting the help of a computer, Kasparov suggested the computer had received human intervention. In his opinion, Deep Blue had made moves that were too “uncomputerlike.” Kasparov used a soccer reference 25 years before Carlsen would do the same: “It reminds me of the famous goal which Maradona scored against England in 1986. He said it was the ‘hand of God.’ ” As chess computer programs became stronger and stronger, it was only a matter of time before we saw players who couldn’t resist the temptation of a little help from my silicon friend—especially once the advent of the Pocket PC and the smartphone allowed them to have a chess computer in their trousers. An early case occurred in 2006 when an amateur player was caught playing with a device called a Phonito, a wireless receiver used for undetected communication, at the World Open in Philadelphia. As he refused to be searched, the organizers banned him from the tournament. Actual proof of cheating did not surface, but the circumstances were enough for the organizers to take measures. An interesting side story is that the manufacturer of the Phonito was the Swiss hearing aid producer Phonak, which was sponsoring Floyd Landis and his cycling team at the time. By coincidence, Phonak was unwittingly caught up in a similar scandal when the American cyclist, who won the Tour de France that year, was disqualified after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Landis had been a former teammate of the even more famous Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist who was stripped of seven consecutive Tour de France victories when an investigation found that he had doped throughout his career. Cheating with a chess engine during a game has been compared with doping countless times. A better comparison unfolded in early 2016 at the Cyclo-cross World Championships in Zolder, Belgium. A concealed motor was discovered inside the frame of Belgian racer Femke van den Driessche’s bike. “It wasn’t my bike—it was that of a friend and was identical to mine,” Van den Driessche said in tears, but that didn’t prevent her from becoming the first cyclist to be officially charged with mechanical doping. The year 2006 witnessed a more famous cheating story, even though it never went beyond accusations and actual proof never surfaced. After he was accused himself a year before, the Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov, through his manager Silvio Danailov, accused Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during their world championship match. Why? Because Kramnik went to the restroom literally dozens of times during games. The Bulgarians felt that was suspicious, while Kramnik categorically denied any wrongdoing. The scandal rocked the chess world, where it was quickly named “Toiletgate.” Years later, I heard a sensible explanation: Kramnik probably visited the restroom to smoke. He had promised his soon-to-be wife that he would quit smoking, but wasn’t succeeding yet. Over the years, I must have written at least a dozen articles about players, from amateurs to grandmasters, who were caught cheating by using a phone during a game. Most stories stayed within the chess scene, but one was different: large mainstream media coverage went to the story about the 58-year-old Latvian-Czech grandmaster Igors Rausis. That was in 2019, when the chess world learned two things. First, there was a new, high-profile cheating case. Second, a picture is worth a thousand words. Rausis, who had raised suspicion for years after scoring unnaturally good results for a player his age, was caught cheating in July 2019 at a tournament in Strasbourg, France. The whole world got to see how, as one of the participants followed him to the restroom and took a photo from above, over the edge of Rausis’s cubicle. The photo was then posted to social media and went viral. Soon, the story was everywhere, from the Washington Post to the Daily Mail and China Daily. The photo showed Rausis sat on the toilet seat with the lid closed, his pants on (making it slightly less embarrassing), holding a smartphone in his hands. His left leg rested on his right knee, with his trousers rolled up above the knee, revealing a large cloth bandage circling his lower leg. You could imagine it being used to hold a small device, and Rausis looking at his phone said it all. There can’t possibly be a clearer case of being caught red-handed. At the end of 2019, the FIDE Ethics and Disciplinary Commission dished out the strongest cheating punishment to date: Rausis was banned for six years and stripped of his grandmaster title. I did not publish my news report before contacting Rausis. I spoke to him the day after he got caught, and he informed me of the end of his chess career: “I simply lost my mind yesterday.… At least what I committed yesterday is a good lesson, not for me—I played my last game of chess already.” However, he couldn’t resist returning to the arena. In October 2020, Rausis appeared at a small rapid tournament in Latvia, playing under a new name. You couldn’t make this up. Rausis told me that he hadn’t changed his name so that he could play chess again but because he was embarrassed over the widely published and unflattering picture (the internet doesn’t forget). Apart from his old name being forever linked to the photo, he said he’d also changed his name because he felt ashamed for his family. He was now using the surname of his ex-wife, with whom he was still on good terms. Rausis died at the end of March 2024, after struggling with a serious illness for two decades. In the reactions to his death, statements such as “great chess player” and “friendly personality” predominated. Cheaters are human beings too. My Lawsuit Speaks for Itself On October 20, 2022, the Carlsen–Niemann saga entered a new chapter when Niemann started a major counterattack. On Twitter (now X), he shared a link to a 44-page legal document and wrote, “My lawsuit speaks for itself.” He was going to court. Niemann filed a defamation lawsuit in the Eastern Missouri District Court against five entities: the players Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the companies Chess.com and Play Magnus Group, and Chess.com’s CCO Danny Rensch. The Play Magnus Group, a conglomerate of several small chess companies co-owned by the Carlsen family, would be acquired by Chess.com just two months later, while the lawsuit was still underway. Niemann demanded $100 million in damages from each party as he was claiming slander, libel, unlawful group boycott under the Sherman Act, tortious interference with contract and business expectancies, and civil conspiracy. Niemann stated that Carlsen, Nakamura, Chess.com, Play Magnus Group, and Rensch had been “egregiously defaming him and unlawfully colluding to blacklist him from the profession to which he has dedicated his life,” and that the whole situation had caused “devastating damages.” Regarding the alleged collusion, Niemann’s lawyers pointed for instance at Carlsen and Chess.com, referencing Chess.com’s planned takeover of Play Magnus. Their legal document noted that Chess.com’s decision to ban Niemann from their site right after Carlsen had accused Niemann of cheating “added instant credibility to Carlsen’s false allegations and suggested that they were true.” However, when I spoke to him for this book, Rensch told me personally that he had advised Carlsen not to withdraw from the Sinquefield Cup, and while Carlsen’s father and manager Henrik thanked him for the message, they decided to go down that path anyway. On June 27, 2023, a federal judge dismissed Niemann’s lawsuit. Initially, his attorneys intended to pursue the defamation claim, among others, in state court. However, by August 28 it became clear that the hatchet had been buried: Chess.com issued a statement that noted the legal dispute was concluded, and Niemann’s account on the site was reinstated. Without giving details of the settlement, the site noted: “Since June, both sides have negotiated privately in a good-faith effort to resolve their issues and allow the chess world to move forward without further litigation. We are happy to share that all sides have reached an agreement.” The text included statements from the two main characters. Carlsen admitted that “there is no determinative evidence that Niemann cheated in his game against me at the Sinquefield Cup.” Niemann said, “I look forward to competing against Magnus in chess rather than in court.” “We are literally not allowed to talk about it,” Danny Rensch told me. “We prefer to call it ‘an agreement to move on.’ Basically, Hans wanted back on Chess.com. Magnus wanted the whole thing to get behind him, and he knew the only way to do that was to agree to move forward. Chess.com acknowledged that it no longer had any evidence to justify a continued closure other than what we had already acted on, and so we all agreed to take our marbles and go home.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal directly affected the chess world in that some of the top tournaments in 2023, both online and over-the-board, increased their anti-cheating measures. It has since become standard almost everywhere that players are scanned with a metal detector before games. As well as being forbidden from carrying phones, they are also no longer allowed to wear a watch, whether it’s analog, digital, or a smartwatch. Spectators are no longer allowed to use phones in the playing hall either. In online events, players need to provide signals from multiple webcams, while there can also be audio monitoring, computer task manager review, and sometimes in-person on-site proctors. Not all tournaments take enough measures, though, which can lead to unpleasant situations. On October 12, 2023, the relatively unknown Kazakh player Alisher Suleymenov, who had earned the grandmaster title earlier in the year, defeated Magnus Carlsen in a spectacular game at the Qatar Masters in Doha. “I was completely crushed in my game today,” Carlsen tweeted. “This is not to accuse my opponent of anything, who played an amazing game and deserved to win, but, honestly, as soon as I saw my opponent was wearing a watch early in the game, I lost my ability to concentrate. I obviously take responsibility for my inability to deal with those thoughts properly, but it’s also incredibly frustrating to see organizers still not taking anti-cheating seriously at all (no transmission delay, spectators walking around the playing hall with smartphones).” Suleymenov did not respond to the tweet, and when asked about the game he said Carlsen lost due to a blunder on the board. Two months later, the other main character of the 2022 cheating scandal again attracted attention, but this time more positively. Niemann scored a career-best result by clinching the Tournament of Peace in Zagreb, Croatia, winning seven games and drawing two. His performance rating was 2956, among the best shown by any player in recent decades. On X, Niemann compared himself to Bobby Fischer, who had won the same tournament 53 years earlier. Suspicions started spreading when the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten came up with a story that included a rather vague quote from one of the organizers. Kresimir Podravec, the secretary of the Zagreb Chess Federation, reportedly said, “Niemann’s result is out of this world, but we have no definite proof that he cheated.” I don’t know if Niemann ever responded to this. Meanwhile, some of his opponents in the tournament complained about the lack of sufficient anti-cheating measures in the playing hall, but a week or two later, the chess world had moved on. But paranoia continued to exist in chess circles, particularly regarding online matches. When Vladimir Kramnik lost an online game to Niemann in September 2023, the 14th World Chess Champion uploaded a video expressing his surprise about some of his opponent’s moves. In subsequent months, Kramnik launched a personal campaign about the issue of cheating online, claiming it occurs much more often than we realize and that Chess.com isn’t doing enough to fight it. In late November, Chess.com responded in a blog post: “With the deepest respect for former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, in our opinion, his accusations lack statistical merit.” When Kramnik continued to express doubts about what he considered to be suspicious players’ performances, including those of a 12-year-old prodigy, Chess.com decided he had gone too far and closed the former world champion’s account on the site for violating its terms of service. It did not stop Kramnik from continuing to share his “statistics” on X. Chess.com’s Head of Cheat Detection Gerard Le-Marechal pointed out to me some larger implications of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal and how it has recently fed paranoia at the top level. He argued that it may have emboldened people to accuse others more openly—which is not a good thing. “There’s an interesting statistic we noticed,” Le-Marechal said. “Which is that during the time of the Niemann scandal, the rate at which people reported others increased across the site, then returned to normal after it died down, potentially suggesting that the scandal encouraged people to treat their fellow chessers with more suspicion as a whole where this did not reflect in the number of cheating cases detected.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal’s final chapter arrived on December 12, 2023. Fourteen and a half months after FIDE started its investigation into the matter, its Ethics and Disciplinary Commission finally posted its long-awaited verdict on the FIDE website. Rumor had it that Carlsen might be banned from FIDE-rated tournaments for his allegations without proof, but he was ultimately found not guilty of the most important charges. The only penalty he received was a fine of €10,000 ($10,800) for “withdrawing without a valid reason” from the Sinquefield Cup. Could It Be Done? One question remains, and for that, we’re returning once more to those damn anal beads. Is it possible to cheat at chess using a vibrating device? Could it be done? The short answer is: probably, yes. But don’t take my word for it. You can find more than one video on the internet where people attempt to verify the theory by actually creating a vibrating device connected to a computer and hidden in a sex toy. The biggest among them is YouTuber Mike Boyd. His channel, which had three million subscribers in June 2024, documents the learning process of new challenges he gives himself. In a video from November 14, 2022, titled “Actually Making THAT Chess Cheat Device,” which has been viewed 2.3 million times, he did exactly the thing Elon Musk and others had joked about—a computer transmitted moves suggested by Stockfish to a vibrating anal toy connected to a receiver and transmitter. Boyd used the device (strapped on his right ankle, hidden by his trousers) to beat a friend who was a much stronger chess player—but also received many comments from viewers pointing out that his device would never get past a metal detector like those used at top-level chess tournaments. In a video posted a week later, Boyd showed that his device wasn’t so easily traceable. A metal detector started beeping when it hovered close to his watch, his smartphone in his pocket, a pocket knife, and even a two-gram scalpel blade, but remained silent when slid over the cheat device in his pocket. Only when the detector hit the spot quite fast would it produce a brief beep. Boyd’s conclusion: handheld metal detectors suck, and the thin silicon layer surrounding the electronic components was enough to bypass the detector. The fact that an anal bead could work wasn’t the biggest problem for the chess world. Boyd’s demonstration of it passing the metal detector was arguably much more damaging. That had also been demonstrated a month before in a real-life situation. That was in October 2022, at a prestigious chess event in Reykjavík. To figure out what is spotted by a metal detector and what isn’t, a Norwegian journalist arrived at the tournament with several devices attached to her body and let herself be examined. She had an earplug the size of a small grain placed right up to the eardrum. It was connected to a receiver hidden in her clothes, which could communicate with a smartwatch attached to the inside of her belt buckle. She also brought a walkie-talkie, a power bracelet, and a pair of sunglasses with earplugs. The result was alarming: while the walkie-talkie and the bracelet were revealed in the security check, the earplugs, smartwatch, and sunglasses were not. The Norwegian organizer Jøran Aulin-Jansson wasn’t too worried that players could get through the check with an electronic device, stating, “It is quite possible that they do it, but they don’t get to use it.” Ian Nepomniachtchi, one of the participants, was less comfortable: “I still don’t feel that it is safe. I heard that an NRK reporter got through. The criminals are always one step ahead.” I feel that over the last decade or so, more cheating might have occurred than we realize, especially at smaller open tournaments where organizers lack the means to enforce proper anti-cheating measures and where it’s relatively easy to bring your smartphone to the restroom. I would like to believe that I am wrong and that all chess players are good people, but, at the same time, I think FIDE has a task to help those organizers of smaller tournaments to level up their game. I also witnessed the paranoia firsthand at a tournament in Liechtenstein back in 2014, where I scored my second international master (IM) norm. In one of my games, I drew with a titled player and after the tournament, he accused me of cheating in a personal conversation: I couldn’t have played at 2400+ level with a rating of 2215. When I told him I had done it before, in a tournament in 2004, he only saw that as further proof that I wasn’t kosher. It is clear how much computers have impacted chess. The man versus machine matches, culminating in Kasparov–Deep Blue, raised the game’s profile. Ever since, computers have helped humans become stronger players. And we continued playing, even though the chess engines on our smartphones are now stronger than Deep Blue. While cheating continues to be an issue the chess world needs to deal with, my conclusion is that artificial intelligence has done more good than bad for chess overall. Plus there’s one big factor to explore, which I haven’t even mentioned yet. These days, most chess games are played between people who don’t know their opponents or where they are located. Millions of games are played daily between people across the globe, from their homes, the office, the train, or even the restroom. All this is possible thanks to the internet, an invention that seems like it was made for chess. We’ll explore the strong bond between chess and the internet next.",

As it gets close to the chewing gum, the detector blinks a red light. Niemann smiles and opens the packet, which the arbiter puts aside for a moment as he continues his search. He then switches the Garrett for a smaller radio-frequency scanner and meticulously moves down Niemann’s dark blazer and trousers, carefully checking his tanned leather shoes before going up again. This is not an airport but the entrance to a chess tournament. A pre-game check for electronic devices such as mobile phones or smartwatches—not allowed on a player’s body during gameplay—is becoming standard in top chess. This particular check, however, is taking longer than usual. The clock on the TV screen shows 12:59 p.m. in St. Louis on Monday, September 5, 2022. The fourth round of the Sinquefield Cup is about to start. The annual ten-player super-tournament, among the most prestigious on the chess calendar and backed by Missouri-based billionaire Rex Sinquefield, is being held for the ninth time. The 19-year-old Niemann, from Connecticut, is a highly talented junior chess player who made a big jump in the world rankings during the COVID-19 pandemic. But he isn’t even among the world’s top 40 players. He has no business winning this one. None-theless, Niemann is the sole leader three rounds into the event after a spectacular result the day before, when he beat none other than Magnus Carlsen (see annotated game on pages 399–400), the world champion, the 31-year-old superstar from Norway. The GOAT? Carlsen the Mighty went unbeaten for 125 games between 2019 and 2020. In 2022 he had built another impressive streak: he hadn’t suffered a single loss in his previous 53 games. Until St. Louis. With his typical, unfiltered voice, Niemann commented after their game, “It must be embarrassing for the world champion to lose to me.” At the exact moment when the arbiter finishes his security check and Niemann walks into the playing hall, Carlsen sends out a tweet that shocks the chess world. “I’ve withdrawn from the tournament. I’ve always enjoyed playing in the @STLChessClub, and hope to be back in the future,” he wrote. Wait, what? Carlsen had once prematurely left a press conference, but never before had he stepped out of a tournament. The number of times a top grandmaster has deliberately withdrawn from an ongoing tournament can be counted on the fingers of one hand. In 1967, the erratic American and future world champion Bobby Fischer left the Sousse Interzonal Tournament after a dispute with the organizers over the scheduling of his games. In 2018 the Chinese number-one player and future world champion Ding Liren was forced to withdraw from the Norway Chess tournament after he broke his hip during a fateful bicycle ride. Carlsen’s decision was something the chess world had rarely seen before. “I am sitting here in a bit of a stunned silence; I don’t really know how to react to this,” said the popular commentator and top grandmaster Peter Svidler, perplexed about this unique moment for chess. “There will be some developments, I assume,” he added. It was the understatement of the year, considering what would happen in the months ahead. Carlsen’s tweet opened a Pandora’s box of speculation, primarily because of a video clip that he had attached to it. In it, soccer manager José Mourinho said, “I prefer, really, not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble.” The clip was a well-known soccer meme from 2014, when the Portuguese trainer, then the coach of Chelsea, was interviewed following his team’s loss to Aston Villa in the English Premier League. Mourinho was furious about some of the decisions by the referee but preferred not to speak for fear of retroactive punishment from the Football Association. What Mourinho wanted to say wasn’t immediately clear at the time (although he seemed to be suggesting mistakes from the referee), so what did Carlsen, a big soccer fan himself, mean by using this meme? Speculation started instantly on social media and wouldn’t stop for weeks. Mainstream media worldwide would report on what was to become the biggest scandal chess had ever seen. Chess had hit the fan. The Chess Speaks for Itself The narrative kind of started three weeks before the Sinquefield Cup when Carlsen and Niemann played each other four times in faster games at a tournament in Miami. Niemann, the lowest seed and an outspoken and confident newcomer, had started with a surprising win against the favorite before losing the next three games and their mini-match 1–3. Asked for a summary of that first game, the American teenager replied, “The chess speaks for itself.” He walked away from the camera, ignoring the follow-up question and perplexing the interviewer. It was the chess version of dropping the mic. The phrase “speaks for itself” became a meme, instantly added to the vocabulary of chess players and fans on social media. Niemann had quickly positioned himself off the board as the Conor McGregor of chess as he spoke with a bravado that evoked both cringe and delight. He was brimming with confidence, supported by his quick rise to the top. Less than two years after earning the grandmaster title at the age of 17, he had recently entered the world’s top hundred. Niemann’s ascent was aided by the fact that he was one of the most active grandmasters in the world, having played a string of tournaments almost back-to-back in Spain, Serbia, Italy, Montenegro, the US (Las Vegas, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cherry Hill), Portugal, Serbia again, the United Arab Emirates, Latvia, Uzbekistan, and Spain again. He was a one-man band on tour, his computer was his roadie, and his Uber Eats account his stage manager. In March 2022, Niemann was a guest on the popular Perpetual Chess Podcast, where he explained his regimen: “The time that I’m investing is a minimum of ten to 12 hours a day. I’m working very hard; I don’t have much of a social life, you could say. I don’t indulge in any distractions other than chess.” He didn’t hide his ambition and confidence: “The goal is to be the best in the world. I think it’s absolutely impossible for me to fail at this point because I am really just doing everything that I need to do, and I am investing every second of every day into improving my chess.” How important chess had become for him was revealed when he said, “If I do not reach the top ten, I think I will assess my chess career as a failure. I think [then] my life is a failure as well, if you wanna get deep.” He spoke with the same intensity as that other legendary American prodigy who famously became the chess world champion in 1972. “Just look at how Fischer lived his life before insanity,” said Niemann. “That’s the right way to do it, right? Before things went haywire, the way that he approached the game was absolutely inspiring. He was working entirely alone, he had a set regimen, and he was in great physical shape. He had no romance, no distractions. He was totally focused. And it paid dividends.” This 19-year-old brat: could he be the new Bobby Fischer? Carlsen, for one, didn’t think so. He hadn’t accused Niemann of wrongdoing by tweeting his goodbye to the Sinquefield Cup with that José Mourinho clip. At the same time, it was clear that he was implying it. But what point was Carlsen making, exactly? That Niemann had beaten him thanks to cheating? In a live stream on Twitch, the American top grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura was the first to say what Carlsen had only suggested while discussing the tournament’s fourth round, particularly Carlsen’s withdrawal. Nakamura had been streaming chess for four years (more about that in Chapter 10), was one of the biggest chess streamers in the world, with more than a million followers on Twitch and a million and a half subscribers on YouTube. When he talks—whether it’s about his games, a brewing scandal, or sushi—the world listens. Nakamura said, “I think Magnus believes that Hans probably is cheating.” Magnus Carlsen, left, and Hans Niemann, right, during their fateful game in the third round of the 2022 Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. While the scandal was getting bigger by the day inside the chess world, it soon became clear that it was rippling out into the mainstream media too. On Tuesday, September 20, 15 days after Carlsen’s tweet, one of the editors of the Dutch comedy radio show Spijkers met Koppen contacted me via a DM on Twitter (now called X). Would I be interested in talking about the chess cheating scandal in their next show? Four days later, I found myself in the studio in front of a live audience. More media would reach out to me in the days to come, something that hadn’t happened to me in over 16 years of covering chess. I realized how big this story was. Poker player Robbi Jade Lew was suspected of foul play after winning a $269,000 hand against poker pro Garrett Adelstein on an episode of the popular YouTube show Hustler Casino Live. She denied the allegations and an investigation into the matter concluded with no findings of wrongdoing. Two fishermen seeking a $29,000 first prize were disqualified from the Lake Erie Walleye Trail tournament after their fish turned out to be stuffed with lead weights. Both of these events happened in the fall of 2022 but neither got nearly as much media coverage as the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Why was that? One reason was because it was chess—the ancient, intelligent and highly respected board game had suddenly been connected to something as shady as cheating. Apart from that, there was the often thought-provoking communication (or lack thereof) by the main protagonists, and the endless speculation by fans, experts, and so-called experts. Oh, and then there was Elon Musk. Elon Musk and the Anal Beads The 30-year-old Canadian grandmaster and streamer Eric Hansen involuntarily played a crucial role in the story. In one of his streams in September 2022, viewers asked the question on everyone’s mind: how do you cheat over the board at a top tournament? Hansen said he didn’t know and mentioned the strict anti-cheating measures at the Saint Louis Chess Club. And then, it happened. A question popped up in the chat that would ultimately be the primary catalyst for this brewing scandal to explode into a global media frenzy. The subscriber asked: “What if he was hiding something in his butt?” Without hesitating, Hansen responded in his stream: “That’s probably a good one. An anal bead would probably beat the thing, the engine. I don’t know.” Later, Hansen would say he was joking, but the genie was out of the bottle. A theory was born: Niemann could have hidden something up his rectum, a device small enough to fit in that place where the sun doesn’t shine, but sophisticated enough to be connected to a chess engine and vibrate the information needed to make very strong chess moves. Really? Hansen’s theory would probably have been quickly forgotten if it hadn’t been picked up by none other than Elon Musk, the world-famous business magnate. Musk came across the anal bead theory and retweeted it to his 110 million followers on Twitter. With his retweet, Musk commented: “Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one sees (cause it’s in ur butt):—Schopenhauer.” He then also tweeted a screenshot from a lengthy comment on Reddit with the bizarre claim that Carlsen(!) had played with anal beads for years, and wrote in that tweet: “My version of Occam’s Razor: most entertaining outcome is most likely …” Musk followed up: “You can almost hear that snap of the rubber glove before chess match cavity searches.” It was thanks to these tweets (which were deleted a few weeks later, around the time Musk was completing his takeover of Twitter) that just about every single mainstream newspaper, magazine, TV and radio show, blog, or podcast in almost the entire Western world would, at one point or another, cover the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Popular non-chess streamers were picking up the story, such as Charlie White Jr., a.k.a. penguinz0, who at the time had over 11 million subscribers on YouTube. It was also discussed on The Joe Rogan Experience, the most popular podcast worldwide in 2022. Everyone was talking about it. Trevor Noah joked on The Daily Show: “I get why someone would use vibrating anal beads to cheat. Because, even if you lose, you still kind of win, you know?” In the same week, The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert briefly covered the story as well, and, in December, it featured on Saturday Night Live. On January 23, 2023, Niemann appeared as an answer on Jeopardy!—to “His name signifies ‘newcomer,’ and this relative newcomer sparked accusations of cheating after a 2022 upset of champ Magnus Carlsen.” In June 2023 an episode of the sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia starring Danny DeVito was entirely inspired by the saga. And in May 2024, the American film industry’s news website Hollywood Reporter announced plans for a movie titled Checkmate about Carlsen–Niemann with Nathan Fielder as director and Emma Stone as co-producer. It will be based on a 12-page book proposal from Ben Mezrich, the author of books adapted into films such as The Social Network and Dumb Money. Meanwhile, the chess world remained divided into two camps. While many held up the presumption of innocence and believed Niemann should be left alone until proven guilty, a majority was willing to give Carlsen the benefit of the doubt. The world champion had a flawless record of sportsmanship throughout his career and was known to be brutally honest and often self-critical. The army of Carlsen believers grew fast due to interviews Niemann gave in the official Sinquefield Cup broadcast. It seemed he had expected Carlsen to play a defense he hadn’t used in years, and Niemann’s explanation wasn’t all too convincing: “By some miracle, I had checked this today. It was such a ridiculous miracle that I don’t even remember why I checked it.” The French top grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave gave a very sensible comment after round five of the St. Louis tournament: “[Given] the information I have until now, I would say: no cheating. But then, of course, Magnus is also not known for going on witch-hunts and stuff like that. Maybe he has solid arguments, but I would like to see them.” Garry Kasparov, a member of the board of the Grand Chess Tour, of which the Sinquefield Cup was part, chimed in on Twitter: “Carlsen’s withdrawal was a blow to chess fans, his colleagues at the tournament, the organizers, and, as the rumors and negative publicity swirl in a vacuum, to the game. The world title has its responsibilities, and a public statement is the least of them here.” In an interview conducted a few weeks later, Kasparov was even more critical of his successor: “I think his behaviour was unacceptable.” Niemann Admits to Online Cheating It was after the fifth round when Niemann first commented about Carlsen’s hidden allegation. He gave a long monologue in defense of himself, addressing all the topics discussed on social media and elsewhere, one by one. It was one of the most extraordinary interviews given by a chess player. Why? Because he suddenly admitted to cheating, live, on camera. “When I was 12 years old, I was with a friend, and I was playing Titled Tuesday,” Niemann started, referring to a well-known weekly blitz tournament on Chess.com, where only players with a title (such as grandmasters or international masters) can play. He revealed that, while playing, his friend was feeding him moves based on a chess engine running on an iPad. “I was a child; I had no idea what happened,” he said. “This happened once in an online tournament. I was just a child, and nothing happened then. Now, four years later, when I was 16 years old during my streaming career, in an absolutely ridiculous mistake, in an unrated game.… Other than that, after I was 12, I have never, ever in my life cheated in an over-the-board game, in an online tournament. They were unrated games, and I’m admitting this.” Although he was emphasizing the insignificance of his cheating as a minor, his revelation showed what, for many, was a key aspect of the story: that Niemann had been willing to cheat. Suddenly it was easier to believe he could have done it again, perhaps even over the board—which was the opposite of what he wanted to achieve. After apologizing several times, saying he was “deeply ashamed” about his online cheating, Niemann launched a direct attack on Chess.com, the biggest among several online chess platforms. He revealed that he had received an email saying that the company had privately removed access to his account and that he had been uninvited from Chess.com’s Global Chess Championship (GCC). This $1 million series of online top events had started earlier in the year with online qualifiers and had reached the stage where top grandmasters were added to the field on an invitation basis. Niemann had personally been invited by Chess.com’s “Chief Chess Officer” (CCO) Danny Rensch a month earlier, so being removed shocked Niemann: “Right when I beat Magnus, they decide to remove my account and not let me play in the tournaments. This is absolutely ridiculous, and they’ve only done this because of what Magnus has said, what Hikaru says, and the entire social media and chess world is completely attacking me and undermining me.” In the end, Niemann said that the whole affair fueled him. He now wanted to win the tournament even more, even if demonstrating he was not using a device meant he had to play without clothes: “If they want me to strip fully naked, I’ll do it. I don’t care because I know that I’m clean, and I’m willing to subject myself.’ As there was a certain charm in the way Niemann expressed himself, the chess world still wasn’t sure what to believe. Perhaps there was only one way to find out, as the top American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana jokingly tweeted: “New chess format concept in light of recent controversy: The Speedo Speed Chess Championship. Thoughts?” Shortly after Niemann’s interviews, Chess.com came out with a statement signed by CCO Danny Rensch. It said the company had privately contacted Niemann to explain their decision to remove him from Chess.com and their events. The key part of the statement read: “We have shared detailed evidence with him concerning our decision, including information that contradicts his statements regarding the amount and seriousness of his cheating on Chess.com.” Did that mean Niemann had cheated more often than he had admitted to, and perhaps in more important games than he suggested? These questions remained unanswered for a while, and things calmed down somewhat during the second half of the tournament, where Niemann finished with three draws and two losses in the remaining rounds. Niemann wasn’t without supporters during this time. At the start of the eighth round, four young ladies were seen outside the Saint Louis Chess Club entrance on Maryland Avenue. They had come to cheer for Niemann and were holding up signs that said: “We LOVE Hans!,” “Gen Z’s LOVE Hans!,” “Hans Has Cool Hair” and “Hans Has an Awesome Accent.” More authoritative support came from Kenneth Regan in the Wall Street Journal. As an associate professor at the University at Buffalo, Regan has advised FIDE on anti-cheating matters for two decades, using an algorithm for statistical tests to identify computer-assisted chess cheating. Regan had looked at Niemann’s games and found nothing unusual. After the tournament ended, the debate continued on social media, where all kinds of theories were suggested regarding Niemann’s potential cheating in over-the-board play. Among these, some people claimed to have found strong evidence in some of Niemann’s games of him playing a suspiciously high number of moves approved by computer engines. Others pointed out methodological flaws in the research of these armchair statisticians. However, one analysis of Niemann’s games came with an authority that was hard to ignore. When a former world number two and the 2018 world championship challenger says something about chess, you take it seriously. In his newly launched C-Squared Podcast, Caruana commented on one game Niemann had played in 2022: “This game, to me, is quite extraordinary. It’s either the game of a genius or something fishy.” Carlsen Resigns It’s Monday, September 19, 2022, 10:00 a.m. on the West Coast of America; 7:00 p.m. in central Europe. The sixth round of the Julius Baer Generation Cup is about to start. The online tournament involves 16 strong grandmasters of different generations and is the seventh event in the $1.6 million Meltwater Champions Chess Tour. Fate has it that Carlsen is paired with Niemann on this day, and fans are on the edge of their seats. The online broadcast shows a big chessboard on the left of the screen and the faces of Niemann and Carlsen through their webcams. The renowned Hungarian commentator and former top grandmaster Peter Leko starts providing energetic commentary from the get-go: “D4. Because this is his main move. Knight f6, c4. Yeah, definitely. And … WHAT? No …” Co-commentator and international master Tania Sachdev of India quietly says, “What happened?” before she utters a loud “WHAT?” With the commentators still in disbelief, Carlsen turns off his webcam. It turns out he has resigned the game after making his first move, making it clear that he doesn’t want to play a game of chess against Hans Niemann. It’s a matter of principle. For the second time in a month, the world champion has shocked the chess world. This time, the reactions were less sympathetic toward the world champion. While some pointed out that he was affecting other players in the tournament by giving his opponent a free point, others demanded that Carlsen issue a statement. “It looks like he is clearly insinuating something, but until you catch someone, you cannot do anything,” said the Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, who was also competing in the tournament. “It just looks very odd now. Clearly, it all makes sense if, supposedly, Hans is cheating and he doesn’t want to play him. But if he isn’t, then it is really very wrong.” While FIDE refrained from commenting publicly, its president Arkady Dvorkovich issued a “personal statement” (though he used the first person plural) on September 23. It was openly critical of Carlsen’s decisions to withdraw from one tournament and resign after one move in another: “We strongly believe that the world champion has a moral responsibility attached to his status since he is viewed as a global ambassador of the game,” wrote Dvorkovich. “His actions impact the reputation of his colleagues, sportive results, and eventually can be damaging to our game. We strongly believe that there were better ways to handle this situation.” The president also noted that FIDE shared Carlsen’s “deep concerns about the damage that cheating brings to chess” and announced that it would task its Fair Play Commission with a thorough investigation. About a week later FIDE announced on its website that an investigatory panel had been formed to investigate the Carlsen–Niemann situation. On September 27, three weeks into the affair, Carlsen finally published a much-anticipated statement. He said he was as “frustrated” about the situation as the chess community. For the first time, he used the c-word, finally becoming more concrete after that mysterious Mourinho tweet he sent on September 5: “I believe that Niemann has cheated more—and more recently—than he has publicly admitted. His over-the-board progress has been unusual, and throughout our game in the Sinquefield Cup I had the impression that he wasn’t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as Black in a way I think only a handful of players can do. This game contributed to changing my perspective.” Carlsen’s remarks about Niemann’s demeanor during their game didn’t seem convincing, if only because, according to the experts, he hadn’t played his best chess himself in the encounter. At the same time, the biggest question remained unanswered: did the world champion possess hard evidence that showed Niemann had cheated? Carlsen’s use of language was obviously restricted for legal reasons when he wrote: “Unfortunately, at this time, I am limited in what I can say without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly.” Did Niemann need to give permission to get himself buried completely? The next big moment in the saga happened on October 5 when Chess.com published a 72-page document titled “Hans Niemann Report” on its website, signed off by CEO Erik Allebest, CCO Danny Rensch, and the company’s Fair Play team. The report had been shared with the Wall Street Journal shortly before publication and, on the face of it, dealt Niemann a heavy blow as the revelations seemed quite damaging. The company claimed he had “likely cheated in more than 100 online chess games, including several prize money events.” Chess.com listed 11 events between 2015 and 2020, including multiple Titled Tuesday events, Speed Chess Championship Qualifiers, the PRO Chess League, and several individual matches against highly rated, well-known figures in the chess community, each pointing to multiple games where Niemann “likely cheated.” Importantly, the report noted that, contrary to Niemann’s claims in his interviews, several of the games in which he was alleged to have cheated on Chess.com were rated and played in tournaments. In Niemann’s lawsuit this claim was described as “false.” Whereas anti-cheating expert Kenneth Regan hadn’t found suspicious data in Niemann’s over-the-board games, he agreed with Chess.com on their conclusions of Niemann’s online play. Chess.com’s tools to detect cheating are specifically intended for looking at online chess with fast time controls, so it was somewhat surprising that their report also discussed Niemann’s sharp increase in playing strength in over-the-board chess. This part of their report was mostly criticized afterward (for instance, it was pointed out that the Armenian American grandmaster Levon Aronian had shown similar progress as a teenager) and did not always coincide with Ken Regan’s conclusions regarding Niemann’s over-the-board play. But the Chess.com report was applauded almost universally for one thing: for the first time, the company allowed a peek into their anti-cheating kitchen. In order not to make it easier for future cheaters, the company couldn’t go into detail, but they did enlighten the chess world: The basic concept of cheat detection, particularly at the top level of chess, is both statistical and manual, involving: comparing the moves made to engine recommended moves, removing some moves (opening, some endgame), focusing on key/critical moves, discussing with a panel of trained analysts and strong players, comparing player past performance and known strength profile, comparing a player’s performance to performances of comparable peers, looking at the statistical significance of the results (ex. “one in a million chance of happening naturally”), looking at if there are behavioral factors at play (ex. “browser behavior”), and reviewing time usage when compared to the difficulty of the moves on the board. Other chess platforms also use some of these methods, but there are differences. Lichess, Chess.com’s biggest rival in the online chess market, published a blog post in August 2022 pointing out that they use different kinds of AI, including a neural network that detects “suspicious patterns in online play, and crucially doesn’t need to do an engine analysis on a sample of games to spot those patterns.” In suspicious but not clear-cut cases, games are sent for further review by human moderators. Online cheating is becoming increasingly problematic. In 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, over-the-board chess was impossible but online chess grew enormously, and so did cheating. In their report, Chess.com noted that over the course of more than 15 years of their existence, they had “closed the accounts of many non-professional online players, hundreds of titled players, dozens of GMs.” They had elicited cheating confessions from over 300 players, four of whom were in the FIDE top 100. In blog posts from September 2020 and February 2024, Chess.com revealed more numbers. Where, monthly, between five and six thousand players were banned from Chess.com in 2019, about 17,000 were banned in August 2020 alone. By the end of 2022 roughly 600,000 accounts had been closed. Lichess, back then about eight times smaller than Chess.com, had flagged more than 61,000 accounts around that time for using illegal external assistance, as noted in their “End of Year Update 2022.” In 2023 alone, after it had witnessed a significant growth in members, Chess.com closed just over a million of its 60 million active accounts. The company averaged more than 2,700 closures per day for engine use and another 258 closures per day for other types of fair play violations. Of these closed accounts, 89 belonged to titled players, including 11 grandmasters. Early in the pandemic, Chess.com hired three new employees to their Fair Play team that now consisted of a total of nine full-time employees: three statisticians, four cheat detectives, and two titled-player manual review experts. Three and a half years later, the team had grown to 17 members. The Australian grandmaster and scientist David Smerdon, whom we met in Chapter 3, conducted an online survey in 2020 with about a thousand respondents: anonymous chess players of different levels who provided information about cheating. One of the most striking results was that about one-fifth of the respondents admitted that they had cheated at some point in their lives. Two-thirds of those who admitted to cheating had used chess engines; the others found help in books or friends. The good news was that it only happened once in most cases, as most of them felt awful afterward. Also, if Chess.com caught them and gave them a second chance, the incidence of reoffending was very low. From this survey, the number of elite professional players who repeatedly cheated was just a fraction of 1 percent. While the methods used today to cheat are new (and even newer methods are likely to appear), cheating itself has a long and sorry history in chess. Before we wrap up the Carlsen–Niemann case, let’s first dive into this fascinating history. A Brief History of Cheating in Chess In the spring of 1770, the 36-year-old Austrian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen made a special appearance at Maria Theresa’s court in Vienna. The Habsburg empress and her entourage were eagerly awaiting a spectacle they had been promised six months earlier, and they were not disappointed. What Von Kempelen showed them that day would make an indelible impression and amaze audiences for decades to come. Tom Standage set the scene in his 2002 book The Turk: “When Maria Theresa indicated that he could begin, Kempelen brought his automaton in from a side room and wheeled it forward for closer scrutiny. It consisted of a wooden cabinet, behind which was seated a life-size figure of a man, made of carved wood, wearing an ermine-trimmed robe, loose trousers, and a turban—the traditional costume of an oriental sorcerer.” The cabinet was about four feet (1.2 meters) long, two and a half feet (76 centimeters) deep, and three feet (91 centimeters) high, and had a large chessboard screwed on its tabletop. Von Kempelen announced that he had created the first automaton that could … play chess. Before embarking on the first game, Von Kempelen opened several doors in front of and on the side of the cabinet, which revealed all sorts of wheels, cogs, levers, and clockwork-like machinery. He also made sure that the spectators could see right through the cabinet. After this inspection, he placed a set of chess pieces on the board and found a volunteer, a courtier called Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, who would be the Mechanical Turk’s first-ever opponent. Adding to the spectacle, Von Kempelen wound up the clockwork mechanism “with a loud ratcheting sound” (Standage), something he would repeat a few times during games. The figure behind the cabinet suddenly came to life, moved its head, and made the first move with its left hand. When it attacked the opponent’s queen, it would nod its head twice, and if it put the king in check, it nodded three times. If the opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, put back the piece, and make a move of its own. This automaton could not only play chess, it could play rather well. Cobenzl was easily defeated, and so were the other opponents that day. And the Turk could do even more. At the end of the show, it entertained the crowds by solving what is known as the Knight’s Tour, a mathematical puzzle where one single knight has to make a full circuit of the whole board, visiting all 64 squares just once. Von Kempelen gave more performances at the court for many distinguished international guests and toured through Europe with his Mechanical Turk in the mid-1780s. One of its opponents in Paris was Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman. As we know, Franklin was a passionate chess player, but he stood no chance against the machine. Eventually, the Turk played and lost to Philidor, the strongest player in the world at the time. It wasn’t an easy victory for Philidor, who believed his opponent to be genuine. After Von Kempelen died in 1804, his son sold the Turk to the German musician, inventor, and showman Johann Nepomuk Maelzel. It was the start of a second career for the chess-playing automaton that would eclipse the first. The most famous opponent of the Turk under Maelzel’s care was Napoleon Bonaparte (see annotated game on page 381). The French emperor also didn’t stand much of a chance. After Maelzel died in 1838, the Turk eventually ended up in the possession of John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, who repaired it and was the last to perform public shows. The Turk was then donated to the Chinese Museum in Baltimore, where it was destroyed in a fire on July 5, 1854. How did the Turk play chess? During its lifespan of more than 80 years, many reports appeared in newspapers and magazines with both simple suggestions and elaborate theories. One of those contributions came from 27-year-old writer Edgar Allan Poe in his essay “Maelzel’s Chess Player,” published in April 1836 in Richmond’s Southern Literary Messenger. Poe had seen the Turk in action in December of the previous year in Richmond, Virginia. He was not wrong when he declared that “It is quite certain that the operations of the automaton are regulated by mind, and by nothing else.… The only question is of the manner by which human agency is brought to bear.” The secret was that a human operator had always been in control, hidden inside the cabinet, and responsible for all those strong chess moves executed by the mechanical left arm of the Turk. The machinery and clockwork behind the cabinet’s doors were fake and intended to distract the audience, and the operator could easily hide thanks to a sliding seat. Over the years, several strong players acted as operators. The strongest was probably the Viennese chess master and theoretician Johann Baptist Allgaier, who happened to be operating when the Turk faced Napoleon. An image from a 1789 book by German baron Joseph Friedrich zu Racknitz that supposedly revealed the secret behind the Mechanical Turk. All this was revealed only in 1857, when the son of the Turk’s last owner, Silas Weir Mitchell, published a series of articles titled “Last of a Veteran Chess Player” in the New York magazine Chess Monthly. More than a century later, in 1989, the accuracy of Mitchell’s account was mostly confirmed when John Gaughan, aprop builder for professional magicians and an automata collector, finished a complete reconstruction of the Turk in Los Angeles. The case of the chess-cheating automaton was finally solved. Cheating is as old as the game of chess. One of the earliest examples had deadly consequences. The story goes that the eleventh-century rulers Cnut, King of the North Sea Empire, and Ulf Jarl, the regent of Denmark and Cnut’s brother-in-law, played a game of chess. The king made a losing move and insisted on taking it back, whereupon a quarrel followed until Cnut angrily overturned the chessboard. The next morning, on Christmas Day 1026, the king ordered Ulf to be killed. A drawing from Eleanor Means Hull’s 1913 book The Northmen in Britain depicting the game of chess played between eleventh-century Danish rulers Cnut and Ulf Jarl—likely the latter’s last game. Luis Ramírez de Lucena (c. 1465–c. 1530), a Spanish player who published the oldest surviving printed book on chess, suggested a mild form of, let’s say, influencing the game to your advantage. He recommended placing your opponent with the sun in their eyes if you play by day and with the candle at their right hand if you play by night (presumably to make it harder for right-handed players to execute their moves). He added that it would be even worse for your opponent if they had just eaten and drunk freely. Before the computer became a factor, cheating in chess usually meant that a player could obtain illegal access to other forms of assistance during a game. Even at the highest level, there have been allegations that players were somehow given information during play. For instance, during the Fischer–Spassky world championship match in 1972 in Reykjavík, the Russian delegation accused the Americans of using chemical and electronic means to try to beat Spassky unfairly. In a statement prepared independently from Spassky, they inquired about the lighting in the playing hall and Fischer’s chair. The organizers brought in a chemist and an electronics engineer and had the chairs of both players X-rayed, but found nothing. Inside the lamps, all that could be found were two dead flies. Writing for the New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg noted that some people suggested dissecting the flies: “Did they die a natural death? Or had an American death ray put an end to them? Or was their death a result of tasting the Poisoned Pawn Sicilian?” In the next World Chess Championship match, which took place in 1978 in Baguio City in the Philippines, cheating allegations went a step further. The backdrop of the Cold War played a role once again. Soviet representative Anatoly Karpov, who ultimately won the match, faced Viktor Korchnoi, an enemy of the Soviet state since he had defected in 1976 to become a Swiss citizen. This title match is mainly remembered for the many scandals surrounding it, which is a pity because the chess played was fantastic. But we must stay true to our theme, so there’s no way not to talk about Dr. Zukhar and a cup of blueberry yogurt. Viktor Korchnoi, left, and Anatoly Karpov, right, playing their world championship match in July 1978 in Baguio, Philippines. After the first game, Korchnoi filed an official complaint that members of Karpov’s team had handed the 12th World Chess Champion yogurt during play. According to the rules, contact between Karpov and anyone in the auditorium was forbidden during games. The Soviet press officer called it “a storm in a yogurt cup.” Still, the chief arbiter took a measure: from now on, the yogurt could only be handed to Karpov at a specific time to avoid any suggestions that it could be a means of communication. Korchnoi was never wholly reassured. After the match, he wrote, “I noticed that after this ‘yogurt,’ Karpov would often start playing like a machine gun! It wouldn’t have been a bad thing to take away this ‘yogurt’ for chemical analysis.” I am not sure if Karpov ever bothered to respond to this bizarre suggestion of doping. And then there was the infamous psychologist Vladimir Zukhar, part of Karpov’s team. Zukhar suddenly appeared in the playing hall in Baguio during the fourth game, where he sat still near the stage for hours, staring directly at Korchnoi. The Korchnoi team imagined him a parapsychologist attempting hypnosis but failed to have Zukhar removed. Korchnoi then brought his own psychologist, but only for a few days before reaching a compromise: Zukhar would sit elsewhere in the hall while Korchnoi would get rid of the reflective sunglasses he had been wearing. A few days later, Korchnoi brought two volunteer assistants, yoga practitioners who sat down in the playing hall in lotus postures, to counter any influence Zukhar might still radiate. Of course, the Soviet team protested, and soon the two yogis were barred from the playing hall. Cheating in chess reached a whole new level after the appearance of the chess computer—the actual Mechanical Turk without a hidden human being inside. The first example occurred in August 1980, in the Alsterdorfer Sports Hall in Hamburg, Germany. The German grandmaster Dr. Helmut Pfleger, a popular commentator on national television, gave a simultaneous exhibition but wasn’t aware that, in this simul, not all of his 26 opponents were human. Three participants were “simultaneously” participating in a scientific experiment, where they were helped by computers that could play chess—a fairly new development at the time. Someone holding binoculars observed the boards and pieces from a vantage point above the tournament hall. The moves were fed to three chess computers, and they were communicated back to the accomplices in the simul (two women, one man), who all had hair long enough to hide microphones and wireless receivers. As they kept their poker faces while making their moves, Pfleger had no idea what was happening. One of the three computers managed to beat the grandmaster. It was actually thousands of miles away, because that particular game was being communicated by telephone to Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, where Ken Thompson was feeding his chess program Belle the moves and sending its answers back to Hamburg. After the event was over and Pfleger was informed of the trickery, he laughed and said, “I’m really surprised. These things are now playing quite well!” We know from Chapter 5 that Kasparov considered his loss to Deep Blue in 1997 as less than fair and square. When speaking to the press about the infamous second game, Kasparov did something quite similar to what Magnus Carlsen would do a quarter of a century later: he accused his opponent of cheating without accusing it of cheating. In this case, it was also the exact opposite of what happened in the Carlsen–Niemann case. Instead of suspecting the help of a computer, Kasparov suggested the computer had received human intervention. In his opinion, Deep Blue had made moves that were too “uncomputerlike.” Kasparov used a soccer reference 25 years before Carlsen would do the same: “It reminds me of the famous goal which Maradona scored against England in 1986. He said it was the ‘hand of God.’ ” As chess computer programs became stronger and stronger, it was only a matter of time before we saw players who couldn’t resist the temptation of a little help from my silicon friend—especially once the advent of the Pocket PC and the smartphone allowed them to have a chess computer in their trousers. An early case occurred in 2006 when an amateur player was caught playing with a device called a Phonito, a wireless receiver used for undetected communication, at the World Open in Philadelphia. As he refused to be searched, the organizers banned him from the tournament. Actual proof of cheating did not surface, but the circumstances were enough for the organizers to take measures. An interesting side story is that the manufacturer of the Phonito was the Swiss hearing aid producer Phonak, which was sponsoring Floyd Landis and his cycling team at the time. By coincidence, Phonak was unwittingly caught up in a similar scandal when the American cyclist, who won the Tour de France that year, was disqualified after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Landis had been a former teammate of the even more famous Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist who was stripped of seven consecutive Tour de France victories when an investigation found that he had doped throughout his career. Cheating with a chess engine during a game has been compared with doping countless times. A better comparison unfolded in early 2016 at the Cyclo-cross World Championships in Zolder, Belgium. A concealed motor was discovered inside the frame of Belgian racer Femke van den Driessche’s bike. “It wasn’t my bike—it was that of a friend and was identical to mine,” Van den Driessche said in tears, but that didn’t prevent her from becoming the first cyclist to be officially charged with mechanical doping. The year 2006 witnessed a more famous cheating story, even though it never went beyond accusations and actual proof never surfaced. After he was accused himself a year before, the Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov, through his manager Silvio Danailov, accused Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during their world championship match. Why? Because Kramnik went to the restroom literally dozens of times during games. The Bulgarians felt that was suspicious, while Kramnik categorically denied any wrongdoing. The scandal rocked the chess world, where it was quickly named “Toiletgate.” Years later, I heard a sensible explanation: Kramnik probably visited the restroom to smoke. He had promised his soon-to-be wife that he would quit smoking, but wasn’t succeeding yet. Over the years, I must have written at least a dozen articles about players, from amateurs to grandmasters, who were caught cheating by using a phone during a game. Most stories stayed within the chess scene, but one was different: large mainstream media coverage went to the story about the 58-year-old Latvian-Czech grandmaster Igors Rausis. That was in 2019, when the chess world learned two things. First, there was a new, high-profile cheating case. Second, a picture is worth a thousand words. Rausis, who had raised suspicion for years after scoring unnaturally good results for a player his age, was caught cheating in July 2019 at a tournament in Strasbourg, France. The whole world got to see how, as one of the participants followed him to the restroom and took a photo from above, over the edge of Rausis’s cubicle. The photo was then posted to social media and went viral. Soon, the story was everywhere, from the Washington Post to the Daily Mail and China Daily. The photo showed Rausis sat on the toilet seat with the lid closed, his pants on (making it slightly less embarrassing), holding a smartphone in his hands. His left leg rested on his right knee, with his trousers rolled up above the knee, revealing a large cloth bandage circling his lower leg. You could imagine it being used to hold a small device, and Rausis looking at his phone said it all. There can’t possibly be a clearer case of being caught red-handed. At the end of 2019, the FIDE Ethics and Disciplinary Commission dished out the strongest cheating punishment to date: Rausis was banned for six years and stripped of his grandmaster title. I did not publish my news report before contacting Rausis. I spoke to him the day after he got caught, and he informed me of the end of his chess career: “I simply lost my mind yesterday.… At least what I committed yesterday is a good lesson, not for me—I played my last game of chess already.” However, he couldn’t resist returning to the arena. In October 2020, Rausis appeared at a small rapid tournament in Latvia, playing under a new name. You couldn’t make this up. Rausis told me that he hadn’t changed his name so that he could play chess again but because he was embarrassed over the widely published and unflattering picture (the internet doesn’t forget). Apart from his old name being forever linked to the photo, he said he’d also changed his name because he felt ashamed for his family. He was now using the surname of his ex-wife, with whom he was still on good terms. Rausis died at the end of March 2024, after struggling with a serious illness for two decades. In the reactions to his death, statements such as “great chess player” and “friendly personality” predominated. Cheaters are human beings too. My Lawsuit Speaks for Itself On October 20, 2022, the Carlsen–Niemann saga entered a new chapter when Niemann started a major counterattack. On Twitter (now X), he shared a link to a 44-page legal document and wrote, “My lawsuit speaks for itself.” He was going to court. Niemann filed a defamation lawsuit in the Eastern Missouri District Court against five entities: the players Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the companies Chess.com and Play Magnus Group, and Chess.com’s CCO Danny Rensch. The Play Magnus Group, a conglomerate of several small chess companies co-owned by the Carlsen family, would be acquired by Chess.com just two months later, while the lawsuit was still underway. Niemann demanded $100 million in damages from each party as he was claiming slander, libel, unlawful group boycott under the Sherman Act, tortious interference with contract and business expectancies, and civil conspiracy. Niemann stated that Carlsen, Nakamura, Chess.com, Play Magnus Group, and Rensch had been “egregiously defaming him and unlawfully colluding to blacklist him from the profession to which he has dedicated his life,” and that the whole situation had caused “devastating damages.” Regarding the alleged collusion, Niemann’s lawyers pointed for instance at Carlsen and Chess.com, referencing Chess.com’s planned takeover of Play Magnus. Their legal document noted that Chess.com’s decision to ban Niemann from their site right after Carlsen had accused Niemann of cheating “added instant credibility to Carlsen’s false allegations and suggested that they were true.” However, when I spoke to him for this book, Rensch told me personally that he had advised Carlsen not to withdraw from the Sinquefield Cup, and while Carlsen’s father and manager Henrik thanked him for the message, they decided to go down that path anyway. On June 27, 2023, a federal judge dismissed Niemann’s lawsuit. Initially, his attorneys intended to pursue the defamation claim, among others, in state court. However, by August 28 it became clear that the hatchet had been buried: Chess.com issued a statement that noted the legal dispute was concluded, and Niemann’s account on the site was reinstated. Without giving details of the settlement, the site noted: “Since June, both sides have negotiated privately in a good-faith effort to resolve their issues and allow the chess world to move forward without further litigation. We are happy to share that all sides have reached an agreement.” The text included statements from the two main characters. Carlsen admitted that “there is no determinative evidence that Niemann cheated in his game against me at the Sinquefield Cup.” Niemann said, “I look forward to competing against Magnus in chess rather than in court.” “We are literally not allowed to talk about it,” Danny Rensch told me. “We prefer to call it ‘an agreement to move on.’ Basically, Hans wanted back on Chess.com. Magnus wanted the whole thing to get behind him, and he knew the only way to do that was to agree to move forward. Chess.com acknowledged that it no longer had any evidence to justify a continued closure other than what we had already acted on, and so we all agreed to take our marbles and go home.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal directly affected the chess world in that some of the top tournaments in 2023, both online and over-the-board, increased their anti-cheating measures. It has since become standard almost everywhere that players are scanned with a metal detector before games. As well as being forbidden from carrying phones, they are also no longer allowed to wear a watch, whether it’s analog, digital, or a smartwatch. Spectators are no longer allowed to use phones in the playing hall either. In online events, players need to provide signals from multiple webcams, while there can also be audio monitoring, computer task manager review, and sometimes in-person on-site proctors. Not all tournaments take enough measures, though, which can lead to unpleasant situations. On October 12, 2023, the relatively unknown Kazakh player Alisher Suleymenov, who had earned the grandmaster title earlier in the year, defeated Magnus Carlsen in a spectacular game at the Qatar Masters in Doha. “I was completely crushed in my game today,” Carlsen tweeted. “This is not to accuse my opponent of anything, who played an amazing game and deserved to win, but, honestly, as soon as I saw my opponent was wearing a watch early in the game, I lost my ability to concentrate. I obviously take responsibility for my inability to deal with those thoughts properly, but it’s also incredibly frustrating to see organizers still not taking anti-cheating seriously at all (no transmission delay, spectators walking around the playing hall with smartphones).” Suleymenov did not respond to the tweet, and when asked about the game he said Carlsen lost due to a blunder on the board. Two months later, the other main character of the 2022 cheating scandal again attracted attention, but this time more positively. Niemann scored a career-best result by clinching the Tournament of Peace in Zagreb, Croatia, winning seven games and drawing two. His performance rating was 2956, among the best shown by any player in recent decades. On X, Niemann compared himself to Bobby Fischer, who had won the same tournament 53 years earlier. Suspicions started spreading when the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten came up with a story that included a rather vague quote from one of the organizers. Kresimir Podravec, the secretary of the Zagreb Chess Federation, reportedly said, “Niemann’s result is out of this world, but we have no definite proof that he cheated.” I don’t know if Niemann ever responded to this. Meanwhile, some of his opponents in the tournament complained about the lack of sufficient anti-cheating measures in the playing hall, but a week or two later, the chess world had moved on. But paranoia continued to exist in chess circles, particularly regarding online matches. When Vladimir Kramnik lost an online game to Niemann in September 2023, the 14th World Chess Champion uploaded a video expressing his surprise about some of his opponent’s moves. In subsequent months, Kramnik launched a personal campaign about the issue of cheating online, claiming it occurs much more often than we realize and that Chess.com isn’t doing enough to fight it. In late November, Chess.com responded in a blog post: “With the deepest respect for former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, in our opinion, his accusations lack statistical merit.” When Kramnik continued to express doubts about what he considered to be suspicious players’ performances, including those of a 12-year-old prodigy, Chess.com decided he had gone too far and closed the former world champion’s account on the site for violating its terms of service. It did not stop Kramnik from continuing to share his “statistics” on X. Chess.com’s Head of Cheat Detection Gerard Le-Marechal pointed out to me some larger implications of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal and how it has recently fed paranoia at the top level. He argued that it may have emboldened people to accuse others more openly—which is not a good thing. “There’s an interesting statistic we noticed,” Le-Marechal said. “Which is that during the time of the Niemann scandal, the rate at which people reported others increased across the site, then returned to normal after it died down, potentially suggesting that the scandal encouraged people to treat their fellow chessers with more suspicion as a whole where this did not reflect in the number of cheating cases detected.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal’s final chapter arrived on December 12, 2023. Fourteen and a half months after FIDE started its investigation into the matter, its Ethics and Disciplinary Commission finally posted its long-awaited verdict on the FIDE website. Rumor had it that Carlsen might be banned from FIDE-rated tournaments for his allegations without proof, but he was ultimately found not guilty of the most important charges. The only penalty he received was a fine of €10,000 ($10,800) for “withdrawing without a valid reason” from the Sinquefield Cup. Could It Be Done? One question remains, and for that, we’re returning once more to those damn anal beads. Is it possible to cheat at chess using a vibrating device? Could it be done? The short answer is: probably, yes. But don’t take my word for it. You can find more than one video on the internet where people attempt to verify the theory by actually creating a vibrating device connected to a computer and hidden in a sex toy. The biggest among them is YouTuber Mike Boyd. His channel, which had three million subscribers in June 2024, documents the learning process of new challenges he gives himself. In a video from November 14, 2022, titled “Actually Making THAT Chess Cheat Device,” which has been viewed 2.3 million times, he did exactly the thing Elon Musk and others had joked about—a computer transmitted moves suggested by Stockfish to a vibrating anal toy connected to a receiver and transmitter. Boyd used the device (strapped on his right ankle, hidden by his trousers) to beat a friend who was a much stronger chess player—but also received many comments from viewers pointing out that his device would never get past a metal detector like those used at top-level chess tournaments. In a video posted a week later, Boyd showed that his device wasn’t so easily traceable. A metal detector started beeping when it hovered close to his watch, his smartphone in his pocket, a pocket knife, and even a two-gram scalpel blade, but remained silent when slid over the cheat device in his pocket. Only when the detector hit the spot quite fast would it produce a brief beep. Boyd’s conclusion: handheld metal detectors suck, and the thin silicon layer surrounding the electronic components was enough to bypass the detector. The fact that an anal bead could work wasn’t the biggest problem for the chess world. Boyd’s demonstration of it passing the metal detector was arguably much more damaging. That had also been demonstrated a month before in a real-life situation. That was in October 2022, at a prestigious chess event in Reykjavík. To figure out what is spotted by a metal detector and what isn’t, a Norwegian journalist arrived at the tournament with several devices attached to her body and let herself be examined. She had an earplug the size of a small grain placed right up to the eardrum. It was connected to a receiver hidden in her clothes, which could communicate with a smartwatch attached to the inside of her belt buckle. She also brought a walkie-talkie, a power bracelet, and a pair of sunglasses with earplugs. The result was alarming: while the walkie-talkie and the bracelet were revealed in the security check, the earplugs, smartwatch, and sunglasses were not. The Norwegian organizer Jøran Aulin-Jansson wasn’t too worried that players could get through the check with an electronic device, stating, “It is quite possible that they do it, but they don’t get to use it.” Ian Nepomniachtchi, one of the participants, was less comfortable: “I still don’t feel that it is safe. I heard that an NRK reporter got through. The criminals are always one step ahead.” I feel that over the last decade or so, more cheating might have occurred than we realize, especially at smaller open tournaments where organizers lack the means to enforce proper anti-cheating measures and where it’s relatively easy to bring your smartphone to the restroom. I would like to believe that I am wrong and that all chess players are good people, but, at the same time, I think FIDE has a task to help those organizers of smaller tournaments to level up their game. I also witnessed the paranoia firsthand at a tournament in Liechtenstein back in 2014, where I scored my second international master (IM) norm. In one of my games, I drew with a titled player and after the tournament, he accused me of cheating in a personal conversation: I couldn’t have played at 2400+ level with a rating of 2215. When I told him I had done it before, in a tournament in 2004, he only saw that as further proof that I wasn’t kosher. It is clear how much computers have impacted chess. The man versus machine matches, culminating in Kasparov–Deep Blue, raised the game’s profile. Ever since, computers have helped humans become stronger players. And we continued playing, even though the chess engines on our smartphones are now stronger than Deep Blue. While cheating continues to be an issue the chess world needs to deal with, my conclusion is that artificial intelligence has done more good than bad for chess overall. Plus there’s one big factor to explore, which I haven’t even mentioned yet. These days, most chess games are played between people who don’t know their opponents or where they are located. Millions of games are played daily between people across the globe, from their homes, the office, the train, or even the restroom. All this is possible thanks to the internet, an invention that seems like it was made for chess. We’ll explore the strong bond between chess and the internet next.",

As it gets close to the chewing gum, the detector blinks a red light. Niemann smiles and opens the packet, which the arbiter puts aside for a moment as he continues his search. He then switches the Garrett for a smaller radio-frequency scanner and meticulously moves down Niemann’s dark blazer and trousers, carefully checking his tanned leather shoes before going up again. This is not an airport but the entrance to a chess tournament. A pre-game check for electronic devices such as mobile phones or smartwatches—not allowed on a player’s body during gameplay—is becoming standard in top chess. This particular check, however, is taking longer than usual. The clock on the TV screen shows 12:59 p.m. in St. Louis on Monday, September 5, 2022. The fourth round of the Sinquefield Cup is about to start. The annual ten-player super-tournament, among the most prestigious on the chess calendar and backed by Missouri-based billionaire Rex Sinquefield, is being held for the ninth time. The 19-year-old Niemann, from Connecticut, is a highly talented junior chess player who made a big jump in the world rankings during the COVID-19 pandemic. But he isn’t even among the world’s top 40 players. He has no business winning this one. None-theless, Niemann is the sole leader three rounds into the event after a spectacular result the day before, when he beat none other than Magnus Carlsen (see annotated game on pages 399–400), the world champion, the 31-year-old superstar from Norway. The GOAT? Carlsen the Mighty went unbeaten for 125 games between 2019 and 2020. In 2022 he had built another impressive streak: he hadn’t suffered a single loss in his previous 53 games. Until St. Louis. With his typical, unfiltered voice, Niemann commented after their game, “It must be embarrassing for the world champion to lose to me.” At the exact moment when the arbiter finishes his security check and Niemann walks into the playing hall, Carlsen sends out a tweet that shocks the chess world. “I’ve withdrawn from the tournament. I’ve always enjoyed playing in the @STLChessClub, and hope to be back in the future,” he wrote. Wait, what? Carlsen had once prematurely left a press conference, but never before had he stepped out of a tournament. The number of times a top grandmaster has deliberately withdrawn from an ongoing tournament can be counted on the fingers of one hand. In 1967, the erratic American and future world champion Bobby Fischer left the Sousse Interzonal Tournament after a dispute with the organizers over the scheduling of his games. In 2018 the Chinese number-one player and future world champion Ding Liren was forced to withdraw from the Norway Chess tournament after he broke his hip during a fateful bicycle ride. Carlsen’s decision was something the chess world had rarely seen before. “I am sitting here in a bit of a stunned silence; I don’t really know how to react to this,” said the popular commentator and top grandmaster Peter Svidler, perplexed about this unique moment for chess. “There will be some developments, I assume,” he added. It was the understatement of the year, considering what would happen in the months ahead. Carlsen’s tweet opened a Pandora’s box of speculation, primarily because of a video clip that he had attached to it. In it, soccer manager José Mourinho said, “I prefer, really, not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble.” The clip was a well-known soccer meme from 2014, when the Portuguese trainer, then the coach of Chelsea, was interviewed following his team’s loss to Aston Villa in the English Premier League. Mourinho was furious about some of the decisions by the referee but preferred not to speak for fear of retroactive punishment from the Football Association. What Mourinho wanted to say wasn’t immediately clear at the time (although he seemed to be suggesting mistakes from the referee), so what did Carlsen, a big soccer fan himself, mean by using this meme? Speculation started instantly on social media and wouldn’t stop for weeks. Mainstream media worldwide would report on what was to become the biggest scandal chess had ever seen. Chess had hit the fan. The Chess Speaks for Itself The narrative kind of started three weeks before the Sinquefield Cup when Carlsen and Niemann played each other four times in faster games at a tournament in Miami. Niemann, the lowest seed and an outspoken and confident newcomer, had started with a surprising win against the favorite before losing the next three games and their mini-match 1–3. Asked for a summary of that first game, the American teenager replied, “The chess speaks for itself.” He walked away from the camera, ignoring the follow-up question and perplexing the interviewer. It was the chess version of dropping the mic. The phrase “speaks for itself” became a meme, instantly added to the vocabulary of chess players and fans on social media. Niemann had quickly positioned himself off the board as the Conor McGregor of chess as he spoke with a bravado that evoked both cringe and delight. He was brimming with confidence, supported by his quick rise to the top. Less than two years after earning the grandmaster title at the age of 17, he had recently entered the world’s top hundred. Niemann’s ascent was aided by the fact that he was one of the most active grandmasters in the world, having played a string of tournaments almost back-to-back in Spain, Serbia, Italy, Montenegro, the US (Las Vegas, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cherry Hill), Portugal, Serbia again, the United Arab Emirates, Latvia, Uzbekistan, and Spain again. He was a one-man band on tour, his computer was his roadie, and his Uber Eats account his stage manager. In March 2022, Niemann was a guest on the popular Perpetual Chess Podcast, where he explained his regimen: “The time that I’m investing is a minimum of ten to 12 hours a day. I’m working very hard; I don’t have much of a social life, you could say. I don’t indulge in any distractions other than chess.” He didn’t hide his ambition and confidence: “The goal is to be the best in the world. I think it’s absolutely impossible for me to fail at this point because I am really just doing everything that I need to do, and I am investing every second of every day into improving my chess.” How important chess had become for him was revealed when he said, “If I do not reach the top ten, I think I will assess my chess career as a failure. I think [then] my life is a failure as well, if you wanna get deep.” He spoke with the same intensity as that other legendary American prodigy who famously became the chess world champion in 1972. “Just look at how Fischer lived his life before insanity,” said Niemann. “That’s the right way to do it, right? Before things went haywire, the way that he approached the game was absolutely inspiring. He was working entirely alone, he had a set regimen, and he was in great physical shape. He had no romance, no distractions. He was totally focused. And it paid dividends.” This 19-year-old brat: could he be the new Bobby Fischer? Carlsen, for one, didn’t think so. He hadn’t accused Niemann of wrongdoing by tweeting his goodbye to the Sinquefield Cup with that José Mourinho clip. At the same time, it was clear that he was implying it. But what point was Carlsen making, exactly? That Niemann had beaten him thanks to cheating? In a live stream on Twitch, the American top grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura was the first to say what Carlsen had only suggested while discussing the tournament’s fourth round, particularly Carlsen’s withdrawal. Nakamura had been streaming chess for four years (more about that in Chapter 10), was one of the biggest chess streamers in the world, with more than a million followers on Twitch and a million and a half subscribers on YouTube. When he talks—whether it’s about his games, a brewing scandal, or sushi—the world listens. Nakamura said, “I think Magnus believes that Hans probably is cheating.” Magnus Carlsen, left, and Hans Niemann, right, during their fateful game in the third round of the 2022 Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. While the scandal was getting bigger by the day inside the chess world, it soon became clear that it was rippling out into the mainstream media too. On Tuesday, September 20, 15 days after Carlsen’s tweet, one of the editors of the Dutch comedy radio show Spijkers met Koppen contacted me via a DM on Twitter (now called X). Would I be interested in talking about the chess cheating scandal in their next show? Four days later, I found myself in the studio in front of a live audience. More media would reach out to me in the days to come, something that hadn’t happened to me in over 16 years of covering chess. I realized how big this story was. Poker player Robbi Jade Lew was suspected of foul play after winning a $269,000 hand against poker pro Garrett Adelstein on an episode of the popular YouTube show Hustler Casino Live. She denied the allegations and an investigation into the matter concluded with no findings of wrongdoing. Two fishermen seeking a $29,000 first prize were disqualified from the Lake Erie Walleye Trail tournament after their fish turned out to be stuffed with lead weights. Both of these events happened in the fall of 2022 but neither got nearly as much media coverage as the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Why was that? One reason was because it was chess—the ancient, intelligent and highly respected board game had suddenly been connected to something as shady as cheating. Apart from that, there was the often thought-provoking communication (or lack thereof) by the main protagonists, and the endless speculation by fans, experts, and so-called experts. Oh, and then there was Elon Musk. Elon Musk and the Anal Beads The 30-year-old Canadian grandmaster and streamer Eric Hansen involuntarily played a crucial role in the story. In one of his streams in September 2022, viewers asked the question on everyone’s mind: how do you cheat over the board at a top tournament? Hansen said he didn’t know and mentioned the strict anti-cheating measures at the Saint Louis Chess Club. And then, it happened. A question popped up in the chat that would ultimately be the primary catalyst for this brewing scandal to explode into a global media frenzy. The subscriber asked: “What if he was hiding something in his butt?” Without hesitating, Hansen responded in his stream: “That’s probably a good one. An anal bead would probably beat the thing, the engine. I don’t know.” Later, Hansen would say he was joking, but the genie was out of the bottle. A theory was born: Niemann could have hidden something up his rectum, a device small enough to fit in that place where the sun doesn’t shine, but sophisticated enough to be connected to a chess engine and vibrate the information needed to make very strong chess moves. Really? Hansen’s theory would probably have been quickly forgotten if it hadn’t been picked up by none other than Elon Musk, the world-famous business magnate. Musk came across the anal bead theory and retweeted it to his 110 million followers on Twitter. With his retweet, Musk commented: “Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one sees (cause it’s in ur butt):—Schopenhauer.” He then also tweeted a screenshot from a lengthy comment on Reddit with the bizarre claim that Carlsen(!) had played with anal beads for years, and wrote in that tweet: “My version of Occam’s Razor: most entertaining outcome is most likely …” Musk followed up: “You can almost hear that snap of the rubber glove before chess match cavity searches.” It was thanks to these tweets (which were deleted a few weeks later, around the time Musk was completing his takeover of Twitter) that just about every single mainstream newspaper, magazine, TV and radio show, blog, or podcast in almost the entire Western world would, at one point or another, cover the Carlsen–Niemann scandal. Popular non-chess streamers were picking up the story, such as Charlie White Jr., a.k.a. penguinz0, who at the time had over 11 million subscribers on YouTube. It was also discussed on The Joe Rogan Experience, the most popular podcast worldwide in 2022. Everyone was talking about it. Trevor Noah joked on The Daily Show: “I get why someone would use vibrating anal beads to cheat. Because, even if you lose, you still kind of win, you know?” In the same week, The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert briefly covered the story as well, and, in December, it featured on Saturday Night Live. On January 23, 2023, Niemann appeared as an answer on Jeopardy!—to “His name signifies ‘newcomer,’ and this relative newcomer sparked accusations of cheating after a 2022 upset of champ Magnus Carlsen.” In June 2023 an episode of the sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia starring Danny DeVito was entirely inspired by the saga. And in May 2024, the American film industry’s news website Hollywood Reporter announced plans for a movie titled Checkmate about Carlsen–Niemann with Nathan Fielder as director and Emma Stone as co-producer. It will be based on a 12-page book proposal from Ben Mezrich, the author of books adapted into films such as The Social Network and Dumb Money. Meanwhile, the chess world remained divided into two camps. While many held up the presumption of innocence and believed Niemann should be left alone until proven guilty, a majority was willing to give Carlsen the benefit of the doubt. The world champion had a flawless record of sportsmanship throughout his career and was known to be brutally honest and often self-critical. The army of Carlsen believers grew fast due to interviews Niemann gave in the official Sinquefield Cup broadcast. It seemed he had expected Carlsen to play a defense he hadn’t used in years, and Niemann’s explanation wasn’t all too convincing: “By some miracle, I had checked this today. It was such a ridiculous miracle that I don’t even remember why I checked it.” The French top grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave gave a very sensible comment after round five of the St. Louis tournament: “[Given] the information I have until now, I would say: no cheating. But then, of course, Magnus is also not known for going on witch-hunts and stuff like that. Maybe he has solid arguments, but I would like to see them.” Garry Kasparov, a member of the board of the Grand Chess Tour, of which the Sinquefield Cup was part, chimed in on Twitter: “Carlsen’s withdrawal was a blow to chess fans, his colleagues at the tournament, the organizers, and, as the rumors and negative publicity swirl in a vacuum, to the game. The world title has its responsibilities, and a public statement is the least of them here.” In an interview conducted a few weeks later, Kasparov was even more critical of his successor: “I think his behaviour was unacceptable.” Niemann Admits to Online Cheating It was after the fifth round when Niemann first commented about Carlsen’s hidden allegation. He gave a long monologue in defense of himself, addressing all the topics discussed on social media and elsewhere, one by one. It was one of the most extraordinary interviews given by a chess player. Why? Because he suddenly admitted to cheating, live, on camera. “When I was 12 years old, I was with a friend, and I was playing Titled Tuesday,” Niemann started, referring to a well-known weekly blitz tournament on Chess.com, where only players with a title (such as grandmasters or international masters) can play. He revealed that, while playing, his friend was feeding him moves based on a chess engine running on an iPad. “I was a child; I had no idea what happened,” he said. “This happened once in an online tournament. I was just a child, and nothing happened then. Now, four years later, when I was 16 years old during my streaming career, in an absolutely ridiculous mistake, in an unrated game.… Other than that, after I was 12, I have never, ever in my life cheated in an over-the-board game, in an online tournament. They were unrated games, and I’m admitting this.” Although he was emphasizing the insignificance of his cheating as a minor, his revelation showed what, for many, was a key aspect of the story: that Niemann had been willing to cheat. Suddenly it was easier to believe he could have done it again, perhaps even over the board—which was the opposite of what he wanted to achieve. After apologizing several times, saying he was “deeply ashamed” about his online cheating, Niemann launched a direct attack on Chess.com, the biggest among several online chess platforms. He revealed that he had received an email saying that the company had privately removed access to his account and that he had been uninvited from Chess.com’s Global Chess Championship (GCC). This $1 million series of online top events had started earlier in the year with online qualifiers and had reached the stage where top grandmasters were added to the field on an invitation basis. Niemann had personally been invited by Chess.com’s “Chief Chess Officer” (CCO) Danny Rensch a month earlier, so being removed shocked Niemann: “Right when I beat Magnus, they decide to remove my account and not let me play in the tournaments. This is absolutely ridiculous, and they’ve only done this because of what Magnus has said, what Hikaru says, and the entire social media and chess world is completely attacking me and undermining me.” In the end, Niemann said that the whole affair fueled him. He now wanted to win the tournament even more, even if demonstrating he was not using a device meant he had to play without clothes: “If they want me to strip fully naked, I’ll do it. I don’t care because I know that I’m clean, and I’m willing to subject myself.’ As there was a certain charm in the way Niemann expressed himself, the chess world still wasn’t sure what to believe. Perhaps there was only one way to find out, as the top American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana jokingly tweeted: “New chess format concept in light of recent controversy: The Speedo Speed Chess Championship. Thoughts?” Shortly after Niemann’s interviews, Chess.com came out with a statement signed by CCO Danny Rensch. It said the company had privately contacted Niemann to explain their decision to remove him from Chess.com and their events. The key part of the statement read: “We have shared detailed evidence with him concerning our decision, including information that contradicts his statements regarding the amount and seriousness of his cheating on Chess.com.” Did that mean Niemann had cheated more often than he had admitted to, and perhaps in more important games than he suggested? These questions remained unanswered for a while, and things calmed down somewhat during the second half of the tournament, where Niemann finished with three draws and two losses in the remaining rounds. Niemann wasn’t without supporters during this time. At the start of the eighth round, four young ladies were seen outside the Saint Louis Chess Club entrance on Maryland Avenue. They had come to cheer for Niemann and were holding up signs that said: “We LOVE Hans!,” “Gen Z’s LOVE Hans!,” “Hans Has Cool Hair” and “Hans Has an Awesome Accent.” More authoritative support came from Kenneth Regan in the Wall Street Journal. As an associate professor at the University at Buffalo, Regan has advised FIDE on anti-cheating matters for two decades, using an algorithm for statistical tests to identify computer-assisted chess cheating. Regan had looked at Niemann’s games and found nothing unusual. After the tournament ended, the debate continued on social media, where all kinds of theories were suggested regarding Niemann’s potential cheating in over-the-board play. Among these, some people claimed to have found strong evidence in some of Niemann’s games of him playing a suspiciously high number of moves approved by computer engines. Others pointed out methodological flaws in the research of these armchair statisticians. However, one analysis of Niemann’s games came with an authority that was hard to ignore. When a former world number two and the 2018 world championship challenger says something about chess, you take it seriously. In his newly launched C-Squared Podcast, Caruana commented on one game Niemann had played in 2022: “This game, to me, is quite extraordinary. It’s either the game of a genius or something fishy.” Carlsen Resigns It’s Monday, September 19, 2022, 10:00 a.m. on the West Coast of America; 7:00 p.m. in central Europe. The sixth round of the Julius Baer Generation Cup is about to start. The online tournament involves 16 strong grandmasters of different generations and is the seventh event in the $1.6 million Meltwater Champions Chess Tour. Fate has it that Carlsen is paired with Niemann on this day, and fans are on the edge of their seats. The online broadcast shows a big chessboard on the left of the screen and the faces of Niemann and Carlsen through their webcams. The renowned Hungarian commentator and former top grandmaster Peter Leko starts providing energetic commentary from the get-go: “D4. Because this is his main move. Knight f6, c4. Yeah, definitely. And … WHAT? No …” Co-commentator and international master Tania Sachdev of India quietly says, “What happened?” before she utters a loud “WHAT?” With the commentators still in disbelief, Carlsen turns off his webcam. It turns out he has resigned the game after making his first move, making it clear that he doesn’t want to play a game of chess against Hans Niemann. It’s a matter of principle. For the second time in a month, the world champion has shocked the chess world. This time, the reactions were less sympathetic toward the world champion. While some pointed out that he was affecting other players in the tournament by giving his opponent a free point, others demanded that Carlsen issue a statement. “It looks like he is clearly insinuating something, but until you catch someone, you cannot do anything,” said the Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, who was also competing in the tournament. “It just looks very odd now. Clearly, it all makes sense if, supposedly, Hans is cheating and he doesn’t want to play him. But if he isn’t, then it is really very wrong.” While FIDE refrained from commenting publicly, its president Arkady Dvorkovich issued a “personal statement” (though he used the first person plural) on September 23. It was openly critical of Carlsen’s decisions to withdraw from one tournament and resign after one move in another: “We strongly believe that the world champion has a moral responsibility attached to his status since he is viewed as a global ambassador of the game,” wrote Dvorkovich. “His actions impact the reputation of his colleagues, sportive results, and eventually can be damaging to our game. We strongly believe that there were better ways to handle this situation.” The president also noted that FIDE shared Carlsen’s “deep concerns about the damage that cheating brings to chess” and announced that it would task its Fair Play Commission with a thorough investigation. About a week later FIDE announced on its website that an investigatory panel had been formed to investigate the Carlsen–Niemann situation. On September 27, three weeks into the affair, Carlsen finally published a much-anticipated statement. He said he was as “frustrated” about the situation as the chess community. For the first time, he used the c-word, finally becoming more concrete after that mysterious Mourinho tweet he sent on September 5: “I believe that Niemann has cheated more—and more recently—than he has publicly admitted. His over-the-board progress has been unusual, and throughout our game in the Sinquefield Cup I had the impression that he wasn’t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as Black in a way I think only a handful of players can do. This game contributed to changing my perspective.” Carlsen’s remarks about Niemann’s demeanor during their game didn’t seem convincing, if only because, according to the experts, he hadn’t played his best chess himself in the encounter. At the same time, the biggest question remained unanswered: did the world champion possess hard evidence that showed Niemann had cheated? Carlsen’s use of language was obviously restricted for legal reasons when he wrote: “Unfortunately, at this time, I am limited in what I can say without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly.” Did Niemann need to give permission to get himself buried completely? The next big moment in the saga happened on October 5 when Chess.com published a 72-page document titled “Hans Niemann Report” on its website, signed off by CEO Erik Allebest, CCO Danny Rensch, and the company’s Fair Play team. The report had been shared with the Wall Street Journal shortly before publication and, on the face of it, dealt Niemann a heavy blow as the revelations seemed quite damaging. The company claimed he had “likely cheated in more than 100 online chess games, including several prize money events.” Chess.com listed 11 events between 2015 and 2020, including multiple Titled Tuesday events, Speed Chess Championship Qualifiers, the PRO Chess League, and several individual matches against highly rated, well-known figures in the chess community, each pointing to multiple games where Niemann “likely cheated.” Importantly, the report noted that, contrary to Niemann’s claims in his interviews, several of the games in which he was alleged to have cheated on Chess.com were rated and played in tournaments. In Niemann’s lawsuit this claim was described as “false.” Whereas anti-cheating expert Kenneth Regan hadn’t found suspicious data in Niemann’s over-the-board games, he agreed with Chess.com on their conclusions of Niemann’s online play. Chess.com’s tools to detect cheating are specifically intended for looking at online chess with fast time controls, so it was somewhat surprising that their report also discussed Niemann’s sharp increase in playing strength in over-the-board chess. This part of their report was mostly criticized afterward (for instance, it was pointed out that the Armenian American grandmaster Levon Aronian had shown similar progress as a teenager) and did not always coincide with Ken Regan’s conclusions regarding Niemann’s over-the-board play. But the Chess.com report was applauded almost universally for one thing: for the first time, the company allowed a peek into their anti-cheating kitchen. In order not to make it easier for future cheaters, the company couldn’t go into detail, but they did enlighten the chess world: The basic concept of cheat detection, particularly at the top level of chess, is both statistical and manual, involving: comparing the moves made to engine recommended moves, removing some moves (opening, some endgame), focusing on key/critical moves, discussing with a panel of trained analysts and strong players, comparing player past performance and known strength profile, comparing a player’s performance to performances of comparable peers, looking at the statistical significance of the results (ex. “one in a million chance of happening naturally”), looking at if there are behavioral factors at play (ex. “browser behavior”), and reviewing time usage when compared to the difficulty of the moves on the board. Other chess platforms also use some of these methods, but there are differences. Lichess, Chess.com’s biggest rival in the online chess market, published a blog post in August 2022 pointing out that they use different kinds of AI, including a neural network that detects “suspicious patterns in online play, and crucially doesn’t need to do an engine analysis on a sample of games to spot those patterns.” In suspicious but not clear-cut cases, games are sent for further review by human moderators. Online cheating is becoming increasingly problematic. In 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, over-the-board chess was impossible but online chess grew enormously, and so did cheating. In their report, Chess.com noted that over the course of more than 15 years of their existence, they had “closed the accounts of many non-professional online players, hundreds of titled players, dozens of GMs.” They had elicited cheating confessions from over 300 players, four of whom were in the FIDE top 100. In blog posts from September 2020 and February 2024, Chess.com revealed more numbers. Where, monthly, between five and six thousand players were banned from Chess.com in 2019, about 17,000 were banned in August 2020 alone. By the end of 2022 roughly 600,000 accounts had been closed. Lichess, back then about eight times smaller than Chess.com, had flagged more than 61,000 accounts around that time for using illegal external assistance, as noted in their “End of Year Update 2022.” In 2023 alone, after it had witnessed a significant growth in members, Chess.com closed just over a million of its 60 million active accounts. The company averaged more than 2,700 closures per day for engine use and another 258 closures per day for other types of fair play violations. Of these closed accounts, 89 belonged to titled players, including 11 grandmasters. Early in the pandemic, Chess.com hired three new employees to their Fair Play team that now consisted of a total of nine full-time employees: three statisticians, four cheat detectives, and two titled-player manual review experts. Three and a half years later, the team had grown to 17 members. The Australian grandmaster and scientist David Smerdon, whom we met in Chapter 3, conducted an online survey in 2020 with about a thousand respondents: anonymous chess players of different levels who provided information about cheating. One of the most striking results was that about one-fifth of the respondents admitted that they had cheated at some point in their lives. Two-thirds of those who admitted to cheating had used chess engines; the others found help in books or friends. The good news was that it only happened once in most cases, as most of them felt awful afterward. Also, if Chess.com caught them and gave them a second chance, the incidence of reoffending was very low. From this survey, the number of elite professional players who repeatedly cheated was just a fraction of 1 percent. While the methods used today to cheat are new (and even newer methods are likely to appear), cheating itself has a long and sorry history in chess. Before we wrap up the Carlsen–Niemann case, let’s first dive into this fascinating history. A Brief History of Cheating in Chess In the spring of 1770, the 36-year-old Austrian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen made a special appearance at Maria Theresa’s court in Vienna. The Habsburg empress and her entourage were eagerly awaiting a spectacle they had been promised six months earlier, and they were not disappointed. What Von Kempelen showed them that day would make an indelible impression and amaze audiences for decades to come. Tom Standage set the scene in his 2002 book The Turk: “When Maria Theresa indicated that he could begin, Kempelen brought his automaton in from a side room and wheeled it forward for closer scrutiny. It consisted of a wooden cabinet, behind which was seated a life-size figure of a man, made of carved wood, wearing an ermine-trimmed robe, loose trousers, and a turban—the traditional costume of an oriental sorcerer.” The cabinet was about four feet (1.2 meters) long, two and a half feet (76 centimeters) deep, and three feet (91 centimeters) high, and had a large chessboard screwed on its tabletop. Von Kempelen announced that he had created the first automaton that could … play chess. Before embarking on the first game, Von Kempelen opened several doors in front of and on the side of the cabinet, which revealed all sorts of wheels, cogs, levers, and clockwork-like machinery. He also made sure that the spectators could see right through the cabinet. After this inspection, he placed a set of chess pieces on the board and found a volunteer, a courtier called Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, who would be the Mechanical Turk’s first-ever opponent. Adding to the spectacle, Von Kempelen wound up the clockwork mechanism “with a loud ratcheting sound” (Standage), something he would repeat a few times during games. The figure behind the cabinet suddenly came to life, moved its head, and made the first move with its left hand. When it attacked the opponent’s queen, it would nod its head twice, and if it put the king in check, it nodded three times. If the opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, put back the piece, and make a move of its own. This automaton could not only play chess, it could play rather well. Cobenzl was easily defeated, and so were the other opponents that day. And the Turk could do even more. At the end of the show, it entertained the crowds by solving what is known as the Knight’s Tour, a mathematical puzzle where one single knight has to make a full circuit of the whole board, visiting all 64 squares just once. Von Kempelen gave more performances at the court for many distinguished international guests and toured through Europe with his Mechanical Turk in the mid-1780s. One of its opponents in Paris was Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman. As we know, Franklin was a passionate chess player, but he stood no chance against the machine. Eventually, the Turk played and lost to Philidor, the strongest player in the world at the time. It wasn’t an easy victory for Philidor, who believed his opponent to be genuine. After Von Kempelen died in 1804, his son sold the Turk to the German musician, inventor, and showman Johann Nepomuk Maelzel. It was the start of a second career for the chess-playing automaton that would eclipse the first. The most famous opponent of the Turk under Maelzel’s care was Napoleon Bonaparte (see annotated game on page 381). The French emperor also didn’t stand much of a chance. After Maelzel died in 1838, the Turk eventually ended up in the possession of John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, who repaired it and was the last to perform public shows. The Turk was then donated to the Chinese Museum in Baltimore, where it was destroyed in a fire on July 5, 1854. How did the Turk play chess? During its lifespan of more than 80 years, many reports appeared in newspapers and magazines with both simple suggestions and elaborate theories. One of those contributions came from 27-year-old writer Edgar Allan Poe in his essay “Maelzel’s Chess Player,” published in April 1836 in Richmond’s Southern Literary Messenger. Poe had seen the Turk in action in December of the previous year in Richmond, Virginia. He was not wrong when he declared that “It is quite certain that the operations of the automaton are regulated by mind, and by nothing else.… The only question is of the manner by which human agency is brought to bear.” The secret was that a human operator had always been in control, hidden inside the cabinet, and responsible for all those strong chess moves executed by the mechanical left arm of the Turk. The machinery and clockwork behind the cabinet’s doors were fake and intended to distract the audience, and the operator could easily hide thanks to a sliding seat. Over the years, several strong players acted as operators. The strongest was probably the Viennese chess master and theoretician Johann Baptist Allgaier, who happened to be operating when the Turk faced Napoleon. An image from a 1789 book by German baron Joseph Friedrich zu Racknitz that supposedly revealed the secret behind the Mechanical Turk. All this was revealed only in 1857, when the son of the Turk’s last owner, Silas Weir Mitchell, published a series of articles titled “Last of a Veteran Chess Player” in the New York magazine Chess Monthly. More than a century later, in 1989, the accuracy of Mitchell’s account was mostly confirmed when John Gaughan, aprop builder for professional magicians and an automata collector, finished a complete reconstruction of the Turk in Los Angeles. The case of the chess-cheating automaton was finally solved. Cheating is as old as the game of chess. One of the earliest examples had deadly consequences. The story goes that the eleventh-century rulers Cnut, King of the North Sea Empire, and Ulf Jarl, the regent of Denmark and Cnut’s brother-in-law, played a game of chess. The king made a losing move and insisted on taking it back, whereupon a quarrel followed until Cnut angrily overturned the chessboard. The next morning, on Christmas Day 1026, the king ordered Ulf to be killed. A drawing from Eleanor Means Hull’s 1913 book The Northmen in Britain depicting the game of chess played between eleventh-century Danish rulers Cnut and Ulf Jarl—likely the latter’s last game. Luis Ramírez de Lucena (c. 1465–c. 1530), a Spanish player who published the oldest surviving printed book on chess, suggested a mild form of, let’s say, influencing the game to your advantage. He recommended placing your opponent with the sun in their eyes if you play by day and with the candle at their right hand if you play by night (presumably to make it harder for right-handed players to execute their moves). He added that it would be even worse for your opponent if they had just eaten and drunk freely. Before the computer became a factor, cheating in chess usually meant that a player could obtain illegal access to other forms of assistance during a game. Even at the highest level, there have been allegations that players were somehow given information during play. For instance, during the Fischer–Spassky world championship match in 1972 in Reykjavík, the Russian delegation accused the Americans of using chemical and electronic means to try to beat Spassky unfairly. In a statement prepared independently from Spassky, they inquired about the lighting in the playing hall and Fischer’s chair. The organizers brought in a chemist and an electronics engineer and had the chairs of both players X-rayed, but found nothing. Inside the lamps, all that could be found were two dead flies. Writing for the New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg noted that some people suggested dissecting the flies: “Did they die a natural death? Or had an American death ray put an end to them? Or was their death a result of tasting the Poisoned Pawn Sicilian?” In the next World Chess Championship match, which took place in 1978 in Baguio City in the Philippines, cheating allegations went a step further. The backdrop of the Cold War played a role once again. Soviet representative Anatoly Karpov, who ultimately won the match, faced Viktor Korchnoi, an enemy of the Soviet state since he had defected in 1976 to become a Swiss citizen. This title match is mainly remembered for the many scandals surrounding it, which is a pity because the chess played was fantastic. But we must stay true to our theme, so there’s no way not to talk about Dr. Zukhar and a cup of blueberry yogurt. Viktor Korchnoi, left, and Anatoly Karpov, right, playing their world championship match in July 1978 in Baguio, Philippines. After the first game, Korchnoi filed an official complaint that members of Karpov’s team had handed the 12th World Chess Champion yogurt during play. According to the rules, contact between Karpov and anyone in the auditorium was forbidden during games. The Soviet press officer called it “a storm in a yogurt cup.” Still, the chief arbiter took a measure: from now on, the yogurt could only be handed to Karpov at a specific time to avoid any suggestions that it could be a means of communication. Korchnoi was never wholly reassured. After the match, he wrote, “I noticed that after this ‘yogurt,’ Karpov would often start playing like a machine gun! It wouldn’t have been a bad thing to take away this ‘yogurt’ for chemical analysis.” I am not sure if Karpov ever bothered to respond to this bizarre suggestion of doping. And then there was the infamous psychologist Vladimir Zukhar, part of Karpov’s team. Zukhar suddenly appeared in the playing hall in Baguio during the fourth game, where he sat still near the stage for hours, staring directly at Korchnoi. The Korchnoi team imagined him a parapsychologist attempting hypnosis but failed to have Zukhar removed. Korchnoi then brought his own psychologist, but only for a few days before reaching a compromise: Zukhar would sit elsewhere in the hall while Korchnoi would get rid of the reflective sunglasses he had been wearing. A few days later, Korchnoi brought two volunteer assistants, yoga practitioners who sat down in the playing hall in lotus postures, to counter any influence Zukhar might still radiate. Of course, the Soviet team protested, and soon the two yogis were barred from the playing hall. Cheating in chess reached a whole new level after the appearance of the chess computer—the actual Mechanical Turk without a hidden human being inside. The first example occurred in August 1980, in the Alsterdorfer Sports Hall in Hamburg, Germany. The German grandmaster Dr. Helmut Pfleger, a popular commentator on national television, gave a simultaneous exhibition but wasn’t aware that, in this simul, not all of his 26 opponents were human. Three participants were “simultaneously” participating in a scientific experiment, where they were helped by computers that could play chess—a fairly new development at the time. Someone holding binoculars observed the boards and pieces from a vantage point above the tournament hall. The moves were fed to three chess computers, and they were communicated back to the accomplices in the simul (two women, one man), who all had hair long enough to hide microphones and wireless receivers. As they kept their poker faces while making their moves, Pfleger had no idea what was happening. One of the three computers managed to beat the grandmaster. It was actually thousands of miles away, because that particular game was being communicated by telephone to Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, where Ken Thompson was feeding his chess program Belle the moves and sending its answers back to Hamburg. After the event was over and Pfleger was informed of the trickery, he laughed and said, “I’m really surprised. These things are now playing quite well!” We know from Chapter 5 that Kasparov considered his loss to Deep Blue in 1997 as less than fair and square. When speaking to the press about the infamous second game, Kasparov did something quite similar to what Magnus Carlsen would do a quarter of a century later: he accused his opponent of cheating without accusing it of cheating. In this case, it was also the exact opposite of what happened in the Carlsen–Niemann case. Instead of suspecting the help of a computer, Kasparov suggested the computer had received human intervention. In his opinion, Deep Blue had made moves that were too “uncomputerlike.” Kasparov used a soccer reference 25 years before Carlsen would do the same: “It reminds me of the famous goal which Maradona scored against England in 1986. He said it was the ‘hand of God.’ ” As chess computer programs became stronger and stronger, it was only a matter of time before we saw players who couldn’t resist the temptation of a little help from my silicon friend—especially once the advent of the Pocket PC and the smartphone allowed them to have a chess computer in their trousers. An early case occurred in 2006 when an amateur player was caught playing with a device called a Phonito, a wireless receiver used for undetected communication, at the World Open in Philadelphia. As he refused to be searched, the organizers banned him from the tournament. Actual proof of cheating did not surface, but the circumstances were enough for the organizers to take measures. An interesting side story is that the manufacturer of the Phonito was the Swiss hearing aid producer Phonak, which was sponsoring Floyd Landis and his cycling team at the time. By coincidence, Phonak was unwittingly caught up in a similar scandal when the American cyclist, who won the Tour de France that year, was disqualified after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Landis had been a former teammate of the even more famous Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist who was stripped of seven consecutive Tour de France victories when an investigation found that he had doped throughout his career. Cheating with a chess engine during a game has been compared with doping countless times. A better comparison unfolded in early 2016 at the Cyclo-cross World Championships in Zolder, Belgium. A concealed motor was discovered inside the frame of Belgian racer Femke van den Driessche’s bike. “It wasn’t my bike—it was that of a friend and was identical to mine,” Van den Driessche said in tears, but that didn’t prevent her from becoming the first cyclist to be officially charged with mechanical doping. The year 2006 witnessed a more famous cheating story, even though it never went beyond accusations and actual proof never surfaced. After he was accused himself a year before, the Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov, through his manager Silvio Danailov, accused Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during their world championship match. Why? Because Kramnik went to the restroom literally dozens of times during games. The Bulgarians felt that was suspicious, while Kramnik categorically denied any wrongdoing. The scandal rocked the chess world, where it was quickly named “Toiletgate.” Years later, I heard a sensible explanation: Kramnik probably visited the restroom to smoke. He had promised his soon-to-be wife that he would quit smoking, but wasn’t succeeding yet. Over the years, I must have written at least a dozen articles about players, from amateurs to grandmasters, who were caught cheating by using a phone during a game. Most stories stayed within the chess scene, but one was different: large mainstream media coverage went to the story about the 58-year-old Latvian-Czech grandmaster Igors Rausis. That was in 2019, when the chess world learned two things. First, there was a new, high-profile cheating case. Second, a picture is worth a thousand words. Rausis, who had raised suspicion for years after scoring unnaturally good results for a player his age, was caught cheating in July 2019 at a tournament in Strasbourg, France. The whole world got to see how, as one of the participants followed him to the restroom and took a photo from above, over the edge of Rausis’s cubicle. The photo was then posted to social media and went viral. Soon, the story was everywhere, from the Washington Post to the Daily Mail and China Daily. The photo showed Rausis sat on the toilet seat with the lid closed, his pants on (making it slightly less embarrassing), holding a smartphone in his hands. His left leg rested on his right knee, with his trousers rolled up above the knee, revealing a large cloth bandage circling his lower leg. You could imagine it being used to hold a small device, and Rausis looking at his phone said it all. There can’t possibly be a clearer case of being caught red-handed. At the end of 2019, the FIDE Ethics and Disciplinary Commission dished out the strongest cheating punishment to date: Rausis was banned for six years and stripped of his grandmaster title. I did not publish my news report before contacting Rausis. I spoke to him the day after he got caught, and he informed me of the end of his chess career: “I simply lost my mind yesterday.… At least what I committed yesterday is a good lesson, not for me—I played my last game of chess already.” However, he couldn’t resist returning to the arena. In October 2020, Rausis appeared at a small rapid tournament in Latvia, playing under a new name. You couldn’t make this up. Rausis told me that he hadn’t changed his name so that he could play chess again but because he was embarrassed over the widely published and unflattering picture (the internet doesn’t forget). Apart from his old name being forever linked to the photo, he said he’d also changed his name because he felt ashamed for his family. He was now using the surname of his ex-wife, with whom he was still on good terms. Rausis died at the end of March 2024, after struggling with a serious illness for two decades. In the reactions to his death, statements such as “great chess player” and “friendly personality” predominated. Cheaters are human beings too. My Lawsuit Speaks for Itself On October 20, 2022, the Carlsen–Niemann saga entered a new chapter when Niemann started a major counterattack. On Twitter (now X), he shared a link to a 44-page legal document and wrote, “My lawsuit speaks for itself.” He was going to court. Niemann filed a defamation lawsuit in the Eastern Missouri District Court against five entities: the players Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, the companies Chess.com and Play Magnus Group, and Chess.com’s CCO Danny Rensch. The Play Magnus Group, a conglomerate of several small chess companies co-owned by the Carlsen family, would be acquired by Chess.com just two months later, while the lawsuit was still underway. Niemann demanded $100 million in damages from each party as he was claiming slander, libel, unlawful group boycott under the Sherman Act, tortious interference with contract and business expectancies, and civil conspiracy. Niemann stated that Carlsen, Nakamura, Chess.com, Play Magnus Group, and Rensch had been “egregiously defaming him and unlawfully colluding to blacklist him from the profession to which he has dedicated his life,” and that the whole situation had caused “devastating damages.” Regarding the alleged collusion, Niemann’s lawyers pointed for instance at Carlsen and Chess.com, referencing Chess.com’s planned takeover of Play Magnus. Their legal document noted that Chess.com’s decision to ban Niemann from their site right after Carlsen had accused Niemann of cheating “added instant credibility to Carlsen’s false allegations and suggested that they were true.” However, when I spoke to him for this book, Rensch told me personally that he had advised Carlsen not to withdraw from the Sinquefield Cup, and while Carlsen’s father and manager Henrik thanked him for the message, they decided to go down that path anyway. On June 27, 2023, a federal judge dismissed Niemann’s lawsuit. Initially, his attorneys intended to pursue the defamation claim, among others, in state court. However, by August 28 it became clear that the hatchet had been buried: Chess.com issued a statement that noted the legal dispute was concluded, and Niemann’s account on the site was reinstated. Without giving details of the settlement, the site noted: “Since June, both sides have negotiated privately in a good-faith effort to resolve their issues and allow the chess world to move forward without further litigation. We are happy to share that all sides have reached an agreement.” The text included statements from the two main characters. Carlsen admitted that “there is no determinative evidence that Niemann cheated in his game against me at the Sinquefield Cup.” Niemann said, “I look forward to competing against Magnus in chess rather than in court.” “We are literally not allowed to talk about it,” Danny Rensch told me. “We prefer to call it ‘an agreement to move on.’ Basically, Hans wanted back on Chess.com. Magnus wanted the whole thing to get behind him, and he knew the only way to do that was to agree to move forward. Chess.com acknowledged that it no longer had any evidence to justify a continued closure other than what we had already acted on, and so we all agreed to take our marbles and go home.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal directly affected the chess world in that some of the top tournaments in 2023, both online and over-the-board, increased their anti-cheating measures. It has since become standard almost everywhere that players are scanned with a metal detector before games. As well as being forbidden from carrying phones, they are also no longer allowed to wear a watch, whether it’s analog, digital, or a smartwatch. Spectators are no longer allowed to use phones in the playing hall either. In online events, players need to provide signals from multiple webcams, while there can also be audio monitoring, computer task manager review, and sometimes in-person on-site proctors. Not all tournaments take enough measures, though, which can lead to unpleasant situations. On October 12, 2023, the relatively unknown Kazakh player Alisher Suleymenov, who had earned the grandmaster title earlier in the year, defeated Magnus Carlsen in a spectacular game at the Qatar Masters in Doha. “I was completely crushed in my game today,” Carlsen tweeted. “This is not to accuse my opponent of anything, who played an amazing game and deserved to win, but, honestly, as soon as I saw my opponent was wearing a watch early in the game, I lost my ability to concentrate. I obviously take responsibility for my inability to deal with those thoughts properly, but it’s also incredibly frustrating to see organizers still not taking anti-cheating seriously at all (no transmission delay, spectators walking around the playing hall with smartphones).” Suleymenov did not respond to the tweet, and when asked about the game he said Carlsen lost due to a blunder on the board. Two months later, the other main character of the 2022 cheating scandal again attracted attention, but this time more positively. Niemann scored a career-best result by clinching the Tournament of Peace in Zagreb, Croatia, winning seven games and drawing two. His performance rating was 2956, among the best shown by any player in recent decades. On X, Niemann compared himself to Bobby Fischer, who had won the same tournament 53 years earlier. Suspicions started spreading when the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten came up with a story that included a rather vague quote from one of the organizers. Kresimir Podravec, the secretary of the Zagreb Chess Federation, reportedly said, “Niemann’s result is out of this world, but we have no definite proof that he cheated.” I don’t know if Niemann ever responded to this. Meanwhile, some of his opponents in the tournament complained about the lack of sufficient anti-cheating measures in the playing hall, but a week or two later, the chess world had moved on. But paranoia continued to exist in chess circles, particularly regarding online matches. When Vladimir Kramnik lost an online game to Niemann in September 2023, the 14th World Chess Champion uploaded a video expressing his surprise about some of his opponent’s moves. In subsequent months, Kramnik launched a personal campaign about the issue of cheating online, claiming it occurs much more often than we realize and that Chess.com isn’t doing enough to fight it. In late November, Chess.com responded in a blog post: “With the deepest respect for former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, in our opinion, his accusations lack statistical merit.” When Kramnik continued to express doubts about what he considered to be suspicious players’ performances, including those of a 12-year-old prodigy, Chess.com decided he had gone too far and closed the former world champion’s account on the site for violating its terms of service. It did not stop Kramnik from continuing to share his “statistics” on X. Chess.com’s Head of Cheat Detection Gerard Le-Marechal pointed out to me some larger implications of the Carlsen–Niemann scandal and how it has recently fed paranoia at the top level. He argued that it may have emboldened people to accuse others more openly—which is not a good thing. “There’s an interesting statistic we noticed,” Le-Marechal said. “Which is that during the time of the Niemann scandal, the rate at which people reported others increased across the site, then returned to normal after it died down, potentially suggesting that the scandal encouraged people to treat their fellow chessers with more suspicion as a whole where this did not reflect in the number of cheating cases detected.” The Carlsen–Niemann scandal’s final chapter arrived on December 12, 2023. Fourteen and a half months after FIDE started its investigation into the matter, its Ethics and Disciplinary Commission finally posted its long-awaited verdict on the FIDE website. Rumor had it that Carlsen might be banned from FIDE-rated tournaments for his allegations without proof, but he was ultimately found not guilty of the most important charges. The only penalty he received was a fine of €10,000 ($10,800) for “withdrawing without a valid reason” from the Sinquefield Cup. Could It Be Done? One question remains, and for that, we’re returning once more to those damn anal beads. Is it possible to cheat at chess using a vibrating device? Could it be done? The short answer is: probably, yes. But don’t take my word for it. You can find more than one video on the internet where people attempt to verify the theory by actually creating a vibrating device connected to a computer and hidden in a sex toy. The biggest among them is YouTuber Mike Boyd. His channel, which had three million subscribers in June 2024, documents the learning process of new challenges he gives himself. In a video from November 14, 2022, titled “Actually Making THAT Chess Cheat Device,” which has been viewed 2.3 million times, he did exactly the thing Elon Musk and others had joked about—a computer transmitted moves suggested by Stockfish to a vibrating anal toy connected to a receiver and transmitter. Boyd used the device (strapped on his right ankle, hidden by his trousers) to beat a friend who was a much stronger chess player—but also received many comments from viewers pointing out that his device would never get past a metal detector like those used at top-level chess tournaments. In a video posted a week later, Boyd showed that his device wasn’t so easily traceable. A metal detector started beeping when it hovered close to his watch, his smartphone in his pocket, a pocket knife, and even a two-gram scalpel blade, but remained silent when slid over the cheat device in his pocket. Only when the detector hit the spot quite fast would it produce a brief beep. Boyd’s conclusion: handheld metal detectors suck, and the thin silicon layer surrounding the electronic components was enough to bypass the detector. The fact that an anal bead could work wasn’t the biggest problem for the chess world. Boyd’s demonstration of it passing the metal detector was arguably much more damaging. That had also been demonstrated a month before in a real-life situation. That was in October 2022, at a prestigious chess event in Reykjavík. To figure out what is spotted by a metal detector and what isn’t, a Norwegian journalist arrived at the tournament with several devices attached to her body and let herself be examined. She had an earplug the size of a small grain placed right up to the eardrum. It was connected to a receiver hidden in her clothes, which could communicate with a smartwatch attached to the inside of her belt buckle. She also brought a walkie-talkie, a power bracelet, and a pair of sunglasses with earplugs. The result was alarming: while the walkie-talkie and the bracelet were revealed in the security check, the earplugs, smartwatch, and sunglasses were not. The Norwegian organizer Jøran Aulin-Jansson wasn’t too worried that players could get through the check with an electronic device, stating, “It is quite possible that they do it, but they don’t get to use it.” Ian Nepomniachtchi, one of the participants, was less comfortable: “I still don’t feel that it is safe. I heard that an NRK reporter got through. The criminals are always one step ahead.” I feel that over the last decade or so, more cheating might have occurred than we realize, especially at smaller open tournaments where organizers lack the means to enforce proper anti-cheating measures and where it’s relatively easy to bring your smartphone to the restroom. I would like to believe that I am wrong and that all chess players are good people, but, at the same time, I think FIDE has a task to help those organizers of smaller tournaments to level up their game. I also witnessed the paranoia firsthand at a tournament in Liechtenstein back in 2014, where I scored my second international master (IM) norm. In one of my games, I drew with a titled player and after the tournament, he accused me of cheating in a personal conversation: I couldn’t have played at 2400+ level with a rating of 2215. When I told him I had done it before, in a tournament in 2004, he only saw that as further proof that I wasn’t kosher. It is clear how much computers have impacted chess. The man versus machine matches, culminating in Kasparov–Deep Blue, raised the game’s profile. Ever since, computers have helped humans become stronger players. And we continued playing, even though the chess engines on our smartphones are now stronger than Deep Blue. While cheating continues to be an issue the chess world needs to deal with, my conclusion is that artificial intelligence has done more good than bad for chess overall. Plus there’s one big factor to explore, which I haven’t even mentioned yet. These days, most chess games are played between people who don’t know their opponents or where they are located. Millions of games are played daily between people across the globe, from their homes, the office, the train, or even the restroom. All this is possible thanks to the internet, an invention that seems like it was made for chess. We’ll explore the strong bond between chess and the internet next.",

But you could still play like a 5-minute game. You couldn’t play bullet of course, that wasn’t possible. The popularity of bullet started a couple of years later, when the speed of the Internet got fast enough for that.” —Sandro Leonori, long-time admin of the Internet Chess Club, 2023 In 1989, a 20-year-old student named Brian Karen from Long Island, New York, was working at a computer shop. He was responsible for the shipping department and phone sales, and, as it turned out, his interest in computers would soon be connected to his growing love for chess. When we spoke for this book, he revealed that he was one of the very first people ever to play an international game of chess in real-time on the internet: At college, the chess player on my floor in the dorm was one of my friends, and he said: “You’ve got to see this. You can play chess online!” This was at Syracuse University, and they had this big mainframe computer there. So I went with him. I had to go through the snow. We went to the computer center, and I played some guy, I think he was in Chile. And the way it would be, you type in like e2-e4 and hit return, and then the dot matrix printer would print out the board, like in text format, and you’d see his move, you know, e7-e5, or whatever it was. And we played the game. And I was like, wow, this is amazing. Back then, you had to pay a lot of money for long-distance calls, so to play someone in Chile was like, What? The first network of linked computers at different physical locations was set up in the mid-1960s at the American government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This network, named ARPANET, would later be connected to other networks from which the internet emerged. To play online chess in the late 1980s, you basically had to be living in the US where you could connect either via a university or by subscribing to one of the commercial networks, such as CompuServe, Prodigy, or the Sierra Network, that typically charged $2 to $7 an hour. Karen’s game with his Chilean opponent used a rudimentary form of what would soon see the light: the first dedicated server to play chess. It was born on January 15, 1992. Online Chess Emerges: ICS, FICS, ICC Created by Michael Moore and Richard Nash, the Internet Chess Server (ICS) was the first online chess server of many to come. It could be reached on the University of Utah’s server address lark.utah.edu via Telnet (short for “teletype network”), a protocol originally developed in 1969 allowing users to access and interact with another computer or device over a network. Users could log into a remote computer and execute commands as if they were physically at that computer’s terminal, or they could log into the ICS and play a game of chess. In July 1992, the ICS was moved to a host machine at Carnegie Mellon University, where a couple of undergraduate students ran it. Daniel Sleator, a professor of computer science at the university, started managing the project by the end of 1992. He improved the system, fixed bugs, added new features (most notably the “time-stamp” feature, a system that compensated for internet lag), copyrighted the code, and had a bit of fun now and then. On April 1, 1994, as an April Fools’ joke, he set the server code to “bogomode,” a setting that made the ratings go crazy. Suddenly, winning or losing games would result in gaining or dropping hundreds of rating points. After the settings were restored, one member emailed Sleator: “Why can’t I keep my rating of -11609? April Fools’ or not, I had the worst record.” As the number of accounts grew rapidly from roughly 2,000 in 1993 to 10,000 in early 1995, Sleator started to receive purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialize the server. With his wife, Lylia, and ICS administrators Marty Grund and Eric Peterson, he created a company himself instead. (Today, it is likely one of the ten oldest e-commerce sites that remains active at the time of writing, founded eight months after Amazon and six months before eBay.) On March 1, 1995, Sleator shared his decision with the members. Anyone who telnetted into the ICS saw the following message on their screen: “Important announcement for all members: Today, ICS has become the Internet Chess Club (ICC). Please type ‘help announce’ for all the details.” The most important of those details was the introduction of a fee. From now on, members would be charged $49 a year. The measure came as a shock to most as people were used to playing chess on the internet for free. Sleator’s announcement caused quite the uproar, leading to heated debates on the server and elsewhere. A quick follow-up announcement saying that students would only need to pay $24.50 a year didn’t help much to calm the waters. As tech journalist Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store, wrote in that summer of 1995, “Players lost their tempers and were exiled from the server, opposition groups were formed, lawsuits were threatened, ICC administrators were harassed, and plans to erect alternative servers were formed.” A small group of former ICS programmers decided to create a new, free club: the Free Internet Chess Server. FICS launched on the address fics.onenet.net in the first week of March 1995, just days after Sleator’s announcement. A few months later it had about 1,500 members, while the ICC had 11,000. Throughout the years, FICS remained the smaller sibling of the two, while many of the original naysayers eventually joined and paid for an ICC membership. Around 2009, ICC reached its peak of around 72,000 paying members, with many more using free trials or playing as guests. Asked if FICS was ever a true rival, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer Ruy Mora told me, “That’s tough to say because we couldn’t really measure. But I’m sure there was an impact. There’s a lot of people who don’t want to pay.” Even in 2024, both playing servers continue to exist, keeping a small but loyal user base in the shadow of two giants that occupy the current online landscape. In a way, the relationship between FICS and ICC is similar to the two dominant chess platforms today: Lichess, which is free to play, and the paid-for Chess.com. Starting in the mid-nineties, the “commercial” versus the “internet-should-be-free” vibe is still manifest today as a bit of an ideological rivalry between the two communities. John Fernandez, who was an admin for ICC in the late nineties, told me the analogy does work to some extent: “To some people, ICC were the evil capitalists out there to make money, and FICS was like, ‘We’re free, we’re open source, we’re all volunteers.’ You would use that as a shield, you know. ‘We’re the good guys, the self-proclaimed good guys.’ Lichess is certainly doing that as well.” The Intergalactic Chess Café What was it like to play chess online in those early days? The Dutch novelist and chess player Tim Krabbé described it wonderfully in an article in New in Chess magazine in 1995: It was a fateful night in February when I first saw that posting on the internet, in the newsgroup rec.games.chess. It suggested that I try telnet chess.lm.com 5000 and see how I would like it there. Before I knew what had happened, I had a screenful of names like turbopragma, CarbonNitride, Sartre, DEATH, GrandJaap, Hoho, toto, Barendregt, zigzag, CapedCrusader, Roman, gutterface; all chessplayers I understood—some of them, judging from the ratings next to their names, quite good, and all ready to play chess with me. When I had mastered my first few commands, and was able to read their personal files, I saw they were from all over the world, from the US, Iceland, New Zealand, Brazil, Turkey, Chile, India, even from Leiden [in the Netherlands], but regrettably few from Eastern Europe. DEATH was a student from Puerto Rico, HUS an IM from Singapore, Belsebub a blitz-only player, TheKiller a mathematician from Sweden, Galileo a father of four from San Diego, Pawngrubber a girl, Candide a Texan who turned out never to have heard of Pangloss and indeed, Roman was Roman Dzindzichashvili. He had already played over 1,500 blitz games there, and his rating was over 2800. The global village suddenly seemed like something from the past—this was a global living room; an Intergalactic Chess Cafe. Playing from Amsterdam, Krabbé tried out his first game and was paired against someone in Atlanta, Georgia. The distance between the two players was more than 7,000 kilometers (4,385 miles) but the experience was as exciting as Brian Karen’s: “Even so, those moves appeared on my screen instantly, bleep onto bleep, as if he were sitting across the table. It was overwhelming, mindboggling—the old dream of omnipresence come true.” I had a similar experience around that time. I had just moved to Amsterdam, where I studied for my master’s degree in Dutch Language and Literature at the University of Amsterdam while devoting much of my spare time to chess. A friend of mine, a student at the city’s other university (Vrije Universiteit), had access to the computer department where machines were connected to the internet. All you needed was a login, and he allowed me to use his. I created an account on FICS, logged in via Telnet, and played my first online games. I wasn’t playing on a normal-looking chessboard. Students couldn’t download and install software on the university computer, so Telnet was the only option. Because of that, I had to play on an ASCII board created by text characters. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a character-encoding standard for electronic communication limited to 95 printable characters. Since it was text only, the chessboard was built from vertical (|) and horizontal (—) lines creating a grid with 64 squares (but no distinction between light or dark!) and pieces in capital letters (P, N, B, R, Q, K), together with asterisks for the black pieces (*P, *N, *B, *R, *Q, *K). Each move had to be typed in by keyboard. The whole experience made it hard to focus on the actual chess, but I kept returning anyway, as the experience was indeed overwhelming and mindboggling. It looked like this, after White had played their first move: Soon, I got myself a computer and a 28.8 Kbps dial-up modem that allowed me to hook up to the internet from home. A modem was a piece of external hardware that converted data into a format suitable for an analog transmission medium, in this case, your telephone line. Older readers will remember the typical sound such a modem would make when the connection was initialized, something akin to the shrieking of an old tavern’s wooden door, leading to a digital world full of instantly accessible information—and crazy chess players. In Europe, most of the chess was played in the evening or during the night, for two reasons. This was when the Americans, and therefore most of the stronger players, would be online. But it was also cheaper because, in those days, making phone calls in the evening was charged at a lower rate than during the day. Still, there have been stories about chess players who faced a phone bill of over a thousand dollars after “clicking” chess moves for a month. Internet chess would never have exploded like it did if everyone was still playing with those impossible ASCII-based chessboards. Like the chess world’s Wright brothers, developers created chess server interfaces to play the game, and that’s when things took off. Dozens of such interfaces were developed. You had to pick one, download it from the anonymous file transfer site ftp://chess.onenet.net, unpack it, install it on your local machine, brew a nice cup of coffee, and enter the arena. This is what playing chess online (on the Free Internet Chess Server) looked like in the 1990s. One of the most popular was ZIICS, developed by Andy McFarland from Owensboro, Kentucky. It ran on MS-DOS, Microsoft’s operating system used in most personal computers. It co-existed for many years with Windows, launched in late 1985. ZIICS also required a graphics adapter, but then you could choose from several styles of piece sets from 32 pixels per square to 56 pixels per square, and you could configure the buttons’ colors and functions by editing a text file. If Vincent van Gogh had been into chess, he would have loved it. On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95, reportedly spending as much as $200 million on advertising. A year later, the program BlitzIn, which worked on Windows, became the most popular chess interface. It helped boost the success of ICC, and so did the massive influx of new members thanks to the live relay of the Kasparov–Deep Blue matches. Word spread quickly that there was a place where you could play chess and meet grandmasters 24/7. On the day Kasparov and Deep Blue played their second match game, the ICC set a record with 2,266 people online and 307 simultaneous games—a small step in hindsight but a giant leap at the time. On August 25, 1997, the ICC launched The King’s Messenger, an email newsletter for online chess. In its first issue, Danny Sleator wrote, “This newsletter was necessitated by the staggering growth of the ICC: now over 25,000 games are played every day, and the population reaches over 800 on an average night. The ICC has become one of the more significant organizations in world chess.” In early January 1998, about 40,000 games were played daily on the platform. A year later, this had grown to over 70,000. A large tournament for prize money in the year 2000 attracted 310 FIDE-rated players, among them 64 grandmasters. By 2002, the ICC had over 25,000 paying members; two years later that number had crossed 30,000. These numbers might seem tiny—incomparable to the numbers we’re seeing today—but at the time the growth was remarkable. Mouse Skills and Bullet Chess In 1964, Douglas Engelbart and Bill English built the first prototype of a device that moved a cursor on a computer screen. For decades, these devices were wired and therefore resembled the shape and size of a mouse—hence the name. As soon as online chess emerged, the mouse became indispensable. As the tool to execute the moves on the board, it was the chess player’s Nintendo game controller. Chess knowledge and the ability to calculate moves weren’t enough any more; developing mouse skills became critical to having success. One of the strongest players on the ICC in the mid-to-late nineties was the German grandmaster Roland Schmaltz, who played under the handle Hawkeye. In his 2004 book The Complete Chess Server Guide, he wrote a small segment titled “The Art of Mouse Mastery,” where he gave technical tips such as “adjusting the sample rate” in the computer settings and choosing “the right board size and mouse speed.” Schmaltz’s tips and tricks were mostly relevant to a special form of chess called bullet. It’s one of the fastest formats in chess, with players usually getting just one minute for a whole game. With a game averaging about 35 moves, you can think only for about two seconds per move. If you think longer early on, you will have even less time later in the game. This absolutely crazy (but very popular) way of playing chess often leads to insane time scrambles where players can make multiple moves in only a fraction of a second. In fact, most bullet games are decided by one player running out of time or “getting flagged,” in chess lingo. This phrase originates from over-the-board chess before the 2000s, when analog clocks would have a small lever, called a flag, that would drop if the large hand reached the hour. When I was in touch with ICC founder Danny Sleator for this book, he forwarded me an email he sent to some of the administrators in 1995, with “bullet chess” in the subject field. It describes how the name for this spectacular format came about, and that a separate rating system was needed on the server. (Below are only the first two paragraphs of a longer email.) To: sleator+icc-admins@CS.CMU.EDU Subject: bullet chess Date: Wed, 23 Aug 1995 14:14:21 -0400 Message-ID: <6304.809201661@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> From: Daniel Sleator <Daniel_Sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> Sender: sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU I’m going to introduce a new rating. I’m proposing to call it a “bullet” rating. (Alternative would be “lightening” [sic] but that’s too long and awkward. I would entertain other ideas for names.) I talked to several people about where the boundary between bullet and blitz should be. (POTZY, Surf, Broncept have all given me their opinions.) I’d like to solicit your opinions on this matter. You could also play one-minute chess on FICS, where it was not called bullet but lightning (the alternative name Sleator had suggested!). My good friend Arne Moll, a very active online player at the time, noted that this was an example of the rivalry between the two servers: “On FICS, there was some kind of hatred against the word. They would say: ‘Bullet,’ that’s ICC, that’s a shitty, commercial name. We call this ‘lightning.’ ” Whatever it was called, the new format caught on. The American grandmaster Larry Christiansen wrote, in the late 1990s, “Bullet chess is to tournament chess as slapstick comedy is to high drama, or tabloid journalism is to literature. Maybe that is why it is so popular.” Some players had more talent (or taste) for it than others. There’s no denying that bullet chess involves a lot of “dirty tricks” that can help to gain valuable time in the final phases of the game, when it’s all about avoiding getting flagged. One of them is to voluntarily give up a piece simply because of the surprise value and the extra half-second it will take for the opponent to execute their move. Also, in bullet chess, players often continue playing positions where they would normally agree to a draw to try to flag the opponent—opinions are divided on whether this is unsports-manlike behavior. And then there’s the infamous premove: the possibility of, after having made your move, making your next move before your opponent makes one—something unthinkable in over-the-board chess—if you’re certain of your next turn. While the opponent thinks, you can drag your mouse and move one of your pieces to another square. As soon as it’s your move, the server executes your “premoved” move, and you don’t lose any time on your clock. It is a gamble, though, as the success of a premove depends heavily on an expected reply from the opponent. Roland Schmaltz agreed that particularly those final seconds of a game do not have much to do with chess, but stressed that chess skills are still important in bullet: “You are no longer focused on finding the best move. You are focused on finding the most unpleasant move for your opponent to make him lose more time. To achieve your goal, you still have to think in chess terms, but, more importantly, like in a normal chess game, you must think ahead!” And, indeed, to this day the strongest bullet players are also the strongest players in general. As I write this, Chess.com’s 2023 Bullet Chess Championship has just finished, with Hikaru Nakamura beating Magnus Carlsen in the final—the world number one and number two in classical chess, then. A fun moment during the 2023 Bullet Chess Championship on Chess.com in the game between Magnus Carlsen and Daniel Naroditsky. Addiction On August 30, 1999, Loek van Wely from the Netherlands and Alexander Rustemov from Russia played well over a hundred blitz games on the ICC, with a time control of five minutes for a whole game. It turned into a heroic match, a hard-fought and long battle that attracted a lot of online spectators who logged in from many different time zones—because, in the end, the two grandmasters played for 20 hours straight. My compatriot Van Wely won by a score of 64–60 wins, with 13 draws over a total of 137 games. Now, that’s dedication. Or is it something else? The 1895 essay “Concerning Chess” by H. G. Wells opens with the following famous passage: “The passion for playing chess is one of the most unaccountable in the world. It slaps the theory of natural selection in the face. It is the most absorbing of occupations. The least satisfying of desires. A nameless excrescence upon life. It annihilates a man. You have, let us say, a promising politician, a rising artist that you wish to destroy. Dagger or bomb are archaic and unreliable—but teach him, inoculate him with chess.” Although chess addiction is probably as old as the game itself, I believe it’s much easier to get addicted to online chess. The English grandmaster Danny Gormally did not shy away from the truth when he published an article in New in Chess magazine in 2008 titled “Diary of an ICC Addict.” He compared playing online to drugs: “[T]he user experiences a serotonin cascade in the pre-frontal lobe of his brain similar to a drug which could be described as psychotropic. This leads to more and more use, as the addict chases his high, which he finds increasingly difficult to replicate in his humdrum everyday existence.” A comparison to avid casino visitors comes to mind when you realize that chess players sometimes reach for the last resort: asking for a self-ban. Don’t let me in anymore. The same Gormally wrote in his 2016 book A Year Inside the Chess World: “Eventually it dawned on me that playing blitz online all day was a complete waste of my life so I asked them to ban me, being seemingly incapable of stopping playing myself. I was just playing all day, every day.” It’s not a watertight solution because sometimes people create a new account to circumvent their ban. Is blitz chess a drug? In a more recent article in New in Chess magazine, Jennifer Vallens has pointed out that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has added Internet Gaming Addiction as one of the potential disorders that need to be treated: “The APA explains that internet gaming activates reward systems similarly to using drugs. The euphoric feeling when you win a match or unlock an achievement is the same as getting high, as both activities trigger dopamine releases in the brain. When addicts get engrossed playing online games, certain pathways in their brains are triggered in the same direct and intense way that a drug addict’s brain is affected by a particular substance.” Some people just cannot stop playing. They really play a lot. But how much is a lot? One Chess.com account played 436,770 games between April 2014 and June 2021, an average of 167 games per day. Among the titled players, one grandmaster played more games than anyone: 180,000 since 2009. On ICC, one of the members played over 740,000 games between 1996 and 2024, an average of 72 games a day for 28 years straight. A note in his profile says that ICC is “the best chess club in the world.” The American writer and podcaster James Altucher was one of the early users of ICC’s precursor ICS, as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon under Danny Sleator. He told me: I was an addict. I was working a job I didn’t like. I was in a relationship I was unhappy with. One time, it was around 6:00 p.m., I was at work. My girlfriend called me and said, “Don’t forget we have guests coming for dinner at 6:30.” So I was going to play one more game. At midnight she banged on my office door, which was locked. I was in a one-minute match that went on for hours with this guy from Israel. I was just an addict, I couldn’t stop. Then I got home around 7 a.m., and she was just leaving to go to classes. I remember she was so upset with me that she threw a bag filled with textbooks at me and left. It wasn’t the end of the relationship, but it was close. Probably the most addictive aspect of online chess is the time-trouble phase, which occurs late in the game when adrenaline sets in, and every decision feels decisive. It’s basically life or death, killing a wild animal before it gets to you, move after move. No wonder chess has often been compared to boxing. “The emotional impulse behind chess, and the pain it inflicts, is comparable but just takes a different form,” according to the Scottish grandmaster and philosopher Jonathan Rowson. Because most games are played at a quick time control of ten, five, or three minutes—or even one minute—per game, just about every game will see such a time-trouble phase. Among my friends, the most popular format is three-minute chess, which means that during a longer session, that thrilling moment when everything is on the line and the seconds are ticking away occurs roughly every five minutes, again and again: a rush of blood to the head. A quick trip to where the action happens. A brief, intense sense of living—on repeat. Another reason for online addiction is the ratings. Every online server works with its own application of Arpad Elo’s rating system. Because almost all players use a handle (nickname) when playing online, they’re defined by their rating, which is constantly visible alongside their virtual name and updated after every game. A good day’s results in a higher rating, and you feel great, but if the number goes down, it can completely ruin your day (or night). As Krabbé put it, “The ego has its needs too.” The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler told me a story about reaching the highest-ever rating on the platform: I was a very heavy ICC user, and then I just basically quit cold turkey and stopped playing online chess for, like, 15 years. One day, I played a very long match and won by a small margin. Then I beat another player in a ten-game match, and, by the end of it, I got the record. I got to 3318. It got badly broken by Hikaru Nakamura and others later, but at that point, for a brief moment, that was the highest-ever blitz rating. So I got the record. I was still kind of high, still feeling the buzz, and I got challenged by Hawkeye. I thought, “Why not?” But in that match, I didn’t play well. It was 5–5. And while you’re playing, you’re not paying much attention to anything but playing the game. When I finished, I looked up, and I was, like, 3092. Because [Roland Schmaltz] wasn’t very high rated, but he was much better than his rating, obviously. And I just looked at this and thought: “What am I doing here? Why am I spending hours and hours doing this?” I realized that the gains I had made over months and months—climbing further when you’re already 3250 is not very easy—were all gone. It would take me another three months to return to whatever it was an hour ago. And I thought, “No, I should maybe just stop.” Now I only play in tournaments and when I stream. In November 2023, Hikaru Nakamura set a new all-time high record blitz rating on Chess.com: 3336. It took just a few weeks for the always competitive Magnus Carlsen to top it, getting to 3340 on December 6 (only to reach even higher numbers before the end of the year). He commented to Norwegian media: I was on a sponsor event in the Bahamas this week and played some games online on Monday. On Tuesday I played Titled Tuesday and was planning to go to bed, but then I found out that I was close to Hikaru’s rating record. Then I thought I could play a few games and take the record. I was pretty close five times. But then it pissed me off so much that I kept going for hours and finally at 3 a.m. I had the record. I was actually pretty chill before that. But afterward I was so excited and struggled to sleep. It was fun, but then I thought, “I can’t be going on like this!” My friend Arne Moll has noted another aspect of online chess addiction, which he calls “the hate.” Sometimes we play badly, and losing sucks. Losing to bad players sucks even more, as it leads to a rating drop into regions that are just embarrassing. On such nights, you tend to play for too long with the idle hope of turning the tide. But it only gets worse. There is nothing new about this. This extract from an article titled “The Hate” by FICS member pdeck reads as if it could have been written yesterday instead of in 1998: I have the hate. I hate my opponent. I hate the spectators that goaded me into playing an extended series with someone who often gets my rating points. I hate the guys in the Lightning Channel for teasing me about my blunders and then logging off at midnight, leaving me to fester in a death spiral of worthless, repetitive chess punctuated only by one or two mad dashes to the men’s room or poorly stocked vending machines. More than anything, I hate myself. I spend too much god-damned time playing lightning, giving up both work and sleep. And what do I have to show for it? A shitty rating. The silliness about online ratings is mostly revealed by what I call the round-number idiocy. All chess players are prone to it, but they can take comfort in realizing they’re not unique. It is typical human behavior. Studies have shown that those who wear fitness trackers, professional baseball players, and high school SAT takers exert more effort when their performance falls just short of a round number rather than just above. And it goes even further, as shown in research from 2020 undertaken at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. The study determined that people have a preference for round numbers over specific numbers—that, for instance, people informed by health officials that a newly developed COVID-19 vaccine was 91.27 percent effective would likely think it was a less effective vaccine than if they were told it was 90 percent effective. Chess players, from total beginners to world champions, are obsessed with round-numbered ratings. Magnus Carlsen peaked at 2882 (twice) and, for a while, attempted to break 2900. Those 18 points mattered. It was big news when the French-Iranian prodigy Alireza Firouzja broke the 2800 rating barrier in December 2021 at 18 years and 166 days (breaking Carlsen’s previous record of 18 years and 336 days). For club players, making it to 2000 is a big deal. And then 2100—and then 2200. My own peak rating was 2292 in October 2004, and it still annoys me that I didn’t get to 2300. This leads to nonsensical, but familiar, behavior online. You play a few games in the evening, your rating has dropped to 1950, and you decide: “I’ll play until my rating is over 2000 again.” You win some, you lose some. Before you know it, it’s after midnight, and you suddenly notice your rating is 1998. Just one more win and you can call it a day. But you don’t win. In fact, you somehow never win that last game. At four in the morning, with a rating of 1911, you give up, frustrated and exhausted. You’ll have to find your way to your bed knowing you’re a terrible chess player because you don’t belong in that group of players above 2000. Often, you log on the next morning, fresh again, win a bunch of games in a row, break 2000, and don’t understand why that went so easy. You promise you will never play late in the evening again. But you will, maybe even on that same day. I’ve experienced many such evenings of online blitz silliness, but I’m cured now. The only way to avoid them is to play unrated games, the equivalent of zero-alcohol beer. It’s not the real thing. But many others can’t stop. Those heavy users with over a hundred games per day on average might have a serious problem. I feel worried sometimes about those heavy users, and I wonder if Chess.com and Lichess could do more to help the real addicts. Everyone Played. Everyone? The Internet Chess Club is a true pioneer of online chess. It can boast several milestones: the first online chess lecture in April 1995; the first internet simultaneous exhibition by a world champion (Garry Kasparov), in November 1995; the first intercollegiate online chess tournament, a month later; and the first top grandmasters playing online for prize money in November 1999. Around then, John Fernandez was hired as the public relations director tasked with growing the ICC further. He started working on sponsorships, banner advertising, and building relationships with organizers. For the next decade, the ICC was the place to be. In the early 2000s, the British newspaper the Sunday Telegraph wrote: “There are more than 300 places to play chess on the Internet but, as with nightclubs, there is only one place the ‘A list’ gravitates to: the Internet Chess Club.” The absolute top players of the time became active on the site: people like Veselin Topalov, Alexei Shirov, Nigel Short, and even Garry Kasparov, but also a young Hikaru Nakamura and an even younger Magnus Carlsen. It helped that grandmasters got free accounts, and Fernandez put a lot of effort into getting them to play on the site. During the 1999 FIDE World Chess Championship—a knockout event with a hundred participants held in Las Vegas—Fernandez gave all of the entrants a gift bag with a personal letter and a floppy disk that had the BlitzIn interface pre-installed to make it easier for the grandmasters to start playing. And it worked. All players logged in at least once, except one: the 68-year-old Viktor Korchnoi, a living legend but also a bit of a grumpy old man. Fernandez recalls: “He mumbled something and threw the envelope in the nearest bin.” Especially after Vegas 1999, just about all the big names joined the ICC. Nakamura had started playing as early as 1997, when he was nine years old, on an account he shared with his brother and stepfather. In 1999 he created a new one named YearoftheRabbit and used it until most strong players knew who he was. Starting from 2001, he played under Smallville, after the American superhero TV series that ran between 2001 and 2011. “I wanted an anonymous account, and, at the time, I was a big fan of the TV show,” Nakamura told me. Between 2001 and 2011 he played 15,306 blitz games and 13,967 bullet games on this account. He was also one of the first grandmasters to seriously benefit from online chess as a youngster because he would download his games and look for mistakes he’d made with the computer. But mostly, he would just play—a lot. I remember that around 2008–9 Nakamura stayed at my place in Amsterdam for one night as he had mistakenly booked a connecting flight on the wrong date. The next morning, I started working in the living room as quietly as I could, hiding behind a big computer screen while he slept on the couch. Eventually, he woke up and got out of the sleeping bag. Only then did I notice he was still wearing his clothes. We exchanged good mornings, and he sat down behind his laptop. Soon, I heard the type of mouse-clicking that could mean only one thing: he was playing blitz. That’s how you get good: when something is on your mind first thing in the morning, before breakfast, before anything else. Magnus Carlsen joined the ICC around 2001 and created the account imtobesoon. After becoming an IM, he ambitiously continued with the account gmtobesoon, and when that title was in the bag, he changed it to Magnus. Later on, the Norwegian prodigy used multiple anonymous accounts. He and Nakamura likely first played each other online in 2004. What would turn out to become a rivalry lasting over two decades all started with a friendly match between Magnus and Smallville on July 18, 2004. Over 12 games with a time control of three minutes per person (and no increment), 13-year-old Carlsen beat 16-year-old Nakamura 9–3, with no draws. The ICC made it a lot easier for people to play a game of chess against someone. You no longer had to follow the annoying social code of taking a shower and getting dressed before moving your king’s pawn. In the late 1990s, founder Danny Sleator noted that his online club encouraged people to play chess who normally wouldn’t bother going out to a club: “I’ve heard a lot of people say that. I am an example of this.” Just about everyone was trying their luck with online chess, although, as with all new technological developments, there were skeptics too. John Saunders, a very nice English fellow whom I met at many tournaments where he was working as a journalist and photographer, is one such person. He said in an interview in 1999: “Chess is like sex—it is only healthy when it involves two consenting humans in the same room. It is a social game. How can people enjoy playing chess when they masquerade under names like ‘Kingkicker’ and exchange no more dialogue than the perennial ‘thanx?’ Okay, I’m a hypocrite because I HAVE played Internet chess, am no good at it, and have a ‘handle’ which is an ancient Greek word meaning ‘I thrust a radish up the fundament.’ But I do not find it addictive or attractive.” Apart from the few critics, just about everyone who played chess played on the ICC. For a brief time that may have included a certain Bobby Fischer. On September 9, 2001, the English grandmaster Nigel Short wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph in which he claimed to be “99 percent sure” that he had faced the American former world champion in almost 50 online games. It was tremendously exciting news for chess fans; even those who didn’t believe it wanted to believe it. Any news related to Fischer, who had completely disappeared from the chess scene once again after beating Spassky in 1992, was fascinating. The thought of him playing chess again was just wonderful. Short revealed that in his first encounter, he lost 8–0, despite his mysterious opponent playing “some highly irregular if not totally absurd opening moves.” He would shift all his pawns forward by one square or play his king toward the center of the board as early as move two. “From this deliberately unpromising position emerged moves of extraordinary power,” said Short. “In this first game, I was totally crushed.” While chatting with his opponent, Short noticed that he knew a great deal about the major chess players of the 1960s, which happened to be Fischer’s most active period. Short decided to test him and asked his opponent if he knew of Armando Acevedo, an obscure Mexican player. He got an instant reply: “Siegen, 1970.” Because Fischer had played Acevedo at the Siegen Chess Olympiad in West Germany in 1970, Short felt “the guy was trying to tell me something.” The games were not recorded because Short had used a guest account (respecting his opponent’s wishes). ICC’s Danny Sleator, therefore, could not investigate Short’s claim that it was Fischer. However, soon it was revealed—somewhat sadly, I may add—who the mysterious opponent was: a Canadian network expert who used a chess engine. On January 28, 2002, Fischer himself said in an interview on Icelandic television that he never played on the internet. Alas, the mystery had been more enticing while still unsolved. Most grandmasters playing on the site didn’t keep their identity a secret. In fact, many of them would provide some extra details in their profile. I especially liked the notes from the English grandmaster David Norwood, who used the handle DaveNoGood for playing: Dave Norwood Retired grandmaster … ashamed to keep the title I only play 1 g3 and 1 … g6 4.If my play gets a bit funny it may have something to do with what I’m drinking … One of the many stories from those early days of internet chess is about a man whose life was saved while playing online. In September 1997, 48-year-old Charles Drafts started to feel a shortness of breath and dizziness during a game and sent a message to all members, saying, “I’m having physical illness problems and need help.” Drafts was a double amputee who lived in Boston’s housing projects in Mission Hill and who typed using a stick in his mouth. Some chess fans thought his message was a joke, but, luckily, others took it seriously. They asked Drafts to type his address and asked about his symptoms. Andy McFarland, one of the ICC admins, called Boston’s emergency medical services, and, eventually, firefighters broke down the door and rushed Drafts to Beth Israel hospital, where he was stabilized. The Charles Drafts story is an example of something that should not be underestimated about those early years of online chess: the social aspect. People came online not only to play a game of chess but also to meet people. Because, back then, there were so many fewer people online at the same time than we’ve grown accustomed to nowadays (3,000 concurrent players would push the server to its limits), and because of how things were structured, everyone could fairly easily talk to each other, and amateurs regularly conversed with top players. For most chess fans who didn’t travel internationally to tournaments, it was the first time in their lives that they could communicate with chess players from abroad. International master Greg Shahade, who started playing online in 1995, told me, “Girls approached me on FICS. I made a lot of friends.” For others, it went further: there are several stories of people getting married after first speaking to each other on the ICC. A Dutch chess player named his son after the handle he used online: Jaap. The chess servers had special chat channels, technically the same as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), to serve these social needs: you could start a private channel among your friends, or join one of the open channels with specific subjects. There was, for instance, a music channel, and a trivia channel where a bot would throw in trivia questions all day, and everyone providing answers would automatically be included in the daily rankings. ICC’s most popular channel was 97, dedicated to (mostly American) politics and more liberal than other channels when it came to foul language. “I also tried regular chat rooms in those days, but these would be meaningless,” Arne Moll told me. “You would sit there with random Americans. What should you talk about? Chess connects, and that’s the great thing. An ICC chat room was like a local pub full of international people who loved chess. It was quite special.” These days, we have individual chess communities active on social media platforms like Discord, X, Reddit, and Telegram, but they are somewhat scattered. Sites like Chess.com or Lichess don’t have chat channels, but maybe they should. Mark Crowther: Unsung Hero As desktop computers and other workstations became more connected globally in the late 1970s, there was a growing interest in sharing information. This led to a particular type of network called the Bulletin Board System (BBS), which allowed users to post messages like they would on a physical thumbtack bulletin board. USENET launched in 1978 as a global bulletin board that established the concept of newsgroups, where like-minded users could exchange messages on their topics of interest. It was estimated that in 1990 there were 265,000 users on five continents. One of these newsgroups was rec.games.chess, launched in 1987. People started sharing anything related to chess, and some even took up the task of typing out the full notation of recently played tournament games. This particular newsgroup kick-started the incredible acceleration of the availability of chess information, which would have enormous consequences for the game. One avid chess fan from Clayton, a suburb of Bradford in northern England, would play a vital role in this development and, as most chess fans are unaware, still does. Born in 1966, Mark Crowther learned the rules of chess in 1972, the year of the famous Fischer–Spassky match. He played chess at school and joined a local club. After studying information sciences in Leeds, Crowther found a job as a librarian/technician at Bradford University’s Modern Languages Center in the late 1980s. Crowther had a desire to collect and a love to share. He got a computer account in the library, joined the rec.games.chess newsgroup, and soon became one of the most active users, sharing recent chess games he found in newspaper chess columns and other media available in his library. Using a Linux system, he manually typed them in almost daily until he decided to turn it into a weekly thing. On September 17, 1994, he launched the first issue of The Week in Chess (TWIC). After seven weeks, he had learned enough HTML to set up his first website and post links to all TWIC issues. A legendary online magazine was born. Initially, Crowther combined collecting games with his day job. “I used to work at the university, finish on Friday, go to the computer center and do it on Friday night and Saturday, and go back to work on Monday,” he said. That went on for about a year and a half until it became too much: “Very quickly, I got pushed into publishing more and more games. It got out of control very quickly. And then it became: either I give up or go pro. That was the choice.” In 1996, Crowther briefly worked for the Canadian enterprise Thoth Communications Corporation. Between 1997 and 2012, he was sponsored by journalist and entrepreneur Malcolm Pein. As the owner of London’s Chess & Bridge shop, Pein used TWIC to send its readers to his online shop. Crowther got paid, and Pein got his online book sales. In 2012 the collaboration ended, and since then Crowther has relied on advertising, subscriptions, and donations. To me, Crowther is a legend, one of the unsung heroes of the chess world who deserves more credit than he gets. When I interviewed him in 2019 on the occasion of TWIC’s 25th anniversary, he told me that he was doing well, though he had some slight worries about his pension: “It’s a fun business to be in, but it’s not very secure. I’m going to have to work for another 20 years. But I enjoy doing it. I never go to bed on a Monday without finishing TWIC. It’s unthinkable. It’s how you get it done.” As I type this, TWIC is still going strong, a stunning 30 years after its inception. It appears on Mondays and summarizes the results of international chess tournaments. More importantly, Crowther provides a file with all the games played over the last week that anyone can download for free. These days, a single file can easily contain a few thousand games. Since 1994, the TWIC database has grown to over three and a half million games. Crowther doesn’t keep track of the figures, but chess fans who click the download button each week—from seasoned grandmasters to aspiring youngsters—must number in their thousands. Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand told me, “I remember, I think it was some time in 1995 that I first heard about The Week in Chess. I downloaded my first one then, and I cannot think of too many [other] routines that I’ve stuck to every single week for the last 25 years. [TWIC is] just really an institution in chess.” The Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, of a younger generation, expressed a similar sentiment in a tweet in August 2015: “When more than two TWICs are missing on your laptop, you know that something has gone wrong with your chess routine.” Why was TWIC so revolutionary? Well, having information about your opponent is vital. Before the internet, that wasn’t easy to get. One of the people who helped provide games for Crowther in the early years was Australia’s number-one player, Ian Rogers. Becoming a world-class grandmaster himself in the 1980s, while combining his successful playing career with chess journalism, Rogers witnessed firsthand how the internet changed the sport. “Before TWIC, you had Murray Chandler’s Tournament Chess,” said Rogers. “This magazine was not much more than printouts of games, with the occasional diagram, but it was invaluable. You traveled with it. If you were playing a tournament and had games from tournaments where your opponent had played before, it was very useful to have info on that.” Rogers toured Europe in those years with his wife Cathy, due to the lack of tournaments in Australia. Along with Tournament Chess, he and his colleagues would pack recent copies of Chess Informant or New in Chess Yearbooks in their suitcases: thick manuals containing hundreds of recent top-level games and analyses printed on thin paper, resembling phonebooks, another relic of the past. Other sources of information were periodicals such as British Chess Magazine, the German Schach 64, the Swiss weekly Die Schachwoche, and specialized books on chess openings. There was always a limit to the amount of material you could bring to a tournament, so books and clothes would be fighting for luggage space. With TWIC, preparing for a game was suddenly child’s play as it became much easier to find games played by your opponent, even as recently as the previous week. Moreover, you could now store thousands of games on a single floppy disk, which saved a huge amount of space. TWIC was particularly useful for chess players working with one of the chess database programs that were starting to become popular in those years as well. KasparovChess and the Dotcom Bubble While TWIC had the chess information and the ICC was the place to play, the internet landscape was changing rapidly. Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web was all the rage, and the first browsers started to appear: first Mosaic in 1993, then Netscape Navigator in 1994, followed by Internet Explorer in 1995. Just 16 months after Marc Andreessen and James Clark formed Netscape, the company had a historic initial public offering, or IPO, on August 9, 1995. On the first trading day, the stock opened at $28 per share and closed at $58.25 per share, giving the company a market value of about $2.9 billion. Andreessen became a multimillionaire, and Clark moved toward being the first internet billionaire. Netscape went public without previously having made a profit, a groundbreaking move at the time that contributed to a surge in interest in making money on the internet. A speculative mania, dubbed the “dot-com bubble,” led to a collapse in the early 2000s of many companies. KasparovChess was one of the failed start-ups. World champion since 1985, Garry Kasparov had launched a “Club Kasparov” website in early 1999, mainly written in Russian. The same year, the location of the site was changed to kasparovchess.com with the launch of a new business backed by mostly Israeli investors. Offices in the US, UK, Russia, and Israel opened as the international content team grew to about 30 members. Kasparov Chess Online (KCO), as it was officially named, was intended to be the dominant chess platform for both strong and casual players, parents, and kids. The site ambitiously advertised itself as “the home of chess on the web.” It offered everything: a playing zone, a news section, a forum, an event calendar, a shop, a magazine, downloadable multimedia lessons, and regular contributions from Kasparov himself, who often sent “express commentary” on the same day he played in a tournament. One of the key assets of KCO, which was fairly new at the time, was that users could play chess in a browser via an HTML interface. The main business model was both typical of those days and hardly viable: trying to build a huge base of free users who would be exposed to advertising. By 2002 a total of $13 million of investment was burned, including Kasparov’s personal injection of $110,000. The company was hardly making money. In September 2002 the board of directors decided to pull the plug. According to New in Chess magazine, Kasparov blamed the demise of his platform on “disputes between the minority Israeli stockholders who controlled the business and administrative functions of the company, and the majority stockholders associated with him.” Mig Greengard, who worked on content for KCO, wrote at the time: “The Israeli money-men thought it was more important to employ a group of Israeli programmers costing over $100,000 per month than have grandmasters, writers, and other chess people costing a fraction of that. Instead of cutting back, they went down with the ship over Kasparov’s protests.” I don’t know if the Israeli team ever responded to Greengard’s version of how things went down, but they likely saw it differently. This was not the end of the story. On Christmas Eve 2002, the First International Bank of Israel (FIBI), which had lent $1.6 million to KCO demanded the site be reopened and sought unspecified damages in a court in Delaware, where the company was registered. Effectively, the bank attempted to seize permanent control of the world-class asset of Kasparov’s name and likeness as compensation for their failed loan. On December 27, a US chancery judge ruled against the bank, calling the case “far too thin.” From a historical perspective, it’s interesting to note that Jay Severson, one of the future cofounders of Chess.com, had a rendezvous with KasparovChess somewhere between 1999 and 2000. Severson was working at Case’s Ladder, a Seattle-based online solutions provider for tournaments, leagues, brackets, and ladders. As the market leader in that area, the company was approached by KasparovChess for the rather ambitious plan to run a worldwide tournament for kids in schools, which would end up with a live final somewhere. They needed logistical support, arbiters, the whole shebang. “I remember laughing at the email, going, like, ‘These guys are nuts,’ ” Severson told me. Even for Chess.com in 2024, with all its resources, it would be hard to pull off a tournament involving millions of players. But KasparovChess wanted it and flew Severson out to New York City. “When I reached their floor, I was, like, ‘Wow!’ ” he said. “It was a humongous floor, first off. I remember there were a lot of cubicles, and I thought: This company is huge. I was blown away that they could afford such nice, high-rise office space in Manhattan.” Severson presented his calculations and estimates and showed the total sum of what it would cost. “It was a ridiculous number; it was in the millions,” he said. “I was supposed to be in New York for two days. The meeting lasted maybe an hour or two at the most, and they were just, like, ‘All right, thanks for coming, but we’re not going to continue with your services.’ So I basically had a two-day paid vacation in Manhattan. I went sightseeing and still remember having a Midori sour in the Windows on the World bar on the top floor of the World Trade Center’s North Tower.” KasparovChess suddenly resurfaced in April 2021, described as “a new multimedia content platform for chess lovers of all skill levels.” The platform hosted puzzles, online matches, tutorials, articles, documentaries, and an exclusive master class by Kasparov for premium members. Like with the first iteration of the site, there was an emphasis on multimedia lessons. Hundreds of videos had been pre-recorded, often featuring some of the world’s most famous grandmasters. In short, the site looked slick and promising. Would it work this time around? For the relaunch Kasparov partnered with global media company Vivendi. The company, the owner of businesses like Canal+ and Dailymotion, was also an early sponsor of the Grand Chess Tour, an annual circuit of chess tournaments to which Kasparov was a special advisor. Vivendi’s subsidiary Keysquare provided a starting capital of $3.5 million. The business model was quite different from the one in 1999–2000, this time going for freemium: some content was free, but the best material was available for a $13.99 monthly fee or $119.99 for a yearly subscription—for comparison, an annual Diamond membership on Chess.com, providing all the premium features, went for $99 that year. For a few months in 2021, KasparovChess gained quite a bit of traction as top grandmasters promoted their videos on social media. Two years later, nobody was talking about the company any more. It’s not easy to explain why Kasparov’s online enterprises failed twice. I believe that, in the early 2000s, it was a combination of perhaps naive management and bad timing: the market of chess players wishing to spend money on the internet just wasn’t big enough yet. Two decades later, it might have been too saturated: KasparovChess couldn’t claim a sizeable market share from the existing and successful commercial platforms, most notably Chess.com. Meanwhile, in those early 2000s, the ICC went from strength to strength, although not without facing competition. Several others tried to set up playing servers as a business, including Yahoo!Chess, Chess.net, the World Chess Network, Chesslive, Chesspark, and Chesscube. In the market for club-level players, the ICC’s biggest rival was Playchess, a playing server developed by ChessBase and launched in October 2001. Many serious amateurs, as well as grandmasters, would have accounts on both ICC and Playchess, and the two companies presided over a roughly equal market share for a few years. The next chapter will explore how they were relegated to marginal players, losing the battle to Lichess and Chess.com. With the incredible rise in popularity of online chess since the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, it’s easy to forget that playing chess over the internet is basically as old as the internet itself. Thanks to technology, playing a game in real time with someone at the other end of the world has been possible since the late 1980s. Chess was already a game without limitations, as it could be played between opponents of any age, gender, ethnic group, political affiliation, or religion. Now, distance was not a problem either. It took a few decades before the true global revolution would take place, but the seeds had been sown.",

But you could still play like a 5-minute game. You couldn’t play bullet of course, that wasn’t possible. The popularity of bullet started a couple of years later, when the speed of the Internet got fast enough for that.” —Sandro Leonori, long-time admin of the Internet Chess Club, 2023 In 1989, a 20-year-old student named Brian Karen from Long Island, New York, was working at a computer shop. He was responsible for the shipping department and phone sales, and, as it turned out, his interest in computers would soon be connected to his growing love for chess. When we spoke for this book, he revealed that he was one of the very first people ever to play an international game of chess in real-time on the internet: At college, the chess player on my floor in the dorm was one of my friends, and he said: “You’ve got to see this. You can play chess online!” This was at Syracuse University, and they had this big mainframe computer there. So I went with him. I had to go through the snow. We went to the computer center, and I played some guy, I think he was in Chile. And the way it would be, you type in like e2-e4 and hit return, and then the dot matrix printer would print out the board, like in text format, and you’d see his move, you know, e7-e5, or whatever it was. And we played the game. And I was like, wow, this is amazing. Back then, you had to pay a lot of money for long-distance calls, so to play someone in Chile was like, What? The first network of linked computers at different physical locations was set up in the mid-1960s at the American government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This network, named ARPANET, would later be connected to other networks from which the internet emerged. To play online chess in the late 1980s, you basically had to be living in the US where you could connect either via a university or by subscribing to one of the commercial networks, such as CompuServe, Prodigy, or the Sierra Network, that typically charged $2 to $7 an hour. Karen’s game with his Chilean opponent used a rudimentary form of what would soon see the light: the first dedicated server to play chess. It was born on January 15, 1992. Online Chess Emerges: ICS, FICS, ICC Created by Michael Moore and Richard Nash, the Internet Chess Server (ICS) was the first online chess server of many to come. It could be reached on the University of Utah’s server address lark.utah.edu via Telnet (short for “teletype network”), a protocol originally developed in 1969 allowing users to access and interact with another computer or device over a network. Users could log into a remote computer and execute commands as if they were physically at that computer’s terminal, or they could log into the ICS and play a game of chess. In July 1992, the ICS was moved to a host machine at Carnegie Mellon University, where a couple of undergraduate students ran it. Daniel Sleator, a professor of computer science at the university, started managing the project by the end of 1992. He improved the system, fixed bugs, added new features (most notably the “time-stamp” feature, a system that compensated for internet lag), copyrighted the code, and had a bit of fun now and then. On April 1, 1994, as an April Fools’ joke, he set the server code to “bogomode,” a setting that made the ratings go crazy. Suddenly, winning or losing games would result in gaining or dropping hundreds of rating points. After the settings were restored, one member emailed Sleator: “Why can’t I keep my rating of -11609? April Fools’ or not, I had the worst record.” As the number of accounts grew rapidly from roughly 2,000 in 1993 to 10,000 in early 1995, Sleator started to receive purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialize the server. With his wife, Lylia, and ICS administrators Marty Grund and Eric Peterson, he created a company himself instead. (Today, it is likely one of the ten oldest e-commerce sites that remains active at the time of writing, founded eight months after Amazon and six months before eBay.) On March 1, 1995, Sleator shared his decision with the members. Anyone who telnetted into the ICS saw the following message on their screen: “Important announcement for all members: Today, ICS has become the Internet Chess Club (ICC). Please type ‘help announce’ for all the details.” The most important of those details was the introduction of a fee. From now on, members would be charged $49 a year. The measure came as a shock to most as people were used to playing chess on the internet for free. Sleator’s announcement caused quite the uproar, leading to heated debates on the server and elsewhere. A quick follow-up announcement saying that students would only need to pay $24.50 a year didn’t help much to calm the waters. As tech journalist Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store, wrote in that summer of 1995, “Players lost their tempers and were exiled from the server, opposition groups were formed, lawsuits were threatened, ICC administrators were harassed, and plans to erect alternative servers were formed.” A small group of former ICS programmers decided to create a new, free club: the Free Internet Chess Server. FICS launched on the address fics.onenet.net in the first week of March 1995, just days after Sleator’s announcement. A few months later it had about 1,500 members, while the ICC had 11,000. Throughout the years, FICS remained the smaller sibling of the two, while many of the original naysayers eventually joined and paid for an ICC membership. Around 2009, ICC reached its peak of around 72,000 paying members, with many more using free trials or playing as guests. Asked if FICS was ever a true rival, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer Ruy Mora told me, “That’s tough to say because we couldn’t really measure. But I’m sure there was an impact. There’s a lot of people who don’t want to pay.” Even in 2024, both playing servers continue to exist, keeping a small but loyal user base in the shadow of two giants that occupy the current online landscape. In a way, the relationship between FICS and ICC is similar to the two dominant chess platforms today: Lichess, which is free to play, and the paid-for Chess.com. Starting in the mid-nineties, the “commercial” versus the “internet-should-be-free” vibe is still manifest today as a bit of an ideological rivalry between the two communities. John Fernandez, who was an admin for ICC in the late nineties, told me the analogy does work to some extent: “To some people, ICC were the evil capitalists out there to make money, and FICS was like, ‘We’re free, we’re open source, we’re all volunteers.’ You would use that as a shield, you know. ‘We’re the good guys, the self-proclaimed good guys.’ Lichess is certainly doing that as well.” The Intergalactic Chess Café What was it like to play chess online in those early days? The Dutch novelist and chess player Tim Krabbé described it wonderfully in an article in New in Chess magazine in 1995: It was a fateful night in February when I first saw that posting on the internet, in the newsgroup rec.games.chess. It suggested that I try telnet chess.lm.com 5000 and see how I would like it there. Before I knew what had happened, I had a screenful of names like turbopragma, CarbonNitride, Sartre, DEATH, GrandJaap, Hoho, toto, Barendregt, zigzag, CapedCrusader, Roman, gutterface; all chessplayers I understood—some of them, judging from the ratings next to their names, quite good, and all ready to play chess with me. When I had mastered my first few commands, and was able to read their personal files, I saw they were from all over the world, from the US, Iceland, New Zealand, Brazil, Turkey, Chile, India, even from Leiden [in the Netherlands], but regrettably few from Eastern Europe. DEATH was a student from Puerto Rico, HUS an IM from Singapore, Belsebub a blitz-only player, TheKiller a mathematician from Sweden, Galileo a father of four from San Diego, Pawngrubber a girl, Candide a Texan who turned out never to have heard of Pangloss and indeed, Roman was Roman Dzindzichashvili. He had already played over 1,500 blitz games there, and his rating was over 2800. The global village suddenly seemed like something from the past—this was a global living room; an Intergalactic Chess Cafe. Playing from Amsterdam, Krabbé tried out his first game and was paired against someone in Atlanta, Georgia. The distance between the two players was more than 7,000 kilometers (4,385 miles) but the experience was as exciting as Brian Karen’s: “Even so, those moves appeared on my screen instantly, bleep onto bleep, as if he were sitting across the table. It was overwhelming, mindboggling—the old dream of omnipresence come true.” I had a similar experience around that time. I had just moved to Amsterdam, where I studied for my master’s degree in Dutch Language and Literature at the University of Amsterdam while devoting much of my spare time to chess. A friend of mine, a student at the city’s other university (Vrije Universiteit), had access to the computer department where machines were connected to the internet. All you needed was a login, and he allowed me to use his. I created an account on FICS, logged in via Telnet, and played my first online games. I wasn’t playing on a normal-looking chessboard. Students couldn’t download and install software on the university computer, so Telnet was the only option. Because of that, I had to play on an ASCII board created by text characters. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a character-encoding standard for electronic communication limited to 95 printable characters. Since it was text only, the chessboard was built from vertical (|) and horizontal (—) lines creating a grid with 64 squares (but no distinction between light or dark!) and pieces in capital letters (P, N, B, R, Q, K), together with asterisks for the black pieces (*P, *N, *B, *R, *Q, *K). Each move had to be typed in by keyboard. The whole experience made it hard to focus on the actual chess, but I kept returning anyway, as the experience was indeed overwhelming and mindboggling. It looked like this, after White had played their first move: Soon, I got myself a computer and a 28.8 Kbps dial-up modem that allowed me to hook up to the internet from home. A modem was a piece of external hardware that converted data into a format suitable for an analog transmission medium, in this case, your telephone line. Older readers will remember the typical sound such a modem would make when the connection was initialized, something akin to the shrieking of an old tavern’s wooden door, leading to a digital world full of instantly accessible information—and crazy chess players. In Europe, most of the chess was played in the evening or during the night, for two reasons. This was when the Americans, and therefore most of the stronger players, would be online. But it was also cheaper because, in those days, making phone calls in the evening was charged at a lower rate than during the day. Still, there have been stories about chess players who faced a phone bill of over a thousand dollars after “clicking” chess moves for a month. Internet chess would never have exploded like it did if everyone was still playing with those impossible ASCII-based chessboards. Like the chess world’s Wright brothers, developers created chess server interfaces to play the game, and that’s when things took off. Dozens of such interfaces were developed. You had to pick one, download it from the anonymous file transfer site ftp://chess.onenet.net, unpack it, install it on your local machine, brew a nice cup of coffee, and enter the arena. This is what playing chess online (on the Free Internet Chess Server) looked like in the 1990s. One of the most popular was ZIICS, developed by Andy McFarland from Owensboro, Kentucky. It ran on MS-DOS, Microsoft’s operating system used in most personal computers. It co-existed for many years with Windows, launched in late 1985. ZIICS also required a graphics adapter, but then you could choose from several styles of piece sets from 32 pixels per square to 56 pixels per square, and you could configure the buttons’ colors and functions by editing a text file. If Vincent van Gogh had been into chess, he would have loved it. On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95, reportedly spending as much as $200 million on advertising. A year later, the program BlitzIn, which worked on Windows, became the most popular chess interface. It helped boost the success of ICC, and so did the massive influx of new members thanks to the live relay of the Kasparov–Deep Blue matches. Word spread quickly that there was a place where you could play chess and meet grandmasters 24/7. On the day Kasparov and Deep Blue played their second match game, the ICC set a record with 2,266 people online and 307 simultaneous games—a small step in hindsight but a giant leap at the time. On August 25, 1997, the ICC launched The King’s Messenger, an email newsletter for online chess. In its first issue, Danny Sleator wrote, “This newsletter was necessitated by the staggering growth of the ICC: now over 25,000 games are played every day, and the population reaches over 800 on an average night. The ICC has become one of the more significant organizations in world chess.” In early January 1998, about 40,000 games were played daily on the platform. A year later, this had grown to over 70,000. A large tournament for prize money in the year 2000 attracted 310 FIDE-rated players, among them 64 grandmasters. By 2002, the ICC had over 25,000 paying members; two years later that number had crossed 30,000. These numbers might seem tiny—incomparable to the numbers we’re seeing today—but at the time the growth was remarkable. Mouse Skills and Bullet Chess In 1964, Douglas Engelbart and Bill English built the first prototype of a device that moved a cursor on a computer screen. For decades, these devices were wired and therefore resembled the shape and size of a mouse—hence the name. As soon as online chess emerged, the mouse became indispensable. As the tool to execute the moves on the board, it was the chess player’s Nintendo game controller. Chess knowledge and the ability to calculate moves weren’t enough any more; developing mouse skills became critical to having success. One of the strongest players on the ICC in the mid-to-late nineties was the German grandmaster Roland Schmaltz, who played under the handle Hawkeye. In his 2004 book The Complete Chess Server Guide, he wrote a small segment titled “The Art of Mouse Mastery,” where he gave technical tips such as “adjusting the sample rate” in the computer settings and choosing “the right board size and mouse speed.” Schmaltz’s tips and tricks were mostly relevant to a special form of chess called bullet. It’s one of the fastest formats in chess, with players usually getting just one minute for a whole game. With a game averaging about 35 moves, you can think only for about two seconds per move. If you think longer early on, you will have even less time later in the game. This absolutely crazy (but very popular) way of playing chess often leads to insane time scrambles where players can make multiple moves in only a fraction of a second. In fact, most bullet games are decided by one player running out of time or “getting flagged,” in chess lingo. This phrase originates from over-the-board chess before the 2000s, when analog clocks would have a small lever, called a flag, that would drop if the large hand reached the hour. When I was in touch with ICC founder Danny Sleator for this book, he forwarded me an email he sent to some of the administrators in 1995, with “bullet chess” in the subject field. It describes how the name for this spectacular format came about, and that a separate rating system was needed on the server. (Below are only the first two paragraphs of a longer email.) To: sleator+icc-admins@CS.CMU.EDU Subject: bullet chess Date: Wed, 23 Aug 1995 14:14:21 -0400 Message-ID: <6304.809201661@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> From: Daniel Sleator <Daniel_Sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> Sender: sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU I’m going to introduce a new rating. I’m proposing to call it a “bullet” rating. (Alternative would be “lightening” [sic] but that’s too long and awkward. I would entertain other ideas for names.) I talked to several people about where the boundary between bullet and blitz should be. (POTZY, Surf, Broncept have all given me their opinions.) I’d like to solicit your opinions on this matter. You could also play one-minute chess on FICS, where it was not called bullet but lightning (the alternative name Sleator had suggested!). My good friend Arne Moll, a very active online player at the time, noted that this was an example of the rivalry between the two servers: “On FICS, there was some kind of hatred against the word. They would say: ‘Bullet,’ that’s ICC, that’s a shitty, commercial name. We call this ‘lightning.’ ” Whatever it was called, the new format caught on. The American grandmaster Larry Christiansen wrote, in the late 1990s, “Bullet chess is to tournament chess as slapstick comedy is to high drama, or tabloid journalism is to literature. Maybe that is why it is so popular.” Some players had more talent (or taste) for it than others. There’s no denying that bullet chess involves a lot of “dirty tricks” that can help to gain valuable time in the final phases of the game, when it’s all about avoiding getting flagged. One of them is to voluntarily give up a piece simply because of the surprise value and the extra half-second it will take for the opponent to execute their move. Also, in bullet chess, players often continue playing positions where they would normally agree to a draw to try to flag the opponent—opinions are divided on whether this is unsports-manlike behavior. And then there’s the infamous premove: the possibility of, after having made your move, making your next move before your opponent makes one—something unthinkable in over-the-board chess—if you’re certain of your next turn. While the opponent thinks, you can drag your mouse and move one of your pieces to another square. As soon as it’s your move, the server executes your “premoved” move, and you don’t lose any time on your clock. It is a gamble, though, as the success of a premove depends heavily on an expected reply from the opponent. Roland Schmaltz agreed that particularly those final seconds of a game do not have much to do with chess, but stressed that chess skills are still important in bullet: “You are no longer focused on finding the best move. You are focused on finding the most unpleasant move for your opponent to make him lose more time. To achieve your goal, you still have to think in chess terms, but, more importantly, like in a normal chess game, you must think ahead!” And, indeed, to this day the strongest bullet players are also the strongest players in general. As I write this, Chess.com’s 2023 Bullet Chess Championship has just finished, with Hikaru Nakamura beating Magnus Carlsen in the final—the world number one and number two in classical chess, then. A fun moment during the 2023 Bullet Chess Championship on Chess.com in the game between Magnus Carlsen and Daniel Naroditsky. Addiction On August 30, 1999, Loek van Wely from the Netherlands and Alexander Rustemov from Russia played well over a hundred blitz games on the ICC, with a time control of five minutes for a whole game. It turned into a heroic match, a hard-fought and long battle that attracted a lot of online spectators who logged in from many different time zones—because, in the end, the two grandmasters played for 20 hours straight. My compatriot Van Wely won by a score of 64–60 wins, with 13 draws over a total of 137 games. Now, that’s dedication. Or is it something else? The 1895 essay “Concerning Chess” by H. G. Wells opens with the following famous passage: “The passion for playing chess is one of the most unaccountable in the world. It slaps the theory of natural selection in the face. It is the most absorbing of occupations. The least satisfying of desires. A nameless excrescence upon life. It annihilates a man. You have, let us say, a promising politician, a rising artist that you wish to destroy. Dagger or bomb are archaic and unreliable—but teach him, inoculate him with chess.” Although chess addiction is probably as old as the game itself, I believe it’s much easier to get addicted to online chess. The English grandmaster Danny Gormally did not shy away from the truth when he published an article in New in Chess magazine in 2008 titled “Diary of an ICC Addict.” He compared playing online to drugs: “[T]he user experiences a serotonin cascade in the pre-frontal lobe of his brain similar to a drug which could be described as psychotropic. This leads to more and more use, as the addict chases his high, which he finds increasingly difficult to replicate in his humdrum everyday existence.” A comparison to avid casino visitors comes to mind when you realize that chess players sometimes reach for the last resort: asking for a self-ban. Don’t let me in anymore. The same Gormally wrote in his 2016 book A Year Inside the Chess World: “Eventually it dawned on me that playing blitz online all day was a complete waste of my life so I asked them to ban me, being seemingly incapable of stopping playing myself. I was just playing all day, every day.” It’s not a watertight solution because sometimes people create a new account to circumvent their ban. Is blitz chess a drug? In a more recent article in New in Chess magazine, Jennifer Vallens has pointed out that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has added Internet Gaming Addiction as one of the potential disorders that need to be treated: “The APA explains that internet gaming activates reward systems similarly to using drugs. The euphoric feeling when you win a match or unlock an achievement is the same as getting high, as both activities trigger dopamine releases in the brain. When addicts get engrossed playing online games, certain pathways in their brains are triggered in the same direct and intense way that a drug addict’s brain is affected by a particular substance.” Some people just cannot stop playing. They really play a lot. But how much is a lot? One Chess.com account played 436,770 games between April 2014 and June 2021, an average of 167 games per day. Among the titled players, one grandmaster played more games than anyone: 180,000 since 2009. On ICC, one of the members played over 740,000 games between 1996 and 2024, an average of 72 games a day for 28 years straight. A note in his profile says that ICC is “the best chess club in the world.” The American writer and podcaster James Altucher was one of the early users of ICC’s precursor ICS, as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon under Danny Sleator. He told me: I was an addict. I was working a job I didn’t like. I was in a relationship I was unhappy with. One time, it was around 6:00 p.m., I was at work. My girlfriend called me and said, “Don’t forget we have guests coming for dinner at 6:30.” So I was going to play one more game. At midnight she banged on my office door, which was locked. I was in a one-minute match that went on for hours with this guy from Israel. I was just an addict, I couldn’t stop. Then I got home around 7 a.m., and she was just leaving to go to classes. I remember she was so upset with me that she threw a bag filled with textbooks at me and left. It wasn’t the end of the relationship, but it was close. Probably the most addictive aspect of online chess is the time-trouble phase, which occurs late in the game when adrenaline sets in, and every decision feels decisive. It’s basically life or death, killing a wild animal before it gets to you, move after move. No wonder chess has often been compared to boxing. “The emotional impulse behind chess, and the pain it inflicts, is comparable but just takes a different form,” according to the Scottish grandmaster and philosopher Jonathan Rowson. Because most games are played at a quick time control of ten, five, or three minutes—or even one minute—per game, just about every game will see such a time-trouble phase. Among my friends, the most popular format is three-minute chess, which means that during a longer session, that thrilling moment when everything is on the line and the seconds are ticking away occurs roughly every five minutes, again and again: a rush of blood to the head. A quick trip to where the action happens. A brief, intense sense of living—on repeat. Another reason for online addiction is the ratings. Every online server works with its own application of Arpad Elo’s rating system. Because almost all players use a handle (nickname) when playing online, they’re defined by their rating, which is constantly visible alongside their virtual name and updated after every game. A good day’s results in a higher rating, and you feel great, but if the number goes down, it can completely ruin your day (or night). As Krabbé put it, “The ego has its needs too.” The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler told me a story about reaching the highest-ever rating on the platform: I was a very heavy ICC user, and then I just basically quit cold turkey and stopped playing online chess for, like, 15 years. One day, I played a very long match and won by a small margin. Then I beat another player in a ten-game match, and, by the end of it, I got the record. I got to 3318. It got badly broken by Hikaru Nakamura and others later, but at that point, for a brief moment, that was the highest-ever blitz rating. So I got the record. I was still kind of high, still feeling the buzz, and I got challenged by Hawkeye. I thought, “Why not?” But in that match, I didn’t play well. It was 5–5. And while you’re playing, you’re not paying much attention to anything but playing the game. When I finished, I looked up, and I was, like, 3092. Because [Roland Schmaltz] wasn’t very high rated, but he was much better than his rating, obviously. And I just looked at this and thought: “What am I doing here? Why am I spending hours and hours doing this?” I realized that the gains I had made over months and months—climbing further when you’re already 3250 is not very easy—were all gone. It would take me another three months to return to whatever it was an hour ago. And I thought, “No, I should maybe just stop.” Now I only play in tournaments and when I stream. In November 2023, Hikaru Nakamura set a new all-time high record blitz rating on Chess.com: 3336. It took just a few weeks for the always competitive Magnus Carlsen to top it, getting to 3340 on December 6 (only to reach even higher numbers before the end of the year). He commented to Norwegian media: I was on a sponsor event in the Bahamas this week and played some games online on Monday. On Tuesday I played Titled Tuesday and was planning to go to bed, but then I found out that I was close to Hikaru’s rating record. Then I thought I could play a few games and take the record. I was pretty close five times. But then it pissed me off so much that I kept going for hours and finally at 3 a.m. I had the record. I was actually pretty chill before that. But afterward I was so excited and struggled to sleep. It was fun, but then I thought, “I can’t be going on like this!” My friend Arne Moll has noted another aspect of online chess addiction, which he calls “the hate.” Sometimes we play badly, and losing sucks. Losing to bad players sucks even more, as it leads to a rating drop into regions that are just embarrassing. On such nights, you tend to play for too long with the idle hope of turning the tide. But it only gets worse. There is nothing new about this. This extract from an article titled “The Hate” by FICS member pdeck reads as if it could have been written yesterday instead of in 1998: I have the hate. I hate my opponent. I hate the spectators that goaded me into playing an extended series with someone who often gets my rating points. I hate the guys in the Lightning Channel for teasing me about my blunders and then logging off at midnight, leaving me to fester in a death spiral of worthless, repetitive chess punctuated only by one or two mad dashes to the men’s room or poorly stocked vending machines. More than anything, I hate myself. I spend too much god-damned time playing lightning, giving up both work and sleep. And what do I have to show for it? A shitty rating. The silliness about online ratings is mostly revealed by what I call the round-number idiocy. All chess players are prone to it, but they can take comfort in realizing they’re not unique. It is typical human behavior. Studies have shown that those who wear fitness trackers, professional baseball players, and high school SAT takers exert more effort when their performance falls just short of a round number rather than just above. And it goes even further, as shown in research from 2020 undertaken at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. The study determined that people have a preference for round numbers over specific numbers—that, for instance, people informed by health officials that a newly developed COVID-19 vaccine was 91.27 percent effective would likely think it was a less effective vaccine than if they were told it was 90 percent effective. Chess players, from total beginners to world champions, are obsessed with round-numbered ratings. Magnus Carlsen peaked at 2882 (twice) and, for a while, attempted to break 2900. Those 18 points mattered. It was big news when the French-Iranian prodigy Alireza Firouzja broke the 2800 rating barrier in December 2021 at 18 years and 166 days (breaking Carlsen’s previous record of 18 years and 336 days). For club players, making it to 2000 is a big deal. And then 2100—and then 2200. My own peak rating was 2292 in October 2004, and it still annoys me that I didn’t get to 2300. This leads to nonsensical, but familiar, behavior online. You play a few games in the evening, your rating has dropped to 1950, and you decide: “I’ll play until my rating is over 2000 again.” You win some, you lose some. Before you know it, it’s after midnight, and you suddenly notice your rating is 1998. Just one more win and you can call it a day. But you don’t win. In fact, you somehow never win that last game. At four in the morning, with a rating of 1911, you give up, frustrated and exhausted. You’ll have to find your way to your bed knowing you’re a terrible chess player because you don’t belong in that group of players above 2000. Often, you log on the next morning, fresh again, win a bunch of games in a row, break 2000, and don’t understand why that went so easy. You promise you will never play late in the evening again. But you will, maybe even on that same day. I’ve experienced many such evenings of online blitz silliness, but I’m cured now. The only way to avoid them is to play unrated games, the equivalent of zero-alcohol beer. It’s not the real thing. But many others can’t stop. Those heavy users with over a hundred games per day on average might have a serious problem. I feel worried sometimes about those heavy users, and I wonder if Chess.com and Lichess could do more to help the real addicts. Everyone Played. Everyone? The Internet Chess Club is a true pioneer of online chess. It can boast several milestones: the first online chess lecture in April 1995; the first internet simultaneous exhibition by a world champion (Garry Kasparov), in November 1995; the first intercollegiate online chess tournament, a month later; and the first top grandmasters playing online for prize money in November 1999. Around then, John Fernandez was hired as the public relations director tasked with growing the ICC further. He started working on sponsorships, banner advertising, and building relationships with organizers. For the next decade, the ICC was the place to be. In the early 2000s, the British newspaper the Sunday Telegraph wrote: “There are more than 300 places to play chess on the Internet but, as with nightclubs, there is only one place the ‘A list’ gravitates to: the Internet Chess Club.” The absolute top players of the time became active on the site: people like Veselin Topalov, Alexei Shirov, Nigel Short, and even Garry Kasparov, but also a young Hikaru Nakamura and an even younger Magnus Carlsen. It helped that grandmasters got free accounts, and Fernandez put a lot of effort into getting them to play on the site. During the 1999 FIDE World Chess Championship—a knockout event with a hundred participants held in Las Vegas—Fernandez gave all of the entrants a gift bag with a personal letter and a floppy disk that had the BlitzIn interface pre-installed to make it easier for the grandmasters to start playing. And it worked. All players logged in at least once, except one: the 68-year-old Viktor Korchnoi, a living legend but also a bit of a grumpy old man. Fernandez recalls: “He mumbled something and threw the envelope in the nearest bin.” Especially after Vegas 1999, just about all the big names joined the ICC. Nakamura had started playing as early as 1997, when he was nine years old, on an account he shared with his brother and stepfather. In 1999 he created a new one named YearoftheRabbit and used it until most strong players knew who he was. Starting from 2001, he played under Smallville, after the American superhero TV series that ran between 2001 and 2011. “I wanted an anonymous account, and, at the time, I was a big fan of the TV show,” Nakamura told me. Between 2001 and 2011 he played 15,306 blitz games and 13,967 bullet games on this account. He was also one of the first grandmasters to seriously benefit from online chess as a youngster because he would download his games and look for mistakes he’d made with the computer. But mostly, he would just play—a lot. I remember that around 2008–9 Nakamura stayed at my place in Amsterdam for one night as he had mistakenly booked a connecting flight on the wrong date. The next morning, I started working in the living room as quietly as I could, hiding behind a big computer screen while he slept on the couch. Eventually, he woke up and got out of the sleeping bag. Only then did I notice he was still wearing his clothes. We exchanged good mornings, and he sat down behind his laptop. Soon, I heard the type of mouse-clicking that could mean only one thing: he was playing blitz. That’s how you get good: when something is on your mind first thing in the morning, before breakfast, before anything else. Magnus Carlsen joined the ICC around 2001 and created the account imtobesoon. After becoming an IM, he ambitiously continued with the account gmtobesoon, and when that title was in the bag, he changed it to Magnus. Later on, the Norwegian prodigy used multiple anonymous accounts. He and Nakamura likely first played each other online in 2004. What would turn out to become a rivalry lasting over two decades all started with a friendly match between Magnus and Smallville on July 18, 2004. Over 12 games with a time control of three minutes per person (and no increment), 13-year-old Carlsen beat 16-year-old Nakamura 9–3, with no draws. The ICC made it a lot easier for people to play a game of chess against someone. You no longer had to follow the annoying social code of taking a shower and getting dressed before moving your king’s pawn. In the late 1990s, founder Danny Sleator noted that his online club encouraged people to play chess who normally wouldn’t bother going out to a club: “I’ve heard a lot of people say that. I am an example of this.” Just about everyone was trying their luck with online chess, although, as with all new technological developments, there were skeptics too. John Saunders, a very nice English fellow whom I met at many tournaments where he was working as a journalist and photographer, is one such person. He said in an interview in 1999: “Chess is like sex—it is only healthy when it involves two consenting humans in the same room. It is a social game. How can people enjoy playing chess when they masquerade under names like ‘Kingkicker’ and exchange no more dialogue than the perennial ‘thanx?’ Okay, I’m a hypocrite because I HAVE played Internet chess, am no good at it, and have a ‘handle’ which is an ancient Greek word meaning ‘I thrust a radish up the fundament.’ But I do not find it addictive or attractive.” Apart from the few critics, just about everyone who played chess played on the ICC. For a brief time that may have included a certain Bobby Fischer. On September 9, 2001, the English grandmaster Nigel Short wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph in which he claimed to be “99 percent sure” that he had faced the American former world champion in almost 50 online games. It was tremendously exciting news for chess fans; even those who didn’t believe it wanted to believe it. Any news related to Fischer, who had completely disappeared from the chess scene once again after beating Spassky in 1992, was fascinating. The thought of him playing chess again was just wonderful. Short revealed that in his first encounter, he lost 8–0, despite his mysterious opponent playing “some highly irregular if not totally absurd opening moves.” He would shift all his pawns forward by one square or play his king toward the center of the board as early as move two. “From this deliberately unpromising position emerged moves of extraordinary power,” said Short. “In this first game, I was totally crushed.” While chatting with his opponent, Short noticed that he knew a great deal about the major chess players of the 1960s, which happened to be Fischer’s most active period. Short decided to test him and asked his opponent if he knew of Armando Acevedo, an obscure Mexican player. He got an instant reply: “Siegen, 1970.” Because Fischer had played Acevedo at the Siegen Chess Olympiad in West Germany in 1970, Short felt “the guy was trying to tell me something.” The games were not recorded because Short had used a guest account (respecting his opponent’s wishes). ICC’s Danny Sleator, therefore, could not investigate Short’s claim that it was Fischer. However, soon it was revealed—somewhat sadly, I may add—who the mysterious opponent was: a Canadian network expert who used a chess engine. On January 28, 2002, Fischer himself said in an interview on Icelandic television that he never played on the internet. Alas, the mystery had been more enticing while still unsolved. Most grandmasters playing on the site didn’t keep their identity a secret. In fact, many of them would provide some extra details in their profile. I especially liked the notes from the English grandmaster David Norwood, who used the handle DaveNoGood for playing: Dave Norwood Retired grandmaster … ashamed to keep the title I only play 1 g3 and 1 … g6 4.If my play gets a bit funny it may have something to do with what I’m drinking … One of the many stories from those early days of internet chess is about a man whose life was saved while playing online. In September 1997, 48-year-old Charles Drafts started to feel a shortness of breath and dizziness during a game and sent a message to all members, saying, “I’m having physical illness problems and need help.” Drafts was a double amputee who lived in Boston’s housing projects in Mission Hill and who typed using a stick in his mouth. Some chess fans thought his message was a joke, but, luckily, others took it seriously. They asked Drafts to type his address and asked about his symptoms. Andy McFarland, one of the ICC admins, called Boston’s emergency medical services, and, eventually, firefighters broke down the door and rushed Drafts to Beth Israel hospital, where he was stabilized. The Charles Drafts story is an example of something that should not be underestimated about those early years of online chess: the social aspect. People came online not only to play a game of chess but also to meet people. Because, back then, there were so many fewer people online at the same time than we’ve grown accustomed to nowadays (3,000 concurrent players would push the server to its limits), and because of how things were structured, everyone could fairly easily talk to each other, and amateurs regularly conversed with top players. For most chess fans who didn’t travel internationally to tournaments, it was the first time in their lives that they could communicate with chess players from abroad. International master Greg Shahade, who started playing online in 1995, told me, “Girls approached me on FICS. I made a lot of friends.” For others, it went further: there are several stories of people getting married after first speaking to each other on the ICC. A Dutch chess player named his son after the handle he used online: Jaap. The chess servers had special chat channels, technically the same as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), to serve these social needs: you could start a private channel among your friends, or join one of the open channels with specific subjects. There was, for instance, a music channel, and a trivia channel where a bot would throw in trivia questions all day, and everyone providing answers would automatically be included in the daily rankings. ICC’s most popular channel was 97, dedicated to (mostly American) politics and more liberal than other channels when it came to foul language. “I also tried regular chat rooms in those days, but these would be meaningless,” Arne Moll told me. “You would sit there with random Americans. What should you talk about? Chess connects, and that’s the great thing. An ICC chat room was like a local pub full of international people who loved chess. It was quite special.” These days, we have individual chess communities active on social media platforms like Discord, X, Reddit, and Telegram, but they are somewhat scattered. Sites like Chess.com or Lichess don’t have chat channels, but maybe they should. Mark Crowther: Unsung Hero As desktop computers and other workstations became more connected globally in the late 1970s, there was a growing interest in sharing information. This led to a particular type of network called the Bulletin Board System (BBS), which allowed users to post messages like they would on a physical thumbtack bulletin board. USENET launched in 1978 as a global bulletin board that established the concept of newsgroups, where like-minded users could exchange messages on their topics of interest. It was estimated that in 1990 there were 265,000 users on five continents. One of these newsgroups was rec.games.chess, launched in 1987. People started sharing anything related to chess, and some even took up the task of typing out the full notation of recently played tournament games. This particular newsgroup kick-started the incredible acceleration of the availability of chess information, which would have enormous consequences for the game. One avid chess fan from Clayton, a suburb of Bradford in northern England, would play a vital role in this development and, as most chess fans are unaware, still does. Born in 1966, Mark Crowther learned the rules of chess in 1972, the year of the famous Fischer–Spassky match. He played chess at school and joined a local club. After studying information sciences in Leeds, Crowther found a job as a librarian/technician at Bradford University’s Modern Languages Center in the late 1980s. Crowther had a desire to collect and a love to share. He got a computer account in the library, joined the rec.games.chess newsgroup, and soon became one of the most active users, sharing recent chess games he found in newspaper chess columns and other media available in his library. Using a Linux system, he manually typed them in almost daily until he decided to turn it into a weekly thing. On September 17, 1994, he launched the first issue of The Week in Chess (TWIC). After seven weeks, he had learned enough HTML to set up his first website and post links to all TWIC issues. A legendary online magazine was born. Initially, Crowther combined collecting games with his day job. “I used to work at the university, finish on Friday, go to the computer center and do it on Friday night and Saturday, and go back to work on Monday,” he said. That went on for about a year and a half until it became too much: “Very quickly, I got pushed into publishing more and more games. It got out of control very quickly. And then it became: either I give up or go pro. That was the choice.” In 1996, Crowther briefly worked for the Canadian enterprise Thoth Communications Corporation. Between 1997 and 2012, he was sponsored by journalist and entrepreneur Malcolm Pein. As the owner of London’s Chess & Bridge shop, Pein used TWIC to send its readers to his online shop. Crowther got paid, and Pein got his online book sales. In 2012 the collaboration ended, and since then Crowther has relied on advertising, subscriptions, and donations. To me, Crowther is a legend, one of the unsung heroes of the chess world who deserves more credit than he gets. When I interviewed him in 2019 on the occasion of TWIC’s 25th anniversary, he told me that he was doing well, though he had some slight worries about his pension: “It’s a fun business to be in, but it’s not very secure. I’m going to have to work for another 20 years. But I enjoy doing it. I never go to bed on a Monday without finishing TWIC. It’s unthinkable. It’s how you get it done.” As I type this, TWIC is still going strong, a stunning 30 years after its inception. It appears on Mondays and summarizes the results of international chess tournaments. More importantly, Crowther provides a file with all the games played over the last week that anyone can download for free. These days, a single file can easily contain a few thousand games. Since 1994, the TWIC database has grown to over three and a half million games. Crowther doesn’t keep track of the figures, but chess fans who click the download button each week—from seasoned grandmasters to aspiring youngsters—must number in their thousands. Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand told me, “I remember, I think it was some time in 1995 that I first heard about The Week in Chess. I downloaded my first one then, and I cannot think of too many [other] routines that I’ve stuck to every single week for the last 25 years. [TWIC is] just really an institution in chess.” The Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, of a younger generation, expressed a similar sentiment in a tweet in August 2015: “When more than two TWICs are missing on your laptop, you know that something has gone wrong with your chess routine.” Why was TWIC so revolutionary? Well, having information about your opponent is vital. Before the internet, that wasn’t easy to get. One of the people who helped provide games for Crowther in the early years was Australia’s number-one player, Ian Rogers. Becoming a world-class grandmaster himself in the 1980s, while combining his successful playing career with chess journalism, Rogers witnessed firsthand how the internet changed the sport. “Before TWIC, you had Murray Chandler’s Tournament Chess,” said Rogers. “This magazine was not much more than printouts of games, with the occasional diagram, but it was invaluable. You traveled with it. If you were playing a tournament and had games from tournaments where your opponent had played before, it was very useful to have info on that.” Rogers toured Europe in those years with his wife Cathy, due to the lack of tournaments in Australia. Along with Tournament Chess, he and his colleagues would pack recent copies of Chess Informant or New in Chess Yearbooks in their suitcases: thick manuals containing hundreds of recent top-level games and analyses printed on thin paper, resembling phonebooks, another relic of the past. Other sources of information were periodicals such as British Chess Magazine, the German Schach 64, the Swiss weekly Die Schachwoche, and specialized books on chess openings. There was always a limit to the amount of material you could bring to a tournament, so books and clothes would be fighting for luggage space. With TWIC, preparing for a game was suddenly child’s play as it became much easier to find games played by your opponent, even as recently as the previous week. Moreover, you could now store thousands of games on a single floppy disk, which saved a huge amount of space. TWIC was particularly useful for chess players working with one of the chess database programs that were starting to become popular in those years as well. KasparovChess and the Dotcom Bubble While TWIC had the chess information and the ICC was the place to play, the internet landscape was changing rapidly. Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web was all the rage, and the first browsers started to appear: first Mosaic in 1993, then Netscape Navigator in 1994, followed by Internet Explorer in 1995. Just 16 months after Marc Andreessen and James Clark formed Netscape, the company had a historic initial public offering, or IPO, on August 9, 1995. On the first trading day, the stock opened at $28 per share and closed at $58.25 per share, giving the company a market value of about $2.9 billion. Andreessen became a multimillionaire, and Clark moved toward being the first internet billionaire. Netscape went public without previously having made a profit, a groundbreaking move at the time that contributed to a surge in interest in making money on the internet. A speculative mania, dubbed the “dot-com bubble,” led to a collapse in the early 2000s of many companies. KasparovChess was one of the failed start-ups. World champion since 1985, Garry Kasparov had launched a “Club Kasparov” website in early 1999, mainly written in Russian. The same year, the location of the site was changed to kasparovchess.com with the launch of a new business backed by mostly Israeli investors. Offices in the US, UK, Russia, and Israel opened as the international content team grew to about 30 members. Kasparov Chess Online (KCO), as it was officially named, was intended to be the dominant chess platform for both strong and casual players, parents, and kids. The site ambitiously advertised itself as “the home of chess on the web.” It offered everything: a playing zone, a news section, a forum, an event calendar, a shop, a magazine, downloadable multimedia lessons, and regular contributions from Kasparov himself, who often sent “express commentary” on the same day he played in a tournament. One of the key assets of KCO, which was fairly new at the time, was that users could play chess in a browser via an HTML interface. The main business model was both typical of those days and hardly viable: trying to build a huge base of free users who would be exposed to advertising. By 2002 a total of $13 million of investment was burned, including Kasparov’s personal injection of $110,000. The company was hardly making money. In September 2002 the board of directors decided to pull the plug. According to New in Chess magazine, Kasparov blamed the demise of his platform on “disputes between the minority Israeli stockholders who controlled the business and administrative functions of the company, and the majority stockholders associated with him.” Mig Greengard, who worked on content for KCO, wrote at the time: “The Israeli money-men thought it was more important to employ a group of Israeli programmers costing over $100,000 per month than have grandmasters, writers, and other chess people costing a fraction of that. Instead of cutting back, they went down with the ship over Kasparov’s protests.” I don’t know if the Israeli team ever responded to Greengard’s version of how things went down, but they likely saw it differently. This was not the end of the story. On Christmas Eve 2002, the First International Bank of Israel (FIBI), which had lent $1.6 million to KCO demanded the site be reopened and sought unspecified damages in a court in Delaware, where the company was registered. Effectively, the bank attempted to seize permanent control of the world-class asset of Kasparov’s name and likeness as compensation for their failed loan. On December 27, a US chancery judge ruled against the bank, calling the case “far too thin.” From a historical perspective, it’s interesting to note that Jay Severson, one of the future cofounders of Chess.com, had a rendezvous with KasparovChess somewhere between 1999 and 2000. Severson was working at Case’s Ladder, a Seattle-based online solutions provider for tournaments, leagues, brackets, and ladders. As the market leader in that area, the company was approached by KasparovChess for the rather ambitious plan to run a worldwide tournament for kids in schools, which would end up with a live final somewhere. They needed logistical support, arbiters, the whole shebang. “I remember laughing at the email, going, like, ‘These guys are nuts,’ ” Severson told me. Even for Chess.com in 2024, with all its resources, it would be hard to pull off a tournament involving millions of players. But KasparovChess wanted it and flew Severson out to New York City. “When I reached their floor, I was, like, ‘Wow!’ ” he said. “It was a humongous floor, first off. I remember there were a lot of cubicles, and I thought: This company is huge. I was blown away that they could afford such nice, high-rise office space in Manhattan.” Severson presented his calculations and estimates and showed the total sum of what it would cost. “It was a ridiculous number; it was in the millions,” he said. “I was supposed to be in New York for two days. The meeting lasted maybe an hour or two at the most, and they were just, like, ‘All right, thanks for coming, but we’re not going to continue with your services.’ So I basically had a two-day paid vacation in Manhattan. I went sightseeing and still remember having a Midori sour in the Windows on the World bar on the top floor of the World Trade Center’s North Tower.” KasparovChess suddenly resurfaced in April 2021, described as “a new multimedia content platform for chess lovers of all skill levels.” The platform hosted puzzles, online matches, tutorials, articles, documentaries, and an exclusive master class by Kasparov for premium members. Like with the first iteration of the site, there was an emphasis on multimedia lessons. Hundreds of videos had been pre-recorded, often featuring some of the world’s most famous grandmasters. In short, the site looked slick and promising. Would it work this time around? For the relaunch Kasparov partnered with global media company Vivendi. The company, the owner of businesses like Canal+ and Dailymotion, was also an early sponsor of the Grand Chess Tour, an annual circuit of chess tournaments to which Kasparov was a special advisor. Vivendi’s subsidiary Keysquare provided a starting capital of $3.5 million. The business model was quite different from the one in 1999–2000, this time going for freemium: some content was free, but the best material was available for a $13.99 monthly fee or $119.99 for a yearly subscription—for comparison, an annual Diamond membership on Chess.com, providing all the premium features, went for $99 that year. For a few months in 2021, KasparovChess gained quite a bit of traction as top grandmasters promoted their videos on social media. Two years later, nobody was talking about the company any more. It’s not easy to explain why Kasparov’s online enterprises failed twice. I believe that, in the early 2000s, it was a combination of perhaps naive management and bad timing: the market of chess players wishing to spend money on the internet just wasn’t big enough yet. Two decades later, it might have been too saturated: KasparovChess couldn’t claim a sizeable market share from the existing and successful commercial platforms, most notably Chess.com. Meanwhile, in those early 2000s, the ICC went from strength to strength, although not without facing competition. Several others tried to set up playing servers as a business, including Yahoo!Chess, Chess.net, the World Chess Network, Chesslive, Chesspark, and Chesscube. In the market for club-level players, the ICC’s biggest rival was Playchess, a playing server developed by ChessBase and launched in October 2001. Many serious amateurs, as well as grandmasters, would have accounts on both ICC and Playchess, and the two companies presided over a roughly equal market share for a few years. The next chapter will explore how they were relegated to marginal players, losing the battle to Lichess and Chess.com. With the incredible rise in popularity of online chess since the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, it’s easy to forget that playing chess over the internet is basically as old as the internet itself. Thanks to technology, playing a game in real time with someone at the other end of the world has been possible since the late 1980s. Chess was already a game without limitations, as it could be played between opponents of any age, gender, ethnic group, political affiliation, or religion. Now, distance was not a problem either. It took a few decades before the true global revolution would take place, but the seeds had been sown.",

But you could still play like a 5-minute game. You couldn’t play bullet of course, that wasn’t possible. The popularity of bullet started a couple of years later, when the speed of the Internet got fast enough for that.” —Sandro Leonori, long-time admin of the Internet Chess Club, 2023 In 1989, a 20-year-old student named Brian Karen from Long Island, New York, was working at a computer shop. He was responsible for the shipping department and phone sales, and, as it turned out, his interest in computers would soon be connected to his growing love for chess. When we spoke for this book, he revealed that he was one of the very first people ever to play an international game of chess in real-time on the internet: At college, the chess player on my floor in the dorm was one of my friends, and he said: “You’ve got to see this. You can play chess online!” This was at Syracuse University, and they had this big mainframe computer there. So I went with him. I had to go through the snow. We went to the computer center, and I played some guy, I think he was in Chile. And the way it would be, you type in like e2-e4 and hit return, and then the dot matrix printer would print out the board, like in text format, and you’d see his move, you know, e7-e5, or whatever it was. And we played the game. And I was like, wow, this is amazing. Back then, you had to pay a lot of money for long-distance calls, so to play someone in Chile was like, What? The first network of linked computers at different physical locations was set up in the mid-1960s at the American government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This network, named ARPANET, would later be connected to other networks from which the internet emerged. To play online chess in the late 1980s, you basically had to be living in the US where you could connect either via a university or by subscribing to one of the commercial networks, such as CompuServe, Prodigy, or the Sierra Network, that typically charged $2 to $7 an hour. Karen’s game with his Chilean opponent used a rudimentary form of what would soon see the light: the first dedicated server to play chess. It was born on January 15, 1992. Online Chess Emerges: ICS, FICS, ICC Created by Michael Moore and Richard Nash, the Internet Chess Server (ICS) was the first online chess server of many to come. It could be reached on the University of Utah’s server address lark.utah.edu via Telnet (short for “teletype network”), a protocol originally developed in 1969 allowing users to access and interact with another computer or device over a network. Users could log into a remote computer and execute commands as if they were physically at that computer’s terminal, or they could log into the ICS and play a game of chess. In July 1992, the ICS was moved to a host machine at Carnegie Mellon University, where a couple of undergraduate students ran it. Daniel Sleator, a professor of computer science at the university, started managing the project by the end of 1992. He improved the system, fixed bugs, added new features (most notably the “time-stamp” feature, a system that compensated for internet lag), copyrighted the code, and had a bit of fun now and then. On April 1, 1994, as an April Fools’ joke, he set the server code to “bogomode,” a setting that made the ratings go crazy. Suddenly, winning or losing games would result in gaining or dropping hundreds of rating points. After the settings were restored, one member emailed Sleator: “Why can’t I keep my rating of -11609? April Fools’ or not, I had the worst record.” As the number of accounts grew rapidly from roughly 2,000 in 1993 to 10,000 in early 1995, Sleator started to receive purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialize the server. With his wife, Lylia, and ICS administrators Marty Grund and Eric Peterson, he created a company himself instead. (Today, it is likely one of the ten oldest e-commerce sites that remains active at the time of writing, founded eight months after Amazon and six months before eBay.) On March 1, 1995, Sleator shared his decision with the members. Anyone who telnetted into the ICS saw the following message on their screen: “Important announcement for all members: Today, ICS has become the Internet Chess Club (ICC). Please type ‘help announce’ for all the details.” The most important of those details was the introduction of a fee. From now on, members would be charged $49 a year. The measure came as a shock to most as people were used to playing chess on the internet for free. Sleator’s announcement caused quite the uproar, leading to heated debates on the server and elsewhere. A quick follow-up announcement saying that students would only need to pay $24.50 a year didn’t help much to calm the waters. As tech journalist Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store, wrote in that summer of 1995, “Players lost their tempers and were exiled from the server, opposition groups were formed, lawsuits were threatened, ICC administrators were harassed, and plans to erect alternative servers were formed.” A small group of former ICS programmers decided to create a new, free club: the Free Internet Chess Server. FICS launched on the address fics.onenet.net in the first week of March 1995, just days after Sleator’s announcement. A few months later it had about 1,500 members, while the ICC had 11,000. Throughout the years, FICS remained the smaller sibling of the two, while many of the original naysayers eventually joined and paid for an ICC membership. Around 2009, ICC reached its peak of around 72,000 paying members, with many more using free trials or playing as guests. Asked if FICS was ever a true rival, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer Ruy Mora told me, “That’s tough to say because we couldn’t really measure. But I’m sure there was an impact. There’s a lot of people who don’t want to pay.” Even in 2024, both playing servers continue to exist, keeping a small but loyal user base in the shadow of two giants that occupy the current online landscape. In a way, the relationship between FICS and ICC is similar to the two dominant chess platforms today: Lichess, which is free to play, and the paid-for Chess.com. Starting in the mid-nineties, the “commercial” versus the “internet-should-be-free” vibe is still manifest today as a bit of an ideological rivalry between the two communities. John Fernandez, who was an admin for ICC in the late nineties, told me the analogy does work to some extent: “To some people, ICC were the evil capitalists out there to make money, and FICS was like, ‘We’re free, we’re open source, we’re all volunteers.’ You would use that as a shield, you know. ‘We’re the good guys, the self-proclaimed good guys.’ Lichess is certainly doing that as well.” The Intergalactic Chess Café What was it like to play chess online in those early days? The Dutch novelist and chess player Tim Krabbé described it wonderfully in an article in New in Chess magazine in 1995: It was a fateful night in February when I first saw that posting on the internet, in the newsgroup rec.games.chess. It suggested that I try telnet chess.lm.com 5000 and see how I would like it there. Before I knew what had happened, I had a screenful of names like turbopragma, CarbonNitride, Sartre, DEATH, GrandJaap, Hoho, toto, Barendregt, zigzag, CapedCrusader, Roman, gutterface; all chessplayers I understood—some of them, judging from the ratings next to their names, quite good, and all ready to play chess with me. When I had mastered my first few commands, and was able to read their personal files, I saw they were from all over the world, from the US, Iceland, New Zealand, Brazil, Turkey, Chile, India, even from Leiden [in the Netherlands], but regrettably few from Eastern Europe. DEATH was a student from Puerto Rico, HUS an IM from Singapore, Belsebub a blitz-only player, TheKiller a mathematician from Sweden, Galileo a father of four from San Diego, Pawngrubber a girl, Candide a Texan who turned out never to have heard of Pangloss and indeed, Roman was Roman Dzindzichashvili. He had already played over 1,500 blitz games there, and his rating was over 2800. The global village suddenly seemed like something from the past—this was a global living room; an Intergalactic Chess Cafe. Playing from Amsterdam, Krabbé tried out his first game and was paired against someone in Atlanta, Georgia. The distance between the two players was more than 7,000 kilometers (4,385 miles) but the experience was as exciting as Brian Karen’s: “Even so, those moves appeared on my screen instantly, bleep onto bleep, as if he were sitting across the table. It was overwhelming, mindboggling—the old dream of omnipresence come true.” I had a similar experience around that time. I had just moved to Amsterdam, where I studied for my master’s degree in Dutch Language and Literature at the University of Amsterdam while devoting much of my spare time to chess. A friend of mine, a student at the city’s other university (Vrije Universiteit), had access to the computer department where machines were connected to the internet. All you needed was a login, and he allowed me to use his. I created an account on FICS, logged in via Telnet, and played my first online games. I wasn’t playing on a normal-looking chessboard. Students couldn’t download and install software on the university computer, so Telnet was the only option. Because of that, I had to play on an ASCII board created by text characters. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a character-encoding standard for electronic communication limited to 95 printable characters. Since it was text only, the chessboard was built from vertical (|) and horizontal (—) lines creating a grid with 64 squares (but no distinction between light or dark!) and pieces in capital letters (P, N, B, R, Q, K), together with asterisks for the black pieces (*P, *N, *B, *R, *Q, *K). Each move had to be typed in by keyboard. The whole experience made it hard to focus on the actual chess, but I kept returning anyway, as the experience was indeed overwhelming and mindboggling. It looked like this, after White had played their first move: Soon, I got myself a computer and a 28.8 Kbps dial-up modem that allowed me to hook up to the internet from home. A modem was a piece of external hardware that converted data into a format suitable for an analog transmission medium, in this case, your telephone line. Older readers will remember the typical sound such a modem would make when the connection was initialized, something akin to the shrieking of an old tavern’s wooden door, leading to a digital world full of instantly accessible information—and crazy chess players. In Europe, most of the chess was played in the evening or during the night, for two reasons. This was when the Americans, and therefore most of the stronger players, would be online. But it was also cheaper because, in those days, making phone calls in the evening was charged at a lower rate than during the day. Still, there have been stories about chess players who faced a phone bill of over a thousand dollars after “clicking” chess moves for a month. Internet chess would never have exploded like it did if everyone was still playing with those impossible ASCII-based chessboards. Like the chess world’s Wright brothers, developers created chess server interfaces to play the game, and that’s when things took off. Dozens of such interfaces were developed. You had to pick one, download it from the anonymous file transfer site ftp://chess.onenet.net, unpack it, install it on your local machine, brew a nice cup of coffee, and enter the arena. This is what playing chess online (on the Free Internet Chess Server) looked like in the 1990s. One of the most popular was ZIICS, developed by Andy McFarland from Owensboro, Kentucky. It ran on MS-DOS, Microsoft’s operating system used in most personal computers. It co-existed for many years with Windows, launched in late 1985. ZIICS also required a graphics adapter, but then you could choose from several styles of piece sets from 32 pixels per square to 56 pixels per square, and you could configure the buttons’ colors and functions by editing a text file. If Vincent van Gogh had been into chess, he would have loved it. On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95, reportedly spending as much as $200 million on advertising. A year later, the program BlitzIn, which worked on Windows, became the most popular chess interface. It helped boost the success of ICC, and so did the massive influx of new members thanks to the live relay of the Kasparov–Deep Blue matches. Word spread quickly that there was a place where you could play chess and meet grandmasters 24/7. On the day Kasparov and Deep Blue played their second match game, the ICC set a record with 2,266 people online and 307 simultaneous games—a small step in hindsight but a giant leap at the time. On August 25, 1997, the ICC launched The King’s Messenger, an email newsletter for online chess. In its first issue, Danny Sleator wrote, “This newsletter was necessitated by the staggering growth of the ICC: now over 25,000 games are played every day, and the population reaches over 800 on an average night. The ICC has become one of the more significant organizations in world chess.” In early January 1998, about 40,000 games were played daily on the platform. A year later, this had grown to over 70,000. A large tournament for prize money in the year 2000 attracted 310 FIDE-rated players, among them 64 grandmasters. By 2002, the ICC had over 25,000 paying members; two years later that number had crossed 30,000. These numbers might seem tiny—incomparable to the numbers we’re seeing today—but at the time the growth was remarkable. Mouse Skills and Bullet Chess In 1964, Douglas Engelbart and Bill English built the first prototype of a device that moved a cursor on a computer screen. For decades, these devices were wired and therefore resembled the shape and size of a mouse—hence the name. As soon as online chess emerged, the mouse became indispensable. As the tool to execute the moves on the board, it was the chess player’s Nintendo game controller. Chess knowledge and the ability to calculate moves weren’t enough any more; developing mouse skills became critical to having success. One of the strongest players on the ICC in the mid-to-late nineties was the German grandmaster Roland Schmaltz, who played under the handle Hawkeye. In his 2004 book The Complete Chess Server Guide, he wrote a small segment titled “The Art of Mouse Mastery,” where he gave technical tips such as “adjusting the sample rate” in the computer settings and choosing “the right board size and mouse speed.” Schmaltz’s tips and tricks were mostly relevant to a special form of chess called bullet. It’s one of the fastest formats in chess, with players usually getting just one minute for a whole game. With a game averaging about 35 moves, you can think only for about two seconds per move. If you think longer early on, you will have even less time later in the game. This absolutely crazy (but very popular) way of playing chess often leads to insane time scrambles where players can make multiple moves in only a fraction of a second. In fact, most bullet games are decided by one player running out of time or “getting flagged,” in chess lingo. This phrase originates from over-the-board chess before the 2000s, when analog clocks would have a small lever, called a flag, that would drop if the large hand reached the hour. When I was in touch with ICC founder Danny Sleator for this book, he forwarded me an email he sent to some of the administrators in 1995, with “bullet chess” in the subject field. It describes how the name for this spectacular format came about, and that a separate rating system was needed on the server. (Below are only the first two paragraphs of a longer email.) To: sleator+icc-admins@CS.CMU.EDU Subject: bullet chess Date: Wed, 23 Aug 1995 14:14:21 -0400 Message-ID: <6304.809201661@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> From: Daniel Sleator <Daniel_Sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU> Sender: sleator@BOBO.LINK.CS.CMU.EDU I’m going to introduce a new rating. I’m proposing to call it a “bullet” rating. (Alternative would be “lightening” [sic] but that’s too long and awkward. I would entertain other ideas for names.) I talked to several people about where the boundary between bullet and blitz should be. (POTZY, Surf, Broncept have all given me their opinions.) I’d like to solicit your opinions on this matter. You could also play one-minute chess on FICS, where it was not called bullet but lightning (the alternative name Sleator had suggested!). My good friend Arne Moll, a very active online player at the time, noted that this was an example of the rivalry between the two servers: “On FICS, there was some kind of hatred against the word. They would say: ‘Bullet,’ that’s ICC, that’s a shitty, commercial name. We call this ‘lightning.’ ” Whatever it was called, the new format caught on. The American grandmaster Larry Christiansen wrote, in the late 1990s, “Bullet chess is to tournament chess as slapstick comedy is to high drama, or tabloid journalism is to literature. Maybe that is why it is so popular.” Some players had more talent (or taste) for it than others. There’s no denying that bullet chess involves a lot of “dirty tricks” that can help to gain valuable time in the final phases of the game, when it’s all about avoiding getting flagged. One of them is to voluntarily give up a piece simply because of the surprise value and the extra half-second it will take for the opponent to execute their move. Also, in bullet chess, players often continue playing positions where they would normally agree to a draw to try to flag the opponent—opinions are divided on whether this is unsports-manlike behavior. And then there’s the infamous premove: the possibility of, after having made your move, making your next move before your opponent makes one—something unthinkable in over-the-board chess—if you’re certain of your next turn. While the opponent thinks, you can drag your mouse and move one of your pieces to another square. As soon as it’s your move, the server executes your “premoved” move, and you don’t lose any time on your clock. It is a gamble, though, as the success of a premove depends heavily on an expected reply from the opponent. Roland Schmaltz agreed that particularly those final seconds of a game do not have much to do with chess, but stressed that chess skills are still important in bullet: “You are no longer focused on finding the best move. You are focused on finding the most unpleasant move for your opponent to make him lose more time. To achieve your goal, you still have to think in chess terms, but, more importantly, like in a normal chess game, you must think ahead!” And, indeed, to this day the strongest bullet players are also the strongest players in general. As I write this, Chess.com’s 2023 Bullet Chess Championship has just finished, with Hikaru Nakamura beating Magnus Carlsen in the final—the world number one and number two in classical chess, then. A fun moment during the 2023 Bullet Chess Championship on Chess.com in the game between Magnus Carlsen and Daniel Naroditsky. Addiction On August 30, 1999, Loek van Wely from the Netherlands and Alexander Rustemov from Russia played well over a hundred blitz games on the ICC, with a time control of five minutes for a whole game. It turned into a heroic match, a hard-fought and long battle that attracted a lot of online spectators who logged in from many different time zones—because, in the end, the two grandmasters played for 20 hours straight. My compatriot Van Wely won by a score of 64–60 wins, with 13 draws over a total of 137 games. Now, that’s dedication. Or is it something else? The 1895 essay “Concerning Chess” by H. G. Wells opens with the following famous passage: “The passion for playing chess is one of the most unaccountable in the world. It slaps the theory of natural selection in the face. It is the most absorbing of occupations. The least satisfying of desires. A nameless excrescence upon life. It annihilates a man. You have, let us say, a promising politician, a rising artist that you wish to destroy. Dagger or bomb are archaic and unreliable—but teach him, inoculate him with chess.” Although chess addiction is probably as old as the game itself, I believe it’s much easier to get addicted to online chess. The English grandmaster Danny Gormally did not shy away from the truth when he published an article in New in Chess magazine in 2008 titled “Diary of an ICC Addict.” He compared playing online to drugs: “[T]he user experiences a serotonin cascade in the pre-frontal lobe of his brain similar to a drug which could be described as psychotropic. This leads to more and more use, as the addict chases his high, which he finds increasingly difficult to replicate in his humdrum everyday existence.” A comparison to avid casino visitors comes to mind when you realize that chess players sometimes reach for the last resort: asking for a self-ban. Don’t let me in anymore. The same Gormally wrote in his 2016 book A Year Inside the Chess World: “Eventually it dawned on me that playing blitz online all day was a complete waste of my life so I asked them to ban me, being seemingly incapable of stopping playing myself. I was just playing all day, every day.” It’s not a watertight solution because sometimes people create a new account to circumvent their ban. Is blitz chess a drug? In a more recent article in New in Chess magazine, Jennifer Vallens has pointed out that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has added Internet Gaming Addiction as one of the potential disorders that need to be treated: “The APA explains that internet gaming activates reward systems similarly to using drugs. The euphoric feeling when you win a match or unlock an achievement is the same as getting high, as both activities trigger dopamine releases in the brain. When addicts get engrossed playing online games, certain pathways in their brains are triggered in the same direct and intense way that a drug addict’s brain is affected by a particular substance.” Some people just cannot stop playing. They really play a lot. But how much is a lot? One Chess.com account played 436,770 games between April 2014 and June 2021, an average of 167 games per day. Among the titled players, one grandmaster played more games than anyone: 180,000 since 2009. On ICC, one of the members played over 740,000 games between 1996 and 2024, an average of 72 games a day for 28 years straight. A note in his profile says that ICC is “the best chess club in the world.” The American writer and podcaster James Altucher was one of the early users of ICC’s precursor ICS, as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon under Danny Sleator. He told me: I was an addict. I was working a job I didn’t like. I was in a relationship I was unhappy with. One time, it was around 6:00 p.m., I was at work. My girlfriend called me and said, “Don’t forget we have guests coming for dinner at 6:30.” So I was going to play one more game. At midnight she banged on my office door, which was locked. I was in a one-minute match that went on for hours with this guy from Israel. I was just an addict, I couldn’t stop. Then I got home around 7 a.m., and she was just leaving to go to classes. I remember she was so upset with me that she threw a bag filled with textbooks at me and left. It wasn’t the end of the relationship, but it was close. Probably the most addictive aspect of online chess is the time-trouble phase, which occurs late in the game when adrenaline sets in, and every decision feels decisive. It’s basically life or death, killing a wild animal before it gets to you, move after move. No wonder chess has often been compared to boxing. “The emotional impulse behind chess, and the pain it inflicts, is comparable but just takes a different form,” according to the Scottish grandmaster and philosopher Jonathan Rowson. Because most games are played at a quick time control of ten, five, or three minutes—or even one minute—per game, just about every game will see such a time-trouble phase. Among my friends, the most popular format is three-minute chess, which means that during a longer session, that thrilling moment when everything is on the line and the seconds are ticking away occurs roughly every five minutes, again and again: a rush of blood to the head. A quick trip to where the action happens. A brief, intense sense of living—on repeat. Another reason for online addiction is the ratings. Every online server works with its own application of Arpad Elo’s rating system. Because almost all players use a handle (nickname) when playing online, they’re defined by their rating, which is constantly visible alongside their virtual name and updated after every game. A good day’s results in a higher rating, and you feel great, but if the number goes down, it can completely ruin your day (or night). As Krabbé put it, “The ego has its needs too.” The Russian top grandmaster Peter Svidler told me a story about reaching the highest-ever rating on the platform: I was a very heavy ICC user, and then I just basically quit cold turkey and stopped playing online chess for, like, 15 years. One day, I played a very long match and won by a small margin. Then I beat another player in a ten-game match, and, by the end of it, I got the record. I got to 3318. It got badly broken by Hikaru Nakamura and others later, but at that point, for a brief moment, that was the highest-ever blitz rating. So I got the record. I was still kind of high, still feeling the buzz, and I got challenged by Hawkeye. I thought, “Why not?” But in that match, I didn’t play well. It was 5–5. And while you’re playing, you’re not paying much attention to anything but playing the game. When I finished, I looked up, and I was, like, 3092. Because [Roland Schmaltz] wasn’t very high rated, but he was much better than his rating, obviously. And I just looked at this and thought: “What am I doing here? Why am I spending hours and hours doing this?” I realized that the gains I had made over months and months—climbing further when you’re already 3250 is not very easy—were all gone. It would take me another three months to return to whatever it was an hour ago. And I thought, “No, I should maybe just stop.” Now I only play in tournaments and when I stream. In November 2023, Hikaru Nakamura set a new all-time high record blitz rating on Chess.com: 3336. It took just a few weeks for the always competitive Magnus Carlsen to top it, getting to 3340 on December 6 (only to reach even higher numbers before the end of the year). He commented to Norwegian media: I was on a sponsor event in the Bahamas this week and played some games online on Monday. On Tuesday I played Titled Tuesday and was planning to go to bed, but then I found out that I was close to Hikaru’s rating record. Then I thought I could play a few games and take the record. I was pretty close five times. But then it pissed me off so much that I kept going for hours and finally at 3 a.m. I had the record. I was actually pretty chill before that. But afterward I was so excited and struggled to sleep. It was fun, but then I thought, “I can’t be going on like this!” My friend Arne Moll has noted another aspect of online chess addiction, which he calls “the hate.” Sometimes we play badly, and losing sucks. Losing to bad players sucks even more, as it leads to a rating drop into regions that are just embarrassing. On such nights, you tend to play for too long with the idle hope of turning the tide. But it only gets worse. There is nothing new about this. This extract from an article titled “The Hate” by FICS member pdeck reads as if it could have been written yesterday instead of in 1998: I have the hate. I hate my opponent. I hate the spectators that goaded me into playing an extended series with someone who often gets my rating points. I hate the guys in the Lightning Channel for teasing me about my blunders and then logging off at midnight, leaving me to fester in a death spiral of worthless, repetitive chess punctuated only by one or two mad dashes to the men’s room or poorly stocked vending machines. More than anything, I hate myself. I spend too much god-damned time playing lightning, giving up both work and sleep. And what do I have to show for it? A shitty rating. The silliness about online ratings is mostly revealed by what I call the round-number idiocy. All chess players are prone to it, but they can take comfort in realizing they’re not unique. It is typical human behavior. Studies have shown that those who wear fitness trackers, professional baseball players, and high school SAT takers exert more effort when their performance falls just short of a round number rather than just above. And it goes even further, as shown in research from 2020 undertaken at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. The study determined that people have a preference for round numbers over specific numbers—that, for instance, people informed by health officials that a newly developed COVID-19 vaccine was 91.27 percent effective would likely think it was a less effective vaccine than if they were told it was 90 percent effective. Chess players, from total beginners to world champions, are obsessed with round-numbered ratings. Magnus Carlsen peaked at 2882 (twice) and, for a while, attempted to break 2900. Those 18 points mattered. It was big news when the French-Iranian prodigy Alireza Firouzja broke the 2800 rating barrier in December 2021 at 18 years and 166 days (breaking Carlsen’s previous record of 18 years and 336 days). For club players, making it to 2000 is a big deal. And then 2100—and then 2200. My own peak rating was 2292 in October 2004, and it still annoys me that I didn’t get to 2300. This leads to nonsensical, but familiar, behavior online. You play a few games in the evening, your rating has dropped to 1950, and you decide: “I’ll play until my rating is over 2000 again.” You win some, you lose some. Before you know it, it’s after midnight, and you suddenly notice your rating is 1998. Just one more win and you can call it a day. But you don’t win. In fact, you somehow never win that last game. At four in the morning, with a rating of 1911, you give up, frustrated and exhausted. You’ll have to find your way to your bed knowing you’re a terrible chess player because you don’t belong in that group of players above 2000. Often, you log on the next morning, fresh again, win a bunch of games in a row, break 2000, and don’t understand why that went so easy. You promise you will never play late in the evening again. But you will, maybe even on that same day. I’ve experienced many such evenings of online blitz silliness, but I’m cured now. The only way to avoid them is to play unrated games, the equivalent of zero-alcohol beer. It’s not the real thing. But many others can’t stop. Those heavy users with over a hundred games per day on average might have a serious problem. I feel worried sometimes about those heavy users, and I wonder if Chess.com and Lichess could do more to help the real addicts. Everyone Played. Everyone? The Internet Chess Club is a true pioneer of online chess. It can boast several milestones: the first online chess lecture in April 1995; the first internet simultaneous exhibition by a world champion (Garry Kasparov), in November 1995; the first intercollegiate online chess tournament, a month later; and the first top grandmasters playing online for prize money in November 1999. Around then, John Fernandez was hired as the public relations director tasked with growing the ICC further. He started working on sponsorships, banner advertising, and building relationships with organizers. For the next decade, the ICC was the place to be. In the early 2000s, the British newspaper the Sunday Telegraph wrote: “There are more than 300 places to play chess on the Internet but, as with nightclubs, there is only one place the ‘A list’ gravitates to: the Internet Chess Club.” The absolute top players of the time became active on the site: people like Veselin Topalov, Alexei Shirov, Nigel Short, and even Garry Kasparov, but also a young Hikaru Nakamura and an even younger Magnus Carlsen. It helped that grandmasters got free accounts, and Fernandez put a lot of effort into getting them to play on the site. During the 1999 FIDE World Chess Championship—a knockout event with a hundred participants held in Las Vegas—Fernandez gave all of the entrants a gift bag with a personal letter and a floppy disk that had the BlitzIn interface pre-installed to make it easier for the grandmasters to start playing. And it worked. All players logged in at least once, except one: the 68-year-old Viktor Korchnoi, a living legend but also a bit of a grumpy old man. Fernandez recalls: “He mumbled something and threw the envelope in the nearest bin.” Especially after Vegas 1999, just about all the big names joined the ICC. Nakamura had started playing as early as 1997, when he was nine years old, on an account he shared with his brother and stepfather. In 1999 he created a new one named YearoftheRabbit and used it until most strong players knew who he was. Starting from 2001, he played under Smallville, after the American superhero TV series that ran between 2001 and 2011. “I wanted an anonymous account, and, at the time, I was a big fan of the TV show,” Nakamura told me. Between 2001 and 2011 he played 15,306 blitz games and 13,967 bullet games on this account. He was also one of the first grandmasters to seriously benefit from online chess as a youngster because he would download his games and look for mistakes he’d made with the computer. But mostly, he would just play—a lot. I remember that around 2008–9 Nakamura stayed at my place in Amsterdam for one night as he had mistakenly booked a connecting flight on the wrong date. The next morning, I started working in the living room as quietly as I could, hiding behind a big computer screen while he slept on the couch. Eventually, he woke up and got out of the sleeping bag. Only then did I notice he was still wearing his clothes. We exchanged good mornings, and he sat down behind his laptop. Soon, I heard the type of mouse-clicking that could mean only one thing: he was playing blitz. That’s how you get good: when something is on your mind first thing in the morning, before breakfast, before anything else. Magnus Carlsen joined the ICC around 2001 and created the account imtobesoon. After becoming an IM, he ambitiously continued with the account gmtobesoon, and when that title was in the bag, he changed it to Magnus. Later on, the Norwegian prodigy used multiple anonymous accounts. He and Nakamura likely first played each other online in 2004. What would turn out to become a rivalry lasting over two decades all started with a friendly match between Magnus and Smallville on July 18, 2004. Over 12 games with a time control of three minutes per person (and no increment), 13-year-old Carlsen beat 16-year-old Nakamura 9–3, with no draws. The ICC made it a lot easier for people to play a game of chess against someone. You no longer had to follow the annoying social code of taking a shower and getting dressed before moving your king’s pawn. In the late 1990s, founder Danny Sleator noted that his online club encouraged people to play chess who normally wouldn’t bother going out to a club: “I’ve heard a lot of people say that. I am an example of this.” Just about everyone was trying their luck with online chess, although, as with all new technological developments, there were skeptics too. John Saunders, a very nice English fellow whom I met at many tournaments where he was working as a journalist and photographer, is one such person. He said in an interview in 1999: “Chess is like sex—it is only healthy when it involves two consenting humans in the same room. It is a social game. How can people enjoy playing chess when they masquerade under names like ‘Kingkicker’ and exchange no more dialogue than the perennial ‘thanx?’ Okay, I’m a hypocrite because I HAVE played Internet chess, am no good at it, and have a ‘handle’ which is an ancient Greek word meaning ‘I thrust a radish up the fundament.’ But I do not find it addictive or attractive.” Apart from the few critics, just about everyone who played chess played on the ICC. For a brief time that may have included a certain Bobby Fischer. On September 9, 2001, the English grandmaster Nigel Short wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph in which he claimed to be “99 percent sure” that he had faced the American former world champion in almost 50 online games. It was tremendously exciting news for chess fans; even those who didn’t believe it wanted to believe it. Any news related to Fischer, who had completely disappeared from the chess scene once again after beating Spassky in 1992, was fascinating. The thought of him playing chess again was just wonderful. Short revealed that in his first encounter, he lost 8–0, despite his mysterious opponent playing “some highly irregular if not totally absurd opening moves.” He would shift all his pawns forward by one square or play his king toward the center of the board as early as move two. “From this deliberately unpromising position emerged moves of extraordinary power,” said Short. “In this first game, I was totally crushed.” While chatting with his opponent, Short noticed that he knew a great deal about the major chess players of the 1960s, which happened to be Fischer’s most active period. Short decided to test him and asked his opponent if he knew of Armando Acevedo, an obscure Mexican player. He got an instant reply: “Siegen, 1970.” Because Fischer had played Acevedo at the Siegen Chess Olympiad in West Germany in 1970, Short felt “the guy was trying to tell me something.” The games were not recorded because Short had used a guest account (respecting his opponent’s wishes). ICC’s Danny Sleator, therefore, could not investigate Short’s claim that it was Fischer. However, soon it was revealed—somewhat sadly, I may add—who the mysterious opponent was: a Canadian network expert who used a chess engine. On January 28, 2002, Fischer himself said in an interview on Icelandic television that he never played on the internet. Alas, the mystery had been more enticing while still unsolved. Most grandmasters playing on the site didn’t keep their identity a secret. In fact, many of them would provide some extra details in their profile. I especially liked the notes from the English grandmaster David Norwood, who used the handle DaveNoGood for playing: Dave Norwood Retired grandmaster … ashamed to keep the title I only play 1 g3 and 1 … g6 4.If my play gets a bit funny it may have something to do with what I’m drinking … One of the many stories from those early days of internet chess is about a man whose life was saved while playing online. In September 1997, 48-year-old Charles Drafts started to feel a shortness of breath and dizziness during a game and sent a message to all members, saying, “I’m having physical illness problems and need help.” Drafts was a double amputee who lived in Boston’s housing projects in Mission Hill and who typed using a stick in his mouth. Some chess fans thought his message was a joke, but, luckily, others took it seriously. They asked Drafts to type his address and asked about his symptoms. Andy McFarland, one of the ICC admins, called Boston’s emergency medical services, and, eventually, firefighters broke down the door and rushed Drafts to Beth Israel hospital, where he was stabilized. The Charles Drafts story is an example of something that should not be underestimated about those early years of online chess: the social aspect. People came online not only to play a game of chess but also to meet people. Because, back then, there were so many fewer people online at the same time than we’ve grown accustomed to nowadays (3,000 concurrent players would push the server to its limits), and because of how things were structured, everyone could fairly easily talk to each other, and amateurs regularly conversed with top players. For most chess fans who didn’t travel internationally to tournaments, it was the first time in their lives that they could communicate with chess players from abroad. International master Greg Shahade, who started playing online in 1995, told me, “Girls approached me on FICS. I made a lot of friends.” For others, it went further: there are several stories of people getting married after first speaking to each other on the ICC. A Dutch chess player named his son after the handle he used online: Jaap. The chess servers had special chat channels, technically the same as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), to serve these social needs: you could start a private channel among your friends, or join one of the open channels with specific subjects. There was, for instance, a music channel, and a trivia channel where a bot would throw in trivia questions all day, and everyone providing answers would automatically be included in the daily rankings. ICC’s most popular channel was 97, dedicated to (mostly American) politics and more liberal than other channels when it came to foul language. “I also tried regular chat rooms in those days, but these would be meaningless,” Arne Moll told me. “You would sit there with random Americans. What should you talk about? Chess connects, and that’s the great thing. An ICC chat room was like a local pub full of international people who loved chess. It was quite special.” These days, we have individual chess communities active on social media platforms like Discord, X, Reddit, and Telegram, but they are somewhat scattered. Sites like Chess.com or Lichess don’t have chat channels, but maybe they should. Mark Crowther: Unsung Hero As desktop computers and other workstations became more connected globally in the late 1970s, there was a growing interest in sharing information. This led to a particular type of network called the Bulletin Board System (BBS), which allowed users to post messages like they would on a physical thumbtack bulletin board. USENET launched in 1978 as a global bulletin board that established the concept of newsgroups, where like-minded users could exchange messages on their topics of interest. It was estimated that in 1990 there were 265,000 users on five continents. One of these newsgroups was rec.games.chess, launched in 1987. People started sharing anything related to chess, and some even took up the task of typing out the full notation of recently played tournament games. This particular newsgroup kick-started the incredible acceleration of the availability of chess information, which would have enormous consequences for the game. One avid chess fan from Clayton, a suburb of Bradford in northern England, would play a vital role in this development and, as most chess fans are unaware, still does. Born in 1966, Mark Crowther learned the rules of chess in 1972, the year of the famous Fischer–Spassky match. He played chess at school and joined a local club. After studying information sciences in Leeds, Crowther found a job as a librarian/technician at Bradford University’s Modern Languages Center in the late 1980s. Crowther had a desire to collect and a love to share. He got a computer account in the library, joined the rec.games.chess newsgroup, and soon became one of the most active users, sharing recent chess games he found in newspaper chess columns and other media available in his library. Using a Linux system, he manually typed them in almost daily until he decided to turn it into a weekly thing. On September 17, 1994, he launched the first issue of The Week in Chess (TWIC). After seven weeks, he had learned enough HTML to set up his first website and post links to all TWIC issues. A legendary online magazine was born. Initially, Crowther combined collecting games with his day job. “I used to work at the university, finish on Friday, go to the computer center and do it on Friday night and Saturday, and go back to work on Monday,” he said. That went on for about a year and a half until it became too much: “Very quickly, I got pushed into publishing more and more games. It got out of control very quickly. And then it became: either I give up or go pro. That was the choice.” In 1996, Crowther briefly worked for the Canadian enterprise Thoth Communications Corporation. Between 1997 and 2012, he was sponsored by journalist and entrepreneur Malcolm Pein. As the owner of London’s Chess & Bridge shop, Pein used TWIC to send its readers to his online shop. Crowther got paid, and Pein got his online book sales. In 2012 the collaboration ended, and since then Crowther has relied on advertising, subscriptions, and donations. To me, Crowther is a legend, one of the unsung heroes of the chess world who deserves more credit than he gets. When I interviewed him in 2019 on the occasion of TWIC’s 25th anniversary, he told me that he was doing well, though he had some slight worries about his pension: “It’s a fun business to be in, but it’s not very secure. I’m going to have to work for another 20 years. But I enjoy doing it. I never go to bed on a Monday without finishing TWIC. It’s unthinkable. It’s how you get it done.” As I type this, TWIC is still going strong, a stunning 30 years after its inception. It appears on Mondays and summarizes the results of international chess tournaments. More importantly, Crowther provides a file with all the games played over the last week that anyone can download for free. These days, a single file can easily contain a few thousand games. Since 1994, the TWIC database has grown to over three and a half million games. Crowther doesn’t keep track of the figures, but chess fans who click the download button each week—from seasoned grandmasters to aspiring youngsters—must number in their thousands. Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand told me, “I remember, I think it was some time in 1995 that I first heard about The Week in Chess. I downloaded my first one then, and I cannot think of too many [other] routines that I’ve stuck to every single week for the last 25 years. [TWIC is] just really an institution in chess.” The Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri, of a younger generation, expressed a similar sentiment in a tweet in August 2015: “When more than two TWICs are missing on your laptop, you know that something has gone wrong with your chess routine.” Why was TWIC so revolutionary? Well, having information about your opponent is vital. Before the internet, that wasn’t easy to get. One of the people who helped provide games for Crowther in the early years was Australia’s number-one player, Ian Rogers. Becoming a world-class grandmaster himself in the 1980s, while combining his successful playing career with chess journalism, Rogers witnessed firsthand how the internet changed the sport. “Before TWIC, you had Murray Chandler’s Tournament Chess,” said Rogers. “This magazine was not much more than printouts of games, with the occasional diagram, but it was invaluable. You traveled with it. If you were playing a tournament and had games from tournaments where your opponent had played before, it was very useful to have info on that.” Rogers toured Europe in those years with his wife Cathy, due to the lack of tournaments in Australia. Along with Tournament Chess, he and his colleagues would pack recent copies of Chess Informant or New in Chess Yearbooks in their suitcases: thick manuals containing hundreds of recent top-level games and analyses printed on thin paper, resembling phonebooks, another relic of the past. Other sources of information were periodicals such as British Chess Magazine, the German Schach 64, the Swiss weekly Die Schachwoche, and specialized books on chess openings. There was always a limit to the amount of material you could bring to a tournament, so books and clothes would be fighting for luggage space. With TWIC, preparing for a game was suddenly child’s play as it became much easier to find games played by your opponent, even as recently as the previous week. Moreover, you could now store thousands of games on a single floppy disk, which saved a huge amount of space. TWIC was particularly useful for chess players working with one of the chess database programs that were starting to become popular in those years as well. KasparovChess and the Dotcom Bubble While TWIC had the chess information and the ICC was the place to play, the internet landscape was changing rapidly. Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web was all the rage, and the first browsers started to appear: first Mosaic in 1993, then Netscape Navigator in 1994, followed by Internet Explorer in 1995. Just 16 months after Marc Andreessen and James Clark formed Netscape, the company had a historic initial public offering, or IPO, on August 9, 1995. On the first trading day, the stock opened at $28 per share and closed at $58.25 per share, giving the company a market value of about $2.9 billion. Andreessen became a multimillionaire, and Clark moved toward being the first internet billionaire. Netscape went public without previously having made a profit, a groundbreaking move at the time that contributed to a surge in interest in making money on the internet. A speculative mania, dubbed the “dot-com bubble,” led to a collapse in the early 2000s of many companies. KasparovChess was one of the failed start-ups. World champion since 1985, Garry Kasparov had launched a “Club Kasparov” website in early 1999, mainly written in Russian. The same year, the location of the site was changed to kasparovchess.com with the launch of a new business backed by mostly Israeli investors. Offices in the US, UK, Russia, and Israel opened as the international content team grew to about 30 members. Kasparov Chess Online (KCO), as it was officially named, was intended to be the dominant chess platform for both strong and casual players, parents, and kids. The site ambitiously advertised itself as “the home of chess on the web.” It offered everything: a playing zone, a news section, a forum, an event calendar, a shop, a magazine, downloadable multimedia lessons, and regular contributions from Kasparov himself, who often sent “express commentary” on the same day he played in a tournament. One of the key assets of KCO, which was fairly new at the time, was that users could play chess in a browser via an HTML interface. The main business model was both typical of those days and hardly viable: trying to build a huge base of free users who would be exposed to advertising. By 2002 a total of $13 million of investment was burned, including Kasparov’s personal injection of $110,000. The company was hardly making money. In September 2002 the board of directors decided to pull the plug. According to New in Chess magazine, Kasparov blamed the demise of his platform on “disputes between the minority Israeli stockholders who controlled the business and administrative functions of the company, and the majority stockholders associated with him.” Mig Greengard, who worked on content for KCO, wrote at the time: “The Israeli money-men thought it was more important to employ a group of Israeli programmers costing over $100,000 per month than have grandmasters, writers, and other chess people costing a fraction of that. Instead of cutting back, they went down with the ship over Kasparov’s protests.” I don’t know if the Israeli team ever responded to Greengard’s version of how things went down, but they likely saw it differently. This was not the end of the story. On Christmas Eve 2002, the First International Bank of Israel (FIBI), which had lent $1.6 million to KCO demanded the site be reopened and sought unspecified damages in a court in Delaware, where the company was registered. Effectively, the bank attempted to seize permanent control of the world-class asset of Kasparov’s name and likeness as compensation for their failed loan. On December 27, a US chancery judge ruled against the bank, calling the case “far too thin.” From a historical perspective, it’s interesting to note that Jay Severson, one of the future cofounders of Chess.com, had a rendezvous with KasparovChess somewhere between 1999 and 2000. Severson was working at Case’s Ladder, a Seattle-based online solutions provider for tournaments, leagues, brackets, and ladders. As the market leader in that area, the company was approached by KasparovChess for the rather ambitious plan to run a worldwide tournament for kids in schools, which would end up with a live final somewhere. They needed logistical support, arbiters, the whole shebang. “I remember laughing at the email, going, like, ‘These guys are nuts,’ ” Severson told me. Even for Chess.com in 2024, with all its resources, it would be hard to pull off a tournament involving millions of players. But KasparovChess wanted it and flew Severson out to New York City. “When I reached their floor, I was, like, ‘Wow!’ ” he said. “It was a humongous floor, first off. I remember there were a lot of cubicles, and I thought: This company is huge. I was blown away that they could afford such nice, high-rise office space in Manhattan.” Severson presented his calculations and estimates and showed the total sum of what it would cost. “It was a ridiculous number; it was in the millions,” he said. “I was supposed to be in New York for two days. The meeting lasted maybe an hour or two at the most, and they were just, like, ‘All right, thanks for coming, but we’re not going to continue with your services.’ So I basically had a two-day paid vacation in Manhattan. I went sightseeing and still remember having a Midori sour in the Windows on the World bar on the top floor of the World Trade Center’s North Tower.” KasparovChess suddenly resurfaced in April 2021, described as “a new multimedia content platform for chess lovers of all skill levels.” The platform hosted puzzles, online matches, tutorials, articles, documentaries, and an exclusive master class by Kasparov for premium members. Like with the first iteration of the site, there was an emphasis on multimedia lessons. Hundreds of videos had been pre-recorded, often featuring some of the world’s most famous grandmasters. In short, the site looked slick and promising. Would it work this time around? For the relaunch Kasparov partnered with global media company Vivendi. The company, the owner of businesses like Canal+ and Dailymotion, was also an early sponsor of the Grand Chess Tour, an annual circuit of chess tournaments to which Kasparov was a special advisor. Vivendi’s subsidiary Keysquare provided a starting capital of $3.5 million. The business model was quite different from the one in 1999–2000, this time going for freemium: some content was free, but the best material was available for a $13.99 monthly fee or $119.99 for a yearly subscription—for comparison, an annual Diamond membership on Chess.com, providing all the premium features, went for $99 that year. For a few months in 2021, KasparovChess gained quite a bit of traction as top grandmasters promoted their videos on social media. Two years later, nobody was talking about the company any more. It’s not easy to explain why Kasparov’s online enterprises failed twice. I believe that, in the early 2000s, it was a combination of perhaps naive management and bad timing: the market of chess players wishing to spend money on the internet just wasn’t big enough yet. Two decades later, it might have been too saturated: KasparovChess couldn’t claim a sizeable market share from the existing and successful commercial platforms, most notably Chess.com. Meanwhile, in those early 2000s, the ICC went from strength to strength, although not without facing competition. Several others tried to set up playing servers as a business, including Yahoo!Chess, Chess.net, the World Chess Network, Chesslive, Chesspark, and Chesscube. In the market for club-level players, the ICC’s biggest rival was Playchess, a playing server developed by ChessBase and launched in October 2001. Many serious amateurs, as well as grandmasters, would have accounts on both ICC and Playchess, and the two companies presided over a roughly equal market share for a few years. The next chapter will explore how they were relegated to marginal players, losing the battle to Lichess and Chess.com. With the incredible rise in popularity of online chess since the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, it’s easy to forget that playing chess over the internet is basically as old as the internet itself. Thanks to technology, playing a game in real time with someone at the other end of the world has been possible since the late 1980s. Chess was already a game without limitations, as it could be played between opponents of any age, gender, ethnic group, political affiliation, or religion. Now, distance was not a problem either. It took a few decades before the true global revolution would take place, but the seeds had been sown.",

We will have to somehow convince all these people who play for free to come over to our site and then pay us money. Like, at what point is that business model ever gonna work?” —Jay Severson, to Erik Allebest, in 2005 It is September 1995, the first week of freshman year for Erik Allebest, who has just turned 18. He wakes up and walks to the shared bathroom at the Brigham Young University (BYU) campus in Provo, Utah. He sees a young man of the same age, wearing glasses and brushing his teeth. Allebest uses the bathroom for a couple of minutes, comes back, and the fellow is still brushing. “It just seemed like a really long time,” Allebest told me. “So I said, ‘What, is your dad a dentist, or something?’ ” It is the first thing Allebest ever says to Jarom (Jay) Severson, his future friend and cofounder of Chess.com. Later that day, Severson walks along the third floor of Merrill Hall and notices two students inside one of the dormitories. One is Allebest, the other is Ryan Miller, and they are playing chess. “Can I get the winner?” Severson asks. He beats them both. No, he destroys them. Allebest recalled, “When he came in and saw me playing chess, I felt like he wanted to kick my ass because I’d made this snarky comment in the morning.” Born in 1977 in Silverton, Oregon, Severson grew up in a small town a few miles south called Lebanon. He and his five siblings were raised as Mormons. (These days, the preferred term is “Latter-day Saints.”) Severson told me that when he was 11 years old, the family-owned pizzeria went bankrupt and his father lost his job as a police officer. The family eventually relocated to San José when Severson was in sixth grade. He learned about chess when his father, who enjoyed carpentry as a hobby, made a large, heavy chessboard all by himself, using thick, solid wood. At first, he watched his older brothers play, until they allowed him to join in. Severson told me he got hooked on the game in high school, which had a chess club and played team matches with other schools: “I got sucked in real big.” He started buying chess books and even entered individual tournaments. When he joined BYU, Severson was the obvious person to run the chess club. Allebest, also born in 1977, came from a family of Latter-day Saints too, but he grew up in upper-class Laguna Hills, Orange County, in Southern California. His mother taught him chess when he was eight years old. His father was a lawyer with an entrepreneurial mindset, which Allebest inherited. On Monday mornings he went where the kids drank beers on the weekends, collected the cans and recycled them for $20. After graduating from high school, Allebest went to BYU and deliberately chose something that was not too challenging. In an interview in 2021, he said, “I was an English major, but only so I could get through classes as quickly as possible. I didn’t feel like I was learning a lot in school. I would literally put my Shakespeare book on my desk. Inside of that, I would have a Computers for Dummies or HTML for Beginners. I was teaching myself about computers and technology.” In that BYU dorm in September 1995, Allebest was impressed by Severson’s chess skills and asked, “How did you do that? Hey, can you give me some chess lessons? I’ll pay you $7 an hour.” And that’s what they agreed on. The two met about once a week, and while Severson started teaching Allebest chess openings, their friendship blossomed. Erik Allebest, left, and Jay Severson, right, the founders of Chess.com, as students on a trip (year unknown). Things were different in sophomore year when Severson continued college, but most of his friends, including Allebest, started their two-year missionary service abroad, a typical interruption from college for young Latter-day Saints. The two of them lost touch for a few years. Meanwhile, Severson became a successful video game player who won the 1998 StarCraft World Championship, a 3,000-player competition hosted as part of the Professional Gamers League’s third season. Gaining the first prize of $8,500 and a new computer was nice, but much more lucrative was the sponsorship deal Severson signed with Logitech, worth about $50,000 after he was featured in magazines like Newsweek and Wired. Not bad for a 20-year-old student coming from a family that used to live on welfare. Severson: “I felt I could retire.” But he didn’t. In fact, his professional gaming career only lasted a year or two as Severson decided to enter San José State University (SJSU) instead, ultimately going for a computer science major. He learned about HTML and built his very first two websites: one about winning strategies for the board game Axis and Allies and one about chess openings. After graduating, he worked at different companies as a developer, including Case’s Ladder, which brought him to KasparovChess in New York, and, later, a company called Myers, where he built real-estate and mortgage-related websites. On the other hand, Allebest became an entrepreneur early on. After returning from his mission in Argentina, he created two chess-related companies during his years at BYU. One was Schoolhouse Chess, a chess tutoring program he implemented in dozens of elementary schools across Utah. Out of that company came his e-commerce business, wholesalechess.com, which Severson helped code. Allebest would import chess sets from China (before Alibaba made that easy), store them in his garage, sell them online, and ship them all over the country (before Amazon made running such a business hard). After a few years, Allebest sold the two companies and entered Stanford Business School to get his master’s degree. He interned at Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, Google, and Palantir but turned down full-time positions. In the spring of 2005 he called Severson and said, “Hey, I met the guys that own the chess.com domain. What do you think about doing another chess business together?” Severson wasn’t excited at all. At that point, he had a job at Myers that paid him a pretty good salary, and he had seen many businesses fail in the chess space, including Kasparov Chess Online. The Internet Chess Club was doing okay but wasn’t growing much any more. The only really big chess platform at the time was Yahoo!Chess, but people there were playing for free. Severson told Allebest, “I would love to work with you but, dude, there’s no money in chess.” But Allebest had a plan. He said, “Well, we’ll do it this way. We’ll create profiles for players and make other content, and we’ll have ads for revenue. It will be a MySpace for chess. Just come with me and meet these guys and see how it goes.” Severson agreed, and soon they met with the original chess.com domain owners in the Japanese restaurant Fuki Sushi in Palo Alto, a famous spot in Silicon Valley where many tech companies have started. “So we walk into this meeting, and they were all mid-sixties and older; they were an older group of guys that just generationally did not understand the internet,” Severson said. “They didn’t understand where the internet was going; they didn’t have the technological background to do what they wanted. They were still mailing people DVDs.” The owners had been using the chess.com domain since 1995 to sell Chess Mentor, an educational tool they were trying to get into all California schools as part of the curriculum. They were working with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a chess fan and California’s governor at the time. However, the company had raised $5 million and wasn’t seeing enough sales or growth, so the owners were looking for ways to pay off debt. Bringing in two young tech guys with a track record of building chess sites to do something better with the domain seemed like a good plan. Severson told me, “Erik turns to me and goes, ‘Jay, why don’t you tell these guys why you’re so excited to work on Chess.com?’ And I totally BS for the next 15 minutes about what we would do with the platform and how it would be super-awesome. In my mind, I was thinking: ‘I don’t even wanna do this; this is not what I want to be doing with my time right now. I have a real job.’ ” Even so, Severson convinced the Chess Mentor people to join forces with them. They agreed to lease the domain but keep the property, while Allebest and Severson could put real estate on it and try to generate traffic. And so the brainstorming started: what should that property look like? On July 28, 2005, all Chess Mentor content was removed from the chess.com domain and replaced by the following placeholder text, which revealed some of the early plans: “Chess.com is currently under development to become the #1 online chess portal! The new Chess.com will help you find the best chess stores, places to play chess, where to learn chess, and more. There will be chess community forums to discuss chess openings, a directory of all chess websites, and other features.” In an email from October 21, 2005, Allebest outlined to Severson for the first time what Chess.com should have at launch, listing a place to register, an About page, a directory, a blog, forums, other resources, a search bar, a Learn page, a Play page, and a Shop page. And then, just a few months later, when Allebest and Severson had barely started working on actual code, the Chess Mentor company suddenly filed for bankruptcy. The owners intended to liquidate all assets to the highest bidder at a bankruptcy auction and thus get rid of their debts. Allebest was especially interested in the chess.com domain name, and he decided to try his luck together with his friend Zach Stout. The auction occurred on December 21, 2005, and all bidders joined by phone. Stout joined the auction and, with a winning bid of $55,000, he obtained that lovely domain name alongside all other company assets, including the Chess Mentor lesson material. On January 1, 2006, Allebest bought everything from Stout (who, in return, got a small percentage of the company). For an entrepreneur married with two young kids, it was a big investment. It was also the best investment ever made in the history of chess. How to Build a Chess Website Owning the top domain for a keyword like “chess” had immense value, especially thanks to the introduction of the auto-complete feature first included in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 5, as well as other browsers like Firefox. This feature meant that if you typed “chess” in the search bar and hit enter, the browser would add “.com” itself and go there. Even if you just intended to search for chess, you would end up on chess.com immediately. The site received thousands of free visitors daily, and it was time to do something about it. Two years of hard work followed. While Severson was still employed at Myers, he worked as a contractor for several other companies doing side work as a developer. At night, he worked on Chess.com. Allebest visited him almost daily as they worked from Severson’s room on the third floor in San José, coding until the early hours of the morning before Allebest drove back to Mountain View, only to return the next evening, rinse and repeat. In a podcast in November 2021, Severson said about this period, “The first few years of Chess.com, I felt like I was working 20-hour days. There were some days I couldn’t sleep at all. My wife remembers those days. Sometimes I would just go out in the garage and literally scream, just to let out how angry I was. It was exhausting.” Allebest conceptualized the whole site with 150 pages of wireframes in Microsoft Word. They started in September 2006, with Severson doing the back end (for the tech-minded: he used the Qcodo framework) and Allebest the front end. While making more and more progress on the code, at some point, they needed someone to “take that code and run it”—in other words, a server guy. Severson’s good friend and colleague at Myers, Igor Grinchenko, had the perfect skill set. Born in Kyrgyzstan, Grinchenko had come to the United States as a student in the late 1990s and was now the main IT guy at Myers. “The first time I saw him, he looked like the scariest, meanest Russian dude you have ever seen in your life,” Severson remembered. “He had this long mullet in the back and a small scar on his face, and just looked super-intimidating. But he said, ‘Dude, you’re the only programmer that knows what you’re doing.’ And I was like, ‘Dude, you’re the only IT guy that knows what you’re doing.’ And so we became really good friends. The most badass part about Igor was that every time he would drive in and out of the parking lot, I would laugh at his license plate that said: ‘UNIXRLZ.’ [Unix rules.] I mean, you can’t get any more hardcore than that.” Grinchenko decided to help them, and the team purchased their first server, a $3,000 Dell PowerEdge 1950. “We bought a two-unit machine from the Dell website, and it came to my apartment,” Grinchenko told me. “I called it ‘Igor 1.’ ” (Today, Chess.com has hundreds of servers spread across multiple locations throughout the US and in the cloud.) If you build a member site for chess fans, you need one thing that other social platforms don’t: a chessboard. Chess fans who read, populate forums, and write blogs need to be able to share their chess games and positions using a digital, 2D chessboard, similar to a chess diagram in a book or newspaper, but interactive. For that, too, Allebest and Severson found the right person: the Argentinean developer Matias José, who had created an account and soon after started bugging Erik with lots of feedback, basically, until he got hired. After a short beta testing period, Chess.com was launched publicly on May 18, 2007 (time of birth: 2:30 p.m. Pacific). The site had forums, blogs, articles, the option to play against the computer—and not much else. For the first few months it was all about content, as the articles posted by some of the early members started to generate traffic. The Chess.com home page in August 2007, three months after site launch. Meanwhile, Allebest finished his business degree at Stanford and could fully dedicate himself to his chess project, which, to him, still felt temporary. In a podcast in 2019 he described his attitude at the time: “I’m going to spend one year doing this at most, and then I’m going to go take one of those job offers from the big tech companies. And that just never happened. It just kept growing and growing.” Part of that growth came from being featured in July 2007 on the influential Mashable and TechCrunch websites, leading blogs for news about technology and start-ups. An important next step came when José rebuilt his chessboard into an application that allowed members to play chess against each other. Called “Daily Chess,” it was slow chess without a clock, but it was a start. Allebest himself played the first-ever game on the site on July 8, 2007. He beat member nyarlathotep in 19 moves. By the end of that month, and less than 60 days after its launch, Chess.com reached 10,000 members. Five weeks later, that was 20,000—at the end of October, 50,000. The site grew 10 percent per week for most of its metrics: unique visitors, unique member logins, and page views. Even so, Chess.com was more or less what Allebest and Severson had in mind and were satisfied with if it would stay like this: a content and members platform that produced ad revenue thanks to its excellent domain name. They didn’t believe it would generate much more money. Years later, Allebest and Severson would admit they were a bit under the “Silicon Valley pressure” of raising money, going big, and making a bunch of money at once. And chess, with its tiny market, wouldn’t do that for them. “We used to call it a lifestyle business,” Severson said. “We thought, maybe one day, it will be worth $5 million, if we’re lucky.” It took another half year or so for the early developers to launch what would become the single most important part of the website: the live server. It was the place where members could play real-time chess, with a clock, against each other. The leading developer behind this project was the Polish programmer Piotr Dachtera, who had built a small but slick chess server a few years before that ran on the URL 64pola.pl, Polish for “64 squares.” It had an elegant chessboard based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dachtera joined the company in February 2006, and “Live Chess” went live in early 2008. In May of that year, a Facebook app was launched, allowing members to play with friends who weren’t on Chess.com yet. It would be Chess.com’s biggest external driver of new members in the coming years. Paid memberships were introduced in 2008 as well: for a small monthly fee, premium members could access a web version of the old Chess Mentor software. And it worked. “When we launched it on one of the evenings, and Erik got home, he texted me that he wasn’t going to go to bed before the first member made a payment,” said Severson. “It took five minutes.” The company became profitable soon after and remains so to this day. On January 14, 2009, the word beta was removed from the logo, signifying that the site was fully grown and ready to storm the world even more. That logo has always been quite different from logos of other chess companies, which often use a king, knight, or rook. Allebest and Severson deliberately chose a pawn instead to emphasize that the site was not just for strong players or amateurs but for everyone. Enter Danny and David Chess.com kept growing but remained the small kid on the block. ICC and Playchess, the German platform mentioned in the previous chapter, dominated the chess landscape as the two places where the grandmasters played and, consequently, where all the serious amateurs could be found. If Chess.com was grabbing any market share, it was from Yahoo!Chess, which served the larger group of casual players. In mid-December 2008, Chess.com had 390,000 members, tons of content and features, and a live server with about 2,000 players online all the time. However, one thing was missing: strong players. “We knew that we were not high-enough-rated chess professionals, [for those] in the know in the community, to be able to go after that market,” Severson said. “I was probably rated around 1850 at the time, Erik was about 1500. We didn’t know the right people and were not taken seriously. People would say: “Oh, you’re those guys from Chess.com trying to do that stupid chess idea. Who do you think you are? Kasparov couldn’t even build a chess site, and you guys think you can do it?’ ” And so, in late 2008, Allebest and Severson, both 31 years old at the time, decided to visit the Berkeley Masters, a big chess tournament in Berkeley, California, with one idea in mind: to meet some strong players who might be willing to help them. One of the participants they would meet during the seventh round on December 20 was a 23-year-old player named Danny Rensch, who would score his second international master norm in this tournament. “I was playing this game against the Mongolian grandmaster Dashzeveg Sharavdorj and in walk these two guys,” Rensch remembered. “I was quickly wrapping up my game as I was super-excited to meet them.” On one of the final days of the tournament, Allebest and Severson joined Rensch and other strong players for a dinner arranged by the tournament organizer, the 27-year-old international master David Pruess. “I was all over them,” said Rensch. “I was telling them that I wanted to launch a chess teaching business of my own, that I brought all this value, and that I knew everything about the chess community.” Allebest and Severson, however, were mostly looking for strong players who could write instructional articles and other types of content, which initially clashed with Rensch’s bigger plans. As a result, it was Pruess who got hired as the director of professional relations in February 2009. He was in charge of contacting top players, recruiting titled players to become columnists or lecturers on the site, and coordinating Chess.com’s sponsorship of events. “He had the respect of the titled community because he was a titled player,” said Severson. “People would return his emails, whereas they wouldn’t return our emails.” Titled players got free premium accounts, and Chess.com started to organize tournaments for them with modest prize money. Meanwhile, Rensch was still pursuing his own business but also started providing content for Chess.com. A few months later, in May 2009, the site celebrated its second anniversary. There were now 600,000 users on the site and another 400,000 on the Facebook app, so the one-million barrier had been broken. The company employed ten full-timers and several part-timers, including Rensch, who would only become an official employee in April 2010. The videos that he made were big hits. With his energy and humor, it all clicked for the members. One of them sent an email saying, “Danny Rensch is worth the price of the diamond membership alone.” Echos of ICC and FICS: Chess.com versus Lichess “Should we do another game?” Allebest asked Severson. By the summer of 2009, Chess.com had become a self-sustainable and profitable website. That nice little chess project, that lifestyle business, was doing all right. Perhaps still feeling some of the Silicon Valley pressure, Allebest suggested taking their concept to another level. Dominoes? Backgammon? Take what they’ve learned with search engine optimization (SEO) and what it means to have a great domain name and do it in a much bigger industry. An opportunity came up in August to buy the domain exercise.com for half a million dollars, and the two chess entrepreneurs stopped working full-time on Chess.com. Joined by their friend Dan Rosenthal, they were off to a fresh start and even rented an office on Castro Street in Mountain View, California. For the new site, they used a different PHP technology stack called Symfony. They reached out to one of the top Symfony developers in the world, who was an important contributor to the open-source framework. His name was Thibault Duplessis. Born in France in 1984, Duplessis was already programming with QBasic on Casio calculators in high school. He studied computer science and worked for a few years as a software engineer while contributing to open-source projects. In early 2010 he was working as a developer at a French agency, making websites and experimenting with different technologies, when Allebest and Severson approached him. Duplessis accepted the offer to work for Exercise.com and came to California in the fall, where he initially stayed with Severson’s family. He started coding, and everyone was impressed. He was incredibly productive, capable of doing something in an hour which would take others half a day. Severson: “I remember that every time I would ask, ‘Hey, Thibault, do you wanna go see a movie tonight? You wanna go hang out with friends? You wanna go out drinking and go to a bar?’ he was like, ‘No, I think I just want to stay in the room tonight and write code.’ It was very clear to me that he loved programming on a different level than anybody else I’d ever met in my life. He would easily code 14 hours a day and just love every minute of it.” Meanwhile, like Piotr Dachtera, Duplessis had created a chessboard in the programming language AJAX as a hobby project. He decided to push his creation online and make it open source. “I moved on to the next project, but someday I noticed that someone was actually playing chess on this very simple, very silly website,” Duplessis said, during a presentation in June 2017 in Munich, Germany. “I was like, what the hell, there were requests in the Apache [server] logs. So, I added a chat to the page in order to communicate with this user, and there was a user indeed. The guy started to yell at me because it was full of bugs. I wasn’t even validating if the moves were illegal! So I fixed the bugs. He asked for features, and I added features and bugs. A few more players arrived, some offered to help, and it became Lichess.” The first game on Lichess was played on June 20, 2010, about two months before Duplessis traveled to California. Until November of that year, people logged in anonymously before the option came to create an account. To his surprise, the community on the site kept growing organically. When Allebest and Severson finally found out about his chess site, they were not amused. Duplessis told them it wasn’t a serious project but that he built it to learn and practice with new programming languages. In the summer of 2011 everyone joined for lunch at their favorite Mongolian restaurant in Mountain View. The whole team was there: about eight or nine people, including the three founders, Allebest, Rosenthal, and Severson. Colleagues shared stories about their weekend, but Duplessis’s story was different. “I’ve been reading these books and found this new language,” Severson quoted him. “It’s unbelievable. It’s like the most beautiful programming language I’ve ever seen. I don’t like PHP any more; I don’t like Symfony. I just want to write Scala all day.” Severson: “We were looking at him and thinking, ‘You don’t fall in love with a language over the weekend, right? And you have to write PHP because that’s what you’re doing for us.’ We all had this confused look on our faces.” Rosenthal asked, “Are you quitting Exercise.com?” Duplessis replied, “Yes, I think I am.” He left Exercise.com in September 2011 and started rewriting Lichess completely using Scala. Duplessis is a big believer in open source, the concept that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance your source code. Important parts of the internet run on open-source code, including operating systems (for example, Unix), web servers (Apache), content management systems (WordPress), databases (MySQL), and languages (JavaScript). The Lichess code has been used to create the most popular playing server for draughts, which you can find at lidraughts.org, and there’s one for shogi at lishogi.org. Looking back at it years later, the Lichess founder said he was the right person at the right time to come up with the idea of a free chess platform. “One that would treat players as people and not cattle,” as he put it. He meant that the users would not be bothered with ads or requests for paid memberships. It is a concept diametrically opposed to Chess.com’s, a company that, at the end of the day, needs to bring money to the table. And so, three decades later, the chess world has a new “FICS versus ICC” situation, although it’s not as simple as a clash between socialist and capitalist mindsets. “Money isn’t everything, but it is the resource and the tool that gives you the ability to actually build really cool things and grow the game,” said Severson. “I admit that I am money-driven. But it’s okay, as long as you keep in mind that you’re not just making money so you can buy a yacht. You’re making money as a company to further the cause of the game. I think we’ve stayed true to that mission.” A term that wouldn’t come to mind to describe Duplessis is money-driven. Keeping Lichess completely free has become an important mission. In an interview in July 2023 he explained: “The chess community is made of very smart people, who will not be satisfied with corporations using their hobby for profit, with mediocre proprietary software. Instead, the chess players of the world want to take matters into their own hands: build their own tools, and publish the code and the data to strengthen the chess ecosystem.” This philosophy also explains the site’s name: Lichess (pronounced lee-chess) combines live, light, libre, and chess. “Live, because games are played and watched in real-time 24/7; light and libre for the fact that Lichess is open-source and unencumbered by proprietary junk that plagues other websites,” the site itself explains. Duplessis funded the site’s running costs for about five years until it became clear that this wasn’t sustainable, with server costs getting as high as thousands of dollars per month. In June 2016 Lichess officially gained a nonprofit legal status as an association governed by the French Law of Associations of July 1, 1901. The registry noted that the site’s goal is “to promote and encourage the teaching and practice of the game of chess and its variants.” The association status gave Lichess, which is fully funded by donations from patrons, access to banking services and the ability to employ staff and rent property. Lichess stopped being a one-man show a long time ago. Duplessis credits a large community of volunteers with a shared belief in open source and a free internet. In 2023 the total number of people contributing to translations, to the code or otherwise, was in the high thousands. The “core team,” active daily, was numbered in the hundreds, while about 20 people were paid or eligible to be paid—equivalent to about seven full-time positions. They were working on the second most popular chess platform in the world. According to SimilarWeb—a digital market intelligence company that provides data and insights related to website traffic, user engagement, and online market share—Lichess had about 85 million total visits in June 2023. In comparison, Chess.com had just over 200 million. The numbers can differ quite strongly in different countries though: the traffic share in the US was 83 percent and 17 percent respectively, and similar in India with 82 percent and 18 percent. But in Germany, say, it was 59 percent for Chess.com versus 41 percent for Lichess. From a business perspective, you could even call it “unfair competition” because Chess.com is not dealing with another company but a nonprofit offering a similar product without charging for it. The core product, however—playing a game of chess—is 100 percent free on both Chess.com and Lichess. Many features on the two platforms are virtually identical (such as puzzles, analysis tools, and AI-generated game reviews), but each site also has its own unique features and community. Meanwhile, Allebest and Severson haven’t been in touch with Duplessis for years. “I would say we’re on non-speaking terms,” said Severson. Bringing Video into the Chess World I am a weak chess player and a strong chess player. I belong to the group of players who can effortlessly checkmate most random people in the street but hardly stand a chance against a grandmaster. I say “hardly” because I beat one once in my life. It was in a tournament in July 1996. I was 20 and had played serious chess for about seven years. Somehow, I defeated the Polish American grandmaster Alexander Wojtkiewicz, the world’s 276th player at the time. Since then, I have scored two international master norms (meaning I played nine-round tournaments at the IM level twice). Although few club players can say that, I still consider myself more a writer than a player. I might have influenced the chess world somewhat with my video journalism, which I should be talking about as well. Let’s wind back the clock a bit. On February 6, 2006, I created an account on blogspot.com and published my first blog post. Blogging was a popular internet activity in the early 2000s. It was about sharing thoughts, experiences or hobbies on a blog, short for weblog. Platforms like Blogger, LiveJournal, Moveable Type, and, later, WordPress made it easy for people to create their own sites and post articles, which readers could comment on. Before social media took over, many people blogged about politics, perhaps even more about food, and some about chess. My initial idea for the blog was to publish and discuss chess games, including those I played myself. I soon started writing about all kinds of chess-related topics: the 80th birthday of a famous Russian grandmaster; talented young players at a tournament in Mexico; a book review; a report on the local Amsterdam city championship, where I participated and wrote a complete tournament report. A pivotal moment came in October 2006 when I was playing a tournament in Hoogeveen, a small city in the north of my country. The organizers allowed me to enter the press room each day after I finished my game, where I would meet players and other reporters, including Macauley Peterson, an American chess fan who was spending a year studying film theory in Amsterdam. Soon, we would be colleagues and friends, and Peterson would play a big role in my early years in chess video journalism. One day, I went to the press room where I saw two participants of the main event, Judit Polgár and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, behind a chessboard. They were analyzing their game—something you hardly see today but was quite common then, as the opponent’s opinions were still valued higher than the computer’s. I switched roles from player to reporter and started filming them with my Nikon Coolpix camera. I had experimented with video before and knew my readers enjoyed watching top players analyzing. In a way, they were getting a sort of a free masterclass, and I enjoyed providing a service for the chess world. Two weeks later, the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree mentioned my name in his chess column in the national newspaper NRC. His article “Spied Everywhere” suggested that watching YouTube should perhaps become part of grandmaster preparation. Why? Two weeks after Hoogeveen, in a tournament in Moscow, Mamedyarov had played a quick draw against the Latvian grandmaster Alexei Shirov without using any time on the clock; the Azerbaijani player only needed to remember his prepared homework, including an important new move in a key position. As it turned out, Shirov could have known about that important new move because Mamedyarov had shown it to Polgár in my video! “The Dutch chess player Peter Doggers filmed that analysis and posted the video on his chess website and later also on YouTube,” Ree wrote. “He did not know that he was revealing an important opening novelty; otherwise, he might have had conscientious objections.” When I met Shirov two months later in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, we shook hands, but he also exclaimed, “I am not talking to you!” I still don’t know if he was joking or not. In January 2007, at the annual chess festival in Wijk aan Zee, I was allowed for the first time to enter the stage where the top grandmasters played—a closed-off and sacred segment of the tournament hall. I made new videos, which could be as basic as players arriving at their board, shaking hands and making their first moves, but even that was special then. In a way, I started a new era for chess: the video age. Never before did chess fans have free access to behind-the-scenes activity at top chess events, and never before were interviews with players recorded on video and made available just hours later to enjoy. I did something else that my website visitors appreciated immensely. Each day in Wijk aan Zee, it was common to have a grandmaster—usually someone who’d scored a nice victory—come to the press room and explain their game to the press using a large wooden demonstration board. Tournament director Jeroen van den Berg gave the green light for an idea I had: why didn’t I put up a camera on a tripod, film these analysis sessions by grandmasters, and post them online so that not only the media but all the chess fans in the world could enjoy them? I borrowed a JVC MiniDV digital video camera that recorded on tape and took it to Wijk aan Zee for two weeks. You can still find those videos on the YouTube account Chesscomcommunity. They are basically free lectures by famous players such as Viswanathan Anand, Vladimir Kramnik, and a very young Magnus Carlsen. People loved it. Where before it had about a thousand visitors daily prior to the tournament, my website was getting 15,000 visitors a day a week into the tournament. My site was now located at chessvibes.com. I launched the new URL on January 1, 2007, inspired by the French content aggregator Netvibes I was using. Looking back, I still like the name ChessVibes, which has a positive ring to it, like a chess version of “Good Vibrations” by the Beach Boys. Although when I met the 12th World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov a few years later in Wijk aan Zee, he told me he was reading my articles (yes!) but didn’t know what the word “vibes” meant (oops). Still, the new name was much better than what I had used between February and December 2006: doggers-schaak.nl. My surname likely refers to ancestors who used a “dogger,” a two-masted trawling ship used for fishing in the North Sea. However, as I discovered sometime in late 2006, with a mixture of horror and amusement, “dogging” is also British slang for “engaging in public sex while others watch.” Maybe I didn’t need my surname in that URL anymore … That 2007 edition of Wijk aan Zee was a true breakthrough moment for me: the start of a fascinating journey in the chess world that is not over yet. In September 2007 Peterson and I joined for our first big event: the FIDE World Chess Championship tournament in Mexico City. We provided daily coverage in text and video, mixing player quotes from the press conferences with shots from the playing hall. Soon, tournament organizers wanted us to make video content for them. One of the first was Joop van Oosterom, a Dutch billionaire and chess fanatic who had been organizing an annual chess tournament since 1993 named after his daughter Melody Amber. Peterson and I worked at the last four editions between 2008 and 2011, unforgettable tournaments held in five-star hotels on the French Riviera, where the weather was lovely, the food exquisite, and the service impeccable. As we continued to produce videos, others followed suit. For instance, a team representing the French magazine Europe Échecs was suddenly going to all the tournaments, making videos similar to ours. The chess world had embraced the video format. Meanwhile, I started to focus on writing more and more, and my stories became just as important for my website as the videos. I added more contributors to my site, launched digital magazines, and hired a programmer to rebuild the backend to prepare it for bigger growth. Despite all this, I was having doubts about the future of ChessVibes. Five years after quitting my job, I was making only about half of what I’d been earning previously. I was 37 years old and wondering how long I wanted to go on with this lovely business that looked brilliant from the outside but was tough to grow without attracting investors. Talks with ICC and New in Chess to form a joint company led nowhere, and then, on December 21, 2012, I received an email that would change everything: Hi! This is Erik from Chess.com. I’d love to discuss ways we might be able to work together! Who is the right person to speak with? Thanks! Erik CEO, Chess.com I joined Chess.com in September 2013 and continued doing my reporting, often with Chess.com’s Mike Klein, and producing videos for my new employers, who gave me the journalistic freedom to continue in the same fashion as before. Meanwhile, Exercise.com lasted only two years for Allebest and Severson, as it never turned into the endeavor they had in mind. “We didn’t feel the passion for it,” said Allebest. “And part of the problem was that the whole time we were trying to work on Exercise, we saw this little annoying thing over here. It was just growing and growing and growing.” A big moment for Chess.com came when the company closed a deal with Hikaru Nakamura to play on the site. Until then, Nakamura had been loyal to the Internet Chess Club, even owning shares. It helped, however, that he had known Rensch since he was small. “I stayed with his family two summers in a row, playing baseball and basketball,” said Rensch. It was Allebest who called Nakamura, offering $16,000 a year for just three things: Nakamura had to wear a Chess.com wristband at over-the-board tournaments, play a minimum of 150 games per month on Chess.com, and regularly participate in Titled Tuesdays. Note that he was never asked to play on Chess.com exclusively. “It seemed fresh, something new,” Nakamura told me. “I think I just had the feeling that Danny and Erik were on the right path, even back then.” He accepted the deal and started making some extra money on top of the agreement as he won prizes in Titled Tuesdays more often than not. He also played much more than 150 games a month. “He borderline became exclusive because he appreciated the love we were giving him by making him kind of our guy,” said Rensch. “At the end of the day, Hikaru is a very loyal person, and when he felt like we genuinely loved him and wanted him, I think that was a game changer for him.” As the years went by, Chess.com broke record after record. On December 5, 2014, the one billionth game was played on the server. It took only a further two and a half years to break two billion, and soon, that became a problem: the “32-bit bug” led Chess.com to feature on Hacker News and other tech sites. Late one Saturday evening, on June 10, 2017, Chess.com started to receive messages from members claiming the site was broken. It was the start of the weekend for many developers, so the worst time for a major bug to surface. More and more people were complaining over the weekend, and only on Monday morning did the iOS development team suddenly realize they were dealing with an overflow problem. In other words, the devices used by the members couldn’t handle the number of games. The problem was limited to pre-2013 iOS devices, since the live server worked everywhere except on 32-bit iPhones and iPads. The reason was that 2,147,483,648 games had been played on Chess.com, and new games, with a higher game ID, were breaking the 32-bit integer limit of those older iOS devices, which simply didn’t support interpretation for numbers higher than 231. It was a comical result of yet another amazing milestone reached by the site. The same thing had happened a few years before on YouTube when PSY’s smash-hit song “Gangnam Style” exceeded 2,147,483,647 views. Like Google, Chess.com quickly fixed the bug. An update to the iOS app was submitted to the App Store, which Apple accepted within two hours. As the CEO, Allebest explained the slightly embarrassing but funny bug in a blog post: “Likely, the developer didn’t expect two billion games at the time that code was written long ago. But, on the other hand, two billion games!!! The moral of the story, I guess, is: when you have an idea, always plan BIG. That’s why when I retire and open my donut shop, I’m going to have seating for THREE billion customers.” Beating the ICC The 32-bit bug was a funny episode that could only have happened to Chess.com, now the biggest chess company. It became clear that Chess.com, which started as an underdog, had become a giant that was outgrowing the other chess platforms out there—most notably, the long-term market leader for serious players, the Internet Chess Club. How did this happen? For starters, none of the ICC’s cofounders were of the true entrepreneurial type. The original initiator, Daniel Sleator, is a computer scientist from St. Louis; Marty Grund, a stained glass craftsman from Des Moines; and Eric Peterson, a research geophysicist from Dallas. When a buyout by another company failed in the fall of 2001 due to the 9/11 terrorist attack, it was Sleator’s wife who took over the daily running of the company. “We were a ship without a clear captain. It was like a soap opera, like Dallas or Dynasty,” said Ruy Mora, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer. “I think we had at least four or five people who were CEO for a year.” For two decades, the ICC had made a profit, shareholders received their dividends, and little to no new investment was made. Things remained the same for the users, who only got to play from the browser at a very late stage. “As long as our members were playing with a downloadable client like BlitzIn, we felt in control in our fight against cheating,” Mora explained. “The program would register their mouse-handling, whether they would switch to another program, and if they were running an engine. We thought we would lose that control if we [went] web-based.” By the time the ICC realized that playing from the browser was the future, Chess.com already had a head start, a gap that soon became impossible to bridge. The same happened to ChessBase’s Playchess, said Mora: “They started strongly, but it wasn’t clear what they wanted to do with the platform. It was tightly knit into their ChessBase product. They wanted to make it a seamless experience, but ChessBase was also complicated to use. It didn’t help to popularize the platform.” Rensch gave me three reasons why Chess.com ended up beating the ICC. First, Hikaru Nakamura. Second, Chess.com’s superior analysis board—“the analysis tool was critical for coaching online. And when coaches teach their students on your site, they bring them over.” Third, product. “There’s no debate that for the first five or six years, ICC was just a better play experience,” admitted Rensch. “It was faster, it was cleaner, it was less laggy. Browser technology was not up to snuff with app technology.” Players were happy to go through the hassle of downloading the needed software for playing games as long as it was clearly faster. When Mozilla and Google Chrome’s browser technology and Chess.com’s technology improved, everything turned around. “It’s one of those funny things, because to everyone outside the chess world now, it looks like Chess.com winning was a foregone conclusion—but, for us, we were the underdogs, and this was a huge moment,” said Rensch. “ICC, at one point, had laughed us out of the building.” Chess24 and Live Broadcasts That same summer of 2017, Chess.com broke two round numbers: over 20 million members and over 100 full-time employees. Both figures surpassed any other chess company out there—although one had been growing steadily and was starting to look like Chess.com’s new big rival in the market. This was Chess24, owned in majority by the Bolivian businessman Enrique Guzman and co-run by the German grandmaster Jan Gustafsson. Guzman had made millions from cofounding and selling PokerStrategy.com, a successful portal for poker fans to improve their game with lots of articles and video lessons. He was now trying to do the same for chess by providing an educational and international platform that focused on instructional videos for chess fans who wanted to improve their game. Chess24 launched on February 24, 2014, with content and a play server. The new platform instantly became the most popular place for chess fans to watch their favorite players in action because of its shiny new HTML page for live games with a user interface that blew away any other site on the market. The only one that came close was ChessBomb, a Bulgarian website that had existed for about six years, but its interface offered fewer features and was also aesthetically lagging behind. (In November 2018, ChessBomb would be acquired by Chess.com and turned into its events page chess.com/events.) It’s fair to say that ChessBomb and Chess24 have radically changed how chess fans watch chess. For starters, they provided a home on the web to find all major chess events in one place. Chess events are being played around the globe pretty much 24/7, 365 days a year—from major events to local weekenders. Most clubs and tournaments broadcast the games on their websites, but it’s much more convenient for the chess fan to have one site to fall back on. The other important aspect that made watching chess on Chess24 and ChessBomb so popular was that the two sites integrated a running chess engine alongside the chess moves and the board, which suddenly made it much easier for viewers to understand what was going on. During the game, you could now see what would be the best move to play, according to the engine, and what evaluation belonged to it (e.g., “White is clearly better” or “the game is equal”). To show where the players made a mistake (according to the computer), ChessBomb used a system based on colors: an orange move would be dubious, and a red move a blunder. This became part of chess culture. Often, a grandmaster would ask after finishing a game, “Did I play any red moves?” Chess24 displayed a different system to evaluate positions—one which has subsequently become extremely common in chess: the eval bar. This vertical, thermometer-like bar is placed next to the chessboard with its bottom half white and the top half black at the start of a game. If White gains the advantage, the white segment in the bar goes up; conversely, if Black is doing well, more of the bar will be colored black. The eval bar is quite responsive, so when mistakes are made in quick succession, the bar can go up or down suddenly, adding a fantastic visual element to the experience of watching chess. Suddenly, many more fans could better understand what was going on, which is important for a game like chess. You can put anyone in front of a television that shows a soccer game, and in no time, they will understand that the idea is to get the ball into the goal. To enjoy watching chess, you need to know the rules at least and preferably have some experience playing the game yourself. Thanks to the eval bar, chess has become much more accessible to a wider audience. Although the eval bar has improved the viewing experience for many fans, thereby contributing to popularizing chess in general, it should be noted that there is also a downside to this new development: top players tend to be respected much less than in the old days, and wrongly so. Nowadays, complete patzers, “armchair analysts” who have access to computer analysis while watching the game live, know better about the mistakes made than the grandmasters themselves. Too many times, those fans leave derogatory comments in the chat or the comments section of news articles, saying that players are “bad” or “weak” or “terrible” because they made a move that the computer didn’t like. They completely forget what it’s like to be in the playing hall, with all the pressure and the clock ticking, as well as all the other moves in the game that were played on a level they could only dream about. Occasionally I play in a tournament myself, and I am always reminded of how tough chess really is. Another important aspect of the Chess24 platform was the embedded video player showing a tournament’s live video feed. Suddenly, it became extremely convenient to watch chess events. Because that was the thing now: chess tournaments had started to provide video shows with commentary. A pioneer in that area was my old friend Macauley Peterson. Working as a freelance video producer, Peterson’s broadcast production of the 2010 US championship in St. Louis was the first video broadcast of a top-level chess tournament on the internet. Small cameras showed footage from the playing hall; another cam was recording the commentators; and a 2D chessboard for analysis completed the frame—the basic elements of a chess broadcast that are still used today. The director of the London Chess Classic, Malcolm Pein, invited Peterson to do the same for his tournament in December of that year. After that, more and more tournaments wanted in, such as the annual festival in Gibraltar. In the years to come, I got involved in broadcasting myself on behalf of Chess.com, together with my Dutch friend Lennart Ootes. We made shows in Gibraltar, Reykjavík, Wijk aan Zee, Doha, Jerusalem, Skopje, Oslo, and Douglas (Isle of Man). In early 2024, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament demonstrated that online chess broadcasting had come a long way, as more than 50 cameras were placed in the playing hall, some of them as tiny as the one in your smartphone. By the end of 2021, Chess.com had grown about five times as big as in 2016 (partly thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic; see next chapter). The success didn’t go unnoticed, and the company was looking at multiple takeover bids. Some were not very serious, and others failed to materialize, but things were different when the American growth equity firm General Atlantic (GA) approached the company. GA had a good track record of helping companies like Airbnb, Duolingo, Slack, and Uber toward their IPOs, and Allebest liked their community-driven approach. A deal was signed just before the new year, and GA invested heavily in the company. The deal was unprecedented in size and volume for the chess world. It came, however, after a period of multiple other takeovers by Chess.com’s main rival. It’s about time to start talking about Play Magnus. For that, we have to go back to January 2014. Play Magnus and the Takeover A month before Chess24 went live, the Norwegian company Play Magnus launched its eponymous app with a beautifully simple idea: you could play against an AI version of Magnus Carlsen at different ages. A beginner could beat the five-year-old Magnus, but even the real Magnus struggled against the higher ages. The company, partly owned by the Carlsen family, later added a Magnus Trainer app for chess improvement, and an app for kids called Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess. In that same month of January 2014, Carlsen traveled to the US with his manager Espen Agdestein for several sponsor and promotional events. One of these was a dinner party thrown by billionaire investor Yuri Milner, a famous Israeli entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Carlsen played chess against several tech CEOs, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, a few days before he also met Bill Gates. Gaining these Silicon Valley contacts would prove to be of great value down the road. Approximately five years on, Play Magnus changed its game plan when the business chose a growth strategy based on multiple rounds of venture capital investments. In February 2019 Play Magnus acquired Chess24 at a value of $12.6 million. Chess24 had nearly 850,000 registered users at the time, with 600,000 monthly active users coming to the site. Half a year later, Chessable was also acquired, valued at $6.7 million. Between December 2020 and August 2021 PlayMagnus took over several more small chess companies, with Chessable becoming a key asset. This platform alone has changed chess significantly, especially for amateur players like me. Cofounded in November 2015 by the American international master John Bartholomew and the English player David Kramaley, Chessable was launched on February 22, 2016. The unique selling point of Chessable is its innovative approach to chess learning and training through its use of spaced repetition technology. In practice, this comes down to going through lessons, with videos and text, and then repeating the learned moves regularly on the website or in the app. Especially after the takeover by Play Magnus, Chessable started to add to its library the best content available, sourced from famous instructional books and new material from top-notch authors. Because these included some of the best grandmasters in the world, the material was valuable for both amateurs and strong players. When the American chess prodigy Abhimanyu Mishra became the world’s youngest grandmaster at age 12 in July 2021, it was no secret that he was an avid Chessable user. Eight months after Chess.com’s deal with General Atlantic, on August 24, 2022, a press release shocked the chess world: “Chess.com Makes Offer to Play Magnus Group.” Wait, what? Among many smaller commercial entities, there were two absolute kings in the chess world: Chess.com and Play Magnus. One king was about to eat the other to become the absolute, sovereign ruler. It was the chess equivalent of Microsoft merging with Apple. On December 16, 2022, the deal was closed. The chess world reacted with mixed feelings: some feared that Chess.com’s apparent monopoly was not a good thing, while others noted the benefits of merging two separate communities of online chess players. An important benefit for the fans was that Magnus Carlsen had signed on as a Chess.com ambassador. This meant he would likely compete even more in online events as he could now return to playing on Chess.com, as he had done before his affiliation with former rival Chess24 in 2019. Two days later, on December 18, 2022, Carlsen contested the 2022 Speed Chess Championship Final, where he lost to Hikaru Nakamura in a thrilling, down-to-the-wire battle watched by more than 200,000 viewers. In spring 2024, Chess.com had a total of 714 employees and 167 million registered users (of which 40 million were monthly active users), making it the ninth largest “country” in the world by population, just below Bangladesh and just above Russia. Its value is currently estimated to be over a billion dollars. If, as we’ll see in the next chapter, Levy Rozman is the personification of the chess revolution, Chess.com is the driving force behind it, the organization perhaps most responsible for accelerating the old board game’s popularity to new heights in the modern era.",

We will have to somehow convince all these people who play for free to come over to our site and then pay us money. Like, at what point is that business model ever gonna work?” —Jay Severson, to Erik Allebest, in 2005 It is September 1995, the first week of freshman year for Erik Allebest, who has just turned 18. He wakes up and walks to the shared bathroom at the Brigham Young University (BYU) campus in Provo, Utah. He sees a young man of the same age, wearing glasses and brushing his teeth. Allebest uses the bathroom for a couple of minutes, comes back, and the fellow is still brushing. “It just seemed like a really long time,” Allebest told me. “So I said, ‘What, is your dad a dentist, or something?’ ” It is the first thing Allebest ever says to Jarom (Jay) Severson, his future friend and cofounder of Chess.com. Later that day, Severson walks along the third floor of Merrill Hall and notices two students inside one of the dormitories. One is Allebest, the other is Ryan Miller, and they are playing chess. “Can I get the winner?” Severson asks. He beats them both. No, he destroys them. Allebest recalled, “When he came in and saw me playing chess, I felt like he wanted to kick my ass because I’d made this snarky comment in the morning.” Born in 1977 in Silverton, Oregon, Severson grew up in a small town a few miles south called Lebanon. He and his five siblings were raised as Mormons. (These days, the preferred term is “Latter-day Saints.”) Severson told me that when he was 11 years old, the family-owned pizzeria went bankrupt and his father lost his job as a police officer. The family eventually relocated to San José when Severson was in sixth grade. He learned about chess when his father, who enjoyed carpentry as a hobby, made a large, heavy chessboard all by himself, using thick, solid wood. At first, he watched his older brothers play, until they allowed him to join in. Severson told me he got hooked on the game in high school, which had a chess club and played team matches with other schools: “I got sucked in real big.” He started buying chess books and even entered individual tournaments. When he joined BYU, Severson was the obvious person to run the chess club. Allebest, also born in 1977, came from a family of Latter-day Saints too, but he grew up in upper-class Laguna Hills, Orange County, in Southern California. His mother taught him chess when he was eight years old. His father was a lawyer with an entrepreneurial mindset, which Allebest inherited. On Monday mornings he went where the kids drank beers on the weekends, collected the cans and recycled them for $20. After graduating from high school, Allebest went to BYU and deliberately chose something that was not too challenging. In an interview in 2021, he said, “I was an English major, but only so I could get through classes as quickly as possible. I didn’t feel like I was learning a lot in school. I would literally put my Shakespeare book on my desk. Inside of that, I would have a Computers for Dummies or HTML for Beginners. I was teaching myself about computers and technology.” In that BYU dorm in September 1995, Allebest was impressed by Severson’s chess skills and asked, “How did you do that? Hey, can you give me some chess lessons? I’ll pay you $7 an hour.” And that’s what they agreed on. The two met about once a week, and while Severson started teaching Allebest chess openings, their friendship blossomed. Erik Allebest, left, and Jay Severson, right, the founders of Chess.com, as students on a trip (year unknown). Things were different in sophomore year when Severson continued college, but most of his friends, including Allebest, started their two-year missionary service abroad, a typical interruption from college for young Latter-day Saints. The two of them lost touch for a few years. Meanwhile, Severson became a successful video game player who won the 1998 StarCraft World Championship, a 3,000-player competition hosted as part of the Professional Gamers League’s third season. Gaining the first prize of $8,500 and a new computer was nice, but much more lucrative was the sponsorship deal Severson signed with Logitech, worth about $50,000 after he was featured in magazines like Newsweek and Wired. Not bad for a 20-year-old student coming from a family that used to live on welfare. Severson: “I felt I could retire.” But he didn’t. In fact, his professional gaming career only lasted a year or two as Severson decided to enter San José State University (SJSU) instead, ultimately going for a computer science major. He learned about HTML and built his very first two websites: one about winning strategies for the board game Axis and Allies and one about chess openings. After graduating, he worked at different companies as a developer, including Case’s Ladder, which brought him to KasparovChess in New York, and, later, a company called Myers, where he built real-estate and mortgage-related websites. On the other hand, Allebest became an entrepreneur early on. After returning from his mission in Argentina, he created two chess-related companies during his years at BYU. One was Schoolhouse Chess, a chess tutoring program he implemented in dozens of elementary schools across Utah. Out of that company came his e-commerce business, wholesalechess.com, which Severson helped code. Allebest would import chess sets from China (before Alibaba made that easy), store them in his garage, sell them online, and ship them all over the country (before Amazon made running such a business hard). After a few years, Allebest sold the two companies and entered Stanford Business School to get his master’s degree. He interned at Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, Google, and Palantir but turned down full-time positions. In the spring of 2005 he called Severson and said, “Hey, I met the guys that own the chess.com domain. What do you think about doing another chess business together?” Severson wasn’t excited at all. At that point, he had a job at Myers that paid him a pretty good salary, and he had seen many businesses fail in the chess space, including Kasparov Chess Online. The Internet Chess Club was doing okay but wasn’t growing much any more. The only really big chess platform at the time was Yahoo!Chess, but people there were playing for free. Severson told Allebest, “I would love to work with you but, dude, there’s no money in chess.” But Allebest had a plan. He said, “Well, we’ll do it this way. We’ll create profiles for players and make other content, and we’ll have ads for revenue. It will be a MySpace for chess. Just come with me and meet these guys and see how it goes.” Severson agreed, and soon they met with the original chess.com domain owners in the Japanese restaurant Fuki Sushi in Palo Alto, a famous spot in Silicon Valley where many tech companies have started. “So we walk into this meeting, and they were all mid-sixties and older; they were an older group of guys that just generationally did not understand the internet,” Severson said. “They didn’t understand where the internet was going; they didn’t have the technological background to do what they wanted. They were still mailing people DVDs.” The owners had been using the chess.com domain since 1995 to sell Chess Mentor, an educational tool they were trying to get into all California schools as part of the curriculum. They were working with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a chess fan and California’s governor at the time. However, the company had raised $5 million and wasn’t seeing enough sales or growth, so the owners were looking for ways to pay off debt. Bringing in two young tech guys with a track record of building chess sites to do something better with the domain seemed like a good plan. Severson told me, “Erik turns to me and goes, ‘Jay, why don’t you tell these guys why you’re so excited to work on Chess.com?’ And I totally BS for the next 15 minutes about what we would do with the platform and how it would be super-awesome. In my mind, I was thinking: ‘I don’t even wanna do this; this is not what I want to be doing with my time right now. I have a real job.’ ” Even so, Severson convinced the Chess Mentor people to join forces with them. They agreed to lease the domain but keep the property, while Allebest and Severson could put real estate on it and try to generate traffic. And so the brainstorming started: what should that property look like? On July 28, 2005, all Chess Mentor content was removed from the chess.com domain and replaced by the following placeholder text, which revealed some of the early plans: “Chess.com is currently under development to become the #1 online chess portal! The new Chess.com will help you find the best chess stores, places to play chess, where to learn chess, and more. There will be chess community forums to discuss chess openings, a directory of all chess websites, and other features.” In an email from October 21, 2005, Allebest outlined to Severson for the first time what Chess.com should have at launch, listing a place to register, an About page, a directory, a blog, forums, other resources, a search bar, a Learn page, a Play page, and a Shop page. And then, just a few months later, when Allebest and Severson had barely started working on actual code, the Chess Mentor company suddenly filed for bankruptcy. The owners intended to liquidate all assets to the highest bidder at a bankruptcy auction and thus get rid of their debts. Allebest was especially interested in the chess.com domain name, and he decided to try his luck together with his friend Zach Stout. The auction occurred on December 21, 2005, and all bidders joined by phone. Stout joined the auction and, with a winning bid of $55,000, he obtained that lovely domain name alongside all other company assets, including the Chess Mentor lesson material. On January 1, 2006, Allebest bought everything from Stout (who, in return, got a small percentage of the company). For an entrepreneur married with two young kids, it was a big investment. It was also the best investment ever made in the history of chess. How to Build a Chess Website Owning the top domain for a keyword like “chess” had immense value, especially thanks to the introduction of the auto-complete feature first included in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 5, as well as other browsers like Firefox. This feature meant that if you typed “chess” in the search bar and hit enter, the browser would add “.com” itself and go there. Even if you just intended to search for chess, you would end up on chess.com immediately. The site received thousands of free visitors daily, and it was time to do something about it. Two years of hard work followed. While Severson was still employed at Myers, he worked as a contractor for several other companies doing side work as a developer. At night, he worked on Chess.com. Allebest visited him almost daily as they worked from Severson’s room on the third floor in San José, coding until the early hours of the morning before Allebest drove back to Mountain View, only to return the next evening, rinse and repeat. In a podcast in November 2021, Severson said about this period, “The first few years of Chess.com, I felt like I was working 20-hour days. There were some days I couldn’t sleep at all. My wife remembers those days. Sometimes I would just go out in the garage and literally scream, just to let out how angry I was. It was exhausting.” Allebest conceptualized the whole site with 150 pages of wireframes in Microsoft Word. They started in September 2006, with Severson doing the back end (for the tech-minded: he used the Qcodo framework) and Allebest the front end. While making more and more progress on the code, at some point, they needed someone to “take that code and run it”—in other words, a server guy. Severson’s good friend and colleague at Myers, Igor Grinchenko, had the perfect skill set. Born in Kyrgyzstan, Grinchenko had come to the United States as a student in the late 1990s and was now the main IT guy at Myers. “The first time I saw him, he looked like the scariest, meanest Russian dude you have ever seen in your life,” Severson remembered. “He had this long mullet in the back and a small scar on his face, and just looked super-intimidating. But he said, ‘Dude, you’re the only programmer that knows what you’re doing.’ And I was like, ‘Dude, you’re the only IT guy that knows what you’re doing.’ And so we became really good friends. The most badass part about Igor was that every time he would drive in and out of the parking lot, I would laugh at his license plate that said: ‘UNIXRLZ.’ [Unix rules.] I mean, you can’t get any more hardcore than that.” Grinchenko decided to help them, and the team purchased their first server, a $3,000 Dell PowerEdge 1950. “We bought a two-unit machine from the Dell website, and it came to my apartment,” Grinchenko told me. “I called it ‘Igor 1.’ ” (Today, Chess.com has hundreds of servers spread across multiple locations throughout the US and in the cloud.) If you build a member site for chess fans, you need one thing that other social platforms don’t: a chessboard. Chess fans who read, populate forums, and write blogs need to be able to share their chess games and positions using a digital, 2D chessboard, similar to a chess diagram in a book or newspaper, but interactive. For that, too, Allebest and Severson found the right person: the Argentinean developer Matias José, who had created an account and soon after started bugging Erik with lots of feedback, basically, until he got hired. After a short beta testing period, Chess.com was launched publicly on May 18, 2007 (time of birth: 2:30 p.m. Pacific). The site had forums, blogs, articles, the option to play against the computer—and not much else. For the first few months it was all about content, as the articles posted by some of the early members started to generate traffic. The Chess.com home page in August 2007, three months after site launch. Meanwhile, Allebest finished his business degree at Stanford and could fully dedicate himself to his chess project, which, to him, still felt temporary. In a podcast in 2019 he described his attitude at the time: “I’m going to spend one year doing this at most, and then I’m going to go take one of those job offers from the big tech companies. And that just never happened. It just kept growing and growing.” Part of that growth came from being featured in July 2007 on the influential Mashable and TechCrunch websites, leading blogs for news about technology and start-ups. An important next step came when José rebuilt his chessboard into an application that allowed members to play chess against each other. Called “Daily Chess,” it was slow chess without a clock, but it was a start. Allebest himself played the first-ever game on the site on July 8, 2007. He beat member nyarlathotep in 19 moves. By the end of that month, and less than 60 days after its launch, Chess.com reached 10,000 members. Five weeks later, that was 20,000—at the end of October, 50,000. The site grew 10 percent per week for most of its metrics: unique visitors, unique member logins, and page views. Even so, Chess.com was more or less what Allebest and Severson had in mind and were satisfied with if it would stay like this: a content and members platform that produced ad revenue thanks to its excellent domain name. They didn’t believe it would generate much more money. Years later, Allebest and Severson would admit they were a bit under the “Silicon Valley pressure” of raising money, going big, and making a bunch of money at once. And chess, with its tiny market, wouldn’t do that for them. “We used to call it a lifestyle business,” Severson said. “We thought, maybe one day, it will be worth $5 million, if we’re lucky.” It took another half year or so for the early developers to launch what would become the single most important part of the website: the live server. It was the place where members could play real-time chess, with a clock, against each other. The leading developer behind this project was the Polish programmer Piotr Dachtera, who had built a small but slick chess server a few years before that ran on the URL 64pola.pl, Polish for “64 squares.” It had an elegant chessboard based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dachtera joined the company in February 2006, and “Live Chess” went live in early 2008. In May of that year, a Facebook app was launched, allowing members to play with friends who weren’t on Chess.com yet. It would be Chess.com’s biggest external driver of new members in the coming years. Paid memberships were introduced in 2008 as well: for a small monthly fee, premium members could access a web version of the old Chess Mentor software. And it worked. “When we launched it on one of the evenings, and Erik got home, he texted me that he wasn’t going to go to bed before the first member made a payment,” said Severson. “It took five minutes.” The company became profitable soon after and remains so to this day. On January 14, 2009, the word beta was removed from the logo, signifying that the site was fully grown and ready to storm the world even more. That logo has always been quite different from logos of other chess companies, which often use a king, knight, or rook. Allebest and Severson deliberately chose a pawn instead to emphasize that the site was not just for strong players or amateurs but for everyone. Enter Danny and David Chess.com kept growing but remained the small kid on the block. ICC and Playchess, the German platform mentioned in the previous chapter, dominated the chess landscape as the two places where the grandmasters played and, consequently, where all the serious amateurs could be found. If Chess.com was grabbing any market share, it was from Yahoo!Chess, which served the larger group of casual players. In mid-December 2008, Chess.com had 390,000 members, tons of content and features, and a live server with about 2,000 players online all the time. However, one thing was missing: strong players. “We knew that we were not high-enough-rated chess professionals, [for those] in the know in the community, to be able to go after that market,” Severson said. “I was probably rated around 1850 at the time, Erik was about 1500. We didn’t know the right people and were not taken seriously. People would say: “Oh, you’re those guys from Chess.com trying to do that stupid chess idea. Who do you think you are? Kasparov couldn’t even build a chess site, and you guys think you can do it?’ ” And so, in late 2008, Allebest and Severson, both 31 years old at the time, decided to visit the Berkeley Masters, a big chess tournament in Berkeley, California, with one idea in mind: to meet some strong players who might be willing to help them. One of the participants they would meet during the seventh round on December 20 was a 23-year-old player named Danny Rensch, who would score his second international master norm in this tournament. “I was playing this game against the Mongolian grandmaster Dashzeveg Sharavdorj and in walk these two guys,” Rensch remembered. “I was quickly wrapping up my game as I was super-excited to meet them.” On one of the final days of the tournament, Allebest and Severson joined Rensch and other strong players for a dinner arranged by the tournament organizer, the 27-year-old international master David Pruess. “I was all over them,” said Rensch. “I was telling them that I wanted to launch a chess teaching business of my own, that I brought all this value, and that I knew everything about the chess community.” Allebest and Severson, however, were mostly looking for strong players who could write instructional articles and other types of content, which initially clashed with Rensch’s bigger plans. As a result, it was Pruess who got hired as the director of professional relations in February 2009. He was in charge of contacting top players, recruiting titled players to become columnists or lecturers on the site, and coordinating Chess.com’s sponsorship of events. “He had the respect of the titled community because he was a titled player,” said Severson. “People would return his emails, whereas they wouldn’t return our emails.” Titled players got free premium accounts, and Chess.com started to organize tournaments for them with modest prize money. Meanwhile, Rensch was still pursuing his own business but also started providing content for Chess.com. A few months later, in May 2009, the site celebrated its second anniversary. There were now 600,000 users on the site and another 400,000 on the Facebook app, so the one-million barrier had been broken. The company employed ten full-timers and several part-timers, including Rensch, who would only become an official employee in April 2010. The videos that he made were big hits. With his energy and humor, it all clicked for the members. One of them sent an email saying, “Danny Rensch is worth the price of the diamond membership alone.” Echos of ICC and FICS: Chess.com versus Lichess “Should we do another game?” Allebest asked Severson. By the summer of 2009, Chess.com had become a self-sustainable and profitable website. That nice little chess project, that lifestyle business, was doing all right. Perhaps still feeling some of the Silicon Valley pressure, Allebest suggested taking their concept to another level. Dominoes? Backgammon? Take what they’ve learned with search engine optimization (SEO) and what it means to have a great domain name and do it in a much bigger industry. An opportunity came up in August to buy the domain exercise.com for half a million dollars, and the two chess entrepreneurs stopped working full-time on Chess.com. Joined by their friend Dan Rosenthal, they were off to a fresh start and even rented an office on Castro Street in Mountain View, California. For the new site, they used a different PHP technology stack called Symfony. They reached out to one of the top Symfony developers in the world, who was an important contributor to the open-source framework. His name was Thibault Duplessis. Born in France in 1984, Duplessis was already programming with QBasic on Casio calculators in high school. He studied computer science and worked for a few years as a software engineer while contributing to open-source projects. In early 2010 he was working as a developer at a French agency, making websites and experimenting with different technologies, when Allebest and Severson approached him. Duplessis accepted the offer to work for Exercise.com and came to California in the fall, where he initially stayed with Severson’s family. He started coding, and everyone was impressed. He was incredibly productive, capable of doing something in an hour which would take others half a day. Severson: “I remember that every time I would ask, ‘Hey, Thibault, do you wanna go see a movie tonight? You wanna go hang out with friends? You wanna go out drinking and go to a bar?’ he was like, ‘No, I think I just want to stay in the room tonight and write code.’ It was very clear to me that he loved programming on a different level than anybody else I’d ever met in my life. He would easily code 14 hours a day and just love every minute of it.” Meanwhile, like Piotr Dachtera, Duplessis had created a chessboard in the programming language AJAX as a hobby project. He decided to push his creation online and make it open source. “I moved on to the next project, but someday I noticed that someone was actually playing chess on this very simple, very silly website,” Duplessis said, during a presentation in June 2017 in Munich, Germany. “I was like, what the hell, there were requests in the Apache [server] logs. So, I added a chat to the page in order to communicate with this user, and there was a user indeed. The guy started to yell at me because it was full of bugs. I wasn’t even validating if the moves were illegal! So I fixed the bugs. He asked for features, and I added features and bugs. A few more players arrived, some offered to help, and it became Lichess.” The first game on Lichess was played on June 20, 2010, about two months before Duplessis traveled to California. Until November of that year, people logged in anonymously before the option came to create an account. To his surprise, the community on the site kept growing organically. When Allebest and Severson finally found out about his chess site, they were not amused. Duplessis told them it wasn’t a serious project but that he built it to learn and practice with new programming languages. In the summer of 2011 everyone joined for lunch at their favorite Mongolian restaurant in Mountain View. The whole team was there: about eight or nine people, including the three founders, Allebest, Rosenthal, and Severson. Colleagues shared stories about their weekend, but Duplessis’s story was different. “I’ve been reading these books and found this new language,” Severson quoted him. “It’s unbelievable. It’s like the most beautiful programming language I’ve ever seen. I don’t like PHP any more; I don’t like Symfony. I just want to write Scala all day.” Severson: “We were looking at him and thinking, ‘You don’t fall in love with a language over the weekend, right? And you have to write PHP because that’s what you’re doing for us.’ We all had this confused look on our faces.” Rosenthal asked, “Are you quitting Exercise.com?” Duplessis replied, “Yes, I think I am.” He left Exercise.com in September 2011 and started rewriting Lichess completely using Scala. Duplessis is a big believer in open source, the concept that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance your source code. Important parts of the internet run on open-source code, including operating systems (for example, Unix), web servers (Apache), content management systems (WordPress), databases (MySQL), and languages (JavaScript). The Lichess code has been used to create the most popular playing server for draughts, which you can find at lidraughts.org, and there’s one for shogi at lishogi.org. Looking back at it years later, the Lichess founder said he was the right person at the right time to come up with the idea of a free chess platform. “One that would treat players as people and not cattle,” as he put it. He meant that the users would not be bothered with ads or requests for paid memberships. It is a concept diametrically opposed to Chess.com’s, a company that, at the end of the day, needs to bring money to the table. And so, three decades later, the chess world has a new “FICS versus ICC” situation, although it’s not as simple as a clash between socialist and capitalist mindsets. “Money isn’t everything, but it is the resource and the tool that gives you the ability to actually build really cool things and grow the game,” said Severson. “I admit that I am money-driven. But it’s okay, as long as you keep in mind that you’re not just making money so you can buy a yacht. You’re making money as a company to further the cause of the game. I think we’ve stayed true to that mission.” A term that wouldn’t come to mind to describe Duplessis is money-driven. Keeping Lichess completely free has become an important mission. In an interview in July 2023 he explained: “The chess community is made of very smart people, who will not be satisfied with corporations using their hobby for profit, with mediocre proprietary software. Instead, the chess players of the world want to take matters into their own hands: build their own tools, and publish the code and the data to strengthen the chess ecosystem.” This philosophy also explains the site’s name: Lichess (pronounced lee-chess) combines live, light, libre, and chess. “Live, because games are played and watched in real-time 24/7; light and libre for the fact that Lichess is open-source and unencumbered by proprietary junk that plagues other websites,” the site itself explains. Duplessis funded the site’s running costs for about five years until it became clear that this wasn’t sustainable, with server costs getting as high as thousands of dollars per month. In June 2016 Lichess officially gained a nonprofit legal status as an association governed by the French Law of Associations of July 1, 1901. The registry noted that the site’s goal is “to promote and encourage the teaching and practice of the game of chess and its variants.” The association status gave Lichess, which is fully funded by donations from patrons, access to banking services and the ability to employ staff and rent property. Lichess stopped being a one-man show a long time ago. Duplessis credits a large community of volunteers with a shared belief in open source and a free internet. In 2023 the total number of people contributing to translations, to the code or otherwise, was in the high thousands. The “core team,” active daily, was numbered in the hundreds, while about 20 people were paid or eligible to be paid—equivalent to about seven full-time positions. They were working on the second most popular chess platform in the world. According to SimilarWeb—a digital market intelligence company that provides data and insights related to website traffic, user engagement, and online market share—Lichess had about 85 million total visits in June 2023. In comparison, Chess.com had just over 200 million. The numbers can differ quite strongly in different countries though: the traffic share in the US was 83 percent and 17 percent respectively, and similar in India with 82 percent and 18 percent. But in Germany, say, it was 59 percent for Chess.com versus 41 percent for Lichess. From a business perspective, you could even call it “unfair competition” because Chess.com is not dealing with another company but a nonprofit offering a similar product without charging for it. The core product, however—playing a game of chess—is 100 percent free on both Chess.com and Lichess. Many features on the two platforms are virtually identical (such as puzzles, analysis tools, and AI-generated game reviews), but each site also has its own unique features and community. Meanwhile, Allebest and Severson haven’t been in touch with Duplessis for years. “I would say we’re on non-speaking terms,” said Severson. Bringing Video into the Chess World I am a weak chess player and a strong chess player. I belong to the group of players who can effortlessly checkmate most random people in the street but hardly stand a chance against a grandmaster. I say “hardly” because I beat one once in my life. It was in a tournament in July 1996. I was 20 and had played serious chess for about seven years. Somehow, I defeated the Polish American grandmaster Alexander Wojtkiewicz, the world’s 276th player at the time. Since then, I have scored two international master norms (meaning I played nine-round tournaments at the IM level twice). Although few club players can say that, I still consider myself more a writer than a player. I might have influenced the chess world somewhat with my video journalism, which I should be talking about as well. Let’s wind back the clock a bit. On February 6, 2006, I created an account on blogspot.com and published my first blog post. Blogging was a popular internet activity in the early 2000s. It was about sharing thoughts, experiences or hobbies on a blog, short for weblog. Platforms like Blogger, LiveJournal, Moveable Type, and, later, WordPress made it easy for people to create their own sites and post articles, which readers could comment on. Before social media took over, many people blogged about politics, perhaps even more about food, and some about chess. My initial idea for the blog was to publish and discuss chess games, including those I played myself. I soon started writing about all kinds of chess-related topics: the 80th birthday of a famous Russian grandmaster; talented young players at a tournament in Mexico; a book review; a report on the local Amsterdam city championship, where I participated and wrote a complete tournament report. A pivotal moment came in October 2006 when I was playing a tournament in Hoogeveen, a small city in the north of my country. The organizers allowed me to enter the press room each day after I finished my game, where I would meet players and other reporters, including Macauley Peterson, an American chess fan who was spending a year studying film theory in Amsterdam. Soon, we would be colleagues and friends, and Peterson would play a big role in my early years in chess video journalism. One day, I went to the press room where I saw two participants of the main event, Judit Polgár and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, behind a chessboard. They were analyzing their game—something you hardly see today but was quite common then, as the opponent’s opinions were still valued higher than the computer’s. I switched roles from player to reporter and started filming them with my Nikon Coolpix camera. I had experimented with video before and knew my readers enjoyed watching top players analyzing. In a way, they were getting a sort of a free masterclass, and I enjoyed providing a service for the chess world. Two weeks later, the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree mentioned my name in his chess column in the national newspaper NRC. His article “Spied Everywhere” suggested that watching YouTube should perhaps become part of grandmaster preparation. Why? Two weeks after Hoogeveen, in a tournament in Moscow, Mamedyarov had played a quick draw against the Latvian grandmaster Alexei Shirov without using any time on the clock; the Azerbaijani player only needed to remember his prepared homework, including an important new move in a key position. As it turned out, Shirov could have known about that important new move because Mamedyarov had shown it to Polgár in my video! “The Dutch chess player Peter Doggers filmed that analysis and posted the video on his chess website and later also on YouTube,” Ree wrote. “He did not know that he was revealing an important opening novelty; otherwise, he might have had conscientious objections.” When I met Shirov two months later in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, we shook hands, but he also exclaimed, “I am not talking to you!” I still don’t know if he was joking or not. In January 2007, at the annual chess festival in Wijk aan Zee, I was allowed for the first time to enter the stage where the top grandmasters played—a closed-off and sacred segment of the tournament hall. I made new videos, which could be as basic as players arriving at their board, shaking hands and making their first moves, but even that was special then. In a way, I started a new era for chess: the video age. Never before did chess fans have free access to behind-the-scenes activity at top chess events, and never before were interviews with players recorded on video and made available just hours later to enjoy. I did something else that my website visitors appreciated immensely. Each day in Wijk aan Zee, it was common to have a grandmaster—usually someone who’d scored a nice victory—come to the press room and explain their game to the press using a large wooden demonstration board. Tournament director Jeroen van den Berg gave the green light for an idea I had: why didn’t I put up a camera on a tripod, film these analysis sessions by grandmasters, and post them online so that not only the media but all the chess fans in the world could enjoy them? I borrowed a JVC MiniDV digital video camera that recorded on tape and took it to Wijk aan Zee for two weeks. You can still find those videos on the YouTube account Chesscomcommunity. They are basically free lectures by famous players such as Viswanathan Anand, Vladimir Kramnik, and a very young Magnus Carlsen. People loved it. Where before it had about a thousand visitors daily prior to the tournament, my website was getting 15,000 visitors a day a week into the tournament. My site was now located at chessvibes.com. I launched the new URL on January 1, 2007, inspired by the French content aggregator Netvibes I was using. Looking back, I still like the name ChessVibes, which has a positive ring to it, like a chess version of “Good Vibrations” by the Beach Boys. Although when I met the 12th World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov a few years later in Wijk aan Zee, he told me he was reading my articles (yes!) but didn’t know what the word “vibes” meant (oops). Still, the new name was much better than what I had used between February and December 2006: doggers-schaak.nl. My surname likely refers to ancestors who used a “dogger,” a two-masted trawling ship used for fishing in the North Sea. However, as I discovered sometime in late 2006, with a mixture of horror and amusement, “dogging” is also British slang for “engaging in public sex while others watch.” Maybe I didn’t need my surname in that URL anymore … That 2007 edition of Wijk aan Zee was a true breakthrough moment for me: the start of a fascinating journey in the chess world that is not over yet. In September 2007 Peterson and I joined for our first big event: the FIDE World Chess Championship tournament in Mexico City. We provided daily coverage in text and video, mixing player quotes from the press conferences with shots from the playing hall. Soon, tournament organizers wanted us to make video content for them. One of the first was Joop van Oosterom, a Dutch billionaire and chess fanatic who had been organizing an annual chess tournament since 1993 named after his daughter Melody Amber. Peterson and I worked at the last four editions between 2008 and 2011, unforgettable tournaments held in five-star hotels on the French Riviera, where the weather was lovely, the food exquisite, and the service impeccable. As we continued to produce videos, others followed suit. For instance, a team representing the French magazine Europe Échecs was suddenly going to all the tournaments, making videos similar to ours. The chess world had embraced the video format. Meanwhile, I started to focus on writing more and more, and my stories became just as important for my website as the videos. I added more contributors to my site, launched digital magazines, and hired a programmer to rebuild the backend to prepare it for bigger growth. Despite all this, I was having doubts about the future of ChessVibes. Five years after quitting my job, I was making only about half of what I’d been earning previously. I was 37 years old and wondering how long I wanted to go on with this lovely business that looked brilliant from the outside but was tough to grow without attracting investors. Talks with ICC and New in Chess to form a joint company led nowhere, and then, on December 21, 2012, I received an email that would change everything: Hi! This is Erik from Chess.com. I’d love to discuss ways we might be able to work together! Who is the right person to speak with? Thanks! Erik CEO, Chess.com I joined Chess.com in September 2013 and continued doing my reporting, often with Chess.com’s Mike Klein, and producing videos for my new employers, who gave me the journalistic freedom to continue in the same fashion as before. Meanwhile, Exercise.com lasted only two years for Allebest and Severson, as it never turned into the endeavor they had in mind. “We didn’t feel the passion for it,” said Allebest. “And part of the problem was that the whole time we were trying to work on Exercise, we saw this little annoying thing over here. It was just growing and growing and growing.” A big moment for Chess.com came when the company closed a deal with Hikaru Nakamura to play on the site. Until then, Nakamura had been loyal to the Internet Chess Club, even owning shares. It helped, however, that he had known Rensch since he was small. “I stayed with his family two summers in a row, playing baseball and basketball,” said Rensch. It was Allebest who called Nakamura, offering $16,000 a year for just three things: Nakamura had to wear a Chess.com wristband at over-the-board tournaments, play a minimum of 150 games per month on Chess.com, and regularly participate in Titled Tuesdays. Note that he was never asked to play on Chess.com exclusively. “It seemed fresh, something new,” Nakamura told me. “I think I just had the feeling that Danny and Erik were on the right path, even back then.” He accepted the deal and started making some extra money on top of the agreement as he won prizes in Titled Tuesdays more often than not. He also played much more than 150 games a month. “He borderline became exclusive because he appreciated the love we were giving him by making him kind of our guy,” said Rensch. “At the end of the day, Hikaru is a very loyal person, and when he felt like we genuinely loved him and wanted him, I think that was a game changer for him.” As the years went by, Chess.com broke record after record. On December 5, 2014, the one billionth game was played on the server. It took only a further two and a half years to break two billion, and soon, that became a problem: the “32-bit bug” led Chess.com to feature on Hacker News and other tech sites. Late one Saturday evening, on June 10, 2017, Chess.com started to receive messages from members claiming the site was broken. It was the start of the weekend for many developers, so the worst time for a major bug to surface. More and more people were complaining over the weekend, and only on Monday morning did the iOS development team suddenly realize they were dealing with an overflow problem. In other words, the devices used by the members couldn’t handle the number of games. The problem was limited to pre-2013 iOS devices, since the live server worked everywhere except on 32-bit iPhones and iPads. The reason was that 2,147,483,648 games had been played on Chess.com, and new games, with a higher game ID, were breaking the 32-bit integer limit of those older iOS devices, which simply didn’t support interpretation for numbers higher than 231. It was a comical result of yet another amazing milestone reached by the site. The same thing had happened a few years before on YouTube when PSY’s smash-hit song “Gangnam Style” exceeded 2,147,483,647 views. Like Google, Chess.com quickly fixed the bug. An update to the iOS app was submitted to the App Store, which Apple accepted within two hours. As the CEO, Allebest explained the slightly embarrassing but funny bug in a blog post: “Likely, the developer didn’t expect two billion games at the time that code was written long ago. But, on the other hand, two billion games!!! The moral of the story, I guess, is: when you have an idea, always plan BIG. That’s why when I retire and open my donut shop, I’m going to have seating for THREE billion customers.” Beating the ICC The 32-bit bug was a funny episode that could only have happened to Chess.com, now the biggest chess company. It became clear that Chess.com, which started as an underdog, had become a giant that was outgrowing the other chess platforms out there—most notably, the long-term market leader for serious players, the Internet Chess Club. How did this happen? For starters, none of the ICC’s cofounders were of the true entrepreneurial type. The original initiator, Daniel Sleator, is a computer scientist from St. Louis; Marty Grund, a stained glass craftsman from Des Moines; and Eric Peterson, a research geophysicist from Dallas. When a buyout by another company failed in the fall of 2001 due to the 9/11 terrorist attack, it was Sleator’s wife who took over the daily running of the company. “We were a ship without a clear captain. It was like a soap opera, like Dallas or Dynasty,” said Ruy Mora, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer. “I think we had at least four or five people who were CEO for a year.” For two decades, the ICC had made a profit, shareholders received their dividends, and little to no new investment was made. Things remained the same for the users, who only got to play from the browser at a very late stage. “As long as our members were playing with a downloadable client like BlitzIn, we felt in control in our fight against cheating,” Mora explained. “The program would register their mouse-handling, whether they would switch to another program, and if they were running an engine. We thought we would lose that control if we [went] web-based.” By the time the ICC realized that playing from the browser was the future, Chess.com already had a head start, a gap that soon became impossible to bridge. The same happened to ChessBase’s Playchess, said Mora: “They started strongly, but it wasn’t clear what they wanted to do with the platform. It was tightly knit into their ChessBase product. They wanted to make it a seamless experience, but ChessBase was also complicated to use. It didn’t help to popularize the platform.” Rensch gave me three reasons why Chess.com ended up beating the ICC. First, Hikaru Nakamura. Second, Chess.com’s superior analysis board—“the analysis tool was critical for coaching online. And when coaches teach their students on your site, they bring them over.” Third, product. “There’s no debate that for the first five or six years, ICC was just a better play experience,” admitted Rensch. “It was faster, it was cleaner, it was less laggy. Browser technology was not up to snuff with app technology.” Players were happy to go through the hassle of downloading the needed software for playing games as long as it was clearly faster. When Mozilla and Google Chrome’s browser technology and Chess.com’s technology improved, everything turned around. “It’s one of those funny things, because to everyone outside the chess world now, it looks like Chess.com winning was a foregone conclusion—but, for us, we were the underdogs, and this was a huge moment,” said Rensch. “ICC, at one point, had laughed us out of the building.” Chess24 and Live Broadcasts That same summer of 2017, Chess.com broke two round numbers: over 20 million members and over 100 full-time employees. Both figures surpassed any other chess company out there—although one had been growing steadily and was starting to look like Chess.com’s new big rival in the market. This was Chess24, owned in majority by the Bolivian businessman Enrique Guzman and co-run by the German grandmaster Jan Gustafsson. Guzman had made millions from cofounding and selling PokerStrategy.com, a successful portal for poker fans to improve their game with lots of articles and video lessons. He was now trying to do the same for chess by providing an educational and international platform that focused on instructional videos for chess fans who wanted to improve their game. Chess24 launched on February 24, 2014, with content and a play server. The new platform instantly became the most popular place for chess fans to watch their favorite players in action because of its shiny new HTML page for live games with a user interface that blew away any other site on the market. The only one that came close was ChessBomb, a Bulgarian website that had existed for about six years, but its interface offered fewer features and was also aesthetically lagging behind. (In November 2018, ChessBomb would be acquired by Chess.com and turned into its events page chess.com/events.) It’s fair to say that ChessBomb and Chess24 have radically changed how chess fans watch chess. For starters, they provided a home on the web to find all major chess events in one place. Chess events are being played around the globe pretty much 24/7, 365 days a year—from major events to local weekenders. Most clubs and tournaments broadcast the games on their websites, but it’s much more convenient for the chess fan to have one site to fall back on. The other important aspect that made watching chess on Chess24 and ChessBomb so popular was that the two sites integrated a running chess engine alongside the chess moves and the board, which suddenly made it much easier for viewers to understand what was going on. During the game, you could now see what would be the best move to play, according to the engine, and what evaluation belonged to it (e.g., “White is clearly better” or “the game is equal”). To show where the players made a mistake (according to the computer), ChessBomb used a system based on colors: an orange move would be dubious, and a red move a blunder. This became part of chess culture. Often, a grandmaster would ask after finishing a game, “Did I play any red moves?” Chess24 displayed a different system to evaluate positions—one which has subsequently become extremely common in chess: the eval bar. This vertical, thermometer-like bar is placed next to the chessboard with its bottom half white and the top half black at the start of a game. If White gains the advantage, the white segment in the bar goes up; conversely, if Black is doing well, more of the bar will be colored black. The eval bar is quite responsive, so when mistakes are made in quick succession, the bar can go up or down suddenly, adding a fantastic visual element to the experience of watching chess. Suddenly, many more fans could better understand what was going on, which is important for a game like chess. You can put anyone in front of a television that shows a soccer game, and in no time, they will understand that the idea is to get the ball into the goal. To enjoy watching chess, you need to know the rules at least and preferably have some experience playing the game yourself. Thanks to the eval bar, chess has become much more accessible to a wider audience. Although the eval bar has improved the viewing experience for many fans, thereby contributing to popularizing chess in general, it should be noted that there is also a downside to this new development: top players tend to be respected much less than in the old days, and wrongly so. Nowadays, complete patzers, “armchair analysts” who have access to computer analysis while watching the game live, know better about the mistakes made than the grandmasters themselves. Too many times, those fans leave derogatory comments in the chat or the comments section of news articles, saying that players are “bad” or “weak” or “terrible” because they made a move that the computer didn’t like. They completely forget what it’s like to be in the playing hall, with all the pressure and the clock ticking, as well as all the other moves in the game that were played on a level they could only dream about. Occasionally I play in a tournament myself, and I am always reminded of how tough chess really is. Another important aspect of the Chess24 platform was the embedded video player showing a tournament’s live video feed. Suddenly, it became extremely convenient to watch chess events. Because that was the thing now: chess tournaments had started to provide video shows with commentary. A pioneer in that area was my old friend Macauley Peterson. Working as a freelance video producer, Peterson’s broadcast production of the 2010 US championship in St. Louis was the first video broadcast of a top-level chess tournament on the internet. Small cameras showed footage from the playing hall; another cam was recording the commentators; and a 2D chessboard for analysis completed the frame—the basic elements of a chess broadcast that are still used today. The director of the London Chess Classic, Malcolm Pein, invited Peterson to do the same for his tournament in December of that year. After that, more and more tournaments wanted in, such as the annual festival in Gibraltar. In the years to come, I got involved in broadcasting myself on behalf of Chess.com, together with my Dutch friend Lennart Ootes. We made shows in Gibraltar, Reykjavík, Wijk aan Zee, Doha, Jerusalem, Skopje, Oslo, and Douglas (Isle of Man). In early 2024, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament demonstrated that online chess broadcasting had come a long way, as more than 50 cameras were placed in the playing hall, some of them as tiny as the one in your smartphone. By the end of 2021, Chess.com had grown about five times as big as in 2016 (partly thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic; see next chapter). The success didn’t go unnoticed, and the company was looking at multiple takeover bids. Some were not very serious, and others failed to materialize, but things were different when the American growth equity firm General Atlantic (GA) approached the company. GA had a good track record of helping companies like Airbnb, Duolingo, Slack, and Uber toward their IPOs, and Allebest liked their community-driven approach. A deal was signed just before the new year, and GA invested heavily in the company. The deal was unprecedented in size and volume for the chess world. It came, however, after a period of multiple other takeovers by Chess.com’s main rival. It’s about time to start talking about Play Magnus. For that, we have to go back to January 2014. Play Magnus and the Takeover A month before Chess24 went live, the Norwegian company Play Magnus launched its eponymous app with a beautifully simple idea: you could play against an AI version of Magnus Carlsen at different ages. A beginner could beat the five-year-old Magnus, but even the real Magnus struggled against the higher ages. The company, partly owned by the Carlsen family, later added a Magnus Trainer app for chess improvement, and an app for kids called Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess. In that same month of January 2014, Carlsen traveled to the US with his manager Espen Agdestein for several sponsor and promotional events. One of these was a dinner party thrown by billionaire investor Yuri Milner, a famous Israeli entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Carlsen played chess against several tech CEOs, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, a few days before he also met Bill Gates. Gaining these Silicon Valley contacts would prove to be of great value down the road. Approximately five years on, Play Magnus changed its game plan when the business chose a growth strategy based on multiple rounds of venture capital investments. In February 2019 Play Magnus acquired Chess24 at a value of $12.6 million. Chess24 had nearly 850,000 registered users at the time, with 600,000 monthly active users coming to the site. Half a year later, Chessable was also acquired, valued at $6.7 million. Between December 2020 and August 2021 PlayMagnus took over several more small chess companies, with Chessable becoming a key asset. This platform alone has changed chess significantly, especially for amateur players like me. Cofounded in November 2015 by the American international master John Bartholomew and the English player David Kramaley, Chessable was launched on February 22, 2016. The unique selling point of Chessable is its innovative approach to chess learning and training through its use of spaced repetition technology. In practice, this comes down to going through lessons, with videos and text, and then repeating the learned moves regularly on the website or in the app. Especially after the takeover by Play Magnus, Chessable started to add to its library the best content available, sourced from famous instructional books and new material from top-notch authors. Because these included some of the best grandmasters in the world, the material was valuable for both amateurs and strong players. When the American chess prodigy Abhimanyu Mishra became the world’s youngest grandmaster at age 12 in July 2021, it was no secret that he was an avid Chessable user. Eight months after Chess.com’s deal with General Atlantic, on August 24, 2022, a press release shocked the chess world: “Chess.com Makes Offer to Play Magnus Group.” Wait, what? Among many smaller commercial entities, there were two absolute kings in the chess world: Chess.com and Play Magnus. One king was about to eat the other to become the absolute, sovereign ruler. It was the chess equivalent of Microsoft merging with Apple. On December 16, 2022, the deal was closed. The chess world reacted with mixed feelings: some feared that Chess.com’s apparent monopoly was not a good thing, while others noted the benefits of merging two separate communities of online chess players. An important benefit for the fans was that Magnus Carlsen had signed on as a Chess.com ambassador. This meant he would likely compete even more in online events as he could now return to playing on Chess.com, as he had done before his affiliation with former rival Chess24 in 2019. Two days later, on December 18, 2022, Carlsen contested the 2022 Speed Chess Championship Final, where he lost to Hikaru Nakamura in a thrilling, down-to-the-wire battle watched by more than 200,000 viewers. In spring 2024, Chess.com had a total of 714 employees and 167 million registered users (of which 40 million were monthly active users), making it the ninth largest “country” in the world by population, just below Bangladesh and just above Russia. Its value is currently estimated to be over a billion dollars. If, as we’ll see in the next chapter, Levy Rozman is the personification of the chess revolution, Chess.com is the driving force behind it, the organization perhaps most responsible for accelerating the old board game’s popularity to new heights in the modern era.",

We will have to somehow convince all these people who play for free to come over to our site and then pay us money. Like, at what point is that business model ever gonna work?” —Jay Severson, to Erik Allebest, in 2005 It is September 1995, the first week of freshman year for Erik Allebest, who has just turned 18. He wakes up and walks to the shared bathroom at the Brigham Young University (BYU) campus in Provo, Utah. He sees a young man of the same age, wearing glasses and brushing his teeth. Allebest uses the bathroom for a couple of minutes, comes back, and the fellow is still brushing. “It just seemed like a really long time,” Allebest told me. “So I said, ‘What, is your dad a dentist, or something?’ ” It is the first thing Allebest ever says to Jarom (Jay) Severson, his future friend and cofounder of Chess.com. Later that day, Severson walks along the third floor of Merrill Hall and notices two students inside one of the dormitories. One is Allebest, the other is Ryan Miller, and they are playing chess. “Can I get the winner?” Severson asks. He beats them both. No, he destroys them. Allebest recalled, “When he came in and saw me playing chess, I felt like he wanted to kick my ass because I’d made this snarky comment in the morning.” Born in 1977 in Silverton, Oregon, Severson grew up in a small town a few miles south called Lebanon. He and his five siblings were raised as Mormons. (These days, the preferred term is “Latter-day Saints.”) Severson told me that when he was 11 years old, the family-owned pizzeria went bankrupt and his father lost his job as a police officer. The family eventually relocated to San José when Severson was in sixth grade. He learned about chess when his father, who enjoyed carpentry as a hobby, made a large, heavy chessboard all by himself, using thick, solid wood. At first, he watched his older brothers play, until they allowed him to join in. Severson told me he got hooked on the game in high school, which had a chess club and played team matches with other schools: “I got sucked in real big.” He started buying chess books and even entered individual tournaments. When he joined BYU, Severson was the obvious person to run the chess club. Allebest, also born in 1977, came from a family of Latter-day Saints too, but he grew up in upper-class Laguna Hills, Orange County, in Southern California. His mother taught him chess when he was eight years old. His father was a lawyer with an entrepreneurial mindset, which Allebest inherited. On Monday mornings he went where the kids drank beers on the weekends, collected the cans and recycled them for $20. After graduating from high school, Allebest went to BYU and deliberately chose something that was not too challenging. In an interview in 2021, he said, “I was an English major, but only so I could get through classes as quickly as possible. I didn’t feel like I was learning a lot in school. I would literally put my Shakespeare book on my desk. Inside of that, I would have a Computers for Dummies or HTML for Beginners. I was teaching myself about computers and technology.” In that BYU dorm in September 1995, Allebest was impressed by Severson’s chess skills and asked, “How did you do that? Hey, can you give me some chess lessons? I’ll pay you $7 an hour.” And that’s what they agreed on. The two met about once a week, and while Severson started teaching Allebest chess openings, their friendship blossomed. Erik Allebest, left, and Jay Severson, right, the founders of Chess.com, as students on a trip (year unknown). Things were different in sophomore year when Severson continued college, but most of his friends, including Allebest, started their two-year missionary service abroad, a typical interruption from college for young Latter-day Saints. The two of them lost touch for a few years. Meanwhile, Severson became a successful video game player who won the 1998 StarCraft World Championship, a 3,000-player competition hosted as part of the Professional Gamers League’s third season. Gaining the first prize of $8,500 and a new computer was nice, but much more lucrative was the sponsorship deal Severson signed with Logitech, worth about $50,000 after he was featured in magazines like Newsweek and Wired. Not bad for a 20-year-old student coming from a family that used to live on welfare. Severson: “I felt I could retire.” But he didn’t. In fact, his professional gaming career only lasted a year or two as Severson decided to enter San José State University (SJSU) instead, ultimately going for a computer science major. He learned about HTML and built his very first two websites: one about winning strategies for the board game Axis and Allies and one about chess openings. After graduating, he worked at different companies as a developer, including Case’s Ladder, which brought him to KasparovChess in New York, and, later, a company called Myers, where he built real-estate and mortgage-related websites. On the other hand, Allebest became an entrepreneur early on. After returning from his mission in Argentina, he created two chess-related companies during his years at BYU. One was Schoolhouse Chess, a chess tutoring program he implemented in dozens of elementary schools across Utah. Out of that company came his e-commerce business, wholesalechess.com, which Severson helped code. Allebest would import chess sets from China (before Alibaba made that easy), store them in his garage, sell them online, and ship them all over the country (before Amazon made running such a business hard). After a few years, Allebest sold the two companies and entered Stanford Business School to get his master’s degree. He interned at Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, Google, and Palantir but turned down full-time positions. In the spring of 2005 he called Severson and said, “Hey, I met the guys that own the chess.com domain. What do you think about doing another chess business together?” Severson wasn’t excited at all. At that point, he had a job at Myers that paid him a pretty good salary, and he had seen many businesses fail in the chess space, including Kasparov Chess Online. The Internet Chess Club was doing okay but wasn’t growing much any more. The only really big chess platform at the time was Yahoo!Chess, but people there were playing for free. Severson told Allebest, “I would love to work with you but, dude, there’s no money in chess.” But Allebest had a plan. He said, “Well, we’ll do it this way. We’ll create profiles for players and make other content, and we’ll have ads for revenue. It will be a MySpace for chess. Just come with me and meet these guys and see how it goes.” Severson agreed, and soon they met with the original chess.com domain owners in the Japanese restaurant Fuki Sushi in Palo Alto, a famous spot in Silicon Valley where many tech companies have started. “So we walk into this meeting, and they were all mid-sixties and older; they were an older group of guys that just generationally did not understand the internet,” Severson said. “They didn’t understand where the internet was going; they didn’t have the technological background to do what they wanted. They were still mailing people DVDs.” The owners had been using the chess.com domain since 1995 to sell Chess Mentor, an educational tool they were trying to get into all California schools as part of the curriculum. They were working with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a chess fan and California’s governor at the time. However, the company had raised $5 million and wasn’t seeing enough sales or growth, so the owners were looking for ways to pay off debt. Bringing in two young tech guys with a track record of building chess sites to do something better with the domain seemed like a good plan. Severson told me, “Erik turns to me and goes, ‘Jay, why don’t you tell these guys why you’re so excited to work on Chess.com?’ And I totally BS for the next 15 minutes about what we would do with the platform and how it would be super-awesome. In my mind, I was thinking: ‘I don’t even wanna do this; this is not what I want to be doing with my time right now. I have a real job.’ ” Even so, Severson convinced the Chess Mentor people to join forces with them. They agreed to lease the domain but keep the property, while Allebest and Severson could put real estate on it and try to generate traffic. And so the brainstorming started: what should that property look like? On July 28, 2005, all Chess Mentor content was removed from the chess.com domain and replaced by the following placeholder text, which revealed some of the early plans: “Chess.com is currently under development to become the #1 online chess portal! The new Chess.com will help you find the best chess stores, places to play chess, where to learn chess, and more. There will be chess community forums to discuss chess openings, a directory of all chess websites, and other features.” In an email from October 21, 2005, Allebest outlined to Severson for the first time what Chess.com should have at launch, listing a place to register, an About page, a directory, a blog, forums, other resources, a search bar, a Learn page, a Play page, and a Shop page. And then, just a few months later, when Allebest and Severson had barely started working on actual code, the Chess Mentor company suddenly filed for bankruptcy. The owners intended to liquidate all assets to the highest bidder at a bankruptcy auction and thus get rid of their debts. Allebest was especially interested in the chess.com domain name, and he decided to try his luck together with his friend Zach Stout. The auction occurred on December 21, 2005, and all bidders joined by phone. Stout joined the auction and, with a winning bid of $55,000, he obtained that lovely domain name alongside all other company assets, including the Chess Mentor lesson material. On January 1, 2006, Allebest bought everything from Stout (who, in return, got a small percentage of the company). For an entrepreneur married with two young kids, it was a big investment. It was also the best investment ever made in the history of chess. How to Build a Chess Website Owning the top domain for a keyword like “chess” had immense value, especially thanks to the introduction of the auto-complete feature first included in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 5, as well as other browsers like Firefox. This feature meant that if you typed “chess” in the search bar and hit enter, the browser would add “.com” itself and go there. Even if you just intended to search for chess, you would end up on chess.com immediately. The site received thousands of free visitors daily, and it was time to do something about it. Two years of hard work followed. While Severson was still employed at Myers, he worked as a contractor for several other companies doing side work as a developer. At night, he worked on Chess.com. Allebest visited him almost daily as they worked from Severson’s room on the third floor in San José, coding until the early hours of the morning before Allebest drove back to Mountain View, only to return the next evening, rinse and repeat. In a podcast in November 2021, Severson said about this period, “The first few years of Chess.com, I felt like I was working 20-hour days. There were some days I couldn’t sleep at all. My wife remembers those days. Sometimes I would just go out in the garage and literally scream, just to let out how angry I was. It was exhausting.” Allebest conceptualized the whole site with 150 pages of wireframes in Microsoft Word. They started in September 2006, with Severson doing the back end (for the tech-minded: he used the Qcodo framework) and Allebest the front end. While making more and more progress on the code, at some point, they needed someone to “take that code and run it”—in other words, a server guy. Severson’s good friend and colleague at Myers, Igor Grinchenko, had the perfect skill set. Born in Kyrgyzstan, Grinchenko had come to the United States as a student in the late 1990s and was now the main IT guy at Myers. “The first time I saw him, he looked like the scariest, meanest Russian dude you have ever seen in your life,” Severson remembered. “He had this long mullet in the back and a small scar on his face, and just looked super-intimidating. But he said, ‘Dude, you’re the only programmer that knows what you’re doing.’ And I was like, ‘Dude, you’re the only IT guy that knows what you’re doing.’ And so we became really good friends. The most badass part about Igor was that every time he would drive in and out of the parking lot, I would laugh at his license plate that said: ‘UNIXRLZ.’ [Unix rules.] I mean, you can’t get any more hardcore than that.” Grinchenko decided to help them, and the team purchased their first server, a $3,000 Dell PowerEdge 1950. “We bought a two-unit machine from the Dell website, and it came to my apartment,” Grinchenko told me. “I called it ‘Igor 1.’ ” (Today, Chess.com has hundreds of servers spread across multiple locations throughout the US and in the cloud.) If you build a member site for chess fans, you need one thing that other social platforms don’t: a chessboard. Chess fans who read, populate forums, and write blogs need to be able to share their chess games and positions using a digital, 2D chessboard, similar to a chess diagram in a book or newspaper, but interactive. For that, too, Allebest and Severson found the right person: the Argentinean developer Matias José, who had created an account and soon after started bugging Erik with lots of feedback, basically, until he got hired. After a short beta testing period, Chess.com was launched publicly on May 18, 2007 (time of birth: 2:30 p.m. Pacific). The site had forums, blogs, articles, the option to play against the computer—and not much else. For the first few months it was all about content, as the articles posted by some of the early members started to generate traffic. The Chess.com home page in August 2007, three months after site launch. Meanwhile, Allebest finished his business degree at Stanford and could fully dedicate himself to his chess project, which, to him, still felt temporary. In a podcast in 2019 he described his attitude at the time: “I’m going to spend one year doing this at most, and then I’m going to go take one of those job offers from the big tech companies. And that just never happened. It just kept growing and growing.” Part of that growth came from being featured in July 2007 on the influential Mashable and TechCrunch websites, leading blogs for news about technology and start-ups. An important next step came when José rebuilt his chessboard into an application that allowed members to play chess against each other. Called “Daily Chess,” it was slow chess without a clock, but it was a start. Allebest himself played the first-ever game on the site on July 8, 2007. He beat member nyarlathotep in 19 moves. By the end of that month, and less than 60 days after its launch, Chess.com reached 10,000 members. Five weeks later, that was 20,000—at the end of October, 50,000. The site grew 10 percent per week for most of its metrics: unique visitors, unique member logins, and page views. Even so, Chess.com was more or less what Allebest and Severson had in mind and were satisfied with if it would stay like this: a content and members platform that produced ad revenue thanks to its excellent domain name. They didn’t believe it would generate much more money. Years later, Allebest and Severson would admit they were a bit under the “Silicon Valley pressure” of raising money, going big, and making a bunch of money at once. And chess, with its tiny market, wouldn’t do that for them. “We used to call it a lifestyle business,” Severson said. “We thought, maybe one day, it will be worth $5 million, if we’re lucky.” It took another half year or so for the early developers to launch what would become the single most important part of the website: the live server. It was the place where members could play real-time chess, with a clock, against each other. The leading developer behind this project was the Polish programmer Piotr Dachtera, who had built a small but slick chess server a few years before that ran on the URL 64pola.pl, Polish for “64 squares.” It had an elegant chessboard based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dachtera joined the company in February 2006, and “Live Chess” went live in early 2008. In May of that year, a Facebook app was launched, allowing members to play with friends who weren’t on Chess.com yet. It would be Chess.com’s biggest external driver of new members in the coming years. Paid memberships were introduced in 2008 as well: for a small monthly fee, premium members could access a web version of the old Chess Mentor software. And it worked. “When we launched it on one of the evenings, and Erik got home, he texted me that he wasn’t going to go to bed before the first member made a payment,” said Severson. “It took five minutes.” The company became profitable soon after and remains so to this day. On January 14, 2009, the word beta was removed from the logo, signifying that the site was fully grown and ready to storm the world even more. That logo has always been quite different from logos of other chess companies, which often use a king, knight, or rook. Allebest and Severson deliberately chose a pawn instead to emphasize that the site was not just for strong players or amateurs but for everyone. Enter Danny and David Chess.com kept growing but remained the small kid on the block. ICC and Playchess, the German platform mentioned in the previous chapter, dominated the chess landscape as the two places where the grandmasters played and, consequently, where all the serious amateurs could be found. If Chess.com was grabbing any market share, it was from Yahoo!Chess, which served the larger group of casual players. In mid-December 2008, Chess.com had 390,000 members, tons of content and features, and a live server with about 2,000 players online all the time. However, one thing was missing: strong players. “We knew that we were not high-enough-rated chess professionals, [for those] in the know in the community, to be able to go after that market,” Severson said. “I was probably rated around 1850 at the time, Erik was about 1500. We didn’t know the right people and were not taken seriously. People would say: “Oh, you’re those guys from Chess.com trying to do that stupid chess idea. Who do you think you are? Kasparov couldn’t even build a chess site, and you guys think you can do it?’ ” And so, in late 2008, Allebest and Severson, both 31 years old at the time, decided to visit the Berkeley Masters, a big chess tournament in Berkeley, California, with one idea in mind: to meet some strong players who might be willing to help them. One of the participants they would meet during the seventh round on December 20 was a 23-year-old player named Danny Rensch, who would score his second international master norm in this tournament. “I was playing this game against the Mongolian grandmaster Dashzeveg Sharavdorj and in walk these two guys,” Rensch remembered. “I was quickly wrapping up my game as I was super-excited to meet them.” On one of the final days of the tournament, Allebest and Severson joined Rensch and other strong players for a dinner arranged by the tournament organizer, the 27-year-old international master David Pruess. “I was all over them,” said Rensch. “I was telling them that I wanted to launch a chess teaching business of my own, that I brought all this value, and that I knew everything about the chess community.” Allebest and Severson, however, were mostly looking for strong players who could write instructional articles and other types of content, which initially clashed with Rensch’s bigger plans. As a result, it was Pruess who got hired as the director of professional relations in February 2009. He was in charge of contacting top players, recruiting titled players to become columnists or lecturers on the site, and coordinating Chess.com’s sponsorship of events. “He had the respect of the titled community because he was a titled player,” said Severson. “People would return his emails, whereas they wouldn’t return our emails.” Titled players got free premium accounts, and Chess.com started to organize tournaments for them with modest prize money. Meanwhile, Rensch was still pursuing his own business but also started providing content for Chess.com. A few months later, in May 2009, the site celebrated its second anniversary. There were now 600,000 users on the site and another 400,000 on the Facebook app, so the one-million barrier had been broken. The company employed ten full-timers and several part-timers, including Rensch, who would only become an official employee in April 2010. The videos that he made were big hits. With his energy and humor, it all clicked for the members. One of them sent an email saying, “Danny Rensch is worth the price of the diamond membership alone.” Echos of ICC and FICS: Chess.com versus Lichess “Should we do another game?” Allebest asked Severson. By the summer of 2009, Chess.com had become a self-sustainable and profitable website. That nice little chess project, that lifestyle business, was doing all right. Perhaps still feeling some of the Silicon Valley pressure, Allebest suggested taking their concept to another level. Dominoes? Backgammon? Take what they’ve learned with search engine optimization (SEO) and what it means to have a great domain name and do it in a much bigger industry. An opportunity came up in August to buy the domain exercise.com for half a million dollars, and the two chess entrepreneurs stopped working full-time on Chess.com. Joined by their friend Dan Rosenthal, they were off to a fresh start and even rented an office on Castro Street in Mountain View, California. For the new site, they used a different PHP technology stack called Symfony. They reached out to one of the top Symfony developers in the world, who was an important contributor to the open-source framework. His name was Thibault Duplessis. Born in France in 1984, Duplessis was already programming with QBasic on Casio calculators in high school. He studied computer science and worked for a few years as a software engineer while contributing to open-source projects. In early 2010 he was working as a developer at a French agency, making websites and experimenting with different technologies, when Allebest and Severson approached him. Duplessis accepted the offer to work for Exercise.com and came to California in the fall, where he initially stayed with Severson’s family. He started coding, and everyone was impressed. He was incredibly productive, capable of doing something in an hour which would take others half a day. Severson: “I remember that every time I would ask, ‘Hey, Thibault, do you wanna go see a movie tonight? You wanna go hang out with friends? You wanna go out drinking and go to a bar?’ he was like, ‘No, I think I just want to stay in the room tonight and write code.’ It was very clear to me that he loved programming on a different level than anybody else I’d ever met in my life. He would easily code 14 hours a day and just love every minute of it.” Meanwhile, like Piotr Dachtera, Duplessis had created a chessboard in the programming language AJAX as a hobby project. He decided to push his creation online and make it open source. “I moved on to the next project, but someday I noticed that someone was actually playing chess on this very simple, very silly website,” Duplessis said, during a presentation in June 2017 in Munich, Germany. “I was like, what the hell, there were requests in the Apache [server] logs. So, I added a chat to the page in order to communicate with this user, and there was a user indeed. The guy started to yell at me because it was full of bugs. I wasn’t even validating if the moves were illegal! So I fixed the bugs. He asked for features, and I added features and bugs. A few more players arrived, some offered to help, and it became Lichess.” The first game on Lichess was played on June 20, 2010, about two months before Duplessis traveled to California. Until November of that year, people logged in anonymously before the option came to create an account. To his surprise, the community on the site kept growing organically. When Allebest and Severson finally found out about his chess site, they were not amused. Duplessis told them it wasn’t a serious project but that he built it to learn and practice with new programming languages. In the summer of 2011 everyone joined for lunch at their favorite Mongolian restaurant in Mountain View. The whole team was there: about eight or nine people, including the three founders, Allebest, Rosenthal, and Severson. Colleagues shared stories about their weekend, but Duplessis’s story was different. “I’ve been reading these books and found this new language,” Severson quoted him. “It’s unbelievable. It’s like the most beautiful programming language I’ve ever seen. I don’t like PHP any more; I don’t like Symfony. I just want to write Scala all day.” Severson: “We were looking at him and thinking, ‘You don’t fall in love with a language over the weekend, right? And you have to write PHP because that’s what you’re doing for us.’ We all had this confused look on our faces.” Rosenthal asked, “Are you quitting Exercise.com?” Duplessis replied, “Yes, I think I am.” He left Exercise.com in September 2011 and started rewriting Lichess completely using Scala. Duplessis is a big believer in open source, the concept that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance your source code. Important parts of the internet run on open-source code, including operating systems (for example, Unix), web servers (Apache), content management systems (WordPress), databases (MySQL), and languages (JavaScript). The Lichess code has been used to create the most popular playing server for draughts, which you can find at lidraughts.org, and there’s one for shogi at lishogi.org. Looking back at it years later, the Lichess founder said he was the right person at the right time to come up with the idea of a free chess platform. “One that would treat players as people and not cattle,” as he put it. He meant that the users would not be bothered with ads or requests for paid memberships. It is a concept diametrically opposed to Chess.com’s, a company that, at the end of the day, needs to bring money to the table. And so, three decades later, the chess world has a new “FICS versus ICC” situation, although it’s not as simple as a clash between socialist and capitalist mindsets. “Money isn’t everything, but it is the resource and the tool that gives you the ability to actually build really cool things and grow the game,” said Severson. “I admit that I am money-driven. But it’s okay, as long as you keep in mind that you’re not just making money so you can buy a yacht. You’re making money as a company to further the cause of the game. I think we’ve stayed true to that mission.” A term that wouldn’t come to mind to describe Duplessis is money-driven. Keeping Lichess completely free has become an important mission. In an interview in July 2023 he explained: “The chess community is made of very smart people, who will not be satisfied with corporations using their hobby for profit, with mediocre proprietary software. Instead, the chess players of the world want to take matters into their own hands: build their own tools, and publish the code and the data to strengthen the chess ecosystem.” This philosophy also explains the site’s name: Lichess (pronounced lee-chess) combines live, light, libre, and chess. “Live, because games are played and watched in real-time 24/7; light and libre for the fact that Lichess is open-source and unencumbered by proprietary junk that plagues other websites,” the site itself explains. Duplessis funded the site’s running costs for about five years until it became clear that this wasn’t sustainable, with server costs getting as high as thousands of dollars per month. In June 2016 Lichess officially gained a nonprofit legal status as an association governed by the French Law of Associations of July 1, 1901. The registry noted that the site’s goal is “to promote and encourage the teaching and practice of the game of chess and its variants.” The association status gave Lichess, which is fully funded by donations from patrons, access to banking services and the ability to employ staff and rent property. Lichess stopped being a one-man show a long time ago. Duplessis credits a large community of volunteers with a shared belief in open source and a free internet. In 2023 the total number of people contributing to translations, to the code or otherwise, was in the high thousands. The “core team,” active daily, was numbered in the hundreds, while about 20 people were paid or eligible to be paid—equivalent to about seven full-time positions. They were working on the second most popular chess platform in the world. According to SimilarWeb—a digital market intelligence company that provides data and insights related to website traffic, user engagement, and online market share—Lichess had about 85 million total visits in June 2023. In comparison, Chess.com had just over 200 million. The numbers can differ quite strongly in different countries though: the traffic share in the US was 83 percent and 17 percent respectively, and similar in India with 82 percent and 18 percent. But in Germany, say, it was 59 percent for Chess.com versus 41 percent for Lichess. From a business perspective, you could even call it “unfair competition” because Chess.com is not dealing with another company but a nonprofit offering a similar product without charging for it. The core product, however—playing a game of chess—is 100 percent free on both Chess.com and Lichess. Many features on the two platforms are virtually identical (such as puzzles, analysis tools, and AI-generated game reviews), but each site also has its own unique features and community. Meanwhile, Allebest and Severson haven’t been in touch with Duplessis for years. “I would say we’re on non-speaking terms,” said Severson. Bringing Video into the Chess World I am a weak chess player and a strong chess player. I belong to the group of players who can effortlessly checkmate most random people in the street but hardly stand a chance against a grandmaster. I say “hardly” because I beat one once in my life. It was in a tournament in July 1996. I was 20 and had played serious chess for about seven years. Somehow, I defeated the Polish American grandmaster Alexander Wojtkiewicz, the world’s 276th player at the time. Since then, I have scored two international master norms (meaning I played nine-round tournaments at the IM level twice). Although few club players can say that, I still consider myself more a writer than a player. I might have influenced the chess world somewhat with my video journalism, which I should be talking about as well. Let’s wind back the clock a bit. On February 6, 2006, I created an account on blogspot.com and published my first blog post. Blogging was a popular internet activity in the early 2000s. It was about sharing thoughts, experiences or hobbies on a blog, short for weblog. Platforms like Blogger, LiveJournal, Moveable Type, and, later, WordPress made it easy for people to create their own sites and post articles, which readers could comment on. Before social media took over, many people blogged about politics, perhaps even more about food, and some about chess. My initial idea for the blog was to publish and discuss chess games, including those I played myself. I soon started writing about all kinds of chess-related topics: the 80th birthday of a famous Russian grandmaster; talented young players at a tournament in Mexico; a book review; a report on the local Amsterdam city championship, where I participated and wrote a complete tournament report. A pivotal moment came in October 2006 when I was playing a tournament in Hoogeveen, a small city in the north of my country. The organizers allowed me to enter the press room each day after I finished my game, where I would meet players and other reporters, including Macauley Peterson, an American chess fan who was spending a year studying film theory in Amsterdam. Soon, we would be colleagues and friends, and Peterson would play a big role in my early years in chess video journalism. One day, I went to the press room where I saw two participants of the main event, Judit Polgár and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, behind a chessboard. They were analyzing their game—something you hardly see today but was quite common then, as the opponent’s opinions were still valued higher than the computer’s. I switched roles from player to reporter and started filming them with my Nikon Coolpix camera. I had experimented with video before and knew my readers enjoyed watching top players analyzing. In a way, they were getting a sort of a free masterclass, and I enjoyed providing a service for the chess world. Two weeks later, the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree mentioned my name in his chess column in the national newspaper NRC. His article “Spied Everywhere” suggested that watching YouTube should perhaps become part of grandmaster preparation. Why? Two weeks after Hoogeveen, in a tournament in Moscow, Mamedyarov had played a quick draw against the Latvian grandmaster Alexei Shirov without using any time on the clock; the Azerbaijani player only needed to remember his prepared homework, including an important new move in a key position. As it turned out, Shirov could have known about that important new move because Mamedyarov had shown it to Polgár in my video! “The Dutch chess player Peter Doggers filmed that analysis and posted the video on his chess website and later also on YouTube,” Ree wrote. “He did not know that he was revealing an important opening novelty; otherwise, he might have had conscientious objections.” When I met Shirov two months later in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, we shook hands, but he also exclaimed, “I am not talking to you!” I still don’t know if he was joking or not. In January 2007, at the annual chess festival in Wijk aan Zee, I was allowed for the first time to enter the stage where the top grandmasters played—a closed-off and sacred segment of the tournament hall. I made new videos, which could be as basic as players arriving at their board, shaking hands and making their first moves, but even that was special then. In a way, I started a new era for chess: the video age. Never before did chess fans have free access to behind-the-scenes activity at top chess events, and never before were interviews with players recorded on video and made available just hours later to enjoy. I did something else that my website visitors appreciated immensely. Each day in Wijk aan Zee, it was common to have a grandmaster—usually someone who’d scored a nice victory—come to the press room and explain their game to the press using a large wooden demonstration board. Tournament director Jeroen van den Berg gave the green light for an idea I had: why didn’t I put up a camera on a tripod, film these analysis sessions by grandmasters, and post them online so that not only the media but all the chess fans in the world could enjoy them? I borrowed a JVC MiniDV digital video camera that recorded on tape and took it to Wijk aan Zee for two weeks. You can still find those videos on the YouTube account Chesscomcommunity. They are basically free lectures by famous players such as Viswanathan Anand, Vladimir Kramnik, and a very young Magnus Carlsen. People loved it. Where before it had about a thousand visitors daily prior to the tournament, my website was getting 15,000 visitors a day a week into the tournament. My site was now located at chessvibes.com. I launched the new URL on January 1, 2007, inspired by the French content aggregator Netvibes I was using. Looking back, I still like the name ChessVibes, which has a positive ring to it, like a chess version of “Good Vibrations” by the Beach Boys. Although when I met the 12th World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov a few years later in Wijk aan Zee, he told me he was reading my articles (yes!) but didn’t know what the word “vibes” meant (oops). Still, the new name was much better than what I had used between February and December 2006: doggers-schaak.nl. My surname likely refers to ancestors who used a “dogger,” a two-masted trawling ship used for fishing in the North Sea. However, as I discovered sometime in late 2006, with a mixture of horror and amusement, “dogging” is also British slang for “engaging in public sex while others watch.” Maybe I didn’t need my surname in that URL anymore … That 2007 edition of Wijk aan Zee was a true breakthrough moment for me: the start of a fascinating journey in the chess world that is not over yet. In September 2007 Peterson and I joined for our first big event: the FIDE World Chess Championship tournament in Mexico City. We provided daily coverage in text and video, mixing player quotes from the press conferences with shots from the playing hall. Soon, tournament organizers wanted us to make video content for them. One of the first was Joop van Oosterom, a Dutch billionaire and chess fanatic who had been organizing an annual chess tournament since 1993 named after his daughter Melody Amber. Peterson and I worked at the last four editions between 2008 and 2011, unforgettable tournaments held in five-star hotels on the French Riviera, where the weather was lovely, the food exquisite, and the service impeccable. As we continued to produce videos, others followed suit. For instance, a team representing the French magazine Europe Échecs was suddenly going to all the tournaments, making videos similar to ours. The chess world had embraced the video format. Meanwhile, I started to focus on writing more and more, and my stories became just as important for my website as the videos. I added more contributors to my site, launched digital magazines, and hired a programmer to rebuild the backend to prepare it for bigger growth. Despite all this, I was having doubts about the future of ChessVibes. Five years after quitting my job, I was making only about half of what I’d been earning previously. I was 37 years old and wondering how long I wanted to go on with this lovely business that looked brilliant from the outside but was tough to grow without attracting investors. Talks with ICC and New in Chess to form a joint company led nowhere, and then, on December 21, 2012, I received an email that would change everything: Hi! This is Erik from Chess.com. I’d love to discuss ways we might be able to work together! Who is the right person to speak with? Thanks! Erik CEO, Chess.com I joined Chess.com in September 2013 and continued doing my reporting, often with Chess.com’s Mike Klein, and producing videos for my new employers, who gave me the journalistic freedom to continue in the same fashion as before. Meanwhile, Exercise.com lasted only two years for Allebest and Severson, as it never turned into the endeavor they had in mind. “We didn’t feel the passion for it,” said Allebest. “And part of the problem was that the whole time we were trying to work on Exercise, we saw this little annoying thing over here. It was just growing and growing and growing.” A big moment for Chess.com came when the company closed a deal with Hikaru Nakamura to play on the site. Until then, Nakamura had been loyal to the Internet Chess Club, even owning shares. It helped, however, that he had known Rensch since he was small. “I stayed with his family two summers in a row, playing baseball and basketball,” said Rensch. It was Allebest who called Nakamura, offering $16,000 a year for just three things: Nakamura had to wear a Chess.com wristband at over-the-board tournaments, play a minimum of 150 games per month on Chess.com, and regularly participate in Titled Tuesdays. Note that he was never asked to play on Chess.com exclusively. “It seemed fresh, something new,” Nakamura told me. “I think I just had the feeling that Danny and Erik were on the right path, even back then.” He accepted the deal and started making some extra money on top of the agreement as he won prizes in Titled Tuesdays more often than not. He also played much more than 150 games a month. “He borderline became exclusive because he appreciated the love we were giving him by making him kind of our guy,” said Rensch. “At the end of the day, Hikaru is a very loyal person, and when he felt like we genuinely loved him and wanted him, I think that was a game changer for him.” As the years went by, Chess.com broke record after record. On December 5, 2014, the one billionth game was played on the server. It took only a further two and a half years to break two billion, and soon, that became a problem: the “32-bit bug” led Chess.com to feature on Hacker News and other tech sites. Late one Saturday evening, on June 10, 2017, Chess.com started to receive messages from members claiming the site was broken. It was the start of the weekend for many developers, so the worst time for a major bug to surface. More and more people were complaining over the weekend, and only on Monday morning did the iOS development team suddenly realize they were dealing with an overflow problem. In other words, the devices used by the members couldn’t handle the number of games. The problem was limited to pre-2013 iOS devices, since the live server worked everywhere except on 32-bit iPhones and iPads. The reason was that 2,147,483,648 games had been played on Chess.com, and new games, with a higher game ID, were breaking the 32-bit integer limit of those older iOS devices, which simply didn’t support interpretation for numbers higher than 231. It was a comical result of yet another amazing milestone reached by the site. The same thing had happened a few years before on YouTube when PSY’s smash-hit song “Gangnam Style” exceeded 2,147,483,647 views. Like Google, Chess.com quickly fixed the bug. An update to the iOS app was submitted to the App Store, which Apple accepted within two hours. As the CEO, Allebest explained the slightly embarrassing but funny bug in a blog post: “Likely, the developer didn’t expect two billion games at the time that code was written long ago. But, on the other hand, two billion games!!! The moral of the story, I guess, is: when you have an idea, always plan BIG. That’s why when I retire and open my donut shop, I’m going to have seating for THREE billion customers.” Beating the ICC The 32-bit bug was a funny episode that could only have happened to Chess.com, now the biggest chess company. It became clear that Chess.com, which started as an underdog, had become a giant that was outgrowing the other chess platforms out there—most notably, the long-term market leader for serious players, the Internet Chess Club. How did this happen? For starters, none of the ICC’s cofounders were of the true entrepreneurial type. The original initiator, Daniel Sleator, is a computer scientist from St. Louis; Marty Grund, a stained glass craftsman from Des Moines; and Eric Peterson, a research geophysicist from Dallas. When a buyout by another company failed in the fall of 2001 due to the 9/11 terrorist attack, it was Sleator’s wife who took over the daily running of the company. “We were a ship without a clear captain. It was like a soap opera, like Dallas or Dynasty,” said Ruy Mora, ICC’s Chief Operating Officer. “I think we had at least four or five people who were CEO for a year.” For two decades, the ICC had made a profit, shareholders received their dividends, and little to no new investment was made. Things remained the same for the users, who only got to play from the browser at a very late stage. “As long as our members were playing with a downloadable client like BlitzIn, we felt in control in our fight against cheating,” Mora explained. “The program would register their mouse-handling, whether they would switch to another program, and if they were running an engine. We thought we would lose that control if we [went] web-based.” By the time the ICC realized that playing from the browser was the future, Chess.com already had a head start, a gap that soon became impossible to bridge. The same happened to ChessBase’s Playchess, said Mora: “They started strongly, but it wasn’t clear what they wanted to do with the platform. It was tightly knit into their ChessBase product. They wanted to make it a seamless experience, but ChessBase was also complicated to use. It didn’t help to popularize the platform.” Rensch gave me three reasons why Chess.com ended up beating the ICC. First, Hikaru Nakamura. Second, Chess.com’s superior analysis board—“the analysis tool was critical for coaching online. And when coaches teach their students on your site, they bring them over.” Third, product. “There’s no debate that for the first five or six years, ICC was just a better play experience,” admitted Rensch. “It was faster, it was cleaner, it was less laggy. Browser technology was not up to snuff with app technology.” Players were happy to go through the hassle of downloading the needed software for playing games as long as it was clearly faster. When Mozilla and Google Chrome’s browser technology and Chess.com’s technology improved, everything turned around. “It’s one of those funny things, because to everyone outside the chess world now, it looks like Chess.com winning was a foregone conclusion—but, for us, we were the underdogs, and this was a huge moment,” said Rensch. “ICC, at one point, had laughed us out of the building.” Chess24 and Live Broadcasts That same summer of 2017, Chess.com broke two round numbers: over 20 million members and over 100 full-time employees. Both figures surpassed any other chess company out there—although one had been growing steadily and was starting to look like Chess.com’s new big rival in the market. This was Chess24, owned in majority by the Bolivian businessman Enrique Guzman and co-run by the German grandmaster Jan Gustafsson. Guzman had made millions from cofounding and selling PokerStrategy.com, a successful portal for poker fans to improve their game with lots of articles and video lessons. He was now trying to do the same for chess by providing an educational and international platform that focused on instructional videos for chess fans who wanted to improve their game. Chess24 launched on February 24, 2014, with content and a play server. The new platform instantly became the most popular place for chess fans to watch their favorite players in action because of its shiny new HTML page for live games with a user interface that blew away any other site on the market. The only one that came close was ChessBomb, a Bulgarian website that had existed for about six years, but its interface offered fewer features and was also aesthetically lagging behind. (In November 2018, ChessBomb would be acquired by Chess.com and turned into its events page chess.com/events.) It’s fair to say that ChessBomb and Chess24 have radically changed how chess fans watch chess. For starters, they provided a home on the web to find all major chess events in one place. Chess events are being played around the globe pretty much 24/7, 365 days a year—from major events to local weekenders. Most clubs and tournaments broadcast the games on their websites, but it’s much more convenient for the chess fan to have one site to fall back on. The other important aspect that made watching chess on Chess24 and ChessBomb so popular was that the two sites integrated a running chess engine alongside the chess moves and the board, which suddenly made it much easier for viewers to understand what was going on. During the game, you could now see what would be the best move to play, according to the engine, and what evaluation belonged to it (e.g., “White is clearly better” or “the game is equal”). To show where the players made a mistake (according to the computer), ChessBomb used a system based on colors: an orange move would be dubious, and a red move a blunder. This became part of chess culture. Often, a grandmaster would ask after finishing a game, “Did I play any red moves?” Chess24 displayed a different system to evaluate positions—one which has subsequently become extremely common in chess: the eval bar. This vertical, thermometer-like bar is placed next to the chessboard with its bottom half white and the top half black at the start of a game. If White gains the advantage, the white segment in the bar goes up; conversely, if Black is doing well, more of the bar will be colored black. The eval bar is quite responsive, so when mistakes are made in quick succession, the bar can go up or down suddenly, adding a fantastic visual element to the experience of watching chess. Suddenly, many more fans could better understand what was going on, which is important for a game like chess. You can put anyone in front of a television that shows a soccer game, and in no time, they will understand that the idea is to get the ball into the goal. To enjoy watching chess, you need to know the rules at least and preferably have some experience playing the game yourself. Thanks to the eval bar, chess has become much more accessible to a wider audience. Although the eval bar has improved the viewing experience for many fans, thereby contributing to popularizing chess in general, it should be noted that there is also a downside to this new development: top players tend to be respected much less than in the old days, and wrongly so. Nowadays, complete patzers, “armchair analysts” who have access to computer analysis while watching the game live, know better about the mistakes made than the grandmasters themselves. Too many times, those fans leave derogatory comments in the chat or the comments section of news articles, saying that players are “bad” or “weak” or “terrible” because they made a move that the computer didn’t like. They completely forget what it’s like to be in the playing hall, with all the pressure and the clock ticking, as well as all the other moves in the game that were played on a level they could only dream about. Occasionally I play in a tournament myself, and I am always reminded of how tough chess really is. Another important aspect of the Chess24 platform was the embedded video player showing a tournament’s live video feed. Suddenly, it became extremely convenient to watch chess events. Because that was the thing now: chess tournaments had started to provide video shows with commentary. A pioneer in that area was my old friend Macauley Peterson. Working as a freelance video producer, Peterson’s broadcast production of the 2010 US championship in St. Louis was the first video broadcast of a top-level chess tournament on the internet. Small cameras showed footage from the playing hall; another cam was recording the commentators; and a 2D chessboard for analysis completed the frame—the basic elements of a chess broadcast that are still used today. The director of the London Chess Classic, Malcolm Pein, invited Peterson to do the same for his tournament in December of that year. After that, more and more tournaments wanted in, such as the annual festival in Gibraltar. In the years to come, I got involved in broadcasting myself on behalf of Chess.com, together with my Dutch friend Lennart Ootes. We made shows in Gibraltar, Reykjavík, Wijk aan Zee, Doha, Jerusalem, Skopje, Oslo, and Douglas (Isle of Man). In early 2024, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament demonstrated that online chess broadcasting had come a long way, as more than 50 cameras were placed in the playing hall, some of them as tiny as the one in your smartphone. By the end of 2021, Chess.com had grown about five times as big as in 2016 (partly thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic; see next chapter). The success didn’t go unnoticed, and the company was looking at multiple takeover bids. Some were not very serious, and others failed to materialize, but things were different when the American growth equity firm General Atlantic (GA) approached the company. GA had a good track record of helping companies like Airbnb, Duolingo, Slack, and Uber toward their IPOs, and Allebest liked their community-driven approach. A deal was signed just before the new year, and GA invested heavily in the company. The deal was unprecedented in size and volume for the chess world. It came, however, after a period of multiple other takeovers by Chess.com’s main rival. It’s about time to start talking about Play Magnus. For that, we have to go back to January 2014. Play Magnus and the Takeover A month before Chess24 went live, the Norwegian company Play Magnus launched its eponymous app with a beautifully simple idea: you could play against an AI version of Magnus Carlsen at different ages. A beginner could beat the five-year-old Magnus, but even the real Magnus struggled against the higher ages. The company, partly owned by the Carlsen family, later added a Magnus Trainer app for chess improvement, and an app for kids called Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess. In that same month of January 2014, Carlsen traveled to the US with his manager Espen Agdestein for several sponsor and promotional events. One of these was a dinner party thrown by billionaire investor Yuri Milner, a famous Israeli entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Carlsen played chess against several tech CEOs, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, a few days before he also met Bill Gates. Gaining these Silicon Valley contacts would prove to be of great value down the road. Approximately five years on, Play Magnus changed its game plan when the business chose a growth strategy based on multiple rounds of venture capital investments. In February 2019 Play Magnus acquired Chess24 at a value of $12.6 million. Chess24 had nearly 850,000 registered users at the time, with 600,000 monthly active users coming to the site. Half a year later, Chessable was also acquired, valued at $6.7 million. Between December 2020 and August 2021 PlayMagnus took over several more small chess companies, with Chessable becoming a key asset. This platform alone has changed chess significantly, especially for amateur players like me. Cofounded in November 2015 by the American international master John Bartholomew and the English player David Kramaley, Chessable was launched on February 22, 2016. The unique selling point of Chessable is its innovative approach to chess learning and training through its use of spaced repetition technology. In practice, this comes down to going through lessons, with videos and text, and then repeating the learned moves regularly on the website or in the app. Especially after the takeover by Play Magnus, Chessable started to add to its library the best content available, sourced from famous instructional books and new material from top-notch authors. Because these included some of the best grandmasters in the world, the material was valuable for both amateurs and strong players. When the American chess prodigy Abhimanyu Mishra became the world’s youngest grandmaster at age 12 in July 2021, it was no secret that he was an avid Chessable user. Eight months after Chess.com’s deal with General Atlantic, on August 24, 2022, a press release shocked the chess world: “Chess.com Makes Offer to Play Magnus Group.” Wait, what? Among many smaller commercial entities, there were two absolute kings in the chess world: Chess.com and Play Magnus. One king was about to eat the other to become the absolute, sovereign ruler. It was the chess equivalent of Microsoft merging with Apple. On December 16, 2022, the deal was closed. The chess world reacted with mixed feelings: some feared that Chess.com’s apparent monopoly was not a good thing, while others noted the benefits of merging two separate communities of online chess players. An important benefit for the fans was that Magnus Carlsen had signed on as a Chess.com ambassador. This meant he would likely compete even more in online events as he could now return to playing on Chess.com, as he had done before his affiliation with former rival Chess24 in 2019. Two days later, on December 18, 2022, Carlsen contested the 2022 Speed Chess Championship Final, where he lost to Hikaru Nakamura in a thrilling, down-to-the-wire battle watched by more than 200,000 viewers. In spring 2024, Chess.com had a total of 714 employees and 167 million registered users (of which 40 million were monthly active users), making it the ninth largest “country” in the world by population, just below Bangladesh and just above Russia. Its value is currently estimated to be over a billion dollars. If, as we’ll see in the next chapter, Levy Rozman is the personification of the chess revolution, Chess.com is the driving force behind it, the organization perhaps most responsible for accelerating the old board game’s popularity to new heights in the modern era.",

      "content": "Chapter 10The Streaming Revolution “Ladies and gentlemen, this video is being recorded on 24 January 2023, and the game of chess has literally never been more popular than it is right now. It is so popular, in fact, that it is crashing Chess.com servers on a daily basis.” —Levy Rozman, YouTube, January 2023 On July 14, 2017, one of America’s top grandmasters, Hikaru Nakamura, tried out his first-ever stream on Twitch. It attracted 900 viewers, a large amount for a first stream, but Nakamura wasn’t convinced. He streamed only 11 more times in 2017 and another 11 times the next year, for a few hundred concurrent viewers at most. “It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it, but, first of all, there was no financial gain from it, and, secondly, the community was extremely small,” he told me. But on one October evening in 2018 his perspective changed. Everything changed. Nakamura was playing in a tournament in Douglas, Isle of Man. Chess.com’s Danny Rensch was there too, assisting with the Chess.com live broadcast. He took Nakamura out for dinner to a fish restaurant with Hikaru’s stepfather Sunil Weeramantry, (now ex-) girlfriend Maria De Rosa, and second, Kris Littlejohn. “During that meal, Danny effectively told me that he felt there was real potential for live streaming to become something much bigger for chess,” said Nakamura. “It wasn’t so much that he was trying to tell me that it would overtake my chess career, and I’d make tons of money, but something where he felt there were a lot of fans that were untapped potential.” One of the last things Rensch said to Nakamura at that fateful dinner was, “The chess category on Twitch needs a Ninja.” Nakamura asked, “Who’s Ninja?” Rensch explained to him that Ninja was the face of the esport Fortnite, and what made him special was that he was also one of the best players in the world: “Chess needs a Ninja, and you can be him.” Nakamura chose to give it one more try. It was a decision that would prove life-changing for him and would impact the future of online chess. The Pandemic, Carlsen’s Tournaments, PogChamps In March 2020, Chess.com had 34 million members, up from 27 million members a year earlier. The site was growing by just over half a million monthly registrations. If we look at the whole period since May 2007, the growth was 20–50 percent yearly. But now, the numbers started to look a bit different for the biggest chess platform. As the global COVID-19 lockdowns started, everyone had to stay inside, people needed to work from home, and health workers worked overtime. It was a worldwide health and economic disaster and, frankly, a scary time. Certain companies, however, were on the lucky side of things. Amazon and Netflix come to mind, but Chess.com is also among them. Besides watching more streaming TV, people turned to the internet for distraction. Many decided to pick up chess. “You could track it by country,” said CEO Erik Allebest when talking to the New York Times in 2022. “India locked down, registrations from India went through the roof. Italy locked down, registrations went through the roof.” By the end of March 2020, Chess.com was looking at a projected growth for the next three months that wasn’t supposed to happen in the next ten years. The general consensus was that such a craze would never happen again, but we were wrong. It was only the first wave. In that single month of March 2020 the playing server crashed several times. In two weeks, the number of people playing games at the same time doubled from about 40,000 to 80,000. The live server developers regularly noticed spikes in server activity that led to instability, but soon managed to fix it. Over-the-board chess events were canceled worldwide due to the pandemic. The prestigious Candidates Tournament in Yekaterinburg, Russia, was halted halfway and would resume only a year later. Just about the only over-the-board chess you could witness occurred when the chess hustlers, now wearing facemasks, returned to J. Hood Wright Park in Washington Heights in Manhattan in April 2020—just as they did to Manhattan’s Washington Square Park, London’s Holland Park, or Paris’s Jardin du Luxembourg. No matter what disaster strikes the planet, people want to play chess. And that includes Magnus Carlsen. In that same month of April 2020, just into the first of the COVID-19 lockdowns, Carlsen took the initiative to create an online tournament with seven of his biggest rivals (and an impressive $250,000 prize fund) called the Magnus Carlsen Invitational. This event, the richest online chess tournament thus far that could be watched online on Chess24 (and on Norwegian television), would change top-level chess significantly. Its name-giver, Carlsen, commented: “Chess is unique in the sports world as the moves are the same whether played on a wooden board or a computer screen. This is a historic moment for chess, and given that it’s possible to continue top professional play in an online environment, we have not only the opportunity but the responsibility to players and fans around the world who need a distraction when no other live, competitive sport is being played.” Carlsen’s initiative was a great success. Fittingly, this first of many online top tournaments to come saw Carlsen clashing with and beating Hikaru Nakamura in the final as both played from their homes. As it ended, commentator/grandmaster Jan Gustafsson thanked the viewers for watching, before adding, “Not that you guys have any other choices. Let’s face it, there’s no other sports going on.” Carlsen was nothing less than a visionary here. Almost right after his event was over, a big online team event, the Online Nations Cup, was co-organized by Chess.com and FIDE. It was broadcast in 12 languages and exceeded the viewership of traditional tournaments. That is not even considering the numbers in China, where China Sport & Leisure TV and CCTV channels peaked at over 900,000 concurrent viewers during the tournament’s final between Team USA and Team China. As several more online tournaments followed, alongside Chess.com’s weekly Titled Tuesday events, the calendar was suddenly filling up nicely again for many of the world’s best players. Meanwhile, chess fans had something to enjoy while stuck at home. Things got even better when Carlsen announced bigger plans in May: the launch of the Magnus Carlsen Tour, consisting of four online super tournaments culminating in a Grand Final in August, for a $1 million prize fund. Mainstream media started to notice. “Chess Thrives Online Despite Pandemic,” headlined the New York Times, while the Wall Street Journal proclaimed, “Chess Is the New King of the Pandemic.” The newspaper noted that aside from playing chess, watching chess had become a much more popular pastime as well: “Aficionados tuned in just to watch—and not even play—more than ten million games in April, a jump of 97 percent from February.” Talking to Forbes, the American grandmaster and popular commentator Maurice Ashley explained how special this was when just about every other sport in the world was halted: “The good news for chess is at least chess can actually do it. Major sports can’t. LeBron (James) can’t play against Steph Curry, or the Lakers can’t play against the Bucks with everybody in their living room. In chess, the best of the best can play each other without missing a beat.” In the fall of 2020, Play Magnus announced a second string of tournaments for the new year. This time it was called the Champions Chess Tour, which ran from November to September for a $1.5 million prize fund and included ten tournaments. Carlsen himself won and would repeat that in 2022, when Chess.com held its own series, the Chess.com Global Championship, for a $1 million prize fund. The Filipino-American top grandmaster Wesley So won that one but lost to Carlsen in the 2023 Tour final. I spoke to So, then ranked tenth in the world, in September 2023 during a tournament in Amsterdam. He and his adoptive mother, Lotis Key, gave me a fascinating perspective on what the legacy of the pandemic meant for top players. “Before 2020, I used to play one tournament a month, and now it’s at least two,” said So. “The schedule is like a jigsaw puzzle,” added Key. The thing is: many lucrative online tournaments continue to be organized alongside the traditional over-the-board tournaments that resurfaced after the COVID restrictions were removed. And even some new physical events have appeared. Not only has the general interest in chess exploded, but so have the opportunities for top players to play in money tournaments. Looking at what So played in the full year of 2023, on- and offline, I counted 35 tournaments, meaning almost three tournaments a month. So told me his earnings compared to pre-pandemic had doubled toward roughly $700,000 a year, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s more now. One chess tournament that emerged during the pandemic wasn’t suitable for So—or his grandmaster colleagues—but stood out nonetheless: PogChamps. First held in June 2020, it was an event the chess world had never seen before. Having been trained by experts like Hikaru Nakamura, Daniel Naroditsky, and Alexandra Botez, 16 of Twitch’s most followed esports streamers competed for their share of $50,000 in prizes. Among the participants were Boxbox (Albert Sun Zheng, a League of Legends player), Nate Hill (a Fortnite player) and Yassuo (Mohammad Abdalrhman, also League of Legends). It was the first time that amateur players, often close to absolute beginners, were playing a tournament that Chess.com broadcast live on Twitch. This aspect of PogChamps also raised eyebrows: the level of play was a fair bit lower than what the average fan was used to when watching a chess broadcast. A schism was visible in the chess world. On one side, you had serious players who were quite critical of this new phenomenon. Having invested years or even decades into the game, educated with the knowledge of the great masters from the past—for whom the Lucena position or the Sveshnikov Sicilian was standard knowledge—these strong amateurs deemed the likes of PogChamps a superficial form of entertainment. Wasn’t our beautiful ancient game, with its numerous expressions of a deeper meaning in art, literature and science, being turned into fast food here? One chess journalist compared the event to the British reality TV series I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, which he described as “the emblematic format of trash TV,” and claimed that letting beginners play for an audience was “something one should never do.” The Russian top grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi was initially critical as well, tweeting that the show was “popcorn stuff” that was “replacing and displacing any real chess content”—a prospect he found “just terrifying.” Later, he toned it down by saying, “I’m obviously happy more and more people are getting involved [in] chess.” And, indeed, those serious chess fans didn’t need to watch it, did they? As long as PogChamps wasn’t replacing any of the traditional tournaments but added something for a new audience, what was wrong with it? Sure, but Chess.com was advertising the event as loudly as any serious tournament. All broadcasts were placed on the home page; chess fans couldn’t miss or avoid it, even if you wanted to. The naysayers saw it as a type of landscape pollution, arguing that it was similar to putting a modern, ugly concrete building next to a thirteenth-century temple. A Reddit member signaled another potential PogChamps issue: the prize money. This person wrote, “I’ve had some time to think about the Twitch chess boom and PogChamps tournament specifically. I think it’s bizarre that a handful of people, who are already well off in their own field, are making quite a bit of money playing chess in a tournament sponsored by the largest chess company in the world, making literally thousands and thousands of dollars to win games in five moves, while many chess professionals struggle to make a living.” Others welcomed this remarkable new event, arguing it was fun to watch. Besides, it did bring in a lot of new fans to the game of chess—fans who were watching these Twitch celebrities playing esports like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, or Hearthstone, and were truly enjoying that their heroes were now trying their luck in the royal game. After the first edition of PogChamps, Chess.com announced that 140,000 new chess fans started following their Twitch channel, which had a record 85,000 concurrent viewers at one point. It says a lot that even three years later, Chess.com’s most-watched video on YouTube, with over 18 million views, is “xQc Gets Check-mated by MoistCr1tikal in 6 Moves!” from that first PogChamps. (The channel’s second most-watched video, about a young Russian grandmaster beating Magnus Carlsen in an over-the-board tournament, has 7.8 million views.) David Llada, FIDE’s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at the time, was among the early fans of PogChamps, and said, “Is it silly? Yes! Are we making a show out of absolute beginners blundering pieces? Yes! So what?” Chess.com’s Vice President of Esports, Michael Brancato, told me, “The whole internet was talking about it because it was a novel, fun thing. Everyone plays chess, or knows about chess, but it was the first time that it had any kind of mainstream exposure. All the big people are playing, and they’re all bad at it, and it’s funny because everyone is bad at chess. It was a very relatable thing for a lot of people.” At the time of writing, PogChamps has been held five times. The second edition took place in the fall of 2020. In the third edition, held in early 2021 for an increased prize fund of $100,000, even bigger celebrities participated. YouTuber MrBeast, rapper Logic, actor Rainn Wilson, and poker player Daniel Negreanu helped attract over 375,000 concurrent viewers. PogChamps 4 was officially sponsored by cryptocurrency marketplace Coinbase, whose $100,000 prize pool was matched by an additional $100,000 from Chess.com for charity. PogChamps 5 was held in the summer of 2023 in partnership with Ludwig, a popular online content creator who had attracted more than 1.3 billion views to his channels. For the first time, the tournament ended with a live finals event in Los Angeles. It is worth noting that PogChamps has helped some amateur-level streamers to become quite decent chess players in a short time. In her 2022 book Chess Queens, Jennifer Shahade offered the example of PogChamps 2 winner Rumay Wang, known online as Hafu, a Hearthstone champion and streamer with over one million Twitch followers: “Hafu took the competition so seriously, she played hundreds of games and solved thousands of puzzles on an anonymous burner account. After her win she said, ‘I think if you added everyone’s practice it still would be less than what I played. It’s sickening.’ ” Especially impressive was Tyler1’s rapid progress after participating in PogChamps 5. The League of Legends streamer broke a 1500 rating in just three months. The Queen’s Gambit and the Three Waves When discussing chess’s big surge in popularity in 2020, we usually point to the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, while perhaps PogChamps deserves a place in the same sentence. What do the numbers say? Let’s look at two periods: before The Queen’s Gambit and after. On October 22, 2020, a day before The Queen’s Gambit was launched, Chess.com had 44 million members. Since March of that year, the figure had grown by 12 million in less than eight months, an average pace of about 1.3 million a month. This “pandemic growth” was almost three times as fast as before COVID. On March 23, 2021, when Beth Harmon had spent five months inspiring people to pick up a chess set, Chess.com boasted 61 million members, an increase of 17 million, or 3.4 million a month. This growth was more than six times faster than before the pandemic. By June 2021 the effect of The Queen’s Gambit was fading. While global lockdowns were lifted Chess.com continued to grow, adding roughly 1.7 million members per month until the end of the summer of 2022. If we view the first months of the pandemic as the first wave, The Queen’s Gambit was the second, leading to the biggest surge in chess popularity since Fischer–Spassky in 1972. By then we had seen the peak of the chess mania, right? Wrong. A completely unexpected third wave started in December 2022—a month that broke the previous record of January 2021 for new registrations. As 4.6 million new followers joined in that single month, the site broke the magic barrier of 100 million registered members, only 14 months after reaching 50 million. (Ten months later, in October 2023, the site would reach 150 million.) January and February 2023 smashed that single-month record, with 8.9 million new registrations for both. After that, things started slowing down again, but March (7.5 million) and April (5.7 million) were still higher than any month during the Queen’s Gambit period. “Honestly, the first two weeks, in late November 2022, I didn’t think it was legitimate traffic,” said Chess.com Systems Architect Igor Grinchenko. “I thought it was malicious; it had to be. Traffic went up 10 percent every day, and the same for incoming web requests, bandwidth, load on the server, and everything else. I said, ‘Guys, someone is attacking us.’ Because I know our flows, I know our ups and downs, off-peaks and on-peaks, and I can trace them. There is also seasonality and stuff. Then I started looking at deeper metrics that cannot be affected by malicious traffic—let’s say the number of games played, the number of users online. And then I realized: this is legitimate. And we have to do something about it.” At its peak, Chess.com was accommodating over ten million active users on a single day. That spiked on January 20, 2023, when traffic on Chess.com had nearly doubled since the beginning of December 2022. On February 3, a record 403,000 members joined in 24 hours, over 200,000 more than at the peak of The Queen’s Gambit. Over a billion games were played for the first time in a month. A stunning 42.4 million games were played on a single day on March 2, 2023 (including games against bots). Meanwhile, the Chess.com app briefly occupied #1 in many countries’ Top Free Games section of the iOS app store. The boom was not just happening online. In April 2023, the Washington Post ran a story headlined “Teachers Nationwide are Flummoxed By Students’ New Chess Obsession.” A month later, CBS Bay Area wrote that chess was “sweeping classrooms across the country.” It wasn’t limited to the US either: the Dutch newspaper Het Parool ran a similar story noting that children were suddenly playing chess fanatically in school cafeterias and that Amsterdam chess clubs were facing waiting lists for teenage members. The American entertainment website Polygon, which focuses on video games and popular culture, noted that the chess mania was happening suddenly: “Schools that don’t have chess clubs are rushing to start them. Teachers are confused but pleased to see a wholesome new hobby. Administrators are struggling with how chess is disrupting classrooms at times, and are blaming it for attention issues and drama in classrooms and hallways. Can you ban chess? Some schools have reportedly had to.” The sudden rise in popularity, particularly among teens, was reflected by Chess.com’s age metrics. The site experienced the biggest growth from players aged between 13 and 17 years old: 549,000 of them visited Chess.com in January and February 2023, more than twice as many as in the two months prior. The second-fastest-growing age group in the same period was 18-to-24-year-olds. Chess was booming, and the Chess.com servers were struggling. More often than not, members were getting served a disappointing 503 error when visiting the site: database overload. “It’s hard to explain how painful it was for me as CEO,” Allebest said. “One of our developers would always talk about underwater stones, meaning you can’t see the problems until it’s too late.… There was a moment when somebody crashed our server because they pasted the entire script of the Bee Movie in the chat window of a game. When it came into the server and was sent back to everybody watching this particular game, it crashed the whole site because of too much data. We didn’t think someone was going to paste in that much text. You know, things like that, over and over and over again.” Chess.com purchased $2 million of new hardware—web servers, database servers, a new live chess server, load balancers, and additional service machines. After a few weeks of setting up, separating database tables, sharding databases (a way to spread the load), and other ways of optimizing, things were under control again. A graph of Chess.com’s membership growth between September 2016 and December 2023 clearly shows the three waves of popularity. The first two waves of popularity in 2020 were easy to explain: the pandemic (with PogChamps) and The Queen’s Gambit. But where did that third, and by far biggest wave, come from? Well, in this case, it was a combination of multiple individual events happening in a short period that all helped boost the popularity of chess to stratospheric heights. Some happened in late 2022 and have already been mentioned in this book, such as the Carlsen–Niemann affair, the Instagram picture with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and the Chessboxing event. And then, in January 2023, a furry, meowing phenomenon contributed even more. When Chess.com launched, on May 18, 2007, the only possibility to play chess on the site had been against the computer. Many years later, that remains one of the most popular activities for its members, partly because of some added fun elements. After Chess.com acquired one of the world’s strongest chess engines, Komodo, in May 2018, the company started using it to create computer “characters” to play against. Among those fun bots you could challenge were the “holiday bots” (Santa, Holly, Dash, Eve, and Powder), the “zombie bots” (Zombaru, Zombiachtchi, Zombiano, and Zombanny), and the “fake billionaire bots” (Gill Bates, Melon Husk, Zark Muckerberg, Biff Jezos, and Barron Wuffet). On January 1, 2023, new bots were introduced, and one of them instantly became the biggest star in chess (well, for a few weeks at least). That was Mittens, the strongest among five cat bots—the others were Scaredy Cat, Angry Cat, Mr. Grumpers, and Catspurrov. Right from the start, Mittens—an avatar of a big-eyed, kind of sad-looking kitten boasting a silly rating of just one point—took all the attention, as streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Levy Rozman, and the Botez sisters started playing against it. Mittens’s viral fame didn’t just come from its prowess on the chessboard, where it revealed itself as a ruthless killer, but also from the nasty, sadistic comments it provided during games: “I am become Mittens, the destroyer of kings. I exist at this chess board through all times and realities … hehehe. Meow.” According to a story in the Independent, Chess.com users described Mittens as a “chess nightmare,” “a psycho,” and a “terrible, terrible cat.” Chess.com’s famed catbot Mittens, a cuddly pet turned ruthless killer on the chessboard. It was Will Whalen, a student at Hamilton College (majoring in world politics) and a part-time contributor to Chess.com’s social media team, who came up with the idea. In an interview in April 2023 he said, “Mittens was originally a pitched joke that ended up getting very out of hand.” Whalen noted that his colleague Sean Becker, who was leading the bots project, wrote Mittens’s interactions with help from other content team members. They ensured that the cat would always start very calm and cuddly but then would “devolve into madness,” even quoting Nietzsche. Not your everyday cat-on-the-internet experience. The Rise of the Streamers The decade between 2004 and 2014 saw many battles in the technology industry. There was the social media arms race with MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, but also the vertical distribution arms race: who would win the live streaming battle? While YouTube initially remained limited to video on demand, several live-streaming video websites started popping up: Ustream (acquired by IBM in 2016), Livestream.com (acquired by Vimeo in 2017), and Justin.tv, all launched in 2007. The latter won the battle with its spin-off Twitch, which started in 2011 and was dedicated to gaming. These were the years when the video gaming industry started to blow up with games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Dota. In August 2014, when Twitch had gathered over 50 million users, it was acquired by Amazon for $970 million. Around 2013, Rensch got in touch with Twitch’s Director of Creator Development at the time, Markus “djWHEAT” Graham, who had a long history of providing commentary at video game tournaments since the late 1990s. More importantly, Graham saw the potential for chess. Previously, Chess.com had been using Livestream.com, but Twitch had an altogether different vibe. “Rather than just viewing these broadcasting tools as an opportunity to serve the community, we actually could grow the community because we were reaching the gaming audience, which was a larger community than ours,” said Rensch. Rensch himself had had plenty of experience as a streamer before chess streaming became a thing. One of the first examples of something resembling chess streaming occurred when Rensch created his first weekly “Bullet Brawl” video in 2012, which consisted of a chessboard, the Chess.com logo, and Rensch’s voice. It was a concept that originated from Chess.com’s “Live Sessions” that had existed for three years, but this time, it was all about fun. As Rensch was playing bullet, he provided humorous commentary. In that first video, he noted, “The whole idea of a Bullet Brawl Thursday is we’re going to play two to three bullet games and focus more on the excitement of the game than on the analysis afterward and whether it was a perfect thing. The perfection of it is that it’s flawed.” The idea of making jokes and talking crap while playing a game of chess was born. “What Hikaru and Levy and the others are doing right now is basically Bullet Brawls,” said Rensch. “Despite the name, the Live Sessions were actually pre-recorded. Bullet Brawls was the first time we did it for a live audience, with chat running. And, for me, this was probably the first product on the perfect intersection of what chess was always missing. Over-the-board chess was always going to be a quiet, serious game. You can’t talk; it would distract your opponent. But online streaming, with your own conscious thoughts, was born for this, changing the way people perceived chess. It was like, ‘Oh, I’m inside the head of a titled player!’ ” Around the same time, the first chess-focused channels appeared on Twitch: Gerard Bailleau’s ChessNetwork, Tryfon Gavriel’s Kingscrusher, and, most prominently, Chessbrah, the account run by the Canadian players Eric Hansen (the grandmaster we met in Chapter 7 who first discussed the anal beads theory during a stream) and master Aman Hambleton, who would become a grandmaster a few years later. Both were born in 1992. The Chessbrahs were, and still are, a group of friends living in the same house in Toronto, Canada, who basically just love to hang out and play chess online—something they managed to turn into a business before anyone else. In the spring of 2024, Chessbrah had 325,000 followers on Twitch, 332,000 subscribers on YouTube, and another 9,470 followers on Kick, a Twitch rival platform that launched in 2022 and where the Chessbrahs started an account in June 2023. They had several part-time editors and one full-time operations manager running the merch store and channels. “I started streaming because [I] just wanted to show my screen to friends,” Hansen told me. “There wasn’t share screen back then on MSN Messenger, and Skype was a bit annoying and too formal anyway.” He and his friends were already playing a lot of blitz and bullet chess on different chess platforms, and streaming made it easier to follow and chat with each other. “It was just a community feel, to stay in touch.” Like many of the streaming video pioneers, Hansen started somewhere in 2010 on Livestream.com before moving to Justin.tv and then Twitch. “There wasn’t yet a chess community there, but I created an account because I was into video computer games, and this way, I could watch Starcraft, Age of Vampires, the strategy games, the shooter games. But sometimes we would stream our-selves, playing casual chess and just chatting.” In the fall of 2014, Hansen decided to take streaming more seriously. He bought a desktop computer and two screens, creating a proper setup. He took up the name “Chessbrah,” which he was already using as an online alias, and started streaming in 2015. He was averaging 300 viewers six months later. He streamed over eight hours daily, 60 to 70 hours weekly. “I was really grinding,” he said. “I already played so much bullet and blitz, I was basically addicted. But I was good at it too. So I thought, ‘Why not share that perspective?’ ” Chapter 8 showed that chess addiction is a thing, particularly for online chess. It’s interesting to note that, in the modern era, Hansen and others have shown that streaming can be an outlet, a way of dealing with it, and even a way to monetize it: you can turn your love for chess into a business. Making money from streaming chess would become even easier thanks to cooperation between Twitch and Chess.com a few years later. Chess.com was providing fun live sessions and, on top of that, there were broadcasts of over-the-board events (which I co-produced), Titled Tuesdays, Death Matches, and other events with a growing audience. And then, in 2016, the site organized its biggest event to date: the GM Blitz Battle Championship, a knockout event with only world-class grandmasters. It resulted in a much-anticipated final between Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, won by Carlsen. With a peak concurrent viewership of 36,000, Chess.com’s show was the third most-watched Twitch broadcast that year, behind Hearthstone and Call of Duty, but ahead of all the other major esports. “I always joke that that’s the event where Danny took chess out of the closet,” said Rensch. “Chess came out of the closet on that event because I commented and produced that show by myself from a closet we had made in our studio in Payson, Arizona.” Chess.com launched the PRO Chess League in January 2017, a global team championship with all the games played on the site and live broadcasts on twitch.tv/chess. It was an excellent kickstarter for the new Twitch channel, as some of the best grand-masters were playing, including Nakamura and Carlsen. The Twitch leadership took notice and started new talks with Chess.com. Rensch: “I spoke with Nick Allen, their VP of Esports, who reported directly to Mike Aragon, the Chief Content Officer, who reported to Emmett Shear, the CEO. They were all, like: ‘You guys are crushing it!’ ” Everyone was on the same page: chess had massive potential while hardly anyone was making content typical of Twitch—live, more spontaneous, and less serious. The overwhelming majority of chess video content was either pre-recorded educational material or live broadcasts of top events with commentators targeting club-level players. There was no real chess ecosystem for streaming fun stuff at the time. And so, in November 2017, Chess.com closed a two-year deal with Twitch, which would provide the site a monthly fee intended for orchestrating and fostering the growing chess community. Twitch was now a sponsor for Chess.com’s entire lineup of chess events and was going to help grow the global brand of chess as an online spectator sport. The Chess.com–Twitch arrangement fared better than anyone’s wildest expectations. “Chess has seen some of the most substantial growth in the same period of time than any other esport in the world,” Twitch’s VP of Global Esports, Justin Dellario, told NBC News in February 2020. The Chessbrah channel was one of the earliest to join Chess.com’s Partner Streamers Program, and they did the early heavy lifting for Twitch’s chess category. “They were the backbone, the ones that carried chess through back then,” said Rensch. Soon, streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Alexandra Botez, and Levy Rozman followed the Chessbrahs, among many others. The program’s benefits included accelerated partnership status to streamers and being embedded on Chess.com’s integrated broadcast page www.chess.com/tv for more exposure. The only thing the streamers needed to do was play on Chess.com and not elsewhere, and have Chess.com’s green pawn visible somewhere in the video. “I gotta say, Danny was really good at picking people,” said Chess.com’s esports expert Michael Brancato. “He pretty much knew about Alexandra and Hikaru and encouraged them to stream.” At the time, Chess.com was paying these streamers, and Rensch told them: “We think you can make this much money in the future, so keep up with this.” As noted, during the early days of the pandemic, streaming became an alternative way for chess professionals to earn money as the demand for chess content suddenly increased. Between March and August of 2020, fans watched 41.2 million hours of chess on Twitch, four times as many hours as in the previous six months, according to the analytics website SullyGnome. Even a top grandmaster like Peter Svidler, stuck in his home in St. Petersburg, started broadcasting his chess on Twitch. “Streaming during the pandemic was what kept me sane,” he told me. “I would do three or four streams a week, not very long. But it was just self-care. I earned some money over 2021, which would pay for utility bills, which is good, but I wasn’t doing it for the money. I was doing it because, like many other people, I was going a bit crazy. It was incredibly therapeutic in my case. And I’ve spoken to many people who said exactly the same.” Once Twitch got hacked in October 2021, it also became public knowledge that the biggest chess streamers were making decent money, when details of creator payouts were posted on Reddit. It was suddenly out in the open that, from August 2019 until October 2021, Nakamura earned $773,831.12, the Chessbrahs $767,384.56, Levy Rozman $424,505.01, and the Botez sisters $416,813.43. These earnings did not include revenue from merch, sponsorships, or other channels such as YouTube. “Large creators are incredibly well compensated,” Chess.com’s Influencer Relations Manager Christopher Schroth told me in late 2023. “It’s not uncommon to hear creators earning beyond five, six figures a month, if not more.” Right from the start, in early 2017, Brancato and Rensch worked closely together and created a lot of new events and broadcasts. Aside from the PRO Chess League, there was the Speed Chess Championship (the successor of the Blitz Battle Championship), the Junior Speed Chess Championship for young talents, the Women’s Speed Chess Championship, Arena Kings, and more. On top of that, many new chess streamers started to create channels on Twitch, but something was still missing. What this young community of chess streamers needed was somebody carrying the torch. That person became Hikaru Nakamura. From Top GM to the Ninja of Chess—and Back Again Hikaru Nakamura was born in 1987 in Japan to an American mother and a Japanese father. The family moved to White Plains, New York, when he was two. A year later, his parents divorced. He started playing chess at the age of seven and, with his brother, was coached by his Sri Lankan stepfather, FIDE Master and chess author Sunil Weeramantry. Nakamura was a true chess prodigy. In 2003, at the age of 15 years and 79 days, he became the youngest American to earn the grandmaster title, three months sooner than Bobby Fischer had. He has won the US championship five times, taken first prize at the prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Grand Chess Tour, and won an Olympic gold medal. All this was before he decided to take up streaming on that October evening in 2018 in a fish restaurant on the Isle of Man. “It is very important to note that my result in that tournament in the Isle of Man also played a massive role in terms of me starting to stream,” Nakamura told me. “I was actually doing quite well, but then, in the eighth round, I lost this very heartbreaking game. I was not really in a great frame of mind, I was going from tournament to tournament, and I felt a little bit aimless—I think, in large part, because I lost that game. That was one of the biggest things that spurred me to start trying out streaming.” This time around, it was the perfect moment. Only a few weeks later, the world championship between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana took place in London, and Nakamura’s coverage attracted thousands of viewers daily. During that match, Chess.com launched its popular new product Puzzle Rush, and Nakamura embraced it. “He became obsessed with it. He was breaking records, and before you knew it, chess on Twitch would never be the same,” said Rensch. The following year, 2019, was the first that Nakamura became more of a streamer than a chess player, and it was not an easy year. “I do have to give myself a lot of credit because there are many people who were very pessimistic about it,” he told me. His results at the board got worse, and there were a lot of naysayers. Some of my own friends couldn’t understand why, as they put it, he “wasn’t trying to become world champion any more.” Responding to his critics, Nakamura said, “They just thought it was fairly stupid to be doing this streaming in the first place, and because of that, I kept sticking with it.” After bad results at tournaments in India and Germany, he took a five-month break from playing chess, something he hadn’t done for at least a decade. The plan was to take it up again with the US championship in April 2020, but he never reached that point because of the pandemic. Hikaru Nakamura in a recording studio in St. Louis, August 2021. In the buildup to the first PogChamps, Nakamura did a few streams with the Canadian streamer xQc (real name: Félix Lengyel). The former professional Overwatch player is one of several esports streamers who like chess, and the broadcasts where Nakamura taught him the basics were extremely popular. “I think that was the first time I crossed 10,000 viewers on a live stream,” said Nakamura. “That was sort of the moment I realized it was actually a very big deal, that it was something very serious and in a different kind of way.” Then PogChamps happened. Nakamura was one of the commentators, and his viewership increased even more. At some point, he streamed for 70 days in a row, essentially without a break, grinding like the Chessbrahs. In August of 2020 his channel surpassed the 500,000-follower mark. By that point, he was by far the biggest chess streamer. At the end of that month, he signed with TSM, making him the first professional chess player to sign with an esports organization. (He would represent TSM until June 2022, when he signed with Misfits Gaming.) “You just ride that wave,” he told me. “And afterward I kind of realized that I was quite good at it.” I guessed that it had something to do with his ICC past, and Nakamura agreed: “There were many times when I would actually kibitz with people—not the other player, but with the people who were watching the games while I was playing—and that was something that nobody at the time was doing. In fact, I think even now, nobody does that. When I look back, I think that played a very pivotal role in terms of where I am today. It’s a little bit different, obviously, communicating your thoughts verbally versus in written form, but, for me, I think that having that whole process where I was communicating in some form during the games was like destiny—that I ended up doing what I’m doing now.” Streaming chess does indeed seem to be the perfect way of communicating for Nakamura, who doesn’t always come across as a great communicator away from the computer. The American top grandmaster is generally considered a brilliant player who also has his share of haters. Starting from his early days on the ICC, where he was super-strong at an early age, many disliked him for being caustic, as he sometimes left derogatory comments after suffering occasional losses. Nakamura admitted this to me, saying it was his way of finding motivation: “Back then, I hated losing. Not that I don’t still hate losing, but I did not accept losing. I always felt my loss was a horrible thing. So, you know, I would get very angry over losing games online. And, in some cases, I would actually get mad at opponents and things like that. And so, for me, the motivation was, like, getting really angry, using sort of the unhappiness, the anger, all those different things. And so I didn’t necessarily have a lot of fans wanting to talk to me the same way; in fact, a lot of people disliked me back then.” It is remarkable that such a fantastic chess player turned out to be a natural behind the screen and the microphone as well. Brandon Benton, a physics researcher at Cornell University, put it as follows when speaking to the New York Times in September 2020: “He draws people because he’s so good, but also, there are other top players on Twitch that are not as engaging as he is, not as funny, not as in tune with the sort of Twitch culture.” Brenton called Nakamura a “down-to-earth memer and jokester.” Not many—certainly not the naysayers—expected what happened next with Nakamura’s over-the-board career, in 2019. While he was on his way to becoming the best-paid grandmaster in the world through Twitch, easily surpassing Carlsen’s career earnings, Nakamura also started to play some of his best chess in years. Through the FIDE Grand Prix, he qualified for the 2022 Candidates Tournament, and then he won the 2022 Fischer Random World Championship. In 2023 he came first at the super-strong Norway Chess tournament (climbing back to second place in the world rankings), and thanks to another excellent second place in the FIDE Grand Swiss in October, he qualified for the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, his second in a row. It was a growing list of impressive achievements for any chess player—but an out-of-this-world performance for a streamer. How did he do that? “There’s a couple of reasons,” he told me. “First of all, the financial strain of playing chess professionally. You’re always thinking about supporting people: your family and your partner. And I think that definitely played a huge role in terms of my performance. There were many situations where I would just make quick boring draws rather than try to fight. Rather than trying to win, rather than trying to enjoy the game. Now, I don’t have the financial worries or concerns, which plays a huge role.” Not unimportant was that, since October 2020, Nakamura had been with the Iranian American chess player Atousa Pourkashiyan, and in the summer of 2023 they got married: “It’s also about having the right people in your life. I’m very fortunate that I have someone who is extremely supportive, who’s nothing but positive and very helpful.” In October 2022, while talking to The Guardian, the experienced chess commentator and English grandmaster Daniel King explained Nakamura’s success: “Nakamura was noted for being fantastically strong at bullet chess long before it was sort of hip to play online, and he has turned into the perfect chess streamer, making millions. He’s gobby. He’s opinionated. He doesn’t care about upsetting people. He’s basically just hacked an online algorithm that means you’re going to be successful.” By early 2024 Nakamura had 1.9 million followers on Twitch. Since March of that year, his main channel has been on Kick. He has 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube and 551,000 followers on X. All the “GMHikaru” channels combined are run by a team of six or seven people. Nakamura told me that he is making about four to five times as much money as when he was still a professional chess player. In 2020 and 2021 alone he earned more than during his entire playing career. It’s an incredible story. That player who once slept on my couch and started playing on the ICC right after waking up is indeed nothing less than the Ninja of chess. The Biggest Chess YouTuber of All Born in 1995 in Brooklyn, New York, Levy Rozman is eight years younger than Nakamura. He was among the earliest Twitch streamers, and even helped Nakamura in the early days, providing commentary on the GMHikaru channel when Nakamura was playing an over-the-board tournament. Rozman, however, is most famous for running the biggest chess channel on YouTube. He started playing chess when he was six years old. “I was a very hyper child, and my parents needed to put me in after-school, like, after 3 p.m.,” Rozman told me. “They wanted to put me into art class or chess, but chess was $5 more expensive than art, and my dad said, ‘He is too hyper for chess; he’s gonna get kicked out of chess class.’ But it turned out I really liked chess, for some reason, and I stuck to it like a magnet. I never went to art class because I wasn’t very good, and I found chess so fascinating, and I became obsessed with it.” Rozman started as a scholastic chess coach in 2014 and earned the international master title in 2018. He completed a bachelor’s degree in statistics and quantitative modeling in 2017 at New York’s Baruch College. After that, “It was going to be something corporate, consulting, investment banking, actuary, or data science,” he said. “I was going to a lot of networking events on college campuses to meet people. And I was trying to talk to the parents of my chess students, who worked at Barclays Bank, Deloitte, to try to get interviews, because referrals are really powerful. But none of it ever worked.” Rozman’s story is slightly different from other streamers because he soon began focusing on YouTube after starting on Twitch. He created his channel on August 7, 2018, and, being a New Yorker, he called it GothamChess. It was only on April 19, 2020, about a month and a half into the pandemic, that he uploaded his first video. Duly named “GothamChess 1st Video,” he showed and explained a beautiful three-minute blitz game between the American grandmasters Daniel Naroditsky and Hikaru Nakamura. In this video, you could already see Rozman’s inspiring presentational style and his talent for explaining chess to lower-level players. Levy Rozman, a.k.a. GothamChess, the biggest chess YouTuber—with over five million subscribers. In hindsight, the choice of YouTube was a smart move. “After The Queen’s Gambit came out in late 2020, everything started to change, and YouTube started to become more important than Twitch,” Nakamura explained. “The Twitch boom was when all the chess content creators laid the foundation, but, thanks to The Queen’s Gambit, you had all these people that were naturally driven to chess; they go on the internet and search for content, and it’s much more natural for them to go to YouTube.” Right from the get-go, Rozman started creating YouTube tutorials. He made two videos a day for about six months. And then, when The Queen’s Gambit came out—or rather, in the weeks before—he noticed something interesting: his video about the chess opening called the Queen’s Gambit suddenly surged to 700,000 views. He realized this was because YouTube would serve viewers with this video in the sidebar after they’d watched a trailer for the Netflix show. If anyone talks about “cracking the algorithm,” it’s this kind of thing. Rozman started to understand how YouTube works. From then on, he chose his topics based on what he knew the chess fans were looking for: videos about the most famous players, the most-searched openings, and bots. This new strategy worked, and on June 1, 2021, he broke the magical barrier of a million subscribers to his YouTube channel. GothamChess is one of the streamers originally convinced by Danny Rensch to take streaming seriously. Also, at the start of what I have called “the third wave,” it was Rensch who inspired Rozman during a phone call in the fall of 2022. Rensch was at an anniversary dinner with his wife but picked up the phone anyway, telling her, “I think I’m talking with one of the future stars of chess.” Rozman told me about this moment: “ ‘We need to talk about a really serious topic,’ Danny said, and I was, like, ‘Oh, shit! What did I say? What joke did I make? Did I mention Lichess somewhere?’ And he said, ‘I don’t mean to overstep, but I think you’re making a huge mistake. You’re not focusing enough on short-form content.’ I said, ‘But there’s no money, why would I? It’s so stupid.’ And then I did it, and it’s unbelievable.” Rozman started creating lots of short-form video content where he covered trending topics, funny moments from the chess world, or showed quick ways to checkmate your opponent. “He turns it into something incredibly entertaining in 60 or 30 seconds or less,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “It’s highly repeatable, highly watchable.” On December 24, 2022, Rozman broke two million subscribers on YouTube, and the third wave pushed him to three million just 59 days later, on February 20, 2023. He got 25–30 percent of his lifetime views in that period. On November 21, 2023, Rozman tweeted: “One year ago, I uploaded my first-ever short-form video content. Since then: Tiktok: 616 million views; IG Reels: 293 million views; YT Shorts: 878 million views; total: 1.787 BILLION views. And, most importantly: these users stick around to watch longer videos and feel more connected to chess in some way.” Since the start of the pandemic, Rozman hardly had a day when he didn’t create a video. If Hans Niemann says or does something, he will make a piece of content about it. If Magnus wins a nice game, he will make some content about it. “It’s like routine,” he said. “It’s one of the only routines I think I’ve successfully been able to implement. You know, everybody wants to sleep better, eat better, go to the gym—and we all stop. Even when I’m on vacation, I take my microphone and my webcam, and in the hotel room I make a video, and then I go enjoy my day.” Apart from his persistence, his intelligent use of YouTube and the short-form content, what was it that made Levy by far the biggest chess YouTuber? “I use humor and am good at explaining things,” he told the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant in January 2023. Half a year later, he elaborated to the site Tubefilter: “Maybe I’m funny. Maybe there’s jokes intertwined. Maybe I explain concepts better, I don’t know. I’ve always been good at talking about chess to an audience that would want to listen because I had to teach kids. It’s very tough. As a 19-year-old, when I started teaching chess, I was put in front of a group of five-year-olds, and I could just do it. That’s like a nightmare. But I was able to do it, so I don’t know.” Chess.com’s Michael Brancato explained Levy’s success to me: “I think it’s his genuine excitement for what’s going on. ‘And he sacrifices … the roooook!’ Stuff like that. People resonate with that energy, and he makes it seem really epic and cool. And he comes off as a very relaxed guy; very energetic but a very approachable guy. He’s easy to understand, he seems cool, but he’s also very good at chess and at explaining advanced concepts.” “I would call him an innovator,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “In the same way that the Chessbrahs paved the way for becoming successful on Twitch, Levy did a lot of innovating on the YouTube side.” Aside from the educational content, Schroth pointed out that, like no one else, Rozman has been successful with content related to playing bots, like Mittens, on Chess.com: “I’m screaming to the heavens every day to our creators about how many people play our bots and why they need to be making videos about them.” Rozman is a perfect example of why: five of his six most-watched videos, all with more than five million views, are about playing bots. In June 2024, the GothamChess channel had 5 million subscribers and had broken two billion total views, more than any other chess-focused channel on YouTube. Meanwhile, Rozman had published his first book in October 2023 titled How to Win at Chess, which he described as “a road map from beginner to intermediate.” The book, a New York Times bestseller, is directly linked to his YouTube work through QR codes at the end of chapters, for extra practice. In November 2023, he was included in the Games category of the Forbes Under-30 list as “the internet’s unofficial chess teacher.” The title of his next book could well be How to Win on YouTube. The Holy Grail These days there are hundreds of streamers making daily chess content in dozens of languages. After Rozman and Nakamura, the biggest English-speaking chess channel is BotezLive—Alexandra and Andrea Botez—with 1.3 million followers on Twitch and 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2022 their channel won Best Chess Streamer at the Streamer Awards. The Botez sisters—Alexandra, center, and Andrea, right—in November 2023 at the Saint Louis Chess Club. As the first female streamers who became successful, the Botez sisters have paved the way for other women to make a living through chess. Anna Cramling, Dina Belenkaya, Tallulah Roberts, Alessia Santeramo, Qiyu “Nemo” Zhou, Anna Rudolf, and Anna-Maja Kazarian are among the many female streamers who have demonstrated that the world of chess streaming isn’t as male dominated as the traditional chess world. In fact, sometimes these two worlds become “merged.” Cramling, the Botez sisters, Belenkaya, and Kazarian have sometimes taken a camera with them to play over-the-board tournaments. In cooperation with the organizers, live footage of them at the board has then been live-streamed to their Twitch channels, sometimes accompanied with commentary by a friend. Chess and online streaming cannot be discussed without mentioning Antonio Radić, the Croatian amateur chess player behind the YouTube channel Agadmator. Radić’s was the first chess channel to break one million subscribers, on February 7, 2021. Levy Rozman, who would achieve the same four months later, tweeted: “Congrats, man. Pioneer of the YouTube game and inspiration to a lot of chess players and creators.” Radić makes one video daily in which he shares his knowledge and ideas about chess history and games played in today’s tournaments. It is his positivity that shines through and makes people come back. “There are those who say my daily videos light up their day; some watch it while enjoying a meal, and some fall asleep to it and tell me that I have an incredibly soothing voice,” he told ESPN in August 2020. “There are others who write in to tell me that my videos help them cope with depression, or to let me know that their children are watching chess now instead of Fortnite. Nothing makes me happier.” Meanwhile, the current chess boom in India has been reflected in big success on YouTube as well. The stand-up comedian Samay Raina, and the married couple Sagar Shah and Amruta Mokal, who run the ChessBase India channel, have played an important role in the online video revolution. They have been tirelessly covering the careers of multiple prodigies of a single generation: the siblings Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali Rameshbabu, Arjun Erigaisi, Vidit Gujrathi, Nihal Sarin and, last but not least, Dommaraju Gukesh. The 2024 Candidates winner will play for the world title against Ding Liren shortly after this book comes out. After Rozman surpassed Agadmator, ten more channels broke a million subscribers on YouTube: GMHikaru, ReyEnigma, Chess Talk, Chesscom, BotezLive, ChessBase India, Alencuatro, Samay Raina, Magnus Carlsen, and Anna Cramling. “I felt that I had something to do with chess being popular in the world, and it makes me very happy,” Radić told me. “It’s something that I can always look back on, and it will still make me happy that I was, you know, even a little part of that.” There’s another major reason, though, for the success of the chess streamers: Magnus Carlsen. Even though he is not the world champion any more, the Norwegian is still the number-one ranked player and continues to be the biggest star in chess, and the streamers (and the YouTube algorithm!) know it. A disproportionate amount of videos are about Carlsen, have thumbnails with Carlsen, and scream titles that include Carlsen. When tweeting about something else in October 2023, Carlsen casually noted that Nakamura was “constantly using my name for clicks.” Although Carlsen has been a national celebrity since 2004, when he held Kasparov to a draw in Reykjavík, his father Henrik told me that it is only since the streaming revolution that Carlsen can no longer walk in peace on the streets in Norway. And even though he knows there’s no use in complaining about others making money with his name, Carlsen does have a point when he expresses a slight annoyance. It is similar to the question of whether there can be copyright on chess games, which has been a topic of discussion for over a hundred years. As early as the nineteenth century, top players like Wilhelm Steinitz and Emanuel Lasker complained that others were making money from publishing books that contained their games. When I started filming top players analyzing their games in tournament press rooms in 2007, I also benefited from the performance of others. It is how our society works, but it sometimes feels unfair. It is a big part of the chess revolution that chess is not just something you do any more, but also something you can watch, even if you’re not that good at it yourself. For me, as a chess journalist and early contributor to live broadcasts of chess tournaments in the years 2014–19, it was always the holy grail: how to create a chess show online or on TV that can be enjoyed by people who only know the basic rules of the game? Isn’t chess too complicated to ever be successful? As a player, the true beauty in chess only started to reveal itself after a few years of playing, when I had learned all the basic tactics, concepts and famous players from chess history and their brilliant games. How could you deliver that beauty, that immense culture that belongs to the game, to beginners who are unfamiliar with terms like “Carlsbad Structure” or even something as basic as the en passant rule? Speaking to grandmaster and veteran chess commentator Daniel King gave me the insight that this holy grail wasn’t always out of reach. Even before the internet, a chess broadcast could be successful if it incorporated two important aspects: the players’ personalities and enjoyable commentary set at a low level so that the average TV viewer could follow it with a bit of effort. In 1993 in the UK, Channel 4 television ran an extensive broadcast of the PCA World Chess Championship in London between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. There was an hour-long program at the start of the game, another half-hour broadcast around move 40, followed by a half-hour roundup after the game. King was one of the commentators, alongside grandmasters Jon Speelman and Raymond Keene and the three-time British women’s champion Cathy Forbes. The show’s host was Carol Vorderman, who didn’t know much about chess—and that was perfect. King told me that when he was interviewed for the commentary job, the Channel 4 people wanted to know how he would cover chess. “Look, I want to be a journalist here,” he told them. “If there’s a Wimbledon final, I want to know how the players got there. I want to know about their personalities. I want to know about their style of play. You might not understand exactly what’s going on in a game of chess, but I can tell you about the emotion, and I can tell you about the person playing.” As soon as King told them that, the producers were happy. You could treat chess like any other sport. King had a great talent for providing exciting commentary while keeping the target audience in mind. “We took it from the absolute basics, and if we sometimes delved into something a bit too sophisticated, then Vorderman would say, ‘Hang on! You’ve got to explain that.’ So it was a very natural kind of relationship.” King noted that the longer the match went on (it lasted 20 games, running from September 7 to October 21), the commentary could up their level as the British TV audience started to grasp more and more of the chess concepts—along with Vorderman. She would start saying things like: “I recognize that now; we’ve had this kind of thing before.” Or, “Oh yeah, they castle. They’re always castling, aren’t they?” That 1993 show was a massive success. King continued to provide commentary for both TV and the internet, where his own YouTube channel is called PowerPlayChess. He enjoys the interactive aspect of online broadcasts these days because of the existence of chat: “This provides an extra layer so that you can spark off people. I think this is a fantastic improvement.” Yet still, it seems that what he did back in 1993 had the biggest impact: “I still get people today saying, ‘Oh, yeah, I started chess when I saw you on Channel 4.’ I mean, all the time.” In a way, the streaming revolution is a return to those early days of commentary. The streamers are once again showing that it’s possible to explain concepts entertainingly to newcomers and that it’s possible to have fun chess streams. Watching chess can be fun! This was also reflected in the 2023 end-of-year report of streamcharts.com, which had Chess.com’s channel as the most-viewed English-language Twitch channel (and fifth channel overall) with 11.18 million hours watched. At the same time, the streamers are showing that chess is for everyone. In that sense, it’s not much different from Alfonso X’s Libro de los juegos from the thirteenth century, which included images of nobility and vagrants, young and old, men and women, and Christian, Muslim, and Jewish characters playing chess. The new phenomenon of chess streaming might not be to everyone’s taste, but it stands in a long tradition of democratizing the game and making it more popular across the planet. As it stands, the history is long, and the future is bright for the 1,500-year-old, evergreen board game that continues to reinvent itself while remaining the same. It might well be that the chess revolution has only just started.",

It is so popular, in fact, that it is crashing Chess.com servers on a daily basis.” —Levy Rozman, YouTube, January 2023 On July 14, 2017, one of America’s top grandmasters, Hikaru Nakamura, tried out his first-ever stream on Twitch. It attracted 900 viewers, a large amount for a first stream, but Nakamura wasn’t convinced. He streamed only 11 more times in 2017 and another 11 times the next year, for a few hundred concurrent viewers at most. “It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it, but, first of all, there was no financial gain from it, and, secondly, the community was extremely small,” he told me. But on one October evening in 2018 his perspective changed. Everything changed. Nakamura was playing in a tournament in Douglas, Isle of Man. Chess.com’s Danny Rensch was there too, assisting with the Chess.com live broadcast. He took Nakamura out for dinner to a fish restaurant with Hikaru’s stepfather Sunil Weeramantry, (now ex-) girlfriend Maria De Rosa, and second, Kris Littlejohn. “During that meal, Danny effectively told me that he felt there was real potential for live streaming to become something much bigger for chess,” said Nakamura. “It wasn’t so much that he was trying to tell me that it would overtake my chess career, and I’d make tons of money, but something where he felt there were a lot of fans that were untapped potential.” One of the last things Rensch said to Nakamura at that fateful dinner was, “The chess category on Twitch needs a Ninja.” Nakamura asked, “Who’s Ninja?” Rensch explained to him that Ninja was the face of the esport Fortnite, and what made him special was that he was also one of the best players in the world: “Chess needs a Ninja, and you can be him.” Nakamura chose to give it one more try. It was a decision that would prove life-changing for him and would impact the future of online chess. The Pandemic, Carlsen’s Tournaments, PogChamps In March 2020, Chess.com had 34 million members, up from 27 million members a year earlier. The site was growing by just over half a million monthly registrations. If we look at the whole period since May 2007, the growth was 20–50 percent yearly. But now, the numbers started to look a bit different for the biggest chess platform. As the global COVID-19 lockdowns started, everyone had to stay inside, people needed to work from home, and health workers worked overtime. It was a worldwide health and economic disaster and, frankly, a scary time. Certain companies, however, were on the lucky side of things. Amazon and Netflix come to mind, but Chess.com is also among them. Besides watching more streaming TV, people turned to the internet for distraction. Many decided to pick up chess. “You could track it by country,” said CEO Erik Allebest when talking to the New York Times in 2022. “India locked down, registrations from India went through the roof. Italy locked down, registrations went through the roof.” By the end of March 2020, Chess.com was looking at a projected growth for the next three months that wasn’t supposed to happen in the next ten years. The general consensus was that such a craze would never happen again, but we were wrong. It was only the first wave. In that single month of March 2020 the playing server crashed several times. In two weeks, the number of people playing games at the same time doubled from about 40,000 to 80,000. The live server developers regularly noticed spikes in server activity that led to instability, but soon managed to fix it. Over-the-board chess events were canceled worldwide due to the pandemic. The prestigious Candidates Tournament in Yekaterinburg, Russia, was halted halfway and would resume only a year later. Just about the only over-the-board chess you could witness occurred when the chess hustlers, now wearing facemasks, returned to J. Hood Wright Park in Washington Heights in Manhattan in April 2020—just as they did to Manhattan’s Washington Square Park, London’s Holland Park, or Paris’s Jardin du Luxembourg. No matter what disaster strikes the planet, people want to play chess. And that includes Magnus Carlsen. In that same month of April 2020, just into the first of the COVID-19 lockdowns, Carlsen took the initiative to create an online tournament with seven of his biggest rivals (and an impressive $250,000 prize fund) called the Magnus Carlsen Invitational. This event, the richest online chess tournament thus far that could be watched online on Chess24 (and on Norwegian television), would change top-level chess significantly. Its name-giver, Carlsen, commented: “Chess is unique in the sports world as the moves are the same whether played on a wooden board or a computer screen. This is a historic moment for chess, and given that it’s possible to continue top professional play in an online environment, we have not only the opportunity but the responsibility to players and fans around the world who need a distraction when no other live, competitive sport is being played.” Carlsen’s initiative was a great success. Fittingly, this first of many online top tournaments to come saw Carlsen clashing with and beating Hikaru Nakamura in the final as both played from their homes. As it ended, commentator/grandmaster Jan Gustafsson thanked the viewers for watching, before adding, “Not that you guys have any other choices. Let’s face it, there’s no other sports going on.” Carlsen was nothing less than a visionary here. Almost right after his event was over, a big online team event, the Online Nations Cup, was co-organized by Chess.com and FIDE. It was broadcast in 12 languages and exceeded the viewership of traditional tournaments. That is not even considering the numbers in China, where China Sport & Leisure TV and CCTV channels peaked at over 900,000 concurrent viewers during the tournament’s final between Team USA and Team China. As several more online tournaments followed, alongside Chess.com’s weekly Titled Tuesday events, the calendar was suddenly filling up nicely again for many of the world’s best players. Meanwhile, chess fans had something to enjoy while stuck at home. Things got even better when Carlsen announced bigger plans in May: the launch of the Magnus Carlsen Tour, consisting of four online super tournaments culminating in a Grand Final in August, for a $1 million prize fund. Mainstream media started to notice. “Chess Thrives Online Despite Pandemic,” headlined the New York Times, while the Wall Street Journal proclaimed, “Chess Is the New King of the Pandemic.” The newspaper noted that aside from playing chess, watching chess had become a much more popular pastime as well: “Aficionados tuned in just to watch—and not even play—more than ten million games in April, a jump of 97 percent from February.” Talking to Forbes, the American grandmaster and popular commentator Maurice Ashley explained how special this was when just about every other sport in the world was halted: “The good news for chess is at least chess can actually do it. Major sports can’t. LeBron (James) can’t play against Steph Curry, or the Lakers can’t play against the Bucks with everybody in their living room. In chess, the best of the best can play each other without missing a beat.” In the fall of 2020, Play Magnus announced a second string of tournaments for the new year. This time it was called the Champions Chess Tour, which ran from November to September for a $1.5 million prize fund and included ten tournaments. Carlsen himself won and would repeat that in 2022, when Chess.com held its own series, the Chess.com Global Championship, for a $1 million prize fund. The Filipino-American top grandmaster Wesley So won that one but lost to Carlsen in the 2023 Tour final. I spoke to So, then ranked tenth in the world, in September 2023 during a tournament in Amsterdam. He and his adoptive mother, Lotis Key, gave me a fascinating perspective on what the legacy of the pandemic meant for top players. “Before 2020, I used to play one tournament a month, and now it’s at least two,” said So. “The schedule is like a jigsaw puzzle,” added Key. The thing is: many lucrative online tournaments continue to be organized alongside the traditional over-the-board tournaments that resurfaced after the COVID restrictions were removed. And even some new physical events have appeared. Not only has the general interest in chess exploded, but so have the opportunities for top players to play in money tournaments. Looking at what So played in the full year of 2023, on- and offline, I counted 35 tournaments, meaning almost three tournaments a month. So told me his earnings compared to pre-pandemic had doubled toward roughly $700,000 a year, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s more now. One chess tournament that emerged during the pandemic wasn’t suitable for So—or his grandmaster colleagues—but stood out nonetheless: PogChamps. First held in June 2020, it was an event the chess world had never seen before. Having been trained by experts like Hikaru Nakamura, Daniel Naroditsky, and Alexandra Botez, 16 of Twitch’s most followed esports streamers competed for their share of $50,000 in prizes. Among the participants were Boxbox (Albert Sun Zheng, a League of Legends player), Nate Hill (a Fortnite player) and Yassuo (Mohammad Abdalrhman, also League of Legends). It was the first time that amateur players, often close to absolute beginners, were playing a tournament that Chess.com broadcast live on Twitch. This aspect of PogChamps also raised eyebrows: the level of play was a fair bit lower than what the average fan was used to when watching a chess broadcast. A schism was visible in the chess world. On one side, you had serious players who were quite critical of this new phenomenon. Having invested years or even decades into the game, educated with the knowledge of the great masters from the past—for whom the Lucena position or the Sveshnikov Sicilian was standard knowledge—these strong amateurs deemed the likes of PogChamps a superficial form of entertainment. Wasn’t our beautiful ancient game, with its numerous expressions of a deeper meaning in art, literature and science, being turned into fast food here? One chess journalist compared the event to the British reality TV series I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, which he described as “the emblematic format of trash TV,” and claimed that letting beginners play for an audience was “something one should never do.” The Russian top grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi was initially critical as well, tweeting that the show was “popcorn stuff” that was “replacing and displacing any real chess content”—a prospect he found “just terrifying.” Later, he toned it down by saying, “I’m obviously happy more and more people are getting involved [in] chess.” And, indeed, those serious chess fans didn’t need to watch it, did they? As long as PogChamps wasn’t replacing any of the traditional tournaments but added something for a new audience, what was wrong with it? Sure, but Chess.com was advertising the event as loudly as any serious tournament. All broadcasts were placed on the home page; chess fans couldn’t miss or avoid it, even if you wanted to. The naysayers saw it as a type of landscape pollution, arguing that it was similar to putting a modern, ugly concrete building next to a thirteenth-century temple. A Reddit member signaled another potential PogChamps issue: the prize money. This person wrote, “I’ve had some time to think about the Twitch chess boom and PogChamps tournament specifically. I think it’s bizarre that a handful of people, who are already well off in their own field, are making quite a bit of money playing chess in a tournament sponsored by the largest chess company in the world, making literally thousands and thousands of dollars to win games in five moves, while many chess professionals struggle to make a living.” Others welcomed this remarkable new event, arguing it was fun to watch. Besides, it did bring in a lot of new fans to the game of chess—fans who were watching these Twitch celebrities playing esports like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, or Hearthstone, and were truly enjoying that their heroes were now trying their luck in the royal game. After the first edition of PogChamps, Chess.com announced that 140,000 new chess fans started following their Twitch channel, which had a record 85,000 concurrent viewers at one point. It says a lot that even three years later, Chess.com’s most-watched video on YouTube, with over 18 million views, is “xQc Gets Check-mated by MoistCr1tikal in 6 Moves!” from that first PogChamps. (The channel’s second most-watched video, about a young Russian grandmaster beating Magnus Carlsen in an over-the-board tournament, has 7.8 million views.) David Llada, FIDE’s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at the time, was among the early fans of PogChamps, and said, “Is it silly? Yes! Are we making a show out of absolute beginners blundering pieces? Yes! So what?” Chess.com’s Vice President of Esports, Michael Brancato, told me, “The whole internet was talking about it because it was a novel, fun thing. Everyone plays chess, or knows about chess, but it was the first time that it had any kind of mainstream exposure. All the big people are playing, and they’re all bad at it, and it’s funny because everyone is bad at chess. It was a very relatable thing for a lot of people.” At the time of writing, PogChamps has been held five times. The second edition took place in the fall of 2020. In the third edition, held in early 2021 for an increased prize fund of $100,000, even bigger celebrities participated. YouTuber MrBeast, rapper Logic, actor Rainn Wilson, and poker player Daniel Negreanu helped attract over 375,000 concurrent viewers. PogChamps 4 was officially sponsored by cryptocurrency marketplace Coinbase, whose $100,000 prize pool was matched by an additional $100,000 from Chess.com for charity. PogChamps 5 was held in the summer of 2023 in partnership with Ludwig, a popular online content creator who had attracted more than 1.3 billion views to his channels. For the first time, the tournament ended with a live finals event in Los Angeles. It is worth noting that PogChamps has helped some amateur-level streamers to become quite decent chess players in a short time. In her 2022 book Chess Queens, Jennifer Shahade offered the example of PogChamps 2 winner Rumay Wang, known online as Hafu, a Hearthstone champion and streamer with over one million Twitch followers: “Hafu took the competition so seriously, she played hundreds of games and solved thousands of puzzles on an anonymous burner account. After her win she said, ‘I think if you added everyone’s practice it still would be less than what I played. It’s sickening.’ ” Especially impressive was Tyler1’s rapid progress after participating in PogChamps 5. The League of Legends streamer broke a 1500 rating in just three months. The Queen’s Gambit and the Three Waves When discussing chess’s big surge in popularity in 2020, we usually point to the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, while perhaps PogChamps deserves a place in the same sentence. What do the numbers say? Let’s look at two periods: before The Queen’s Gambit and after. On October 22, 2020, a day before The Queen’s Gambit was launched, Chess.com had 44 million members. Since March of that year, the figure had grown by 12 million in less than eight months, an average pace of about 1.3 million a month. This “pandemic growth” was almost three times as fast as before COVID. On March 23, 2021, when Beth Harmon had spent five months inspiring people to pick up a chess set, Chess.com boasted 61 million members, an increase of 17 million, or 3.4 million a month. This growth was more than six times faster than before the pandemic. By June 2021 the effect of The Queen’s Gambit was fading. While global lockdowns were lifted Chess.com continued to grow, adding roughly 1.7 million members per month until the end of the summer of 2022. If we view the first months of the pandemic as the first wave, The Queen’s Gambit was the second, leading to the biggest surge in chess popularity since Fischer–Spassky in 1972. By then we had seen the peak of the chess mania, right? Wrong. A completely unexpected third wave started in December 2022—a month that broke the previous record of January 2021 for new registrations. As 4.6 million new followers joined in that single month, the site broke the magic barrier of 100 million registered members, only 14 months after reaching 50 million. (Ten months later, in October 2023, the site would reach 150 million.) January and February 2023 smashed that single-month record, with 8.9 million new registrations for both. After that, things started slowing down again, but March (7.5 million) and April (5.7 million) were still higher than any month during the Queen’s Gambit period. “Honestly, the first two weeks, in late November 2022, I didn’t think it was legitimate traffic,” said Chess.com Systems Architect Igor Grinchenko. “I thought it was malicious; it had to be. Traffic went up 10 percent every day, and the same for incoming web requests, bandwidth, load on the server, and everything else. I said, ‘Guys, someone is attacking us.’ Because I know our flows, I know our ups and downs, off-peaks and on-peaks, and I can trace them. There is also seasonality and stuff. Then I started looking at deeper metrics that cannot be affected by malicious traffic—let’s say the number of games played, the number of users online. And then I realized: this is legitimate. And we have to do something about it.” At its peak, Chess.com was accommodating over ten million active users on a single day. That spiked on January 20, 2023, when traffic on Chess.com had nearly doubled since the beginning of December 2022. On February 3, a record 403,000 members joined in 24 hours, over 200,000 more than at the peak of The Queen’s Gambit. Over a billion games were played for the first time in a month. A stunning 42.4 million games were played on a single day on March 2, 2023 (including games against bots). Meanwhile, the Chess.com app briefly occupied #1 in many countries’ Top Free Games section of the iOS app store. The boom was not just happening online. In April 2023, the Washington Post ran a story headlined “Teachers Nationwide are Flummoxed By Students’ New Chess Obsession.” A month later, CBS Bay Area wrote that chess was “sweeping classrooms across the country.” It wasn’t limited to the US either: the Dutch newspaper Het Parool ran a similar story noting that children were suddenly playing chess fanatically in school cafeterias and that Amsterdam chess clubs were facing waiting lists for teenage members. The American entertainment website Polygon, which focuses on video games and popular culture, noted that the chess mania was happening suddenly: “Schools that don’t have chess clubs are rushing to start them. Teachers are confused but pleased to see a wholesome new hobby. Administrators are struggling with how chess is disrupting classrooms at times, and are blaming it for attention issues and drama in classrooms and hallways. Can you ban chess? Some schools have reportedly had to.” The sudden rise in popularity, particularly among teens, was reflected by Chess.com’s age metrics. The site experienced the biggest growth from players aged between 13 and 17 years old: 549,000 of them visited Chess.com in January and February 2023, more than twice as many as in the two months prior. The second-fastest-growing age group in the same period was 18-to-24-year-olds. Chess was booming, and the Chess.com servers were struggling. More often than not, members were getting served a disappointing 503 error when visiting the site: database overload. “It’s hard to explain how painful it was for me as CEO,” Allebest said. “One of our developers would always talk about underwater stones, meaning you can’t see the problems until it’s too late.… There was a moment when somebody crashed our server because they pasted the entire script of the Bee Movie in the chat window of a game. When it came into the server and was sent back to everybody watching this particular game, it crashed the whole site because of too much data. We didn’t think someone was going to paste in that much text. You know, things like that, over and over and over again.” Chess.com purchased $2 million of new hardware—web servers, database servers, a new live chess server, load balancers, and additional service machines. After a few weeks of setting up, separating database tables, sharding databases (a way to spread the load), and other ways of optimizing, things were under control again. A graph of Chess.com’s membership growth between September 2016 and December 2023 clearly shows the three waves of popularity. The first two waves of popularity in 2020 were easy to explain: the pandemic (with PogChamps) and The Queen’s Gambit. But where did that third, and by far biggest wave, come from? Well, in this case, it was a combination of multiple individual events happening in a short period that all helped boost the popularity of chess to stratospheric heights. Some happened in late 2022 and have already been mentioned in this book, such as the Carlsen–Niemann affair, the Instagram picture with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and the Chessboxing event. And then, in January 2023, a furry, meowing phenomenon contributed even more. When Chess.com launched, on May 18, 2007, the only possibility to play chess on the site had been against the computer. Many years later, that remains one of the most popular activities for its members, partly because of some added fun elements. After Chess.com acquired one of the world’s strongest chess engines, Komodo, in May 2018, the company started using it to create computer “characters” to play against. Among those fun bots you could challenge were the “holiday bots” (Santa, Holly, Dash, Eve, and Powder), the “zombie bots” (Zombaru, Zombiachtchi, Zombiano, and Zombanny), and the “fake billionaire bots” (Gill Bates, Melon Husk, Zark Muckerberg, Biff Jezos, and Barron Wuffet). On January 1, 2023, new bots were introduced, and one of them instantly became the biggest star in chess (well, for a few weeks at least). That was Mittens, the strongest among five cat bots—the others were Scaredy Cat, Angry Cat, Mr. Grumpers, and Catspurrov. Right from the start, Mittens—an avatar of a big-eyed, kind of sad-looking kitten boasting a silly rating of just one point—took all the attention, as streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Levy Rozman, and the Botez sisters started playing against it. Mittens’s viral fame didn’t just come from its prowess on the chessboard, where it revealed itself as a ruthless killer, but also from the nasty, sadistic comments it provided during games: “I am become Mittens, the destroyer of kings. I exist at this chess board through all times and realities … hehehe. Meow.” According to a story in the Independent, Chess.com users described Mittens as a “chess nightmare,” “a psycho,” and a “terrible, terrible cat.” Chess.com’s famed catbot Mittens, a cuddly pet turned ruthless killer on the chessboard. It was Will Whalen, a student at Hamilton College (majoring in world politics) and a part-time contributor to Chess.com’s social media team, who came up with the idea. In an interview in April 2023 he said, “Mittens was originally a pitched joke that ended up getting very out of hand.” Whalen noted that his colleague Sean Becker, who was leading the bots project, wrote Mittens’s interactions with help from other content team members. They ensured that the cat would always start very calm and cuddly but then would “devolve into madness,” even quoting Nietzsche. Not your everyday cat-on-the-internet experience. The Rise of the Streamers The decade between 2004 and 2014 saw many battles in the technology industry. There was the social media arms race with MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, but also the vertical distribution arms race: who would win the live streaming battle? While YouTube initially remained limited to video on demand, several live-streaming video websites started popping up: Ustream (acquired by IBM in 2016), Livestream.com (acquired by Vimeo in 2017), and Justin.tv, all launched in 2007. The latter won the battle with its spin-off Twitch, which started in 2011 and was dedicated to gaming. These were the years when the video gaming industry started to blow up with games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Dota. In August 2014, when Twitch had gathered over 50 million users, it was acquired by Amazon for $970 million. Around 2013, Rensch got in touch with Twitch’s Director of Creator Development at the time, Markus “djWHEAT” Graham, who had a long history of providing commentary at video game tournaments since the late 1990s. More importantly, Graham saw the potential for chess. Previously, Chess.com had been using Livestream.com, but Twitch had an altogether different vibe. “Rather than just viewing these broadcasting tools as an opportunity to serve the community, we actually could grow the community because we were reaching the gaming audience, which was a larger community than ours,” said Rensch. Rensch himself had had plenty of experience as a streamer before chess streaming became a thing. One of the first examples of something resembling chess streaming occurred when Rensch created his first weekly “Bullet Brawl” video in 2012, which consisted of a chessboard, the Chess.com logo, and Rensch’s voice. It was a concept that originated from Chess.com’s “Live Sessions” that had existed for three years, but this time, it was all about fun. As Rensch was playing bullet, he provided humorous commentary. In that first video, he noted, “The whole idea of a Bullet Brawl Thursday is we’re going to play two to three bullet games and focus more on the excitement of the game than on the analysis afterward and whether it was a perfect thing. The perfection of it is that it’s flawed.” The idea of making jokes and talking crap while playing a game of chess was born. “What Hikaru and Levy and the others are doing right now is basically Bullet Brawls,” said Rensch. “Despite the name, the Live Sessions were actually pre-recorded. Bullet Brawls was the first time we did it for a live audience, with chat running. And, for me, this was probably the first product on the perfect intersection of what chess was always missing. Over-the-board chess was always going to be a quiet, serious game. You can’t talk; it would distract your opponent. But online streaming, with your own conscious thoughts, was born for this, changing the way people perceived chess. It was like, ‘Oh, I’m inside the head of a titled player!’ ” Around the same time, the first chess-focused channels appeared on Twitch: Gerard Bailleau’s ChessNetwork, Tryfon Gavriel’s Kingscrusher, and, most prominently, Chessbrah, the account run by the Canadian players Eric Hansen (the grandmaster we met in Chapter 7 who first discussed the anal beads theory during a stream) and master Aman Hambleton, who would become a grandmaster a few years later. Both were born in 1992. The Chessbrahs were, and still are, a group of friends living in the same house in Toronto, Canada, who basically just love to hang out and play chess online—something they managed to turn into a business before anyone else. In the spring of 2024, Chessbrah had 325,000 followers on Twitch, 332,000 subscribers on YouTube, and another 9,470 followers on Kick, a Twitch rival platform that launched in 2022 and where the Chessbrahs started an account in June 2023. They had several part-time editors and one full-time operations manager running the merch store and channels. “I started streaming because [I] just wanted to show my screen to friends,” Hansen told me. “There wasn’t share screen back then on MSN Messenger, and Skype was a bit annoying and too formal anyway.” He and his friends were already playing a lot of blitz and bullet chess on different chess platforms, and streaming made it easier to follow and chat with each other. “It was just a community feel, to stay in touch.” Like many of the streaming video pioneers, Hansen started somewhere in 2010 on Livestream.com before moving to Justin.tv and then Twitch. “There wasn’t yet a chess community there, but I created an account because I was into video computer games, and this way, I could watch Starcraft, Age of Vampires, the strategy games, the shooter games. But sometimes we would stream our-selves, playing casual chess and just chatting.” In the fall of 2014, Hansen decided to take streaming more seriously. He bought a desktop computer and two screens, creating a proper setup. He took up the name “Chessbrah,” which he was already using as an online alias, and started streaming in 2015. He was averaging 300 viewers six months later. He streamed over eight hours daily, 60 to 70 hours weekly. “I was really grinding,” he said. “I already played so much bullet and blitz, I was basically addicted. But I was good at it too. So I thought, ‘Why not share that perspective?’ ” Chapter 8 showed that chess addiction is a thing, particularly for online chess. It’s interesting to note that, in the modern era, Hansen and others have shown that streaming can be an outlet, a way of dealing with it, and even a way to monetize it: you can turn your love for chess into a business. Making money from streaming chess would become even easier thanks to cooperation between Twitch and Chess.com a few years later. Chess.com was providing fun live sessions and, on top of that, there were broadcasts of over-the-board events (which I co-produced), Titled Tuesdays, Death Matches, and other events with a growing audience. And then, in 2016, the site organized its biggest event to date: the GM Blitz Battle Championship, a knockout event with only world-class grandmasters. It resulted in a much-anticipated final between Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, won by Carlsen. With a peak concurrent viewership of 36,000, Chess.com’s show was the third most-watched Twitch broadcast that year, behind Hearthstone and Call of Duty, but ahead of all the other major esports. “I always joke that that’s the event where Danny took chess out of the closet,” said Rensch. “Chess came out of the closet on that event because I commented and produced that show by myself from a closet we had made in our studio in Payson, Arizona.” Chess.com launched the PRO Chess League in January 2017, a global team championship with all the games played on the site and live broadcasts on twitch.tv/chess. It was an excellent kickstarter for the new Twitch channel, as some of the best grand-masters were playing, including Nakamura and Carlsen. The Twitch leadership took notice and started new talks with Chess.com. Rensch: “I spoke with Nick Allen, their VP of Esports, who reported directly to Mike Aragon, the Chief Content Officer, who reported to Emmett Shear, the CEO. They were all, like: ‘You guys are crushing it!’ ” Everyone was on the same page: chess had massive potential while hardly anyone was making content typical of Twitch—live, more spontaneous, and less serious. The overwhelming majority of chess video content was either pre-recorded educational material or live broadcasts of top events with commentators targeting club-level players. There was no real chess ecosystem for streaming fun stuff at the time. And so, in November 2017, Chess.com closed a two-year deal with Twitch, which would provide the site a monthly fee intended for orchestrating and fostering the growing chess community. Twitch was now a sponsor for Chess.com’s entire lineup of chess events and was going to help grow the global brand of chess as an online spectator sport. The Chess.com–Twitch arrangement fared better than anyone’s wildest expectations. “Chess has seen some of the most substantial growth in the same period of time than any other esport in the world,” Twitch’s VP of Global Esports, Justin Dellario, told NBC News in February 2020. The Chessbrah channel was one of the earliest to join Chess.com’s Partner Streamers Program, and they did the early heavy lifting for Twitch’s chess category. “They were the backbone, the ones that carried chess through back then,” said Rensch. Soon, streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Alexandra Botez, and Levy Rozman followed the Chessbrahs, among many others. The program’s benefits included accelerated partnership status to streamers and being embedded on Chess.com’s integrated broadcast page www.chess.com/tv for more exposure. The only thing the streamers needed to do was play on Chess.com and not elsewhere, and have Chess.com’s green pawn visible somewhere in the video. “I gotta say, Danny was really good at picking people,” said Chess.com’s esports expert Michael Brancato. “He pretty much knew about Alexandra and Hikaru and encouraged them to stream.” At the time, Chess.com was paying these streamers, and Rensch told them: “We think you can make this much money in the future, so keep up with this.” As noted, during the early days of the pandemic, streaming became an alternative way for chess professionals to earn money as the demand for chess content suddenly increased. Between March and August of 2020, fans watched 41.2 million hours of chess on Twitch, four times as many hours as in the previous six months, according to the analytics website SullyGnome. Even a top grandmaster like Peter Svidler, stuck in his home in St. Petersburg, started broadcasting his chess on Twitch. “Streaming during the pandemic was what kept me sane,” he told me. “I would do three or four streams a week, not very long. But it was just self-care. I earned some money over 2021, which would pay for utility bills, which is good, but I wasn’t doing it for the money. I was doing it because, like many other people, I was going a bit crazy. It was incredibly therapeutic in my case. And I’ve spoken to many people who said exactly the same.” Once Twitch got hacked in October 2021, it also became public knowledge that the biggest chess streamers were making decent money, when details of creator payouts were posted on Reddit. It was suddenly out in the open that, from August 2019 until October 2021, Nakamura earned $773,831.12, the Chessbrahs $767,384.56, Levy Rozman $424,505.01, and the Botez sisters $416,813.43. These earnings did not include revenue from merch, sponsorships, or other channels such as YouTube. “Large creators are incredibly well compensated,” Chess.com’s Influencer Relations Manager Christopher Schroth told me in late 2023. “It’s not uncommon to hear creators earning beyond five, six figures a month, if not more.” Right from the start, in early 2017, Brancato and Rensch worked closely together and created a lot of new events and broadcasts. Aside from the PRO Chess League, there was the Speed Chess Championship (the successor of the Blitz Battle Championship), the Junior Speed Chess Championship for young talents, the Women’s Speed Chess Championship, Arena Kings, and more. On top of that, many new chess streamers started to create channels on Twitch, but something was still missing. What this young community of chess streamers needed was somebody carrying the torch. That person became Hikaru Nakamura. From Top GM to the Ninja of Chess—and Back Again Hikaru Nakamura was born in 1987 in Japan to an American mother and a Japanese father. The family moved to White Plains, New York, when he was two. A year later, his parents divorced. He started playing chess at the age of seven and, with his brother, was coached by his Sri Lankan stepfather, FIDE Master and chess author Sunil Weeramantry. Nakamura was a true chess prodigy. In 2003, at the age of 15 years and 79 days, he became the youngest American to earn the grandmaster title, three months sooner than Bobby Fischer had. He has won the US championship five times, taken first prize at the prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Grand Chess Tour, and won an Olympic gold medal. All this was before he decided to take up streaming on that October evening in 2018 in a fish restaurant on the Isle of Man. “It is very important to note that my result in that tournament in the Isle of Man also played a massive role in terms of me starting to stream,” Nakamura told me. “I was actually doing quite well, but then, in the eighth round, I lost this very heartbreaking game. I was not really in a great frame of mind, I was going from tournament to tournament, and I felt a little bit aimless—I think, in large part, because I lost that game. That was one of the biggest things that spurred me to start trying out streaming.” This time around, it was the perfect moment. Only a few weeks later, the world championship between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana took place in London, and Nakamura’s coverage attracted thousands of viewers daily. During that match, Chess.com launched its popular new product Puzzle Rush, and Nakamura embraced it. “He became obsessed with it. He was breaking records, and before you knew it, chess on Twitch would never be the same,” said Rensch. The following year, 2019, was the first that Nakamura became more of a streamer than a chess player, and it was not an easy year. “I do have to give myself a lot of credit because there are many people who were very pessimistic about it,” he told me. His results at the board got worse, and there were a lot of naysayers. Some of my own friends couldn’t understand why, as they put it, he “wasn’t trying to become world champion any more.” Responding to his critics, Nakamura said, “They just thought it was fairly stupid to be doing this streaming in the first place, and because of that, I kept sticking with it.” After bad results at tournaments in India and Germany, he took a five-month break from playing chess, something he hadn’t done for at least a decade. The plan was to take it up again with the US championship in April 2020, but he never reached that point because of the pandemic. Hikaru Nakamura in a recording studio in St. Louis, August 2021. In the buildup to the first PogChamps, Nakamura did a few streams with the Canadian streamer xQc (real name: Félix Lengyel). The former professional Overwatch player is one of several esports streamers who like chess, and the broadcasts where Nakamura taught him the basics were extremely popular. “I think that was the first time I crossed 10,000 viewers on a live stream,” said Nakamura. “That was sort of the moment I realized it was actually a very big deal, that it was something very serious and in a different kind of way.” Then PogChamps happened. Nakamura was one of the commentators, and his viewership increased even more. At some point, he streamed for 70 days in a row, essentially without a break, grinding like the Chessbrahs. In August of 2020 his channel surpassed the 500,000-follower mark. By that point, he was by far the biggest chess streamer. At the end of that month, he signed with TSM, making him the first professional chess player to sign with an esports organization. (He would represent TSM until June 2022, when he signed with Misfits Gaming.) “You just ride that wave,” he told me. “And afterward I kind of realized that I was quite good at it.” I guessed that it had something to do with his ICC past, and Nakamura agreed: “There were many times when I would actually kibitz with people—not the other player, but with the people who were watching the games while I was playing—and that was something that nobody at the time was doing. In fact, I think even now, nobody does that. When I look back, I think that played a very pivotal role in terms of where I am today. It’s a little bit different, obviously, communicating your thoughts verbally versus in written form, but, for me, I think that having that whole process where I was communicating in some form during the games was like destiny—that I ended up doing what I’m doing now.” Streaming chess does indeed seem to be the perfect way of communicating for Nakamura, who doesn’t always come across as a great communicator away from the computer. The American top grandmaster is generally considered a brilliant player who also has his share of haters. Starting from his early days on the ICC, where he was super-strong at an early age, many disliked him for being caustic, as he sometimes left derogatory comments after suffering occasional losses. Nakamura admitted this to me, saying it was his way of finding motivation: “Back then, I hated losing. Not that I don’t still hate losing, but I did not accept losing. I always felt my loss was a horrible thing. So, you know, I would get very angry over losing games online. And, in some cases, I would actually get mad at opponents and things like that. And so, for me, the motivation was, like, getting really angry, using sort of the unhappiness, the anger, all those different things. And so I didn’t necessarily have a lot of fans wanting to talk to me the same way; in fact, a lot of people disliked me back then.” It is remarkable that such a fantastic chess player turned out to be a natural behind the screen and the microphone as well. Brandon Benton, a physics researcher at Cornell University, put it as follows when speaking to the New York Times in September 2020: “He draws people because he’s so good, but also, there are other top players on Twitch that are not as engaging as he is, not as funny, not as in tune with the sort of Twitch culture.” Brenton called Nakamura a “down-to-earth memer and jokester.” Not many—certainly not the naysayers—expected what happened next with Nakamura’s over-the-board career, in 2019. While he was on his way to becoming the best-paid grandmaster in the world through Twitch, easily surpassing Carlsen’s career earnings, Nakamura also started to play some of his best chess in years. Through the FIDE Grand Prix, he qualified for the 2022 Candidates Tournament, and then he won the 2022 Fischer Random World Championship. In 2023 he came first at the super-strong Norway Chess tournament (climbing back to second place in the world rankings), and thanks to another excellent second place in the FIDE Grand Swiss in October, he qualified for the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, his second in a row. It was a growing list of impressive achievements for any chess player—but an out-of-this-world performance for a streamer. How did he do that? “There’s a couple of reasons,” he told me. “First of all, the financial strain of playing chess professionally. You’re always thinking about supporting people: your family and your partner. And I think that definitely played a huge role in terms of my performance. There were many situations where I would just make quick boring draws rather than try to fight. Rather than trying to win, rather than trying to enjoy the game. Now, I don’t have the financial worries or concerns, which plays a huge role.” Not unimportant was that, since October 2020, Nakamura had been with the Iranian American chess player Atousa Pourkashiyan, and in the summer of 2023 they got married: “It’s also about having the right people in your life. I’m very fortunate that I have someone who is extremely supportive, who’s nothing but positive and very helpful.” In October 2022, while talking to The Guardian, the experienced chess commentator and English grandmaster Daniel King explained Nakamura’s success: “Nakamura was noted for being fantastically strong at bullet chess long before it was sort of hip to play online, and he has turned into the perfect chess streamer, making millions. He’s gobby. He’s opinionated. He doesn’t care about upsetting people. He’s basically just hacked an online algorithm that means you’re going to be successful.” By early 2024 Nakamura had 1.9 million followers on Twitch. Since March of that year, his main channel has been on Kick. He has 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube and 551,000 followers on X. All the “GMHikaru” channels combined are run by a team of six or seven people. Nakamura told me that he is making about four to five times as much money as when he was still a professional chess player. In 2020 and 2021 alone he earned more than during his entire playing career. It’s an incredible story. That player who once slept on my couch and started playing on the ICC right after waking up is indeed nothing less than the Ninja of chess. The Biggest Chess YouTuber of All Born in 1995 in Brooklyn, New York, Levy Rozman is eight years younger than Nakamura. He was among the earliest Twitch streamers, and even helped Nakamura in the early days, providing commentary on the GMHikaru channel when Nakamura was playing an over-the-board tournament. Rozman, however, is most famous for running the biggest chess channel on YouTube. He started playing chess when he was six years old. “I was a very hyper child, and my parents needed to put me in after-school, like, after 3 p.m.,” Rozman told me. “They wanted to put me into art class or chess, but chess was $5 more expensive than art, and my dad said, ‘He is too hyper for chess; he’s gonna get kicked out of chess class.’ But it turned out I really liked chess, for some reason, and I stuck to it like a magnet. I never went to art class because I wasn’t very good, and I found chess so fascinating, and I became obsessed with it.” Rozman started as a scholastic chess coach in 2014 and earned the international master title in 2018. He completed a bachelor’s degree in statistics and quantitative modeling in 2017 at New York’s Baruch College. After that, “It was going to be something corporate, consulting, investment banking, actuary, or data science,” he said. “I was going to a lot of networking events on college campuses to meet people. And I was trying to talk to the parents of my chess students, who worked at Barclays Bank, Deloitte, to try to get interviews, because referrals are really powerful. But none of it ever worked.” Rozman’s story is slightly different from other streamers because he soon began focusing on YouTube after starting on Twitch. He created his channel on August 7, 2018, and, being a New Yorker, he called it GothamChess. It was only on April 19, 2020, about a month and a half into the pandemic, that he uploaded his first video. Duly named “GothamChess 1st Video,” he showed and explained a beautiful three-minute blitz game between the American grandmasters Daniel Naroditsky and Hikaru Nakamura. In this video, you could already see Rozman’s inspiring presentational style and his talent for explaining chess to lower-level players. Levy Rozman, a.k.a. GothamChess, the biggest chess YouTuber—with over five million subscribers. In hindsight, the choice of YouTube was a smart move. “After The Queen’s Gambit came out in late 2020, everything started to change, and YouTube started to become more important than Twitch,” Nakamura explained. “The Twitch boom was when all the chess content creators laid the foundation, but, thanks to The Queen’s Gambit, you had all these people that were naturally driven to chess; they go on the internet and search for content, and it’s much more natural for them to go to YouTube.” Right from the get-go, Rozman started creating YouTube tutorials. He made two videos a day for about six months. And then, when The Queen’s Gambit came out—or rather, in the weeks before—he noticed something interesting: his video about the chess opening called the Queen’s Gambit suddenly surged to 700,000 views. He realized this was because YouTube would serve viewers with this video in the sidebar after they’d watched a trailer for the Netflix show. If anyone talks about “cracking the algorithm,” it’s this kind of thing. Rozman started to understand how YouTube works. From then on, he chose his topics based on what he knew the chess fans were looking for: videos about the most famous players, the most-searched openings, and bots. This new strategy worked, and on June 1, 2021, he broke the magical barrier of a million subscribers to his YouTube channel. GothamChess is one of the streamers originally convinced by Danny Rensch to take streaming seriously. Also, at the start of what I have called “the third wave,” it was Rensch who inspired Rozman during a phone call in the fall of 2022. Rensch was at an anniversary dinner with his wife but picked up the phone anyway, telling her, “I think I’m talking with one of the future stars of chess.” Rozman told me about this moment: “ ‘We need to talk about a really serious topic,’ Danny said, and I was, like, ‘Oh, shit! What did I say? What joke did I make? Did I mention Lichess somewhere?’ And he said, ‘I don’t mean to overstep, but I think you’re making a huge mistake. You’re not focusing enough on short-form content.’ I said, ‘But there’s no money, why would I? It’s so stupid.’ And then I did it, and it’s unbelievable.” Rozman started creating lots of short-form video content where he covered trending topics, funny moments from the chess world, or showed quick ways to checkmate your opponent. “He turns it into something incredibly entertaining in 60 or 30 seconds or less,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “It’s highly repeatable, highly watchable.” On December 24, 2022, Rozman broke two million subscribers on YouTube, and the third wave pushed him to three million just 59 days later, on February 20, 2023. He got 25–30 percent of his lifetime views in that period. On November 21, 2023, Rozman tweeted: “One year ago, I uploaded my first-ever short-form video content. Since then: Tiktok: 616 million views; IG Reels: 293 million views; YT Shorts: 878 million views; total: 1.787 BILLION views. And, most importantly: these users stick around to watch longer videos and feel more connected to chess in some way.” Since the start of the pandemic, Rozman hardly had a day when he didn’t create a video. If Hans Niemann says or does something, he will make a piece of content about it. If Magnus wins a nice game, he will make some content about it. “It’s like routine,” he said. “It’s one of the only routines I think I’ve successfully been able to implement. You know, everybody wants to sleep better, eat better, go to the gym—and we all stop. Even when I’m on vacation, I take my microphone and my webcam, and in the hotel room I make a video, and then I go enjoy my day.” Apart from his persistence, his intelligent use of YouTube and the short-form content, what was it that made Levy by far the biggest chess YouTuber? “I use humor and am good at explaining things,” he told the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant in January 2023. Half a year later, he elaborated to the site Tubefilter: “Maybe I’m funny. Maybe there’s jokes intertwined. Maybe I explain concepts better, I don’t know. I’ve always been good at talking about chess to an audience that would want to listen because I had to teach kids. It’s very tough. As a 19-year-old, when I started teaching chess, I was put in front of a group of five-year-olds, and I could just do it. That’s like a nightmare. But I was able to do it, so I don’t know.” Chess.com’s Michael Brancato explained Levy’s success to me: “I think it’s his genuine excitement for what’s going on. ‘And he sacrifices … the roooook!’ Stuff like that. People resonate with that energy, and he makes it seem really epic and cool. And he comes off as a very relaxed guy; very energetic but a very approachable guy. He’s easy to understand, he seems cool, but he’s also very good at chess and at explaining advanced concepts.” “I would call him an innovator,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “In the same way that the Chessbrahs paved the way for becoming successful on Twitch, Levy did a lot of innovating on the YouTube side.” Aside from the educational content, Schroth pointed out that, like no one else, Rozman has been successful with content related to playing bots, like Mittens, on Chess.com: “I’m screaming to the heavens every day to our creators about how many people play our bots and why they need to be making videos about them.” Rozman is a perfect example of why: five of his six most-watched videos, all with more than five million views, are about playing bots. In June 2024, the GothamChess channel had 5 million subscribers and had broken two billion total views, more than any other chess-focused channel on YouTube. Meanwhile, Rozman had published his first book in October 2023 titled How to Win at Chess, which he described as “a road map from beginner to intermediate.” The book, a New York Times bestseller, is directly linked to his YouTube work through QR codes at the end of chapters, for extra practice. In November 2023, he was included in the Games category of the Forbes Under-30 list as “the internet’s unofficial chess teacher.” The title of his next book could well be How to Win on YouTube. The Holy Grail These days there are hundreds of streamers making daily chess content in dozens of languages. After Rozman and Nakamura, the biggest English-speaking chess channel is BotezLive—Alexandra and Andrea Botez—with 1.3 million followers on Twitch and 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2022 their channel won Best Chess Streamer at the Streamer Awards. The Botez sisters—Alexandra, center, and Andrea, right—in November 2023 at the Saint Louis Chess Club. As the first female streamers who became successful, the Botez sisters have paved the way for other women to make a living through chess. Anna Cramling, Dina Belenkaya, Tallulah Roberts, Alessia Santeramo, Qiyu “Nemo” Zhou, Anna Rudolf, and Anna-Maja Kazarian are among the many female streamers who have demonstrated that the world of chess streaming isn’t as male dominated as the traditional chess world. In fact, sometimes these two worlds become “merged.” Cramling, the Botez sisters, Belenkaya, and Kazarian have sometimes taken a camera with them to play over-the-board tournaments. In cooperation with the organizers, live footage of them at the board has then been live-streamed to their Twitch channels, sometimes accompanied with commentary by a friend. Chess and online streaming cannot be discussed without mentioning Antonio Radić, the Croatian amateur chess player behind the YouTube channel Agadmator. Radić’s was the first chess channel to break one million subscribers, on February 7, 2021. Levy Rozman, who would achieve the same four months later, tweeted: “Congrats, man. Pioneer of the YouTube game and inspiration to a lot of chess players and creators.” Radić makes one video daily in which he shares his knowledge and ideas about chess history and games played in today’s tournaments. It is his positivity that shines through and makes people come back. “There are those who say my daily videos light up their day; some watch it while enjoying a meal, and some fall asleep to it and tell me that I have an incredibly soothing voice,” he told ESPN in August 2020. “There are others who write in to tell me that my videos help them cope with depression, or to let me know that their children are watching chess now instead of Fortnite. Nothing makes me happier.” Meanwhile, the current chess boom in India has been reflected in big success on YouTube as well. The stand-up comedian Samay Raina, and the married couple Sagar Shah and Amruta Mokal, who run the ChessBase India channel, have played an important role in the online video revolution. They have been tirelessly covering the careers of multiple prodigies of a single generation: the siblings Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali Rameshbabu, Arjun Erigaisi, Vidit Gujrathi, Nihal Sarin and, last but not least, Dommaraju Gukesh. The 2024 Candidates winner will play for the world title against Ding Liren shortly after this book comes out. After Rozman surpassed Agadmator, ten more channels broke a million subscribers on YouTube: GMHikaru, ReyEnigma, Chess Talk, Chesscom, BotezLive, ChessBase India, Alencuatro, Samay Raina, Magnus Carlsen, and Anna Cramling. “I felt that I had something to do with chess being popular in the world, and it makes me very happy,” Radić told me. “It’s something that I can always look back on, and it will still make me happy that I was, you know, even a little part of that.” There’s another major reason, though, for the success of the chess streamers: Magnus Carlsen. Even though he is not the world champion any more, the Norwegian is still the number-one ranked player and continues to be the biggest star in chess, and the streamers (and the YouTube algorithm!) know it. A disproportionate amount of videos are about Carlsen, have thumbnails with Carlsen, and scream titles that include Carlsen. When tweeting about something else in October 2023, Carlsen casually noted that Nakamura was “constantly using my name for clicks.” Although Carlsen has been a national celebrity since 2004, when he held Kasparov to a draw in Reykjavík, his father Henrik told me that it is only since the streaming revolution that Carlsen can no longer walk in peace on the streets in Norway. And even though he knows there’s no use in complaining about others making money with his name, Carlsen does have a point when he expresses a slight annoyance. It is similar to the question of whether there can be copyright on chess games, which has been a topic of discussion for over a hundred years. As early as the nineteenth century, top players like Wilhelm Steinitz and Emanuel Lasker complained that others were making money from publishing books that contained their games. When I started filming top players analyzing their games in tournament press rooms in 2007, I also benefited from the performance of others. It is how our society works, but it sometimes feels unfair. It is a big part of the chess revolution that chess is not just something you do any more, but also something you can watch, even if you’re not that good at it yourself. For me, as a chess journalist and early contributor to live broadcasts of chess tournaments in the years 2014–19, it was always the holy grail: how to create a chess show online or on TV that can be enjoyed by people who only know the basic rules of the game? Isn’t chess too complicated to ever be successful? As a player, the true beauty in chess only started to reveal itself after a few years of playing, when I had learned all the basic tactics, concepts and famous players from chess history and their brilliant games. How could you deliver that beauty, that immense culture that belongs to the game, to beginners who are unfamiliar with terms like “Carlsbad Structure” or even something as basic as the en passant rule? Speaking to grandmaster and veteran chess commentator Daniel King gave me the insight that this holy grail wasn’t always out of reach. Even before the internet, a chess broadcast could be successful if it incorporated two important aspects: the players’ personalities and enjoyable commentary set at a low level so that the average TV viewer could follow it with a bit of effort. In 1993 in the UK, Channel 4 television ran an extensive broadcast of the PCA World Chess Championship in London between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. There was an hour-long program at the start of the game, another half-hour broadcast around move 40, followed by a half-hour roundup after the game. King was one of the commentators, alongside grandmasters Jon Speelman and Raymond Keene and the three-time British women’s champion Cathy Forbes. The show’s host was Carol Vorderman, who didn’t know much about chess—and that was perfect. King told me that when he was interviewed for the commentary job, the Channel 4 people wanted to know how he would cover chess. “Look, I want to be a journalist here,” he told them. “If there’s a Wimbledon final, I want to know how the players got there. I want to know about their personalities. I want to know about their style of play. You might not understand exactly what’s going on in a game of chess, but I can tell you about the emotion, and I can tell you about the person playing.” As soon as King told them that, the producers were happy. You could treat chess like any other sport. King had a great talent for providing exciting commentary while keeping the target audience in mind. “We took it from the absolute basics, and if we sometimes delved into something a bit too sophisticated, then Vorderman would say, ‘Hang on! You’ve got to explain that.’ So it was a very natural kind of relationship.” King noted that the longer the match went on (it lasted 20 games, running from September 7 to October 21), the commentary could up their level as the British TV audience started to grasp more and more of the chess concepts—along with Vorderman. She would start saying things like: “I recognize that now; we’ve had this kind of thing before.” Or, “Oh yeah, they castle. They’re always castling, aren’t they?” That 1993 show was a massive success. King continued to provide commentary for both TV and the internet, where his own YouTube channel is called PowerPlayChess. He enjoys the interactive aspect of online broadcasts these days because of the existence of chat: “This provides an extra layer so that you can spark off people. I think this is a fantastic improvement.” Yet still, it seems that what he did back in 1993 had the biggest impact: “I still get people today saying, ‘Oh, yeah, I started chess when I saw you on Channel 4.’ I mean, all the time.” In a way, the streaming revolution is a return to those early days of commentary. The streamers are once again showing that it’s possible to explain concepts entertainingly to newcomers and that it’s possible to have fun chess streams. Watching chess can be fun! This was also reflected in the 2023 end-of-year report of streamcharts.com, which had Chess.com’s channel as the most-viewed English-language Twitch channel (and fifth channel overall) with 11.18 million hours watched. At the same time, the streamers are showing that chess is for everyone. In that sense, it’s not much different from Alfonso X’s Libro de los juegos from the thirteenth century, which included images of nobility and vagrants, young and old, men and women, and Christian, Muslim, and Jewish characters playing chess. The new phenomenon of chess streaming might not be to everyone’s taste, but it stands in a long tradition of democratizing the game and making it more popular across the planet. As it stands, the history is long, and the future is bright for the 1,500-year-old, evergreen board game that continues to reinvent itself while remaining the same. It might well be that the chess revolution has only just started.",

It is so popular, in fact, that it is crashing Chess.com servers on a daily basis.” —Levy Rozman, YouTube, January 2023 On July 14, 2017, one of America’s top grandmasters, Hikaru Nakamura, tried out his first-ever stream on Twitch. It attracted 900 viewers, a large amount for a first stream, but Nakamura wasn’t convinced. He streamed only 11 more times in 2017 and another 11 times the next year, for a few hundred concurrent viewers at most. “It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it, but, first of all, there was no financial gain from it, and, secondly, the community was extremely small,” he told me. But on one October evening in 2018 his perspective changed. Everything changed. Nakamura was playing in a tournament in Douglas, Isle of Man. Chess.com’s Danny Rensch was there too, assisting with the Chess.com live broadcast. He took Nakamura out for dinner to a fish restaurant with Hikaru’s stepfather Sunil Weeramantry, (now ex-) girlfriend Maria De Rosa, and second, Kris Littlejohn. “During that meal, Danny effectively told me that he felt there was real potential for live streaming to become something much bigger for chess,” said Nakamura. “It wasn’t so much that he was trying to tell me that it would overtake my chess career, and I’d make tons of money, but something where he felt there were a lot of fans that were untapped potential.” One of the last things Rensch said to Nakamura at that fateful dinner was, “The chess category on Twitch needs a Ninja.” Nakamura asked, “Who’s Ninja?” Rensch explained to him that Ninja was the face of the esport Fortnite, and what made him special was that he was also one of the best players in the world: “Chess needs a Ninja, and you can be him.” Nakamura chose to give it one more try. It was a decision that would prove life-changing for him and would impact the future of online chess. The Pandemic, Carlsen’s Tournaments, PogChamps In March 2020, Chess.com had 34 million members, up from 27 million members a year earlier. The site was growing by just over half a million monthly registrations. If we look at the whole period since May 2007, the growth was 20–50 percent yearly. But now, the numbers started to look a bit different for the biggest chess platform. As the global COVID-19 lockdowns started, everyone had to stay inside, people needed to work from home, and health workers worked overtime. It was a worldwide health and economic disaster and, frankly, a scary time. Certain companies, however, were on the lucky side of things. Amazon and Netflix come to mind, but Chess.com is also among them. Besides watching more streaming TV, people turned to the internet for distraction. Many decided to pick up chess. “You could track it by country,” said CEO Erik Allebest when talking to the New York Times in 2022. “India locked down, registrations from India went through the roof. Italy locked down, registrations went through the roof.” By the end of March 2020, Chess.com was looking at a projected growth for the next three months that wasn’t supposed to happen in the next ten years. The general consensus was that such a craze would never happen again, but we were wrong. It was only the first wave. In that single month of March 2020 the playing server crashed several times. In two weeks, the number of people playing games at the same time doubled from about 40,000 to 80,000. The live server developers regularly noticed spikes in server activity that led to instability, but soon managed to fix it. Over-the-board chess events were canceled worldwide due to the pandemic. The prestigious Candidates Tournament in Yekaterinburg, Russia, was halted halfway and would resume only a year later. Just about the only over-the-board chess you could witness occurred when the chess hustlers, now wearing facemasks, returned to J. Hood Wright Park in Washington Heights in Manhattan in April 2020—just as they did to Manhattan’s Washington Square Park, London’s Holland Park, or Paris’s Jardin du Luxembourg. No matter what disaster strikes the planet, people want to play chess. And that includes Magnus Carlsen. In that same month of April 2020, just into the first of the COVID-19 lockdowns, Carlsen took the initiative to create an online tournament with seven of his biggest rivals (and an impressive $250,000 prize fund) called the Magnus Carlsen Invitational. This event, the richest online chess tournament thus far that could be watched online on Chess24 (and on Norwegian television), would change top-level chess significantly. Its name-giver, Carlsen, commented: “Chess is unique in the sports world as the moves are the same whether played on a wooden board or a computer screen. This is a historic moment for chess, and given that it’s possible to continue top professional play in an online environment, we have not only the opportunity but the responsibility to players and fans around the world who need a distraction when no other live, competitive sport is being played.” Carlsen’s initiative was a great success. Fittingly, this first of many online top tournaments to come saw Carlsen clashing with and beating Hikaru Nakamura in the final as both played from their homes. As it ended, commentator/grandmaster Jan Gustafsson thanked the viewers for watching, before adding, “Not that you guys have any other choices. Let’s face it, there’s no other sports going on.” Carlsen was nothing less than a visionary here. Almost right after his event was over, a big online team event, the Online Nations Cup, was co-organized by Chess.com and FIDE. It was broadcast in 12 languages and exceeded the viewership of traditional tournaments. That is not even considering the numbers in China, where China Sport & Leisure TV and CCTV channels peaked at over 900,000 concurrent viewers during the tournament’s final between Team USA and Team China. As several more online tournaments followed, alongside Chess.com’s weekly Titled Tuesday events, the calendar was suddenly filling up nicely again for many of the world’s best players. Meanwhile, chess fans had something to enjoy while stuck at home. Things got even better when Carlsen announced bigger plans in May: the launch of the Magnus Carlsen Tour, consisting of four online super tournaments culminating in a Grand Final in August, for a $1 million prize fund. Mainstream media started to notice. “Chess Thrives Online Despite Pandemic,” headlined the New York Times, while the Wall Street Journal proclaimed, “Chess Is the New King of the Pandemic.” The newspaper noted that aside from playing chess, watching chess had become a much more popular pastime as well: “Aficionados tuned in just to watch—and not even play—more than ten million games in April, a jump of 97 percent from February.” Talking to Forbes, the American grandmaster and popular commentator Maurice Ashley explained how special this was when just about every other sport in the world was halted: “The good news for chess is at least chess can actually do it. Major sports can’t. LeBron (James) can’t play against Steph Curry, or the Lakers can’t play against the Bucks with everybody in their living room. In chess, the best of the best can play each other without missing a beat.” In the fall of 2020, Play Magnus announced a second string of tournaments for the new year. This time it was called the Champions Chess Tour, which ran from November to September for a $1.5 million prize fund and included ten tournaments. Carlsen himself won and would repeat that in 2022, when Chess.com held its own series, the Chess.com Global Championship, for a $1 million prize fund. The Filipino-American top grandmaster Wesley So won that one but lost to Carlsen in the 2023 Tour final. I spoke to So, then ranked tenth in the world, in September 2023 during a tournament in Amsterdam. He and his adoptive mother, Lotis Key, gave me a fascinating perspective on what the legacy of the pandemic meant for top players. “Before 2020, I used to play one tournament a month, and now it’s at least two,” said So. “The schedule is like a jigsaw puzzle,” added Key. The thing is: many lucrative online tournaments continue to be organized alongside the traditional over-the-board tournaments that resurfaced after the COVID restrictions were removed. And even some new physical events have appeared. Not only has the general interest in chess exploded, but so have the opportunities for top players to play in money tournaments. Looking at what So played in the full year of 2023, on- and offline, I counted 35 tournaments, meaning almost three tournaments a month. So told me his earnings compared to pre-pandemic had doubled toward roughly $700,000 a year, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s more now. One chess tournament that emerged during the pandemic wasn’t suitable for So—or his grandmaster colleagues—but stood out nonetheless: PogChamps. First held in June 2020, it was an event the chess world had never seen before. Having been trained by experts like Hikaru Nakamura, Daniel Naroditsky, and Alexandra Botez, 16 of Twitch’s most followed esports streamers competed for their share of $50,000 in prizes. Among the participants were Boxbox (Albert Sun Zheng, a League of Legends player), Nate Hill (a Fortnite player) and Yassuo (Mohammad Abdalrhman, also League of Legends). It was the first time that amateur players, often close to absolute beginners, were playing a tournament that Chess.com broadcast live on Twitch. This aspect of PogChamps also raised eyebrows: the level of play was a fair bit lower than what the average fan was used to when watching a chess broadcast. A schism was visible in the chess world. On one side, you had serious players who were quite critical of this new phenomenon. Having invested years or even decades into the game, educated with the knowledge of the great masters from the past—for whom the Lucena position or the Sveshnikov Sicilian was standard knowledge—these strong amateurs deemed the likes of PogChamps a superficial form of entertainment. Wasn’t our beautiful ancient game, with its numerous expressions of a deeper meaning in art, literature and science, being turned into fast food here? One chess journalist compared the event to the British reality TV series I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, which he described as “the emblematic format of trash TV,” and claimed that letting beginners play for an audience was “something one should never do.” The Russian top grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi was initially critical as well, tweeting that the show was “popcorn stuff” that was “replacing and displacing any real chess content”—a prospect he found “just terrifying.” Later, he toned it down by saying, “I’m obviously happy more and more people are getting involved [in] chess.” And, indeed, those serious chess fans didn’t need to watch it, did they? As long as PogChamps wasn’t replacing any of the traditional tournaments but added something for a new audience, what was wrong with it? Sure, but Chess.com was advertising the event as loudly as any serious tournament. All broadcasts were placed on the home page; chess fans couldn’t miss or avoid it, even if you wanted to. The naysayers saw it as a type of landscape pollution, arguing that it was similar to putting a modern, ugly concrete building next to a thirteenth-century temple. A Reddit member signaled another potential PogChamps issue: the prize money. This person wrote, “I’ve had some time to think about the Twitch chess boom and PogChamps tournament specifically. I think it’s bizarre that a handful of people, who are already well off in their own field, are making quite a bit of money playing chess in a tournament sponsored by the largest chess company in the world, making literally thousands and thousands of dollars to win games in five moves, while many chess professionals struggle to make a living.” Others welcomed this remarkable new event, arguing it was fun to watch. Besides, it did bring in a lot of new fans to the game of chess—fans who were watching these Twitch celebrities playing esports like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, or Hearthstone, and were truly enjoying that their heroes were now trying their luck in the royal game. After the first edition of PogChamps, Chess.com announced that 140,000 new chess fans started following their Twitch channel, which had a record 85,000 concurrent viewers at one point. It says a lot that even three years later, Chess.com’s most-watched video on YouTube, with over 18 million views, is “xQc Gets Check-mated by MoistCr1tikal in 6 Moves!” from that first PogChamps. (The channel’s second most-watched video, about a young Russian grandmaster beating Magnus Carlsen in an over-the-board tournament, has 7.8 million views.) David Llada, FIDE’s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at the time, was among the early fans of PogChamps, and said, “Is it silly? Yes! Are we making a show out of absolute beginners blundering pieces? Yes! So what?” Chess.com’s Vice President of Esports, Michael Brancato, told me, “The whole internet was talking about it because it was a novel, fun thing. Everyone plays chess, or knows about chess, but it was the first time that it had any kind of mainstream exposure. All the big people are playing, and they’re all bad at it, and it’s funny because everyone is bad at chess. It was a very relatable thing for a lot of people.” At the time of writing, PogChamps has been held five times. The second edition took place in the fall of 2020. In the third edition, held in early 2021 for an increased prize fund of $100,000, even bigger celebrities participated. YouTuber MrBeast, rapper Logic, actor Rainn Wilson, and poker player Daniel Negreanu helped attract over 375,000 concurrent viewers. PogChamps 4 was officially sponsored by cryptocurrency marketplace Coinbase, whose $100,000 prize pool was matched by an additional $100,000 from Chess.com for charity. PogChamps 5 was held in the summer of 2023 in partnership with Ludwig, a popular online content creator who had attracted more than 1.3 billion views to his channels. For the first time, the tournament ended with a live finals event in Los Angeles. It is worth noting that PogChamps has helped some amateur-level streamers to become quite decent chess players in a short time. In her 2022 book Chess Queens, Jennifer Shahade offered the example of PogChamps 2 winner Rumay Wang, known online as Hafu, a Hearthstone champion and streamer with over one million Twitch followers: “Hafu took the competition so seriously, she played hundreds of games and solved thousands of puzzles on an anonymous burner account. After her win she said, ‘I think if you added everyone’s practice it still would be less than what I played. It’s sickening.’ ” Especially impressive was Tyler1’s rapid progress after participating in PogChamps 5. The League of Legends streamer broke a 1500 rating in just three months. The Queen’s Gambit and the Three Waves When discussing chess’s big surge in popularity in 2020, we usually point to the pandemic and The Queen’s Gambit, while perhaps PogChamps deserves a place in the same sentence. What do the numbers say? Let’s look at two periods: before The Queen’s Gambit and after. On October 22, 2020, a day before The Queen’s Gambit was launched, Chess.com had 44 million members. Since March of that year, the figure had grown by 12 million in less than eight months, an average pace of about 1.3 million a month. This “pandemic growth” was almost three times as fast as before COVID. On March 23, 2021, when Beth Harmon had spent five months inspiring people to pick up a chess set, Chess.com boasted 61 million members, an increase of 17 million, or 3.4 million a month. This growth was more than six times faster than before the pandemic. By June 2021 the effect of The Queen’s Gambit was fading. While global lockdowns were lifted Chess.com continued to grow, adding roughly 1.7 million members per month until the end of the summer of 2022. If we view the first months of the pandemic as the first wave, The Queen’s Gambit was the second, leading to the biggest surge in chess popularity since Fischer–Spassky in 1972. By then we had seen the peak of the chess mania, right? Wrong. A completely unexpected third wave started in December 2022—a month that broke the previous record of January 2021 for new registrations. As 4.6 million new followers joined in that single month, the site broke the magic barrier of 100 million registered members, only 14 months after reaching 50 million. (Ten months later, in October 2023, the site would reach 150 million.) January and February 2023 smashed that single-month record, with 8.9 million new registrations for both. After that, things started slowing down again, but March (7.5 million) and April (5.7 million) were still higher than any month during the Queen’s Gambit period. “Honestly, the first two weeks, in late November 2022, I didn’t think it was legitimate traffic,” said Chess.com Systems Architect Igor Grinchenko. “I thought it was malicious; it had to be. Traffic went up 10 percent every day, and the same for incoming web requests, bandwidth, load on the server, and everything else. I said, ‘Guys, someone is attacking us.’ Because I know our flows, I know our ups and downs, off-peaks and on-peaks, and I can trace them. There is also seasonality and stuff. Then I started looking at deeper metrics that cannot be affected by malicious traffic—let’s say the number of games played, the number of users online. And then I realized: this is legitimate. And we have to do something about it.” At its peak, Chess.com was accommodating over ten million active users on a single day. That spiked on January 20, 2023, when traffic on Chess.com had nearly doubled since the beginning of December 2022. On February 3, a record 403,000 members joined in 24 hours, over 200,000 more than at the peak of The Queen’s Gambit. Over a billion games were played for the first time in a month. A stunning 42.4 million games were played on a single day on March 2, 2023 (including games against bots). Meanwhile, the Chess.com app briefly occupied #1 in many countries’ Top Free Games section of the iOS app store. The boom was not just happening online. In April 2023, the Washington Post ran a story headlined “Teachers Nationwide are Flummoxed By Students’ New Chess Obsession.” A month later, CBS Bay Area wrote that chess was “sweeping classrooms across the country.” It wasn’t limited to the US either: the Dutch newspaper Het Parool ran a similar story noting that children were suddenly playing chess fanatically in school cafeterias and that Amsterdam chess clubs were facing waiting lists for teenage members. The American entertainment website Polygon, which focuses on video games and popular culture, noted that the chess mania was happening suddenly: “Schools that don’t have chess clubs are rushing to start them. Teachers are confused but pleased to see a wholesome new hobby. Administrators are struggling with how chess is disrupting classrooms at times, and are blaming it for attention issues and drama in classrooms and hallways. Can you ban chess? Some schools have reportedly had to.” The sudden rise in popularity, particularly among teens, was reflected by Chess.com’s age metrics. The site experienced the biggest growth from players aged between 13 and 17 years old: 549,000 of them visited Chess.com in January and February 2023, more than twice as many as in the two months prior. The second-fastest-growing age group in the same period was 18-to-24-year-olds. Chess was booming, and the Chess.com servers were struggling. More often than not, members were getting served a disappointing 503 error when visiting the site: database overload. “It’s hard to explain how painful it was for me as CEO,” Allebest said. “One of our developers would always talk about underwater stones, meaning you can’t see the problems until it’s too late.… There was a moment when somebody crashed our server because they pasted the entire script of the Bee Movie in the chat window of a game. When it came into the server and was sent back to everybody watching this particular game, it crashed the whole site because of too much data. We didn’t think someone was going to paste in that much text. You know, things like that, over and over and over again.” Chess.com purchased $2 million of new hardware—web servers, database servers, a new live chess server, load balancers, and additional service machines. After a few weeks of setting up, separating database tables, sharding databases (a way to spread the load), and other ways of optimizing, things were under control again. A graph of Chess.com’s membership growth between September 2016 and December 2023 clearly shows the three waves of popularity. The first two waves of popularity in 2020 were easy to explain: the pandemic (with PogChamps) and The Queen’s Gambit. But where did that third, and by far biggest wave, come from? Well, in this case, it was a combination of multiple individual events happening in a short period that all helped boost the popularity of chess to stratospheric heights. Some happened in late 2022 and have already been mentioned in this book, such as the Carlsen–Niemann affair, the Instagram picture with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and the Chessboxing event. And then, in January 2023, a furry, meowing phenomenon contributed even more. When Chess.com launched, on May 18, 2007, the only possibility to play chess on the site had been against the computer. Many years later, that remains one of the most popular activities for its members, partly because of some added fun elements. After Chess.com acquired one of the world’s strongest chess engines, Komodo, in May 2018, the company started using it to create computer “characters” to play against. Among those fun bots you could challenge were the “holiday bots” (Santa, Holly, Dash, Eve, and Powder), the “zombie bots” (Zombaru, Zombiachtchi, Zombiano, and Zombanny), and the “fake billionaire bots” (Gill Bates, Melon Husk, Zark Muckerberg, Biff Jezos, and Barron Wuffet). On January 1, 2023, new bots were introduced, and one of them instantly became the biggest star in chess (well, for a few weeks at least). That was Mittens, the strongest among five cat bots—the others were Scaredy Cat, Angry Cat, Mr. Grumpers, and Catspurrov. Right from the start, Mittens—an avatar of a big-eyed, kind of sad-looking kitten boasting a silly rating of just one point—took all the attention, as streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Levy Rozman, and the Botez sisters started playing against it. Mittens’s viral fame didn’t just come from its prowess on the chessboard, where it revealed itself as a ruthless killer, but also from the nasty, sadistic comments it provided during games: “I am become Mittens, the destroyer of kings. I exist at this chess board through all times and realities … hehehe. Meow.” According to a story in the Independent, Chess.com users described Mittens as a “chess nightmare,” “a psycho,” and a “terrible, terrible cat.” Chess.com’s famed catbot Mittens, a cuddly pet turned ruthless killer on the chessboard. It was Will Whalen, a student at Hamilton College (majoring in world politics) and a part-time contributor to Chess.com’s social media team, who came up with the idea. In an interview in April 2023 he said, “Mittens was originally a pitched joke that ended up getting very out of hand.” Whalen noted that his colleague Sean Becker, who was leading the bots project, wrote Mittens’s interactions with help from other content team members. They ensured that the cat would always start very calm and cuddly but then would “devolve into madness,” even quoting Nietzsche. Not your everyday cat-on-the-internet experience. The Rise of the Streamers The decade between 2004 and 2014 saw many battles in the technology industry. There was the social media arms race with MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, but also the vertical distribution arms race: who would win the live streaming battle? While YouTube initially remained limited to video on demand, several live-streaming video websites started popping up: Ustream (acquired by IBM in 2016), Livestream.com (acquired by Vimeo in 2017), and Justin.tv, all launched in 2007. The latter won the battle with its spin-off Twitch, which started in 2011 and was dedicated to gaming. These were the years when the video gaming industry started to blow up with games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Dota. In August 2014, when Twitch had gathered over 50 million users, it was acquired by Amazon for $970 million. Around 2013, Rensch got in touch with Twitch’s Director of Creator Development at the time, Markus “djWHEAT” Graham, who had a long history of providing commentary at video game tournaments since the late 1990s. More importantly, Graham saw the potential for chess. Previously, Chess.com had been using Livestream.com, but Twitch had an altogether different vibe. “Rather than just viewing these broadcasting tools as an opportunity to serve the community, we actually could grow the community because we were reaching the gaming audience, which was a larger community than ours,” said Rensch. Rensch himself had had plenty of experience as a streamer before chess streaming became a thing. One of the first examples of something resembling chess streaming occurred when Rensch created his first weekly “Bullet Brawl” video in 2012, which consisted of a chessboard, the Chess.com logo, and Rensch’s voice. It was a concept that originated from Chess.com’s “Live Sessions” that had existed for three years, but this time, it was all about fun. As Rensch was playing bullet, he provided humorous commentary. In that first video, he noted, “The whole idea of a Bullet Brawl Thursday is we’re going to play two to three bullet games and focus more on the excitement of the game than on the analysis afterward and whether it was a perfect thing. The perfection of it is that it’s flawed.” The idea of making jokes and talking crap while playing a game of chess was born. “What Hikaru and Levy and the others are doing right now is basically Bullet Brawls,” said Rensch. “Despite the name, the Live Sessions were actually pre-recorded. Bullet Brawls was the first time we did it for a live audience, with chat running. And, for me, this was probably the first product on the perfect intersection of what chess was always missing. Over-the-board chess was always going to be a quiet, serious game. You can’t talk; it would distract your opponent. But online streaming, with your own conscious thoughts, was born for this, changing the way people perceived chess. It was like, ‘Oh, I’m inside the head of a titled player!’ ” Around the same time, the first chess-focused channels appeared on Twitch: Gerard Bailleau’s ChessNetwork, Tryfon Gavriel’s Kingscrusher, and, most prominently, Chessbrah, the account run by the Canadian players Eric Hansen (the grandmaster we met in Chapter 7 who first discussed the anal beads theory during a stream) and master Aman Hambleton, who would become a grandmaster a few years later. Both were born in 1992. The Chessbrahs were, and still are, a group of friends living in the same house in Toronto, Canada, who basically just love to hang out and play chess online—something they managed to turn into a business before anyone else. In the spring of 2024, Chessbrah had 325,000 followers on Twitch, 332,000 subscribers on YouTube, and another 9,470 followers on Kick, a Twitch rival platform that launched in 2022 and where the Chessbrahs started an account in June 2023. They had several part-time editors and one full-time operations manager running the merch store and channels. “I started streaming because [I] just wanted to show my screen to friends,” Hansen told me. “There wasn’t share screen back then on MSN Messenger, and Skype was a bit annoying and too formal anyway.” He and his friends were already playing a lot of blitz and bullet chess on different chess platforms, and streaming made it easier to follow and chat with each other. “It was just a community feel, to stay in touch.” Like many of the streaming video pioneers, Hansen started somewhere in 2010 on Livestream.com before moving to Justin.tv and then Twitch. “There wasn’t yet a chess community there, but I created an account because I was into video computer games, and this way, I could watch Starcraft, Age of Vampires, the strategy games, the shooter games. But sometimes we would stream our-selves, playing casual chess and just chatting.” In the fall of 2014, Hansen decided to take streaming more seriously. He bought a desktop computer and two screens, creating a proper setup. He took up the name “Chessbrah,” which he was already using as an online alias, and started streaming in 2015. He was averaging 300 viewers six months later. He streamed over eight hours daily, 60 to 70 hours weekly. “I was really grinding,” he said. “I already played so much bullet and blitz, I was basically addicted. But I was good at it too. So I thought, ‘Why not share that perspective?’ ” Chapter 8 showed that chess addiction is a thing, particularly for online chess. It’s interesting to note that, in the modern era, Hansen and others have shown that streaming can be an outlet, a way of dealing with it, and even a way to monetize it: you can turn your love for chess into a business. Making money from streaming chess would become even easier thanks to cooperation between Twitch and Chess.com a few years later. Chess.com was providing fun live sessions and, on top of that, there were broadcasts of over-the-board events (which I co-produced), Titled Tuesdays, Death Matches, and other events with a growing audience. And then, in 2016, the site organized its biggest event to date: the GM Blitz Battle Championship, a knockout event with only world-class grandmasters. It resulted in a much-anticipated final between Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, won by Carlsen. With a peak concurrent viewership of 36,000, Chess.com’s show was the third most-watched Twitch broadcast that year, behind Hearthstone and Call of Duty, but ahead of all the other major esports. “I always joke that that’s the event where Danny took chess out of the closet,” said Rensch. “Chess came out of the closet on that event because I commented and produced that show by myself from a closet we had made in our studio in Payson, Arizona.” Chess.com launched the PRO Chess League in January 2017, a global team championship with all the games played on the site and live broadcasts on twitch.tv/chess. It was an excellent kickstarter for the new Twitch channel, as some of the best grand-masters were playing, including Nakamura and Carlsen. The Twitch leadership took notice and started new talks with Chess.com. Rensch: “I spoke with Nick Allen, their VP of Esports, who reported directly to Mike Aragon, the Chief Content Officer, who reported to Emmett Shear, the CEO. They were all, like: ‘You guys are crushing it!’ ” Everyone was on the same page: chess had massive potential while hardly anyone was making content typical of Twitch—live, more spontaneous, and less serious. The overwhelming majority of chess video content was either pre-recorded educational material or live broadcasts of top events with commentators targeting club-level players. There was no real chess ecosystem for streaming fun stuff at the time. And so, in November 2017, Chess.com closed a two-year deal with Twitch, which would provide the site a monthly fee intended for orchestrating and fostering the growing chess community. Twitch was now a sponsor for Chess.com’s entire lineup of chess events and was going to help grow the global brand of chess as an online spectator sport. The Chess.com–Twitch arrangement fared better than anyone’s wildest expectations. “Chess has seen some of the most substantial growth in the same period of time than any other esport in the world,” Twitch’s VP of Global Esports, Justin Dellario, told NBC News in February 2020. The Chessbrah channel was one of the earliest to join Chess.com’s Partner Streamers Program, and they did the early heavy lifting for Twitch’s chess category. “They were the backbone, the ones that carried chess through back then,” said Rensch. Soon, streamers like Hikaru Nakamura, Alexandra Botez, and Levy Rozman followed the Chessbrahs, among many others. The program’s benefits included accelerated partnership status to streamers and being embedded on Chess.com’s integrated broadcast page www.chess.com/tv for more exposure. The only thing the streamers needed to do was play on Chess.com and not elsewhere, and have Chess.com’s green pawn visible somewhere in the video. “I gotta say, Danny was really good at picking people,” said Chess.com’s esports expert Michael Brancato. “He pretty much knew about Alexandra and Hikaru and encouraged them to stream.” At the time, Chess.com was paying these streamers, and Rensch told them: “We think you can make this much money in the future, so keep up with this.” As noted, during the early days of the pandemic, streaming became an alternative way for chess professionals to earn money as the demand for chess content suddenly increased. Between March and August of 2020, fans watched 41.2 million hours of chess on Twitch, four times as many hours as in the previous six months, according to the analytics website SullyGnome. Even a top grandmaster like Peter Svidler, stuck in his home in St. Petersburg, started broadcasting his chess on Twitch. “Streaming during the pandemic was what kept me sane,” he told me. “I would do three or four streams a week, not very long. But it was just self-care. I earned some money over 2021, which would pay for utility bills, which is good, but I wasn’t doing it for the money. I was doing it because, like many other people, I was going a bit crazy. It was incredibly therapeutic in my case. And I’ve spoken to many people who said exactly the same.” Once Twitch got hacked in October 2021, it also became public knowledge that the biggest chess streamers were making decent money, when details of creator payouts were posted on Reddit. It was suddenly out in the open that, from August 2019 until October 2021, Nakamura earned $773,831.12, the Chessbrahs $767,384.56, Levy Rozman $424,505.01, and the Botez sisters $416,813.43. These earnings did not include revenue from merch, sponsorships, or other channels such as YouTube. “Large creators are incredibly well compensated,” Chess.com’s Influencer Relations Manager Christopher Schroth told me in late 2023. “It’s not uncommon to hear creators earning beyond five, six figures a month, if not more.” Right from the start, in early 2017, Brancato and Rensch worked closely together and created a lot of new events and broadcasts. Aside from the PRO Chess League, there was the Speed Chess Championship (the successor of the Blitz Battle Championship), the Junior Speed Chess Championship for young talents, the Women’s Speed Chess Championship, Arena Kings, and more. On top of that, many new chess streamers started to create channels on Twitch, but something was still missing. What this young community of chess streamers needed was somebody carrying the torch. That person became Hikaru Nakamura. From Top GM to the Ninja of Chess—and Back Again Hikaru Nakamura was born in 1987 in Japan to an American mother and a Japanese father. The family moved to White Plains, New York, when he was two. A year later, his parents divorced. He started playing chess at the age of seven and, with his brother, was coached by his Sri Lankan stepfather, FIDE Master and chess author Sunil Weeramantry. Nakamura was a true chess prodigy. In 2003, at the age of 15 years and 79 days, he became the youngest American to earn the grandmaster title, three months sooner than Bobby Fischer had. He has won the US championship five times, taken first prize at the prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Grand Chess Tour, and won an Olympic gold medal. All this was before he decided to take up streaming on that October evening in 2018 in a fish restaurant on the Isle of Man. “It is very important to note that my result in that tournament in the Isle of Man also played a massive role in terms of me starting to stream,” Nakamura told me. “I was actually doing quite well, but then, in the eighth round, I lost this very heartbreaking game. I was not really in a great frame of mind, I was going from tournament to tournament, and I felt a little bit aimless—I think, in large part, because I lost that game. That was one of the biggest things that spurred me to start trying out streaming.” This time around, it was the perfect moment. Only a few weeks later, the world championship between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana took place in London, and Nakamura’s coverage attracted thousands of viewers daily. During that match, Chess.com launched its popular new product Puzzle Rush, and Nakamura embraced it. “He became obsessed with it. He was breaking records, and before you knew it, chess on Twitch would never be the same,” said Rensch. The following year, 2019, was the first that Nakamura became more of a streamer than a chess player, and it was not an easy year. “I do have to give myself a lot of credit because there are many people who were very pessimistic about it,” he told me. His results at the board got worse, and there were a lot of naysayers. Some of my own friends couldn’t understand why, as they put it, he “wasn’t trying to become world champion any more.” Responding to his critics, Nakamura said, “They just thought it was fairly stupid to be doing this streaming in the first place, and because of that, I kept sticking with it.” After bad results at tournaments in India and Germany, he took a five-month break from playing chess, something he hadn’t done for at least a decade. The plan was to take it up again with the US championship in April 2020, but he never reached that point because of the pandemic. Hikaru Nakamura in a recording studio in St. Louis, August 2021. In the buildup to the first PogChamps, Nakamura did a few streams with the Canadian streamer xQc (real name: Félix Lengyel). The former professional Overwatch player is one of several esports streamers who like chess, and the broadcasts where Nakamura taught him the basics were extremely popular. “I think that was the first time I crossed 10,000 viewers on a live stream,” said Nakamura. “That was sort of the moment I realized it was actually a very big deal, that it was something very serious and in a different kind of way.” Then PogChamps happened. Nakamura was one of the commentators, and his viewership increased even more. At some point, he streamed for 70 days in a row, essentially without a break, grinding like the Chessbrahs. In August of 2020 his channel surpassed the 500,000-follower mark. By that point, he was by far the biggest chess streamer. At the end of that month, he signed with TSM, making him the first professional chess player to sign with an esports organization. (He would represent TSM until June 2022, when he signed with Misfits Gaming.) “You just ride that wave,” he told me. “And afterward I kind of realized that I was quite good at it.” I guessed that it had something to do with his ICC past, and Nakamura agreed: “There were many times when I would actually kibitz with people—not the other player, but with the people who were watching the games while I was playing—and that was something that nobody at the time was doing. In fact, I think even now, nobody does that. When I look back, I think that played a very pivotal role in terms of where I am today. It’s a little bit different, obviously, communicating your thoughts verbally versus in written form, but, for me, I think that having that whole process where I was communicating in some form during the games was like destiny—that I ended up doing what I’m doing now.” Streaming chess does indeed seem to be the perfect way of communicating for Nakamura, who doesn’t always come across as a great communicator away from the computer. The American top grandmaster is generally considered a brilliant player who also has his share of haters. Starting from his early days on the ICC, where he was super-strong at an early age, many disliked him for being caustic, as he sometimes left derogatory comments after suffering occasional losses. Nakamura admitted this to me, saying it was his way of finding motivation: “Back then, I hated losing. Not that I don’t still hate losing, but I did not accept losing. I always felt my loss was a horrible thing. So, you know, I would get very angry over losing games online. And, in some cases, I would actually get mad at opponents and things like that. And so, for me, the motivation was, like, getting really angry, using sort of the unhappiness, the anger, all those different things. And so I didn’t necessarily have a lot of fans wanting to talk to me the same way; in fact, a lot of people disliked me back then.” It is remarkable that such a fantastic chess player turned out to be a natural behind the screen and the microphone as well. Brandon Benton, a physics researcher at Cornell University, put it as follows when speaking to the New York Times in September 2020: “He draws people because he’s so good, but also, there are other top players on Twitch that are not as engaging as he is, not as funny, not as in tune with the sort of Twitch culture.” Brenton called Nakamura a “down-to-earth memer and jokester.” Not many—certainly not the naysayers—expected what happened next with Nakamura’s over-the-board career, in 2019. While he was on his way to becoming the best-paid grandmaster in the world through Twitch, easily surpassing Carlsen’s career earnings, Nakamura also started to play some of his best chess in years. Through the FIDE Grand Prix, he qualified for the 2022 Candidates Tournament, and then he won the 2022 Fischer Random World Championship. In 2023 he came first at the super-strong Norway Chess tournament (climbing back to second place in the world rankings), and thanks to another excellent second place in the FIDE Grand Swiss in October, he qualified for the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, his second in a row. It was a growing list of impressive achievements for any chess player—but an out-of-this-world performance for a streamer. How did he do that? “There’s a couple of reasons,” he told me. “First of all, the financial strain of playing chess professionally. You’re always thinking about supporting people: your family and your partner. And I think that definitely played a huge role in terms of my performance. There were many situations where I would just make quick boring draws rather than try to fight. Rather than trying to win, rather than trying to enjoy the game. Now, I don’t have the financial worries or concerns, which plays a huge role.” Not unimportant was that, since October 2020, Nakamura had been with the Iranian American chess player Atousa Pourkashiyan, and in the summer of 2023 they got married: “It’s also about having the right people in your life. I’m very fortunate that I have someone who is extremely supportive, who’s nothing but positive and very helpful.” In October 2022, while talking to The Guardian, the experienced chess commentator and English grandmaster Daniel King explained Nakamura’s success: “Nakamura was noted for being fantastically strong at bullet chess long before it was sort of hip to play online, and he has turned into the perfect chess streamer, making millions. He’s gobby. He’s opinionated. He doesn’t care about upsetting people. He’s basically just hacked an online algorithm that means you’re going to be successful.” By early 2024 Nakamura had 1.9 million followers on Twitch. Since March of that year, his main channel has been on Kick. He has 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube and 551,000 followers on X. All the “GMHikaru” channels combined are run by a team of six or seven people. Nakamura told me that he is making about four to five times as much money as when he was still a professional chess player. In 2020 and 2021 alone he earned more than during his entire playing career. It’s an incredible story. That player who once slept on my couch and started playing on the ICC right after waking up is indeed nothing less than the Ninja of chess. The Biggest Chess YouTuber of All Born in 1995 in Brooklyn, New York, Levy Rozman is eight years younger than Nakamura. He was among the earliest Twitch streamers, and even helped Nakamura in the early days, providing commentary on the GMHikaru channel when Nakamura was playing an over-the-board tournament. Rozman, however, is most famous for running the biggest chess channel on YouTube. He started playing chess when he was six years old. “I was a very hyper child, and my parents needed to put me in after-school, like, after 3 p.m.,” Rozman told me. “They wanted to put me into art class or chess, but chess was $5 more expensive than art, and my dad said, ‘He is too hyper for chess; he’s gonna get kicked out of chess class.’ But it turned out I really liked chess, for some reason, and I stuck to it like a magnet. I never went to art class because I wasn’t very good, and I found chess so fascinating, and I became obsessed with it.” Rozman started as a scholastic chess coach in 2014 and earned the international master title in 2018. He completed a bachelor’s degree in statistics and quantitative modeling in 2017 at New York’s Baruch College. After that, “It was going to be something corporate, consulting, investment banking, actuary, or data science,” he said. “I was going to a lot of networking events on college campuses to meet people. And I was trying to talk to the parents of my chess students, who worked at Barclays Bank, Deloitte, to try to get interviews, because referrals are really powerful. But none of it ever worked.” Rozman’s story is slightly different from other streamers because he soon began focusing on YouTube after starting on Twitch. He created his channel on August 7, 2018, and, being a New Yorker, he called it GothamChess. It was only on April 19, 2020, about a month and a half into the pandemic, that he uploaded his first video. Duly named “GothamChess 1st Video,” he showed and explained a beautiful three-minute blitz game between the American grandmasters Daniel Naroditsky and Hikaru Nakamura. In this video, you could already see Rozman’s inspiring presentational style and his talent for explaining chess to lower-level players. Levy Rozman, a.k.a. GothamChess, the biggest chess YouTuber—with over five million subscribers. In hindsight, the choice of YouTube was a smart move. “After The Queen’s Gambit came out in late 2020, everything started to change, and YouTube started to become more important than Twitch,” Nakamura explained. “The Twitch boom was when all the chess content creators laid the foundation, but, thanks to The Queen’s Gambit, you had all these people that were naturally driven to chess; they go on the internet and search for content, and it’s much more natural for them to go to YouTube.” Right from the get-go, Rozman started creating YouTube tutorials. He made two videos a day for about six months. And then, when The Queen’s Gambit came out—or rather, in the weeks before—he noticed something interesting: his video about the chess opening called the Queen’s Gambit suddenly surged to 700,000 views. He realized this was because YouTube would serve viewers with this video in the sidebar after they’d watched a trailer for the Netflix show. If anyone talks about “cracking the algorithm,” it’s this kind of thing. Rozman started to understand how YouTube works. From then on, he chose his topics based on what he knew the chess fans were looking for: videos about the most famous players, the most-searched openings, and bots. This new strategy worked, and on June 1, 2021, he broke the magical barrier of a million subscribers to his YouTube channel. GothamChess is one of the streamers originally convinced by Danny Rensch to take streaming seriously. Also, at the start of what I have called “the third wave,” it was Rensch who inspired Rozman during a phone call in the fall of 2022. Rensch was at an anniversary dinner with his wife but picked up the phone anyway, telling her, “I think I’m talking with one of the future stars of chess.” Rozman told me about this moment: “ ‘We need to talk about a really serious topic,’ Danny said, and I was, like, ‘Oh, shit! What did I say? What joke did I make? Did I mention Lichess somewhere?’ And he said, ‘I don’t mean to overstep, but I think you’re making a huge mistake. You’re not focusing enough on short-form content.’ I said, ‘But there’s no money, why would I? It’s so stupid.’ And then I did it, and it’s unbelievable.” Rozman started creating lots of short-form video content where he covered trending topics, funny moments from the chess world, or showed quick ways to checkmate your opponent. “He turns it into something incredibly entertaining in 60 or 30 seconds or less,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “It’s highly repeatable, highly watchable.” On December 24, 2022, Rozman broke two million subscribers on YouTube, and the third wave pushed him to three million just 59 days later, on February 20, 2023. He got 25–30 percent of his lifetime views in that period. On November 21, 2023, Rozman tweeted: “One year ago, I uploaded my first-ever short-form video content. Since then: Tiktok: 616 million views; IG Reels: 293 million views; YT Shorts: 878 million views; total: 1.787 BILLION views. And, most importantly: these users stick around to watch longer videos and feel more connected to chess in some way.” Since the start of the pandemic, Rozman hardly had a day when he didn’t create a video. If Hans Niemann says or does something, he will make a piece of content about it. If Magnus wins a nice game, he will make some content about it. “It’s like routine,” he said. “It’s one of the only routines I think I’ve successfully been able to implement. You know, everybody wants to sleep better, eat better, go to the gym—and we all stop. Even when I’m on vacation, I take my microphone and my webcam, and in the hotel room I make a video, and then I go enjoy my day.” Apart from his persistence, his intelligent use of YouTube and the short-form content, what was it that made Levy by far the biggest chess YouTuber? “I use humor and am good at explaining things,” he told the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant in January 2023. Half a year later, he elaborated to the site Tubefilter: “Maybe I’m funny. Maybe there’s jokes intertwined. Maybe I explain concepts better, I don’t know. I’ve always been good at talking about chess to an audience that would want to listen because I had to teach kids. It’s very tough. As a 19-year-old, when I started teaching chess, I was put in front of a group of five-year-olds, and I could just do it. That’s like a nightmare. But I was able to do it, so I don’t know.” Chess.com’s Michael Brancato explained Levy’s success to me: “I think it’s his genuine excitement for what’s going on. ‘And he sacrifices … the roooook!’ Stuff like that. People resonate with that energy, and he makes it seem really epic and cool. And he comes off as a very relaxed guy; very energetic but a very approachable guy. He’s easy to understand, he seems cool, but he’s also very good at chess and at explaining advanced concepts.” “I would call him an innovator,” said Chess.com’s Christopher Schroth. “In the same way that the Chessbrahs paved the way for becoming successful on Twitch, Levy did a lot of innovating on the YouTube side.” Aside from the educational content, Schroth pointed out that, like no one else, Rozman has been successful with content related to playing bots, like Mittens, on Chess.com: “I’m screaming to the heavens every day to our creators about how many people play our bots and why they need to be making videos about them.” Rozman is a perfect example of why: five of his six most-watched videos, all with more than five million views, are about playing bots. In June 2024, the GothamChess channel had 5 million subscribers and had broken two billion total views, more than any other chess-focused channel on YouTube. Meanwhile, Rozman had published his first book in October 2023 titled How to Win at Chess, which he described as “a road map from beginner to intermediate.” The book, a New York Times bestseller, is directly linked to his YouTube work through QR codes at the end of chapters, for extra practice. In November 2023, he was included in the Games category of the Forbes Under-30 list as “the internet’s unofficial chess teacher.” The title of his next book could well be How to Win on YouTube. The Holy Grail These days there are hundreds of streamers making daily chess content in dozens of languages. After Rozman and Nakamura, the biggest English-speaking chess channel is BotezLive—Alexandra and Andrea Botez—with 1.3 million followers on Twitch and 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2022 their channel won Best Chess Streamer at the Streamer Awards. The Botez sisters—Alexandra, center, and Andrea, right—in November 2023 at the Saint Louis Chess Club. As the first female streamers who became successful, the Botez sisters have paved the way for other women to make a living through chess. Anna Cramling, Dina Belenkaya, Tallulah Roberts, Alessia Santeramo, Qiyu “Nemo” Zhou, Anna Rudolf, and Anna-Maja Kazarian are among the many female streamers who have demonstrated that the world of chess streaming isn’t as male dominated as the traditional chess world. In fact, sometimes these two worlds become “merged.” Cramling, the Botez sisters, Belenkaya, and Kazarian have sometimes taken a camera with them to play over-the-board tournaments. In cooperation with the organizers, live footage of them at the board has then been live-streamed to their Twitch channels, sometimes accompanied with commentary by a friend. Chess and online streaming cannot be discussed without mentioning Antonio Radić, the Croatian amateur chess player behind the YouTube channel Agadmator. Radić’s was the first chess channel to break one million subscribers, on February 7, 2021. Levy Rozman, who would achieve the same four months later, tweeted: “Congrats, man. Pioneer of the YouTube game and inspiration to a lot of chess players and creators.” Radić makes one video daily in which he shares his knowledge and ideas about chess history and games played in today’s tournaments. It is his positivity that shines through and makes people come back. “There are those who say my daily videos light up their day; some watch it while enjoying a meal, and some fall asleep to it and tell me that I have an incredibly soothing voice,” he told ESPN in August 2020. “There are others who write in to tell me that my videos help them cope with depression, or to let me know that their children are watching chess now instead of Fortnite. Nothing makes me happier.” Meanwhile, the current chess boom in India has been reflected in big success on YouTube as well. The stand-up comedian Samay Raina, and the married couple Sagar Shah and Amruta Mokal, who run the ChessBase India channel, have played an important role in the online video revolution. They have been tirelessly covering the careers of multiple prodigies of a single generation: the siblings Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali Rameshbabu, Arjun Erigaisi, Vidit Gujrathi, Nihal Sarin and, last but not least, Dommaraju Gukesh. The 2024 Candidates winner will play for the world title against Ding Liren shortly after this book comes out. After Rozman surpassed Agadmator, ten more channels broke a million subscribers on YouTube: GMHikaru, ReyEnigma, Chess Talk, Chesscom, BotezLive, ChessBase India, Alencuatro, Samay Raina, Magnus Carlsen, and Anna Cramling. “I felt that I had something to do with chess being popular in the world, and it makes me very happy,” Radić told me. “It’s something that I can always look back on, and it will still make me happy that I was, you know, even a little part of that.” There’s another major reason, though, for the success of the chess streamers: Magnus Carlsen. Even though he is not the world champion any more, the Norwegian is still the number-one ranked player and continues to be the biggest star in chess, and the streamers (and the YouTube algorithm!) know it. A disproportionate amount of videos are about Carlsen, have thumbnails with Carlsen, and scream titles that include Carlsen. When tweeting about something else in October 2023, Carlsen casually noted that Nakamura was “constantly using my name for clicks.” Although Carlsen has been a national celebrity since 2004, when he held Kasparov to a draw in Reykjavík, his father Henrik told me that it is only since the streaming revolution that Carlsen can no longer walk in peace on the streets in Norway. And even though he knows there’s no use in complaining about others making money with his name, Carlsen does have a point when he expresses a slight annoyance. It is similar to the question of whether there can be copyright on chess games, which has been a topic of discussion for over a hundred years. As early as the nineteenth century, top players like Wilhelm Steinitz and Emanuel Lasker complained that others were making money from publishing books that contained their games. When I started filming top players analyzing their games in tournament press rooms in 2007, I also benefited from the performance of others. It is how our society works, but it sometimes feels unfair. It is a big part of the chess revolution that chess is not just something you do any more, but also something you can watch, even if you’re not that good at it yourself. For me, as a chess journalist and early contributor to live broadcasts of chess tournaments in the years 2014–19, it was always the holy grail: how to create a chess show online or on TV that can be enjoyed by people who only know the basic rules of the game? Isn’t chess too complicated to ever be successful? As a player, the true beauty in chess only started to reveal itself after a few years of playing, when I had learned all the basic tactics, concepts and famous players from chess history and their brilliant games. How could you deliver that beauty, that immense culture that belongs to the game, to beginners who are unfamiliar with terms like “Carlsbad Structure” or even something as basic as the en passant rule? Speaking to grandmaster and veteran chess commentator Daniel King gave me the insight that this holy grail wasn’t always out of reach. Even before the internet, a chess broadcast could be successful if it incorporated two important aspects: the players’ personalities and enjoyable commentary set at a low level so that the average TV viewer could follow it with a bit of effort. In 1993 in the UK, Channel 4 television ran an extensive broadcast of the PCA World Chess Championship in London between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. There was an hour-long program at the start of the game, another half-hour broadcast around move 40, followed by a half-hour roundup after the game. King was one of the commentators, alongside grandmasters Jon Speelman and Raymond Keene and the three-time British women’s champion Cathy Forbes. The show’s host was Carol Vorderman, who didn’t know much about chess—and that was perfect. King told me that when he was interviewed for the commentary job, the Channel 4 people wanted to know how he would cover chess. “Look, I want to be a journalist here,” he told them. “If there’s a Wimbledon final, I want to know how the players got there. I want to know about their personalities. I want to know about their style of play. You might not understand exactly what’s going on in a game of chess, but I can tell you about the emotion, and I can tell you about the person playing.” As soon as King told them that, the producers were happy. You could treat chess like any other sport. King had a great talent for providing exciting commentary while keeping the target audience in mind. “We took it from the absolute basics, and if we sometimes delved into something a bit too sophisticated, then Vorderman would say, ‘Hang on! You’ve got to explain that.’ So it was a very natural kind of relationship.” King noted that the longer the match went on (it lasted 20 games, running from September 7 to October 21), the commentary could up their level as the British TV audience started to grasp more and more of the chess concepts—along with Vorderman. She would start saying things like: “I recognize that now; we’ve had this kind of thing before.” Or, “Oh yeah, they castle. They’re always castling, aren’t they?” That 1993 show was a massive success. King continued to provide commentary for both TV and the internet, where his own YouTube channel is called PowerPlayChess. He enjoys the interactive aspect of online broadcasts these days because of the existence of chat: “This provides an extra layer so that you can spark off people. I think this is a fantastic improvement.” Yet still, it seems that what he did back in 1993 had the biggest impact: “I still get people today saying, ‘Oh, yeah, I started chess when I saw you on Channel 4.’ I mean, all the time.” In a way, the streaming revolution is a return to those early days of commentary. The streamers are once again showing that it’s possible to explain concepts entertainingly to newcomers and that it’s possible to have fun chess streams. Watching chess can be fun! This was also reflected in the 2023 end-of-year report of streamcharts.com, which had Chess.com’s channel as the most-viewed English-language Twitch channel (and fifth channel overall) with 11.18 million hours watched. At the same time, the streamers are showing that chess is for everyone. In that sense, it’s not much different from Alfonso X’s Libro de los juegos from the thirteenth century, which included images of nobility and vagrants, young and old, men and women, and Christian, Muslim, and Jewish characters playing chess. The new phenomenon of chess streaming might not be to everyone’s taste, but it stands in a long tradition of democratizing the game and making it more popular across the planet. As it stands, the history is long, and the future is bright for the 1,500-year-old, evergreen board game that continues to reinvent itself while remaining the same. It might well be that the chess revolution has only just started.",

      "content": "Epilogue It has often been claimed that there are 600 million chess players worldwide. I’ve seen the number quoted by world-famous institutions such as the New York Times, CNN, the BBC, and even the United Nations. But where does that number come from and what does it mean? In 2012, a chess events company called Agon undertook some market research in conjunction with the authoritative British polling organization YouGov. The results from polls in the UK, US, Russia, and India, where respondents claimed that they had played chess at least once in the previous week, month, or year, were then extrapolated for the global population, ignoring that the samples were hardly representative of the populations of other counties. Agon triumphantly sent out a press release claiming 605 million chess players globally. When a writer for the Streatham & Brixton Chess Blog asked YouGov about it, their reply was: “I am afraid that we do not have any further information about this and about how that figure was arrived at. The client wasn’t very good at sending through press releases for us to check before they were released into the public domain.” The 600 million figure seemed rather questionable but, 12 years later, I feel it might actually be setting the bar a bit low. In his 2017 book Hit Makers, Derek Thompson explores why certain songs, products, or internet memes become popular and others don’t. One key idea he put forward is that people are drawn to objects that are both new and familiar. For instance, the Star Wars movies became a hit because they followed a classical theme (a hero’s journey) from a known genre (e.g., Westerns) in a different setting (in space). Something similar could be the reason for the chess revolution we experienced in the early 2020s. The ancient chess game is familiar and well respected, but can now be enjoyed in different ways. You can play against anyone anywhere on your phone or watch your favorite chess event or streamer. Enjoying chess is no longer limited to those who have invested hundreds or thousands of hours to learn about all its intricacies. Especially among teenagers, there has been a perception change, where watching and playing chess is considered fun. Chess.com and content creators have played a large role in this. At the same time, I’d like to believe that a major reason behind its recent peak in popularity is chess itself. With its perfect balance between simplicity and complexity, it has demonstrated its power for 1,500 years, so why not in the modern era? As chess is such an evergreen game, all generations have always played it—even against each other. In September 2023 at the Moratalaz Open in Madrid, Spain, 101-year-old Manuel Álvarez Escudaro was paired against eight-year-old Martín Courrieu. They were born 93 years apart. (Manuel won the game.) And while the English grandmaster Michael Adams won the London Chess Classic at age 52 in December 2023, an eight-year-old girl was also making headlines. The incredibly talented Bodhana Sivanandan from Harrow, northwest London, scored 8½ out of 13 at the European Blitz Championship against a field of highly rated grandmasters, international masters, and experts. I am unsure if Fischer, Kasparov, or Carlsen were already as good at that age. She has the potential to go beyond what Judit Polgár achieved. Truly inspiring! Even this author, who has prioritized writing over playing for almost two decades now, still has hopes at times for some sort of a comeback. But the way the game has changed doesn’t make that any easier. Among my friends, just about everyone uses engines and/or Chessable these days, and most amateurs prepare their openings at chess tournaments with them. I believe it is one of the reasons why today’s amateur chess players are much better in the opening phase of the game than, say, a decade ago, when that area used to be my forte. After finishing this book, there’s something in me that screams, “Now you can return to play tournaments again!” But it seems like a bigger challenge than ever because of the amount of opening knowledge I feel I need to catch up with. There are more opportunities than ever to learn the game, but that also seems to make it tougher than ever to get back to. I might give it a try anyway. As I hope to have demonstrated in this book, chess is everywhere, has been around for centuries, and has undergone major changes. Now, the question is, where is it going? At the top level, over-the-board chess suffered a bit of a blow when Carlsen announced in the summer of 2022 that he would no longer defend his classical title. Just like between 1993 and 2006, we are unsure of the FIDE world champion’s status. The Chinese player Ding Liren took over Carlsen’s title in April 2023 after beating Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi, but Carlsen is still the clear number one on the rating list. Not having the sport’s biggest star in its most important event is far from ideal, so the question is whether we should adopt significant changes to bring him back. I am not sure. The long tradition of world championship matches is part of the wonderful chess culture we have, going back to 1886. We have seen quite an exciting Ding–Nepomniachtchi match, with six decisive games in the classical portion. As the Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri told me, “The problem is Magnus’s personal problem, and he makes it sound like it’s a chess problem.” Carlsen’s colleagues still want to fight for the world title and FIDE doesn’t seem inclined to make big changes, so the classical World Chess Championship cycle won’t be going away any time soon. Classical tournament chess, however, might take more of a back seat to other formats and faster time controls, catering to the new generations of fans. In line with this was the inaugural Tech Mahindra’s Global Chess League (GCL) in June 2023, which had a lot of top players participating. With a time control of ten minutes for the whole game and a five-second increment, it was the first official “franchise league” in chess. The same system has revolutionized cricket in the last 15 years with, most notably, the Indian Premier League (IPL). Another new top event in 2023, with an even faster time control (three minutes for the game and a two-second increment), was the World Chess Armageddon Championship Series. According to the organizers, highlights of these knockout events were broadcast on 30 online and TV platforms globally, including CNBC, Channel 4, beIN, and Fox Australia. And there is more to come. In April 2024, a new chess program was announced, to be broadcast next year on BBC2. Produced by Curve Media and commissioned by BBC’s Factual Entertainment, Chess Masters will see eight episodes aired in which highly skilled players from different age groups and backgrounds battle it out across a series of rapid games before one is crowned with the title of Chess Master.

We have seen the same with online events for a number of years now, and those will surely continue to be organized and enjoyed. In fact, I think there’s potential for chess to grow even more. Events like the Speed Chess Championship and the Champions Chess Tour—with their increased production quality, the use of the eval bar, and the focus on players, personalities, and drama—have shown that chess has the opportunity to become a mainstream spectator experience like any sport or competitive game. Two recent tournaments revealed that a format change can be exciting too. Both featured Magnus Carlsen, whose ideas about where chess should be going were tested. To lessen the impact of computer preparation, Carlsen either wants faster time controls in regular chess, or longer time controls in Chess960 (mentioned in Chapter 4). In February 2024 the first Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge was held at Weissenhaus in north Germany. It was the first Chess960 tournament at a long time control, and due to its great success initiator and sponsor Jan Henric Buettner plans to hold more events in the future. A month later, classical chess was played at the Grenke tournament in Karlsruhe (also Germany) but with two games of 45 minutes on the clock per day, instead of one long game. Also here, the fans embraced Carlsen’s idea. In my opinion, these new developments can and should exist alongside our classical tradition. For that, we should perhaps treat chess more like athletics, where different disciplines attract different audiences. An old idea of mine is to treat rapid and blitz chess even more like separate disciplines, with their own world championship qualification cycles. Even though the 100 meters will be the most exciting race to watch for most people, our “marathon” classical world championship matches will always have their loyal fanbase too—potentially, also on TV. Meanwhile, it’s wonderful to see chess keep up with its time, even in a world where social media has become a dominant part of how we spend our days. Content creators produce engaging content daily, some of it cringeworthy but often quite entertaining. While chess remains a cultural icon associated with positive features like intelligence, strategy, and cleverness, the influencers remind people how much they like the game and encourage people to pick it up for the first time, or for the fifth time. From King Alfonso X’s Libro de los juegos and many stories from the Middle Ages, we know that women used to play chess just as much as men. A positive development caused by The Queen’s Gambit is that chess is now getting more popular among girls and women again, and not just among streamers. In December 2020, two months after the Netflix series came out, Chess.com saw an increase of 15 percent among new female registrations, while demand for chess lessons among girls and women also went up. Hopefully, new initiatives such as the Women in Chess Foundation and FIDE’s Gender Equality in Chess Index (see page 95) can help create a safer environment for players of all genders and backgrounds. In the commercial society that we live in, the success of a sport can be measured by which global brands are connected to it. Sponsorship for individual players exists, from Intel’s partnership with Fabiano Caruana to Puma’s with Carlsen. However, the chess world still hasn’t seen big global Western brands affiliated with over-the-board chess events. FIDE’s strong ties with Russia and its problematic leadership over the past decades, as mentioned in the first chapter, didn’t help. For many years now a simple Google search into the FIDE president, whether it was Kirsan Ilyumzhinov or Arkady Dvorkovich, will have chased away a Western brand potentially interested in connecting with the game.

Alongside FIDE, Chess.com is likely to play an even bigger role in the world of chess. Especially after its merger with Play Magnus, the platform has a position close to a monopoly on online chess and a lot of influence. That also brings much responsibility, as Chess.com will have a large say in where chess is heading. As I have worked for the company for over a decade, I am far from neutral here, but I think the game is in good hands. Internally, Chess.com employees often use the slogan “Let’s go chess, let’s grow chess.” It represents the company’s main business strategy: growing the game. Instead of going for a bigger piece of the pie, it is trying to bake a bigger pie. As more and more people are playing and watching chess—likely many more than 600 million now—the future does look bright for chess.",

      "content": "Epilogue It has often been claimed that there are 600 million chess players worldwide. I’ve seen the number quoted by world-famous institutions such as the New York Times, CNN, the BBC, and even the United Nations. But where does that number come from and what does it mean? In 2012, a chess events company called Agon undertook some market research in conjunction with the authoritative British polling organization YouGov. The results from polls in the UK, US, Russia, and India, where respondents claimed that they had played chess at least once in the previous week, month, or year, were then extrapolated for the global population, ignoring that the samples were hardly representative of the populations of other counties. Agon triumphantly sent out a press release claiming 605 million chess players globally. When a writer for the Streatham & Brixton Chess Blog asked YouGov about it, their reply was: “I am afraid that we do not have any further information about this and about how that figure was arrived at. The client wasn’t very good at sending through press releases for us to check before they were released into the public domain.” The 600 million figure seemed rather questionable but, 12 years later, I feel it might actually be setting the bar a bit low. In his 2017 book Hit Makers, Derek Thompson explores why certain songs, products, or internet memes become popular and others don’t. One key idea he put forward is that people are drawn to objects that are both new and familiar. For instance, the Star Wars movies became a hit because they followed a classical theme (a hero’s journey) from a known genre (e.g., Westerns) in a different setting (in space). Something similar could be the reason for the chess revolution we experienced in the early 2020s. The ancient chess game is familiar and well respected, but can now be enjoyed in different ways. You can play against anyone anywhere on your phone or watch your favorite chess event or streamer. Enjoying chess is no longer limited to those who have invested hundreds or thousands of hours to learn about all its intricacies. Especially among teenagers, there has been a perception change, where watching and playing chess is considered fun. Chess.com and content creators have played a large role in this. At the same time, I’d like to believe that a major reason behind its recent peak in popularity is chess itself. With its perfect balance between simplicity and complexity, it has demonstrated its power for 1,500 years, so why not in the modern era? As chess is such an evergreen game, all generations have always played it—even against each other. In September 2023 at the Moratalaz Open in Madrid, Spain, 101-year-old Manuel Álvarez Escudaro was paired against eight-year-old Martín Courrieu. They were born 93 years apart. (Manuel won the game.) And while the English grandmaster Michael Adams won the London Chess Classic at age 52 in December 2023, an eight-year-old girl was also making headlines. The incredibly talented Bodhana Sivanandan from Harrow, northwest London, scored 8½ out of 13 at the European Blitz Championship against a field of highly rated grandmasters, international masters, and experts. I am unsure if Fischer, Kasparov, or Carlsen were already as good at that age. She has the potential to go beyond what Judit Polgár achieved. Truly inspiring! Even this author, who has prioritized writing over playing for almost two decades now, still has hopes at times for some sort of a comeback. But the way the game has changed doesn’t make that any easier. Among my friends, just about everyone uses engines and/or Chessable these days, and most amateurs prepare their openings at chess tournaments with them. I believe it is one of the reasons why today’s amateur chess players are much better in the opening phase of the game than, say, a decade ago, when that area used to be my forte. After finishing this book, there’s something in me that screams, “Now you can return to play tournaments again!” But it seems like a bigger challenge than ever because of the amount of opening knowledge I feel I need to catch up with. There are more opportunities than ever to learn the game, but that also seems to make it tougher than ever to get back to. I might give it a try anyway. As I hope to have demonstrated in this book, chess is everywhere, has been around for centuries, and has undergone major changes. Now, the question is, where is it going? At the top level, over-the-board chess suffered a bit of a blow when Carlsen announced in the summer of 2022 that he would no longer defend his classical title. Just like between 1993 and 2006, we are unsure of the FIDE world champion’s status. The Chinese player Ding Liren took over Carlsen’s title in April 2023 after beating Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi, but Carlsen is still the clear number one on the rating list. Not having the sport’s biggest star in its most important event is far from ideal, so the question is whether we should adopt significant changes to bring him back. I am not sure. The long tradition of world championship matches is part of the wonderful chess culture we have, going back to 1886. We have seen quite an exciting Ding–Nepomniachtchi match, with six decisive games in the classical portion. As the Dutch top grandmaster Anish Giri told me, “The problem is Magnus’s personal problem, and he makes it sound like it’s a chess problem.” Carlsen’s colleagues still want to fight for the world title and FIDE doesn’t seem inclined to make big changes, so the classical World Chess Championship cycle won’t be going away any time soon. Classical tournament chess, however, might take more of a back seat to other formats and faster time controls, catering to the new generations of fans. In line with this was the inaugural Tech Mahindra’s Global Chess League (GCL) in June 2023, which had a lot of top players participating. With a time control of ten minutes for the whole game and a five-second increment, it was the first official “franchise league” in chess. The same system has revolutionized cricket in the last 15 years with, most notably, the Indian Premier League (IPL). Another new top event in 2023, with an even faster time control (three minutes for the game and a two-second increment), was the World Chess Armageddon Championship Series. According to the organizers, highlights of these knockout events were broadcast on 30 online and TV platforms globally, including CNBC, Channel 4, beIN, and Fox Australia. And there is more to come. In April 2024, a new chess program was announced, to be broadcast next year on BBC2. Produced by Curve Media and commissioned by BBC’s Factual Entertainment, Chess Masters will see eight episodes aired in which highly skilled players from different age groups and backgrounds battle it out across a series of rapid games before one is crowned with the title of Chess Master. Camilla Lewis, executive producer for Curve Media, said, “We are delighted to be making this warm, inclusive and clever series, where the emotional as well as strategic stakes are high. There is untapped talent out there and the audience will get unique insights into the psychological and practical gameplay of this age-old but highly accessible game played by all cultures and by people of all kinds.” After Fischer–Spassky in 1972 in the US, Kasparov–Short in 1993 in the UK, and Carlsen–Anand in 2013 in Norway, we’re witnessing once again that chess can be exciting to watch on TV—especially when there is fast action involved. We have seen the same with online events for a number of years now, and those will surely continue to be organized and enjoyed. In fact, I think there’s potential for chess to grow even more. Events like the Speed Chess Championship and the Champions Chess Tour—with their increased production quality, the use of the eval bar, and the focus on players, personalities, and drama—have shown that chess has the opportunity to become a mainstream spectator experience like any sport or competitive game.

Also here, the fans embraced Carlsen’s idea. In my opinion, these new developments can and should exist alongside our classical tradition. For that, we should perhaps treat chess more like athletics, where different disciplines attract different audiences. An old idea of mine is to treat rapid and blitz chess even more like separate disciplines, with their own world championship qualification cycles. Even though the 100 meters will be the most exciting race to watch for most people, our “marathon” classical world championship matches will always have their loyal fanbase too—potentially, also on TV. Meanwhile, it’s wonderful to see chess keep up with its time, even in a world where social media has become a dominant part of how we spend our days. Content creators produce engaging content daily, some of it cringeworthy but often quite entertaining.

      "content": "Appendix: Key Annotated Games Throughout the book I have mentioned particular chess games, many quite famous, some lesser known, but always relevant to the story of how the game has developed over the centuries. For those chess fans eager to play through the moves on a chessboard, you will find them below with my annotations. If you prefer to play through them online, you can find the games also at peterdoggers.com/annotated-games. The games are given in algebraic notation; for an explanation I refer to chess.com/terms/chess-notation. Dilaram Problem 1.♖h8+! ♔×h8 2.♗f5+ Note that at the time this problem was composed, bishops could jump over pieces but moved only two squares diagonally. 2 … ♔g8 3.♖h8+! ♔×h8 4.g7+ ♔g8 5.♘h6# Napoleon—Mechanical Turk Vienna, 1809 1.e4 e5 2.♕f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 Napoleon is going for a quick victory on the battlefield. 3 … ♘f6 The Turk is not falling for this beginner’s trick. It would be Scholar’s Mate after something like 3…d6 4.♕×f7#. 4.♘e2 ♗c5 5.a3 d6 6.0-0 Napoleon develops some pieces and castles, showing that he is not a total beginner. 6 … ♗g4 7.♕d3 ♘h5!? 8.h3?! A loss of time. It was high time to develop a new piece; after 8.♘bc3 White is not much worse actually. 8 … ♗×e2 9.♕×e2 ♘f4 10.♕e1? A terrible square for the queen, after which White is dead lost. 10 … ♘d4 After 10 … ♕g5! 11.g4 (11.g3 allows 11 … ♕×g3+! 12.♔h1 ♕g2#) 11…♘×h3+ 12.♔h2 ♕h4 it’s checkmate soon. 11.♗b3?! 11 … ♘×h3+! Here, Napoleon must have realized things weren’t going très bien for him. 12.♔h2 Black’s trick was 12.g×h3 ♘f3+, a “family check” that wins the queen. 12 … ♕h4! A devastating blow. 13.g3 ♘f3+ 14.♔g2 ♘×e1+ The Turk wasn’t a perfect player either. Here, 14 … ♘f4+! would have forced checkmate: 15.g×f4 (15.♔×f3 ♕h5+ 16.g4 ♕h3#) 15 … ♕g4+ 16.♔h1 ♕h3#. 15.♖×e1 ♕g4 16.d3 ♗×f2 17.♖h1 ♕×g3+ 18.♔f1 ♗d4 19.♔e2 ♕g2+ 20.♔d1 ♕×h1+ 21.♔d2 ♕g2+ 22.♔e1 ♘g1 23.♘c3 ♗×c3+ 24.b×c3 ♕e2# It’s safe to say that Napoleon wasn’t too thrilled when this game ended. 0-1 Anderssen-Kieseritzky London, 1851 1.e4 e5 2.f4 The King’s Gambit, arguably the most romantic of openings. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4!? Much more common is 3.♘f3. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔f1 Of course not 4.g3?? f×g3 and White cannot take back the pawn. 4 … b5 A countergambit Kieseritzky had used to beat Anderssen in an earlier game. The idea is to chase the bishop away from the diagonal that attacks f7, and also, Black might be able to attack that bishop more easily. 5.♗×b5 ♘f6 6.♘f3 ♕h6 7.d3 ♘h5 Black now threatens 8 … ♘g3+. 8.♘h4 ♕g5 9.♘f5 c6 On 9 … g6 10.h4 ♕f6 Anderssen was no doubt planning 11.♘c3 after which Black shouldn’t go 11 … g×f5 12.♕×h5 but 11 … ♗b7 would give him a good position. 10.g4?! This attempt to trap Black’s queen is a mistake. Better was 10.♗a4. 10 … ♘f6 11.♖g1 c×b5? 11 … h5! would be in Black’s favor: 12.h4 ♕g6 13.♗a4 (13.g5 ♘g4 shows the main idea behind 11 … h5) 13 … h×g4 14.♗×f4 d5! Black is doing well. 12.h4 ♕g6 13.h5 ♕g5 14.♕f3 White will take the f-pawn with his bishop next, after which Black’s queen would indeed be trapped, so he needs a desperate measure. 14 … ♘g8?! 14 … ♗b7!? was a remarkable option to Black: 15.♗×f4 ♘×g4! 16.♗×g5 ♘h2+ 17.♔f2 ♘×f3 18.♔×f3 but White is close to winning, thanks to his better development and structure. 15.♗×f4 ♕f6 16.♘c3 ♗c5 17.♘d5!? The logical move 17.d4 is very strong as well, but Anderssen probably already saw the fireworks that will soon appear. A romantic mind! 17 … ♕×b2 18.♗d6!? Offering both rooks! This bishop move is the prelude to a wonderful combination which, however, is not entirely correct. With 18.♖e1 White would keep a winning advantage. 18 … ♗×g1? Now Anderssen gets what he wants. Correct was 18 … ♕×a1+ 19.♔e2 ♕b2! attacking c2, when 20.♗×c5 ♕×c2+ 21.♔f1 ♕×c5 22.♕f4 f6 23.♘d6+ ♔d8 24.♘f7+ ♔e8 25.♘d6+ would be a draw by a repetition of moves (not 25.♘×h8? d6 and Black’s extra piece should win the game). 19.e5! Cutting off the a1-h8 diagonal for the queen, so that g7 is not protected anymore. Even stronger was 19.♖e1. 19 … ♕×a1+ 20.♔e2 ♘a6? Allowing a beautiful mate in three that made this game famous. The best defense was 20 … ♗a6 but after 21.♘c7+ ♔d8 22.♘×a6! White would still be winning: 22 … ♕c3 23.♗c7+ ♕×c7 (23 … ♔c8 24.♘d6#; 23 … ♔e8 24.♘d6+ ♔e7 25.♕×f7#) 24.♘×c7. 21.♘×g7+ ♔d8 And now the key idea: 22.♕f6+!! ♘×f6 23.♗e7# 1-0 Anderssen-Dufresne Berlin, 1852 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 ♗c5 4.b4 The Evans Gambit, named after the Welsh sea captain William Davies Evans. 4 … ♗×b4 5.c3 ♗a5 6.d4 e×d4 7.0-0 d3!? Black doesn’t play 7 … d×c3 because after 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.♗g5 ♕g6 White can develop his other knight with 10.♘×c3 while after the text move, the white pawn on c3 keeps the knight away from that square. 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.e5 ♕g6 Not 9 … ♘×e5?? 10.♖e1 d6 11.♕b5+ winning a piece. 10.♖e1 ♘ge7 11.♗a3 b5? This was not necessary at all. After 11 … 0-0 12.♘bd2 d5! 13.e×d6 (en passant) 13 … c×d6 Black is better. 12.♕×b5 ♖b8 This was Black’s idea: winning time to activate his rook over the b-file. It wasn’t worth a pawn, though. 13.♕a4 ♗b6 Castling would lose a piece: 13 … 0-0 14.♗×e7! ♘×e7 15.♕×a5. 14.♘bd2 ♗b7?! 15.♘e4 ♕f5? Losing too much time. The last try was 15 … d2 16.♘e×d2 ♘d8. 16.♗×d3 Threatening 17.♘f6+ and 18.♗×f5, which is also possible if Black castles. 16 … ♕h5 17.♘f6+!? Objectively speaking, 17.♖ad1 was stronger. 17 … g×f6 18.e×f6 Because ♘e7 is pinned, White will win the piece back and the e-file is opened up. It looks great, but Black can counter, which he does: 18 … ♖g8! 19.♖ad1 ♕×f3? Falling for Anderssen’s brilliant ploy. A better way to make use of the pinned g-pawn was 19 … ♕h3! threatening mate on g2, since 20.♗f1 (not 20.g3? ♖×g3+! 21.h×g3 ♕×g3+ 22.♔h1 ♕×f3+ 23.♔h2 ♕×f2+ 24.♔h3 ♕f3+ 25.♔h2 ♘e5 and it’s Black who has a winning attack.) 20 … ♕f5 leaves neither player with a clear advantage. What follows is one of the most famous combinations in chess history. 20.♖×e7+! ♘×e7 21.♕×d7+!! Just brilliant. 21 … ♔×d7 22.♗f5+ ♔e8 23.♗d7+ ♔f8 24.♗×e7# 1-0 Levitsky-Marshall Breslau, 1912 1.e4 e6 The French Defense. 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 c5 4.♘f3 ♘c6 5.e×d5 e×d5 6.♗e2 ♘f6 7.0-0 ♗e7 8.♗g5 0-0 9.d×c5 ♗e6 10.♘d4 ♗×c5 11.♘×e6 f×e6 12.♗g4 ♕d6 13.♗h3 ♖ae8 14.♕d2 ♗b4 15.♗×f6 ♖×f6 16.♖ad1 ♕c5 17.♕e2 ♗×c3 18.b×c3 ♕×c3 19.♖×d5 ♘d4 20.♕h5 ♖ef8 21.♖e5 ♖h6 22.♕g5 ♖×h3 23.♖c5 On 23.g×h3 comes ♘f3+. Black is winning and can go to almost any square with the queen now, since he has already won a piece, but the spot he chooses is the most spectacular. 23 … ♕g3!! White resigned. The black queen can be taken in three ways after 23 … ♕g3 but they all lose: 24.h×g3 ♘e2#; 24.f×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♖×f1#; 24.♕×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♘×g3+ 26.♔g1 (26.f×g3 ♖×f1#) 26 … ♘e2+ 27.♔h1 ♖c3. 0-1 D. Byrne-Fischer New York, 1956 1.♘f3 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 ♗g7 4.d4 0-0 5.♗f4 d5 6.♕b3 d×c4 7.♕×c4 c6 8.e4 ♘bd7 9.♖d1 ♘b6 10.♕c5 ♗g4 11.♗g5? This allows a brilliant shot. Better was 11.♗e2 when 11 … ♘fd7 12.♕a3 ♗×f3 13.♗×f3 e5! 14.d×e5 ♖e8 is close to equal. 11…♘a4!! 12.♕a3 12.♘×a4 ♘×e4 wins for Black in all lines: 13.♕b4 ♘×g5; 13.♕×e7 ♕a5+ 14.b4 ♕×a4 15.♕×e4 ♖fe8 16.♗e7 ♗×f3 17.g×f3 ♗f8; 13.♗×e7 ♘×c5 14.♗×d8 ♖e8+ 15.♗e2 ♘×a4; 13.♕c1 ♗×f3 14.g×f3 ♕a5+ 15.♗d2 ♘×d2 16.♕×d2 ♕×a4 and d4 will drop. 12…♘×c3 13.b×c3 ♘×e4! Another surprising knight move that involves an exchange sacrifice. It’s all possible thanks to White’s lack in development. 14.♗×e7 ♕b6 15.♗c4 After 15.♗×f8 ♗×f8 White is in big trouble: 16.♕c1 ♘×c3 17.♖d2 ♖e8+ 18.♗e2 ♘×e2 19.♖×e2 ♖×e2+ 20.♔×e2 ♕b5+ 21.♔d1 (21.♔d2 ♗h6+; 21.♔e1 ♗b4+) 21…♕d3+ 22.♕d2 ♗×f3+ 23.g×f3 ♕×f3+ or 16.♕b3 ♘×c3! 17.♕×b6 a×b6 18.♖d2 ♗b4! and also here White will lose material. 15…♘×c3! 16.♗c5 16.♕×c3 is met by 16 … ♖ae8 and 16.♗×f8 ♗×f8 17.♕×c3? ♗b4 is another idea. 16…♖fe8+ 17.♔f1 17.♔d2 ♘e4+ and 17.♘e5 ♗×e5 18.♗×b6 ♗d6+ win for Black. 17…♗e6!! The beautiful point behind the whole combination. 18.♗×b6 18.♗×e6 leads to a pretty mate: ♕b5+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘g3+ 21.♔g1 ♕f1+ 22.♖×f1 ♘e2#. After 18.♕×c3 ♕×c5 19.d×c5 ♗×c3 20.♗×e6 ♖×e6 Black has a winning endgame. 18…♗×c4+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘×d4+ 21.♔g1 ♘e2+ 22.♔f1 ♘c3+ 23.♔g1 a×b6! Black’s minor pieces are much stronger than White’s queen. 24.♕b4 ♖a4 25.♕×b6 ♘×d1 26.h3 ♖×a2 27.♔h2 ♘×f2 28.♖e1 ♖×e1 29.♕d8+ ♗f8 30.♘×e1 ♗d5 31.♘f3 ♘e4 32.♕b8 b5 33.h4 h5 34.♘e5 ♔g7 35. ♔g1 ♗c5+ 36.♔f1 36.♔h2 ♗d6 is resignable and 36.♔h1 ♘g3+ 37.♔h2 ♘f1+ 38.♔h3 ♗×g2 is checkmate. 36…♘g3+ 37.♔e1 ♗b4+ 38.♔d1 ♗b3+ 39.♔c1 ♘e2+ 40.♔b1 ♘c3+ 41.♔c1 ♖c2# 0-1 This game never ceases to amaze me. Fischer-Mac Hack (Greenblatt) Cambridge, MA (2), 1977 1.e4 e5 2.f4 Like the Romantics in the 19th century, Fischer plays the King’s Gambit. At that time, computers were very materialistic and could not see deep enough to understand White’s compensation. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4 In the footsteps of Anderssen and others. 3 … d5!? 4.♗×d5 ♘f6 5.♘c3 ♗b4 6.♘f3 0-0 7.0-0 ♘×d5 8.♘×d5 ♗d6?! So far, Black’s play wasn’t actually that bad, but only if it was followed up by 8 … f5! 9.♘×b4 f×e4 winning back a piece, since if White removes ♘f3, Black has ♕d4+ and the knight on b4 drops. 9.d4 Now White is much better, in fact close to winning already, thanks to his strong pawn center. 9 … g5?! Trying to hang on to the pawn on f4 only makes matters worse. 10.♘×g5! An easy sacrifice for Fischer. 10 … ♕×g5 11.e5 ♗h3 12.♖f2 ♗×e5 The bishop is also lost after 12 … ♗e7 13.♗×f4 ♕h4 14.g3. 13.d×e5 c6 14.♗×f4 ♕g7 15.♘f6+ ♔h8 16.♕h5♖d8 16 … ♗e6 allows 17.♗h6. 17.♕×h3 ♘a6 18.♖f3 ♕g6 19.♖c1 ♔g7 20.♖g3 ♖h8 Now White can take the queen, but thanks to the pin over the g-file it’s actually mate in one. 21.♕h6#! 1-0 Chess 4.7-Levy Toronto, 1978 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 f5 The Latvian Gambit. 3.e×f5 A fine move while 3.♘×e5 is considered to be even stronger. 3 … e4 4.♘e5 ♘f6 5.♘g4?! d5 6.♘×f6+ ♕×f6 7.♕h5+? ♕f7?! Levy misses the idea 7 … g6! 8.f×g6 h×g6 9.♕×d5 ♖h5! and after for example 10.♕c4 ♘c6 Black will have very quick development. Modern engines consider the position almost lost for White. 8.♕×f7+ ♔×f7 9.♘c3 c6 10.d3! e×d3! 10 … ♗×f5 11.d×e4 d×e4 would be dangerous because of 12.♗c4+ ♔f6 13.g4! ♗g6 14.h4. 11.♗×d3 ♘d7 12.♗f4 ♘c5 13.g4 ♘×d3+ 14.c×d3 White remains a pawn up in the endgame. 14 … ♗c5 15.0-0 h5 16.♘a4 ♗d4 17.♗e3 ♗e5 18.d4 ♗d6 19.h3 b6 20.♖fe1 ♗d7 21.♘c3 h×g4 22.h×g4 ♖h4 23.f3 ♖ah8 24.♔f1 ♗g3? Missing a win with 24 … ♖h3! 25.♔e2 ♖h2+ 26.♔d3 (on 26.♗f2 Black plays the same move) 26 … ♗c8! and Black’s activity is overwhelming. 25.♖e2 ♗c8 26.♔g2 ♗d6 27.♗g1 ♖h3 28.♖ae1 ♖g3+ 29.♔f2 ♖hh3 30.♖e3 ♗a6 31.♘e2 ♗×e2 32.♖1×e2 c5 33.f4 ♖×e3 34.♖×e3 ♖h4? 34 … ♖×e3 35.♔×e3 c4 was about equal, but Levy wants to win this game. 35.♔g3 ♖h1 36.♗f2 ♖d1 37.♖a3? It was beyond Chess 4.7’s horizon to see the line 37.g5! ♖×d4 38.♖e6 ♗×f4+ 39.♔f3 and the black rook keeps getting attacked so that it cannot stay on the fourth rank after which ♗f4 will hang: 39 … ♖c4 40.b3 ♖b4 41.a3. 37 … c×d4 38.♖×a7+ 38 … ♔f8? Necessary was 38 … ♔e8 when it’s equal again. White cannot play 39.♖×g7? because Black comes first: 39 … d3 40.♔f3 d2 41.♔e2 ♖f1! 42.♔×d2 (42.♔×f1 d1♕+) 42 … ♖×f2+ 43.♔d3 ♖×f4. 39.♖d7! ♖d3+ 40.♔g2 ♗c5 41.♖×d5 ♖d2 42.b4! ♗×b4 43.♖d8+ ♔f7 44.♖d7+ ♔f8 45.♖×d4 ♖b2 46.♔f3 ♗c5 47.♖d8+ ♔e7 48.♗h4+ ♔f7 49.g5 g6 50.♖d7+ ♔f8 51.f×g6 ♖×a2 52.f5 ♖a3+ 53.♔g4 ♖a4+ 54.♔h5 ♖d4 55.♖c7 ♗e7 And Levy resigned, not waiting for 56.f6. It was a historic first win by a computer against a master-level player. 1-0 Karpov-Kasparov Moscow (9), 1984 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.♘f3 c5 The Tarrasch Defense. 4.c×d5 e×d5 5.g3 ♘f6 6.♗g2 ♗e7 7.0-0 0-0 8.♘c3 ♘c6 9.♗g5 c×d4 10.♘×d4 h6 11.♗e3 ♖e8 12.♕b3 ♘a5 13.♕c2 ♗g4 14.♘f5 ♖c8 15.♗d4 ♗c5 16.♗×c5 ♖×c5 17.♘e3 ♗e6 18.♖ad1 ♕c8 19.♕a4 ♖d8 20.♖d3 a6 21.♖fd1 ♘c4 22.♘×c4 ♖×c4 23.♕a5 ♖c5 24.♕b6 ♖d7 25.♖d4 ♕c7 26.♕×c7 ♖d×c7 27.h3 h5 28.a3 g6 29.e3 ♔g7 30.♔h2 ♖c4 31.♗f3 b5 32.♔g2 ♖7c5 33.♖×c4 ♖×c4 34.♖d4 ♔f8 35.♗e2 ♖×d4 36.e×d4 ♔e7 37.♘a2 ♗c8 38.♘b4 ♔d6 39.f3 ♘g8 40.h4 ♘h6 41.♔f2 ♘f5 42.♘c2 f6 43.♗d3 g5 44.♗×f5 Karpov sees that his knight will be a better piece than Black’s bishop in this endgame, which is limited by the many pawns on light squares. 44 … ♗×f5 45.♘e3 ♗b1 46.b4 g×h4? A mistake, but the reason why was hard to foresee. 47.♘g2!! A fantastic move. White sacrifices a pawn to create an entry point for his king along the h-file. After 47.g×h4 ♗g6 48.♔g3 ♔e6 49.♔f4 ♗h7 White cannot make progress. 47 … h×g3+ 48.♔×g3 ♔e6 Giving up the h-pawn right away, since Black cannot keep it. 48 … ♗g6 49.♘f4 ♗f7 50.♔h4 ♔e7 51.♘×h5 is similar to the game and 51 … ♗×h5 52.♔×h5 loses quickly: 52 … ♔f7 53.♔h6 ♔e6 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.f4 ♔e6 56.f5+ ♔e7 57.♔g7. 49.♘f4+ ♔f5 50.♘×h5 Threatening ♘g7-e8-c7, therefore the king must retreat. 50 … ♔e6 50 … ♗c2 51.♘f4 ♗b3 52.♘d3 and the a6-pawn will drop soon. 51.♘f4+ ♔d6 52.♔g4 ♗c2 53.♔h5 ♗d1 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.♘×d5+? The first error by Karpov. The winning move was 55.♘h5!. 55 … ♔e6 56.♘c7+ ♔d7 57.♘×a6 ♗×f3 58.♔×f6 ♔d6 59.♔f5 ♔d5 60.♔f4 ♗h1 61.♔e3 ♔c4 62.♘c5 ♗c6 63.♘d3 ♗g2 64.♘e5+ ♔c3 65.♘g6 ♔c4 66.♘e7 ♗b7? Now White is winning again. This famous endgame has been analyzed by many grandmasters. Some of them reached the same conclusion as the modern engines: Black could still draw this position with 66 … ♗h1!. 67.♘f5 ♗g2 68.♘d6+ ♔b3 69.♘×b5 ♔a4 70.♘d6 If Black takes on a3, White’s b-pawn simply runs up the board. 1-0 Kasparov-Anand New York (10), 1995 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♘×e4 This move marks the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez (Spanish) opening. 6.d4 b5 7.♗b3 d5 8.d×e5 ♗e6 9.♘bd2 ♘c5 10.c3 d4 11.♘g5!? This remarkable move was first played by Kasparov’s long-time nemesis Anatoly Karpov, also in the 10th game of his 1978 match against Viktor Korchnoi. 11 … d×c3 11 … ♕×g5 is also playable when White wins back the piece with 12.♕f3. 12.♘×e6 f×e6 13.b×c3 ♕d3 Both players had played without thinking so far because the same moves had also appeared in the sixth match game. Here, Kasparov deviates. 14.♗c2!! This move had been suggested by the former world champion Mikhail Tal and carefully checked by Kasparov’s team with the help of the computer. 14 … ♕×c3 15.♘b3 ♘×b3 Played by Anand after 45 minutes of thought. 16.♗×b3 16 … ♘d4 White was offering his rook on a1 but Anand saw that it’s dangerous to take it straight away: 16 … ♕×a1 17.♕h5+ g6 (17 … ♔d8 18.♗g5+ wins the queen on a1 while 17 … ♔d7 18.♗×e6+! ♔×e6 19.♕g4+ ♔f7 20.♕f3+ ♔e6 21.♕×c6+ ♗d6 22.e×d6 also wins for White) 18.♕f3 ♘d8 19.♕f6 ♖g8 20.♗×e6 ♖g7 21.♗a3! ♕×f1+ 22.♔×f1 ♘×e6 23.♕×e6+ ♗e7 24.♕c6+ and White will be up too much material. 17.♕g4! Kasparov insists. Take my rook! 17 … ♕×a1 17 … ♘×b3 18.♕×e6+ ♗e7 19.♗g5 is a simple win. 18.♗×e6 ♖d8! The best move. 19.♗h6! Kasparov was still playing his moves almost instantly as he had analyzed all this before with the computer. 19 … ♕c3 The best defense. 19 … ♕×f1+ 20.♔×f1 g×h6 21.♕h5+ ♔e7 22.♕f7#. 20.♗×g7 ♕d3 21.♗×h8 ♕g6 22.♗f6 ♗e7 23.♗×e7 ♕×g4 24.♗×g4 ♔×e7 Anand has managed to reach the endgame only a pawn down, and he would have chances for survival if he could run his c-pawn up the board, but Kasparov prevents that with an important move. 25.♖c1! c6 26.f4 a5 27.♔f2 a4 28.♔e3 b4 29.♗d1! Kasparov continues accurately. 29 … a3 30.g4 ♖d5 31.♖c4 c5 32.♔e4 ♖d8 33.♖×c5 ♘e6 34.♖d5 ♖c8 35.f5 ♖c4+ 36.♔e3 ♘c5 37.g5 ♖c1 38.♖d6 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov Philadelphia (1), 1996 1.e4 c5 2.c3 Deep Blue’s team had prepared the Alapin Sicilian, to not let Kasparov reach middlegame positions that he knows very well. 2 … d5 3.e×d5 ♕×d5 4.d4 ♘f6 5.♘f3 ♗g4 6.♗e2 e6 7.h3 ♗h5 8.0-0 ♘c6 9.♗e3 c×d4 10.c×d4 ♗b4 11.a3 ♗a5 12.♘c3 ♕d6 13.♘b5 ♕e7 14.♘e5 ♗×e2 15.♕×e2 0-0 16.♖ac1 ♖ac8 17.♗g5 ♗b6 18.♗×f6! g×f6 Not 18 … ♕×f6? 19.♘d7 and Black loses an exchange. 19.♘c4 ♖fd8 20.♘×b6 a×b6 21.♖fd1 f5 22.♕e3 ♕f6 23.d5! An excellent pawn sacrifice that computers in the 1970s likely wouldn’t have played. 23 … ♖×d5 24.♖×d5 e×d5 25.b3! Before taking on b6, Deep Blue first removes a pawn that was hanging. 25 … ♔h8 26.♕×b6 ♖g8 27.♕c5 27 … d4? Better was 27 … ♕g5 28.g3 f4 29.♘d6 ♕f6 30.g4 ♖g6! 31.♘f5 h5 32.♔f1 h×g4 33.h×g4 ♖×g4 34.♕c3 ♖g6 with equality. 28.♘d6 f4 29.♘×b7! A human playing against Kasparov would consider this too risky, since the knight is so far away from defending its king. Deep Blue, however, has calculated everything. 29 … ♘e5 30.♕d5! f3 31.g3 ♘d3 32.♖c7 ♖e8 33.♘d6! ♖e1+ 34.♔h2 ♘×f2 35.♘×f7+ ♔g7 36.♘g5+ ♔h6 37.♖×h7+ Kasparov resigned because he saw 37 … ♔g6 38.♕g8+ ♔f5 39.♘×f3 (not 39.♖f7?? ♖h1#) 39 … ♖h1+ 40.♔g2 and now both the knight on f2 hangs and a quick checkmate starting with 41. ♖h5+ is threatened. This was a computer’s first victory against the world champion in a classical time control. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (2), 1997 1.e4 e5 Kasparov usually played the Sicilian, but apparently he figured this to be a more solid choice against a strong computer. 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 The Closed Ruy Lopez (Spanish). 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 h6 10.d4 ♖e8 11.♘bd2 ♗f8 12.♘f1 ♗d7 13.♘g3 ♘a5 14.♗c2 c5 15.b3 ♘c6 16.d5 Closing the center. In the old days, humans would be clearly stronger in closed positions than computers but this game kind of changed that idea. 16 … ♘e7 17.♗e3 ♘g6 18.♕d2 ♘h7 19.a4 ♘h4 20.♘×h4 ♕×h4 21.♕e2 ♕d8 22.b4 ♕c7 23.♖ec1 c4 24.♖a3! Preparing to double rooks on the a-file before taking on b5. 24 … ♖ec8 25.♖ca1 ♕d8 26.f4!? At the time, this was considered to be a stunning move because opening a second front on the kingside was considered a very “human-like” concept. As a result, most commentators overerstimated this pawn move a bit. Modern engines prefer the maneuver 26.♗d1! ♘f6 27.♕a2 g6 28.a×b5 ♗×b5 (White’s three heavy pieces on the a-file prevented 28 … a×b5 as 29.♖×a8 wins a full rook) and, after this small positional victory of isolating Black’s pawns on the queenside, to continue maneuvering with 29.♕d2 h5 30.♗c2 ♗g7 31.♘f1. 26 … ♘f6 Better was 26 … e×f4 27.♗×f4 g6. 27.f×e5 d×e5 28.♕f1?! ♘e8?! Kasparov missed a chance to equalize the game with 28 … a5! 29.a×b5 a×b4 30.♖×a8 ♖×a8 31.♖×a8 ♕×a8 32.♕×c4 ♕a1+ 33.♔h2 ♕e1! attacking ♗e3 and c3. 29.♕f2 ♘d6 30.♗b6 ♕e8 31.♖3a2 ♗e7 32.♗c5 ♗f8? Apparently, Kasparov had a blind spot for the move 32 … a5 during this game. After 33.a×b5 a×b4 34.♗×b4 ♖×a2 35.♖×a2 ♘×b5 Black is OK. 33.♘f5! ♗×f5 33 … ♘×f5 34.e×f5 is not better. 34.e×f5 f6 35.♗×d6 ♗×d6 36.a×b5 a×b5 37.♗e4! Another “human-like” move by Deep Blue, depriving Kasparov of the hope to push his e-pawn and bring his bishop to life. 37 … ♖×a2 38.♕×a2 Black has lost the battle over the a-file, and soon White’s heavy pieces will enter his position. 38 … ♕d7 39.♕a7 ♖c7 39 … ♕×a7+ 40.♖×a7 ♖d8 41.♖a5 ♖b8 42.♖a6 ♖d8 43.♖b6 wins a pawn. 40.♕b6 ♖b7 41.♖a8+ ♔f7 42.♕a6 ♕c7 43.♕c6 ♕b6+ 44.♔f1 ♖b8 45.♖a6? A big mistake, due to a bug in the system. Here, Kasparov resigned, not realizing that 45 … ♕e3! saves the draw: 46.♕×d6 and now the key move 46 … ♖e8! when Black’s queen, deeply entered into the enemy position, will pester the white king with endless checks. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (6), 1997 1.e4 c6 The last time Kasparov had played the Caro-Kann in an official tournament game was in 1982. Nevertheless, Deep Blue was fully ready for it … 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 d×e4 4.♘×e4 ♘d7 5.♘g5 ♘gf6 6.♗d3 e6 7.♘1f3 h6? The move that made history, as it was the reason Kasparov would lose this game, and the match. He had gambled that his computer opponent wouldn’t take on e6, but it did, instantly. 8.♘×e6! A piece sacrifice with the intention to keep the enemy king in the center. 8 … ♕e7?! After this, Black is dead lost. Kasparov wants to run with his king to the queenside, but it won’t find safety there. The best continuation was 8 … f×e6 9.♗g6+ ♔e7 10.♗f4 ♘d5 11.♗g3 h5 12.0-0 ♖h6 13.♘h4 and now 13 … ♖×g6! (a return sacrifice to improve the king’s safety) 14.♘×g6+ ♔f7 15.♕×h5 ♘7f6 when Black is clearly worse, but not lost yet. 9.0-0! f×e6 10.♗g6+ ♔d8 11.♗f4 b5 12.a4! ♗b7 13.♖e1 ♘d5 14.♗g3 ♔c8 15.a×b5 c×b5 16.♕d3 ♗c6 17.♗f5 White simply picks up the e6-pawn, so Kasparov decides to give up his queen, but it’s hopeless. 17 … e×f5 18.♖×e7 ♗×e7 19.c4 Crashing through. Kasparov resigned, losing his first match ever. For Deep Blue, which got dismantled after this contest, it was the finest and final victory. 1-0 Topalov-Shirov Linares, 1998 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense. Black allows White to build a pawn center, and plans to attack it later on. 4.c×d5 ♘×d5 5.e4 ♘×c3 6.b×c3 ♗g7 7.♗b5+ c6 8.♗a4 0-0 9.♘e2 ♘d7 10.0-0 e5 Already countering in the center. 11.f3 ♕e7 12.♗e3 ♖d8 13.♕c2 ♘b6 14.♗b3 ♗e6 15.♖ad1 ♘c4 16.♗c1 b5 17.f4 e×d4 18.♘×d4 On 18.c×d4?! Shirov was no doubt planning 18 … f5! to attack the white center even more. 18 … ♗g4 19.♖de1 ♕c5 20.♔h1 a5 21.h3 ♗d7 Black misses a chance to complicate the game with 21 … a4. 22.a4! b×a4 23.♗a2! White simply wanted to remove a defender of the knight on c4. Not 23.♗×a4? ♘b6 24.♗b3 a4. 23 … ♗e8 24.e5 ♘b6 25.f5 ♘d5 26.♗d2? A blunder. Topalov could have won with 26.♕f2! ♕×c3 27.♗b2 ♕b4 28.♗a1! and White is now ready to play 29.f6 and 30.e6 next, leading to a crushing attack, but then we would never have seen Shirov’s beautiful endgame play. 26 … ♘b4! 27.♕×a4 After 27.c×b4 Topalov might’ve hoped for 27 … ♕×d4 28.f×g6 h×g6 29.e6 giving a win for White, but instead, Black counters with 27 … ♕×c2 28.♘×c2 ♖×d2 29.♗b1 a×b4 to win. 27 … ♘×a2 28.♕×a2 ♗×e5 29.f×g6 h×g6 30.♗g5 ♖d5 31.♖e3 ♕d6 32.♕e2 ♗d7 33.c4 ♗×d4 34.c×d5 ♗×e3 35.♕×e3 ♖e8 36.♕c3 ♕×d5 37.♗h6? The only move was 37.♗f6! ♖e2 38.♕g3 when White has enough play against the enemy king to hold the game to a draw. 37 … ♖e5?! Close to winning was 37 … ♕e5! 38.♕f3 ♗e6 39.♕×c6 ♗d5 40.♕a4 ♖b8. 38.♖f3 ♕c5 39.♕a1 ♗f5 40.♖e3 f6 41.♖×e5 ♕×e5 42.♕a2+? After 42.♕a3! White probably has enough counterplay for a draw. 42 … ♕d5 43.♕×d5+ c×d5 44.♗d2 a4 45.♗c3 ♔f7 46.h4 ♔e6 47.♔g1 Now comes one of the most famous moves in chess history. 47 … ♗h3!! A bolt from the blue. This bizarre-looking bishop move happens to be only way to win this position. 48.g×h3 Ignoring the bishop doesn’t help: 48.♔f2 ♔f5 49.♔e3 ♗×g2 50.♔d4 ♔g4 51.♗e1 a3 52.♔c3 f5 53.♔b3 f4 54.♔×a3 ♔f3 55.♔b2 ♔e2 56.♗c3 f3. 48 … ♔f5 49.♔f2 ♔e4 50.♗×f6 50.♔e2 f5 51.♗b2 f4 52.♔f2 d4 and Black simply has too many pawns. 50 … d4 51.♗e7 ♔d3 52.♗c5 ♔c4 53.♗e7 ♔b3 Here Topalov resigned as 54.♔e2 is met by 54 … ♔c2 and one of the pawns will queen. 0-1 l’Ami-Malakhatko Kavala, 2003 1.e4 c5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.d4 c×d4 4.♘×d4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 e5 The Sveshnikov variation of the Sicilian. 6.♘db5 d6 7.♗g5 a6 8.♘a3 b5 9.♗×f6 g×f6 After 9 … ♕×f6?! 10.♘d5 ♕d8 11.♗×b5! a×b5 12.♘×b5 White’s attack is too strong. 10.♘d5 White has a very nice square for his knight on d5, and Black has doubled pawns. Until the 1970s, this was considered to be unplayable for Black. These days the opening named after Evgeny Sveshnikov is well respected. 10 … f5 11.♗d3 ♗e6 12.0-0 ♗×d5 13.e×d5 ♘e7 14.c3 ♗g7 15.♕h5 e4 16.♗c2 ♕c8 17.♖ae1 0-0 18.f3 b4 19.c×b4 ♗×b2 20.f×e4!? L’Ami had prepared this sacrifice. 20 … ♗×a3 21.♖e3 While attacking ♗a3, the rook shifts to an attacking position. He does leave another bishop hanging, though. 21 … ♕×c2 22.♖g3+ ♘g6 23.♖h3 23 … ♖fc8?! Later, stronger engines found that after 23 … ♖fd8! 24.e×f5 ♘e5 it’s Black who is winning: 25.♕g5+ (25.♖×a3 ♕d2 26.♖g3+ ♔f8 27.f6 ♖dc8! or 25.♕×h7+ ♔f8 26.♖×a3 ♕d2 27.♕h8+ ♔e7 28.f6+ ♔d7 29.♕h3+ ♔c7) 25 … ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ ♔c8. 24.e×f5 ♘e5? Now Black loses after all. Here, it was important to return a piece with 24 … ♘f4! 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♕×f4 and then improve the bishop’s position with 26 … ♗b2! when White should take the draw with 27.♕×d6+ ♔g8 28.♕g3+ ♔f8 (not 28 … ♔h8 29.♕h4) 29.♕d6+ or continue the fight with 29.f6!? ♕e2! 30.♕g7+ ♔e8 31.♖hf3. 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ Now we see why c8 was an unfortunate square to put the rook on. 29 … ♔d8 30.♖e1! L’Ami had analyzed this with the computer till the last move. 1-0 Carlsen-Kasparov Reykjavík (rapid), 2004 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.♘f3 ♘f6 4.♘c3 e6 5.♗g5 ♘bd7 6.e3 ♕a5 The Cambridge Springs Defense of the Queen’s Gambit, named after a 1904 tournament in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, where it was played several times. 7.♘d2 Stopping Black’s intended move 7 … ♘e4. 7 … ♗b4 8.♕c2 0-0 9.♗e2 e5 10.0-0 e×d4 11.♘b3 ♕b6 12.e×d4 d×c4 13.♗×c4 Black has isolated White’s d-pawn but White’s pieces are much more active. 13 … a5 14.a4 ♕c7 15.♖ae1 h6 16.♗h4 ♗d6 16 … ♘b6 17.♗d3 ♘bd5 with equality. 17.h3 ♘b6 18.♗×f6! ♘×c4 19.♘e4! Perhaps Kasparov had underestimated this idea. 19 … ♗h2+ The main point is that Black cannot take: 19 … g×f6 20.♘×f6+ ♔g7 21. ♕h7+ ♔×f6 22.♕×h6+ ♔f5 23.g4#. 20.♔h1 ♘d6 21.♔×h2 ♘×e4+ 22.♗e5 ♘d6 23.♕c5 ♖d8 24.d5! A 13-year-old Carlsen is putting maximum pressure on his famous opponent and will soon win a pawn. 24 … ♕d7 25.♘d4 ♘f5 26.d×c6 b×c6 27.♘×c6 ♖e8 28.♖d1 ♕e6 29.♖fe1 Strong was 29.♗c7! after which White can safely play 30.♘×a5. 29 … ♗b7 30.♘d4 ♘×d4 31.♕×d4 ♕g6 32. ♕g4 Keeping the queens on the board with 32.f3 was slightly more promising. 32 … ♕×g4 33.h×g4 ♗c6 34.b3 f6 35.♗c3 ♖×e1 36.♖×e1 ♗d5 37.♖b1 ♔f7 38.♔g3 ♖b8 39.b4 a×b4 40.♗×b4 ♗c4 41.a5 ♗a6 42.f3 ♔g6 43.♔f4 h5 44.g×h5+ ♔×h5 45.♖h1+ ♔g6 46.♗c5 ♖b2 47.♔g3 ♖a2 48.♗b6 ♔f7 49.♖c1 g5 50.♖c7+ ♔g6 51.♖c6 ♗f1 52.♗f2 Black’s pieces are working so well that White cannot make progress despite the extra pawn. ½-½ Kramnik-Leko Brissago (8), 2004 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 0-0 8.c3 d5 This move starts the Marshall Attack. Black sacrifices the e-pawn but will get attacking chances on White’s king. 9.e×d5 ♘×d5 10.♘×e5 ♘×e5 11.♖×e5 c6 12.d4 ♗d6 13.♖e1 ♕h4 14.g3 ♕h3 15.♖e4 White threatens to move this rook to h4, which Black prevents with his next move. 15 … g5 16.♕f1 ♕h5 17.♘d2 ♗f5 18.f3! Creating a square on f2 for the queen, since Black cannot really take the rook anyway. 18 … ♘f6 18 … ♗×e4? 19.f×e4 ♘b6 20.e5 followed by 21. ♘e4 would give White a wonderful position. 19.♖e1 ♖ae8 20.♖×e8 ♖×e8 21.a4 ♕g6 22.a×b5?! Played relatively quickly by Kramnik, who would later state that he gambled a bit here, also because Leko was already getting low on time. Better was 22.♘e4 ♘×e4 23.f×e4 ♗×e4 24.♗×g5 ♗f5 when Black has enough compensation for the pawn, but not more. 22 … ♗d3! 23.♕f2? Kramnik had too much faith in his team’s computer preparation and overestimated his position here. He should have played 23.♕d1 instead and accept a draw by repetition: 23 … ♗e2 24.♕e1 ♗d3 25.♕d1. 23 … ♖e2 24.♕×e2 After 24.b×a6 ♖×f2 25.♔×f2 ♕h5 26.♔g1 White’s a-pawn will become a queen, but too late: 26 … ♗×g3! 27.h×g3 ♕h3 28.a7 ♕×g3+ 29.♔h1 g4! 30.a8♕+ ♔g7 31.♕b7 ♕e1+ 32.♔g2 g×f3+ 33.♘×f3 ♕f1+ 34.♔g3 ♘h5+ 35.♔h4 ♕h1+ 36.♔g4 ♕g2+ 37.♔×h5 ♕h3+ 38.♘h4 ♗e2+ 39.♔g5 ♕g4#. 24 … ♗×e2 25.b×a6 Also here White is not in time. Leko now executed the attack flawlessly: 25 … ♕d3! 26.♔f2 The problem of 26.a7 ♕e3+ 27.♔g2 is 27 … ♗×f3+! 28.♘×f3 ♕e2+ 29.♔g1 (29.♔h3 ♕f1#) 29 … ♘g4 30.a8♕+ ♔g7 31.♕×c6 (31.♗×g5 ♕f2+ 32.♔h1 ♕×f3+ 33.♔g1 ♕f2+ 34.♔h1 ♕×h2#) 31 … ♕f2+ 32.♔h1 ♕f1+ 33.♘g1 ♘f2#. 26 … ♗×f3! 27.♘×f3 ♘e4+ 28.♔e1 ♘×c3! 29.b×c3 ♕×c3+ 30.♔f2 ♕×a1 31.a7 h6 32.h4 g4 0-1 Deep Fritz 10-Kramnik Bonn (2), 2006 1.d4 d5 2.c4 d×c4 3.e4 b5 4.a4 c6 5.♘c3 b4 6.♘a2 ♘f6 7.e5 ♘d5 8.♗×c4 e6 9.♘f3 a5 10.♗g5 ♕b6 11.♘c1 ♗a6 12.♕e2 h6 13.♗e3 ♗×c4 14.♕×c4 ♘d7 15.♘b3 ♗e7 16.♖c1 0-0 17.0-0 17.♕×c6 ♕×c6 18.♖×c6 is not so good because with 18 … ♘7b6 Black will win the a4-pawn. 17 … ♖fc8 18.♕e2 c5 19.♘fd2 ♕c6 20.♕h5 ♕×a4 21.♘×c5 ♘×c5 22.d×c5 ♘×e3 23.f×e3 ♗×c5 24.♕×f7+ ♔h8 25.♕f3 ♖f8 26.♕e4 ♕d7 Black has the simple plan of running with the a-pawn and White doesn’t have much to show for it. 27.♘b3 ♗b6 28.♖fd1 ♕f7 29.♖f1 ♕a7 30.♖×f8+ ♖×f8 31.♘d4 a4?! Missing 31 … ♖d8! 32.♖c4 b3! 33.h3 (not 33.♘×b3?? ♗×e3+ 34.♔f1 a4) 33 … ♗×d4 34.e×d4 a4 and Black is virtually winning. 32.♘×e6! ♗×e3+ 33.♔h1 ♗×c1 34.♘×f8 34 … ♕e3?? Two question marks are not enough for what is possibly the biggest blunder in history committed by a (former) world champion. The game should have ended with the following repetition: 34 … ♔g8 35.♘g6 ♗×b2 36.♕d5+ ♔h7 37.♘f8+ ♔h8 38.♘g6+. 35.♕h7# 1-0 Topalov-Anand Sofia (1), 2010 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense, like in Topalov-Shirov. 4.c×d5 ♘×d5 5.e4 ♘×c3 6.b×c3 ♗g7 7.♗c4 c5 8.♘e2 ♘c6 With the knight on e2 instead of f3, 8 … ♗g4 can be answered by 9.f3. 9.♗e3 0-0 10.0-0 ♘a5 11.♗d3 b6 12.♕d2 e5 13.♗h6 c×d4 14.♗×g7 ♔×g7 15.c×d4 e×d4 16.♖ac1 ♕d6 17.f4 f6 18.f5 ♕e5 19.♘f4 g5 20.♘h5+ ♔g8 Against 20 … ♔h8 the Topalov team had prepared the same move as he would play next: 21.h4! ♖g8 and now it’s possible to play 22.♘×f6!? ♕×f6 23.e5 ♕×e5 24.f6 and the f-pawn is quite dangerous. A long computer line goes 24 … ♗e6 25.f7 ♖gf8 26.♖ce1 ♕d5 27.♗e4 ♘c4 28.♕d3 ♕c5 29.♗×a8 ♘e3 30.♖f2 ♔g7 31.♗e4 ♖×f7 32.♖d2 ♖d7 33.♗×h7 ♗f7 34.h×g5 and White is still better. 21.h4 h6 22.h×g5 h×g5 23.♖f3 Also in this position 23.♘×f6+ was interesting. 23 … ♔f7? Anand remembered that this move had to be played, but not in which position. Correct was 23 … ♗d7! 24.♖g3 and only now 24 … ♔f7 25.♗c4+ ♘×c4 26.♖×c4 ♖h8 27.♖×d4 ♗e8 28.♖d7+ ♔f8! (28 … ♗×d7?? 29.♕×d7+ ♕e7 30.♕d5+ loses the rook on a8.) 29.♘×f6 ♕a1+ 30.♔f2 ♕×f6 and White’s attack is only good for a draw: 31.♕b4+ ♔g8 32.♕b3+ ♔f8. 24.♘×f6! A sacrifice that Topalov and his team had prepared with the computer, while Anand’s team was also aware of it. But you can’t remember everything … 24 … ♔×f6 24 … ♕×f6 25.♖h3! ♗d7 26.♖h7+ ♔e8 27.e5! with a winning attack. 25.♖h3! ♖g8 25 … ♕f4 26.e5+! ♔×e5 27.♕e2+ ♔d5 28.♖f1 ♕e5 29.♕f3+ winning ♖a8. 26.♖h6+ ♔f7 27.♖h7+ ♔e8 28.♖cc7 ♔d8 29.♗b5! ♕×e4 29 … ♕×b5 30.♕×d4+ ♔e8 31.♖he7+ ♔f8 32.♕f6#. 30.♖×c8+ Anand resigned because of 30 … ♔×c8 31.♕c1+ ♘c6 32.♗×c6 ♕e3+ 33.♕×e3 d×e3 34.♗×a8. 1-0 Carlsen-Nakamura Stavanger, 2017 1.e4 c5 2.♘f3 d6 3.d4 c×d4 4.♘×d4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 a6 The Najdorf variation of the Sicilian, named after the Polish-Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf. 6.h3 This little pawn move was also played by a young Bobby Fischer. 6 … g6 7.g3 ♘c6 8.♗e3 ♗g7 9.♗g2 0-0 10.0-0 ♘d7 11.b3 ♘×d4 12.♗×d4 ♗×d4 13.♕×d4 b6 14.♘d5 ♗b7 15.c4 e5 Fixing White’s e-pawn on a light square, so that it will keep blocking the bishop on g2. Pawn d6 is weakened, but it’s easily defendable. 16.♕e3 b5 17.♖ac1 b×c4 18.♖×c4 ♗×d5 Nakamura feels that his knight is not worse than White’s bishop in the remaining position. 19.e×d5 a5 20.♖fc1 ♘c5?! 21.a3 f5 22.b4 a×b4 23.a×b4 ♘d7 24.♖c6 f4 25.g×f4 e×f4 26.♕e6+ ♖f7 27.♕×d6 ♕g5 28.♔h1 f3 29.♗f1 ♘f6 Black is creating counterplay. 30.♕e6 ♔g7 31.♖c7 ♖×c7 32.♖×c7+ ♔h6 33.♕e1 ♖a2 34.♖e7 ♘g4! This move forces a draw by move repetition. 35.h×g4 ♕h4+ 36.♔g1 ♕×g4+ 37.♔h1 ♕h4+ This is the position that Messi and Ronaldo had on their board in the 2022 Louis Vuitton picture on Instagram. 38.♔g1 ♕g4+ 39.♔h1 ♕h4+ 40.♔g1 ♕g4+ ½-½ Kasparov-Karjakin St. Louis, MO (blitz), 2017 1.e4 e5 2.f4 The first and only time Kasparov played the King’s Gambit in an official game, and this author happened to be standing right next to it with his camera running. 2 … e×f4 3.♘c3!? Kasparov chooses a move that James Mason and Paul Keres have tried in the past. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔e2 A remarkable situation: after four moves the white king cannot castle anymore and is blocking his bishop and queen. In return, he hopes to build up a strong pawn center. 4 … ♕d8?! Not the best move, but not terrible either. Karjakin argues his queen soon needed to leave h4 anyway. 5.d4 ♘f6 6.♗×f4 ♗b4 7.♗g5 Better was 7.♘d5! ♘×d5 8.e×d5 0-0 9.♘f3 ♖e8+ 10.♔f2 with a slight edge for White. 7 … ♗×c3 8.b×c3 d6 9.♘f3 0-0 10.♗×f6 Kasparov first takes the knight as the immediate 10.♔f2?? fails to ♘×e4+. 10 … ♕×f6 11.♔f2 c5 12.h3 ♖e8 13.♕d3 b6 14.♖e1 ♗b7 15.g3 ♘c6 16.♗g2 ♖ac8 17.a3 Anticipating Black’s idea of 17 … c×d4 18.c×d4 ♘b4. 17 … ♘b8 18.♖e3 ♘d7 19.♖f1 ♕e7 20.♔g1?? A terrible blunder that would not have happened in a game with a long time control. White should have overprotected e4 with 20.♖fe1. 20 … ♗×e4 21.♕e2 d5 22.♘h4 g6 23.♗×e4 d×e4 24.♕g4 ♘f6 25.♕g5 ♘h5 26.♕g4 ♘f6 27.♕g5 ♘h5 28.♕g4 ♘g7 29.♕e2 c×d4 30.c×d4 f5 Already a pawn down, White’s pawns on the queenside are weak so he is strategically lost here. 31.♘g2 ♕d6 32.c3 ♕×a3 33.♕d2 ♘e6 34.g4 ♘g5 35.g×f5 ♘f3+ 36.♖e×f3 e×f3 37.♖×f3 ♖f8 38.♘h4 ♕e7 39.♕f2 ♕g5+ 40.♖g3 ♕c1+ 41.♔g2 ♖×c3 42.♘×g6!? Kasparov goes for his last practical chance. 42 … ♖×g3+ Black could just take the knight: 42 … h×g6 43.♖×g6+ ♔f7 44.♕a2+ ♖c4 and White’s attack is over. 43.♕×g3 ♕d2+?? Missing the simple 43 … ♕c6+! after which Black can take the knight. Kasparov would have resigned instantly. 44.♔h1 ♕d1+ 45.♔g2 ♕e2+ 46.♔g1 ♕d1+ 47.♔g2 ♕c2+ 48.♔g1 ♕b1+ 49.♔h2 ♕b2+ 50.♔h1 ♕b1+ 51.♔h2 ♕a2+ 52.♔g1 ♕a1+ 53.♔h2 ♕b2+ 54.♔h1 ♕c1+ 55.♔h2 ♕d2+ 56.♔h1 ♕d1+ 57.♔h2 ♕e2+ 58.♔g1 ♕d1+ 59.♔h2 ♕d2+ 60.♔h1 ♕d1+ With little time on the clock, Karjakin goes for a draw. He could have continued with 60 … ♕c1+ 61.♔h2 ♖f7 but it does look somewhat dangerous: 62.♘h4+ (62.♕b8+ ♔g7 63.♕h8+ ♔h6 64.♘e5 ♕c7) 62 … ♖g7 63.♕b8+ ♔f7 64.♕×a7+ ♔f6 65.♕×b6+ ♔g5 66.♕d8+ ♔h5 67.♘g2. However Black can now trade queens with 67 … ♕c7+ 68.♕×c7 ♖×c7 when the remaining endgame should be a draw. ½-½ Carlsen-Niemann St. Louis, MO, 2022 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 e6 3.♘c3 ♗b4 The Nimzo-Indian Defense, named after the Latvian-born Danish chess player/writer Aron Nimzowitsch. 4.g3 0-0 5.♗g2 d5 6.a3 ♗×c3+ 7.b×c3 d×c4 8.♘f3 c5 9.0-0 c×d4 10.♕×d4 ♘c6 11.♕×c4 e5 12.♗g5 h6 13.♖fd1 ♗e6 14.♖×d8 ♗×c4 15.♖×a8 ♖×a8 16.♗×f6 g×f6 17.♔f1 ♖d8 The opening didn’t go too well for White as he is slightly worse in this endgame. 18.♔e1 ♘a5 19.♖d1 ♖c8 20.♘d2 ♗e6 21.c4 ♗×c4 22.♘×c4 ♖×c4 23.♖d8+ ♔g7 24.♗d5 ♖c7 25.♖a8 a6 26.♖b8 f5 27.♖e8 e4 28.g4?! Here 28.f3 gives better drawing chances. 28 … ♖c5! 29.♗a2 ♘c4?! There was nothing wrong with 29 … f×g4 30.♖×e4 (30.♖e7 ♘c4 31.♖×b7 h5) 30 … f5 31.♖e7+ ♔f6 32.♖f7+ ♔g5 33.♖g7+ ♔h4 and Black is doing well. 30.a4 30.♗×c4 ♖×c4 31.g×f5 ♖a4 32.♖b8 b5 33.♖b6 ♖×a3 34.♔d2 probably didn’t look very attractive to Carlsen, but thanks to the rook on b6 cutting off the black king from participating, White actually has drawing chances here. 30 … ♘d6 31.♖e7 f×g4 32.♖d7 e3! A nice intermediate move. 33.f×e3 Black’s trick was 33.♖×d6?? ♖c1+ 34.♖d1 ♖×d1+ 35.♔×d1 e×f2. 33 … ♘e4 34.♔f1 ♖c1+ Better was 34 … ♖f5+ 35.♔g2 b5. 35.♔g2 ♖c2 36.♗×f7 ♖×e2+ 37.♔g1 ♖e1+ 38.♔g2 ♖e2+ 39.♔g1 ♔f6 40.♗d5 ♖d2 41.♖f7+ ♔g6 42.♖d7? Carlsen again refrains from going into a rook endgame, even though they are notoriously drawish. 42.♖e7! ♖×d5 (42 … ♘g5 43.♗g2) 43.♖×e4 ♔f5 44.♖b4 ♖d7 45.h3! g×h3 46.♔h2 with good chances to draw the game. 42 … ♘g5! Now Black is winning. 43.♗f7+ ♔f5 44.♖×d2 ♘f3+ 45.♔g2 ♘×d2 46.a5 ♔e5 47.♔g3 ♘f1+ 48.♔f2 ♘×h2 49.e4 ♔×e4 50.♗e6 ♔f4 51.♗c8 ♘f3 52.♗×b7 ♘e5 53.♗×a6 ♘c6 54.♗b7 ♘×a5 55.♗d5 h5 56.♗f7 h4 57.♗d5 0-1 Caruana-Giri Bucharest, 2023 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 ♘f6 4.d3 ♗c5 The Giuoco Pianissimo, Italian for ‘very slow game,’ is one of the most popular variations in top-level chess these days. The main reason is that the Berlin Defense (3 … ♘f6) against the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5) is so strong. 5.c3 d6 6.b4 ♗b6 7.a4 a5 8.b5 ♘e7 9.0-0 0-0 10.♘bd2 ♘g6 11.d4 h6 12.♖e1 ♖e8 13.♗a3 Later the same year, Caruana would try the move 13.h3 in this position. 13 … e×d4 14.♕b3 d5! 14 … ♗e6 15.♗×e6 ♖×e6 16.c×d4 is slightly better for White. The text move is a strong, new move after which Black is equal, but only after some very sharp complications. 15.e×d5 d×c3 16.♖×e8+ After 16.♕×c3 ♗f5 Black is perhaps already a bit better. 16 … ♕×e8 17.♖e1! 17 … ♕×e1+! 18.♘×e1 c×d2 19.♘f3 ♘e4 Attacking f2. Black has just enough counterplay for the queen. 20.d6 One of those situations where attack is the best defense. 20 … ♘×f2 21.♗×f7+ ♔h8 22.♘×d2 Now comes the point behind Black’s play. 22 … ♘e4+ 23.♔h1 Of course not 23.♔f1?? ♘×d2+ winning the house. 23 … ♘f2+ 24.♔g1 ♘e4+ 25.♔h1 ♘f2+ 26.♔g1 Caruana had prepared everything and played all moves hardly thinking about them while Giri needed to dig deep in his memory. ½-½",

      "content": "Appendix: Key Annotated Games Throughout the book I have mentioned particular chess games, many quite famous, some lesser known, but always relevant to the story of how the game has developed over the centuries. For those chess fans eager to play through the moves on a chessboard, you will find them below with my annotations. If you prefer to play through them online, you can find the games also at peterdoggers.com/annotated-games. The games are given in algebraic notation; for an explanation I refer to chess.com/terms/chess-notation. Dilaram Problem 1.♖h8+! ♔×h8 2.♗f5+ Note that at the time this problem was composed, bishops could jump over pieces but moved only two squares diagonally. 2 … ♔g8 3.♖h8+! ♔×h8 4.g7+ ♔g8 5.♘h6# Napoleon—Mechanical Turk Vienna, 1809 1.e4 e5 2.♕f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 Napoleon is going for a quick victory on the battlefield. 3 … ♘f6 The Turk is not falling for this beginner’s trick. It would be Scholar’s Mate after something like 3…d6 4.♕×f7#. 4.♘e2 ♗c5 5.a3 d6 6.0-0 Napoleon develops some pieces and castles, showing that he is not a total beginner. 6 … ♗g4 7.♕d3 ♘h5!? 8.h3?! A loss of time. It was high time to develop a new piece; after 8.♘bc3 White is not much worse actually. 8 … ♗×e2 9.♕×e2 ♘f4 10.♕e1? A terrible square for the queen, after which White is dead lost. 10 … ♘d4 After 10 … ♕g5! 11.g4 (11.g3 allows 11 … ♕×g3+! 12.♔h1 ♕g2#) 11…♘×h3+ 12.♔h2 ♕h4 it’s checkmate soon. 11.♗b3?! 11 … ♘×h3+! Here, Napoleon must have realized things weren’t going très bien for him. 12.♔h2 Black’s trick was 12.g×h3 ♘f3+, a “family check” that wins the queen. 12 … ♕h4! A devastating blow. 13.g3 ♘f3+ 14.♔g2 ♘×e1+ The Turk wasn’t a perfect player either. Here, 14 … ♘f4+! would have forced checkmate: 15.g×f4 (15.♔×f3 ♕h5+ 16.g4 ♕h3#) 15 … ♕g4+ 16.♔h1 ♕h3#. 15.♖×e1 ♕g4 16.d3 ♗×f2 17.♖h1 ♕×g3+ 18.♔f1 ♗d4 19.♔e2 ♕g2+ 20.♔d1 ♕×h1+ 21.♔d2 ♕g2+ 22.♔e1 ♘g1 23.♘c3 ♗×c3+ 24.b×c3 ♕e2# It’s safe to say that Napoleon wasn’t too thrilled when this game ended. 0-1 Anderssen-Kieseritzky London, 1851 1.e4 e5 2.f4 The King’s Gambit, arguably the most romantic of openings. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4!? Much more common is 3.♘f3. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔f1 Of course not 4.g3?? f×g3 and White cannot take back the pawn. 4 … b5 A countergambit Kieseritzky had used to beat Anderssen in an earlier game. The idea is to chase the bishop away from the diagonal that attacks f7, and also, Black might be able to attack that bishop more easily. 5.♗×b5 ♘f6 6.♘f3 ♕h6 7.d3 ♘h5 Black now threatens 8 … ♘g3+. 8.♘h4 ♕g5 9.♘f5 c6 On 9 … g6 10.h4 ♕f6 Anderssen was no doubt planning 11.♘c3 after which Black shouldn’t go 11 … g×f5 12.♕×h5 but 11 … ♗b7 would give him a good position. 10.g4?! This attempt to trap Black’s queen is a mistake. Better was 10.♗a4. 10 … ♘f6 11.♖g1 c×b5? 11 … h5! would be in Black’s favor: 12.h4 ♕g6 13.♗a4 (13.g5 ♘g4 shows the main idea behind 11 … h5) 13 … h×g4 14.♗×f4 d5! Black is doing well. 12.h4 ♕g6 13.h5 ♕g5 14.♕f3 White will take the f-pawn with his bishop next, after which Black’s queen would indeed be trapped, so he needs a desperate measure. 14 … ♘g8?! 14 … ♗b7!? was a remarkable option to Black: 15.♗×f4 ♘×g4! 16.♗×g5 ♘h2+ 17.♔f2 ♘×f3 18.♔×f3 but White is close to winning, thanks to his better development and structure. 15.♗×f4 ♕f6 16.♘c3 ♗c5 17.♘d5!? The logical move 17.d4 is very strong as well, but Anderssen probably already saw the fireworks that will soon appear. A romantic mind! 17 … ♕×b2 18.♗d6!? Offering both rooks! This bishop move is the prelude to a wonderful combination which, however, is not entirely correct. With 18.♖e1 White would keep a winning advantage. 18 … ♗×g1? Now Anderssen gets what he wants. Correct was 18 … ♕×a1+ 19.♔e2 ♕b2! attacking c2, when 20.♗×c5 ♕×c2+ 21.♔f1 ♕×c5 22.♕f4 f6 23.♘d6+ ♔d8 24.♘f7+ ♔e8 25.♘d6+ would be a draw by a repetition of moves (not 25.♘×h8? d6 and Black’s extra piece should win the game). 19.e5! Cutting off the a1-h8 diagonal for the queen, so that g7 is not protected anymore. Even stronger was 19.♖e1. 19 … ♕×a1+ 20.♔e2 ♘a6? Allowing a beautiful mate in three that made this game famous. The best defense was 20 … ♗a6 but after 21.♘c7+ ♔d8 22.♘×a6! White would still be winning: 22 … ♕c3 23.♗c7+ ♕×c7 (23 … ♔c8 24.♘d6#; 23 … ♔e8 24.♘d6+ ♔e7 25.♕×f7#) 24.♘×c7. 21.♘×g7+ ♔d8 And now the key idea: 22.♕f6+!! ♘×f6 23.♗e7# 1-0 Anderssen-Dufresne Berlin, 1852 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 ♗c5 4.b4 The Evans Gambit, named after the Welsh sea captain William Davies Evans. 4 … ♗×b4 5.c3 ♗a5 6.d4 e×d4 7.0-0 d3!? Black doesn’t play 7 … d×c3 because after 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.♗g5 ♕g6 White can develop his other knight with 10.♘×c3 while after the text move, the white pawn on c3 keeps the knight away from that square. 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.e5 ♕g6 Not 9 … ♘×e5?? 10.♖e1 d6 11.♕b5+ winning a piece. 10.♖e1 ♘ge7 11.♗a3 b5? This was not necessary at all. After 11 … 0-0 12.♘bd2 d5! 13.e×d6 (en passant) 13 … c×d6 Black is better. 12.♕×b5 ♖b8 This was Black’s idea: winning time to activate his rook over the b-file. It wasn’t worth a pawn, though. 13.♕a4 ♗b6 Castling would lose a piece: 13 … 0-0 14.♗×e7! ♘×e7 15.♕×a5. 14.♘bd2 ♗b7?! 15.♘e4 ♕f5? Losing too much time. The last try was 15 … d2 16.♘e×d2 ♘d8. 16.♗×d3 Threatening 17.♘f6+ and 18.♗×f5, which is also possible if Black castles. 16 … ♕h5 17.♘f6+!? Objectively speaking, 17.♖ad1 was stronger. 17 … g×f6 18.e×f6 Because ♘e7 is pinned, White will win the piece back and the e-file is opened up. It looks great, but Black can counter, which he does: 18 … ♖g8! 19.♖ad1 ♕×f3? Falling for Anderssen’s brilliant ploy. A better way to make use of the pinned g-pawn was 19 … ♕h3! threatening mate on g2, since 20.♗f1 (not 20.g3? ♖×g3+! 21.h×g3 ♕×g3+ 22.♔h1 ♕×f3+ 23.♔h2 ♕×f2+ 24.♔h3 ♕f3+ 25.♔h2 ♘e5 and it’s Black who has a winning attack.) 20 … ♕f5 leaves neither player with a clear advantage. What follows is one of the most famous combinations in chess history. 20.♖×e7+! ♘×e7 21.♕×d7+!! Just brilliant. 21 … ♔×d7 22.♗f5+ ♔e8 23.♗d7+ ♔f8 24.♗×e7# 1-0 Levitsky-Marshall Breslau, 1912 1.e4 e6 The French Defense. 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 c5 4.♘f3 ♘c6 5.e×d5 e×d5 6.♗e2 ♘f6 7.0-0 ♗e7 8.♗g5 0-0 9.d×c5 ♗e6 10.♘d4 ♗×c5 11.♘×e6 f×e6 12.♗g4 ♕d6 13.♗h3 ♖ae8 14.♕d2 ♗b4 15.♗×f6 ♖×f6 16.♖ad1 ♕c5 17.♕e2 ♗×c3 18.b×c3 ♕×c3 19.♖×d5 ♘d4 20.♕h5 ♖ef8 21.♖e5 ♖h6 22.♕g5 ♖×h3 23.♖c5 On 23.g×h3 comes ♘f3+. Black is winning and can go to almost any square with the queen now, since he has already won a piece, but the spot he chooses is the most spectacular. 23 … ♕g3!! White resigned. The black queen can be taken in three ways after 23 … ♕g3 but they all lose: 24.h×g3 ♘e2#; 24.f×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♖×f1#; 24.♕×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♘×g3+ 26.♔g1 (26.f×g3 ♖×f1#) 26 … ♘e2+ 27.♔h1 ♖c3. 0-1 D.

Better was 11.♗e2 when 11 … ♘fd7 12.♕a3 ♗×f3 13.♗×f3 e5! 14.d×e5 ♖e8 is close to equal. 11…♘a4!! 12.♕a3 12.♘×a4 ♘×e4 wins for Black in all lines: 13.♕b4 ♘×g5; 13.♕×e7 ♕a5+ 14.b4 ♕×a4 15.♕×e4 ♖fe8 16.♗e7 ♗×f3 17.g×f3 ♗f8; 13.♗×e7 ♘×c5 14.♗×d8 ♖e8+ 15.♗e2 ♘×a4; 13.♕c1 ♗×f3 14.g×f3 ♕a5+ 15.♗d2 ♘×d2 16.♕×d2 ♕×a4 and d4 will drop. 12…♘×c3 13.b×c3 ♘×e4! Another surprising knight move that involves an exchange sacrifice. It’s all possible thanks to White’s lack in development. 14.♗×e7 ♕b6 15.♗c4 After 15.♗×f8 ♗×f8 White is in big trouble: 16.♕c1 ♘×c3 17.♖d2 ♖e8+ 18.♗e2 ♘×e2 19.♖×e2 ♖×e2+ 20.♔×e2 ♕b5+ 21.♔d1 (21.♔d2 ♗h6+; 21.♔e1 ♗b4+) 21…♕d3+ 22.♕d2 ♗×f3+ 23.g×f3 ♕×f3+ or 16.♕b3 ♘×c3! 17.♕×b6 a×b6 18.♖d2 ♗b4! and also here White will lose material. 15…♘×c3! 16.♗c5 16.♕×c3 is met by 16 … ♖ae8 and 16.♗×f8 ♗×f8 17.♕×c3? ♗b4 is another idea. 16…♖fe8+ 17.♔f1 17.♔d2 ♘e4+ and 17.♘e5 ♗×e5 18.♗×b6 ♗d6+ win for Black. 17…♗e6!! The beautiful point behind the whole combination. 18.♗×b6 18.♗×e6 leads to a pretty mate: ♕b5+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘g3+ 21.♔g1 ♕f1+ 22.♖×f1 ♘e2#. After 18.♕×c3 ♕×c5 19.d×c5 ♗×c3 20.♗×e6 ♖×e6 Black has a winning endgame. 18…♗×c4+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘×d4+ 21.♔g1 ♘e2+ 22.♔f1 ♘c3+ 23.♔g1 a×b6! Black’s minor pieces are much stronger than White’s queen. 24.♕b4 ♖a4 25.♕×b6 ♘×d1 26.h3 ♖×a2 27.♔h2 ♘×f2 28.♖e1 ♖×e1 29.♕d8+ ♗f8 30.♘×e1 ♗d5 31.♘f3 ♘e4 32.♕b8 b5 33.h4 h5 34.♘e5 ♔g7 35. ♔g1 ♗c5+ 36.♔f1 36.♔h2 ♗d6 is resignable and 36.♔h1 ♘g3+ 37.♔h2 ♘f1+ 38.♔h3 ♗×g2 is checkmate. 36…♘g3+ 37.♔e1 ♗b4+ 38.♔d1 ♗b3+ 39.♔c1 ♘e2+ 40.♔b1 ♘c3+ 41.♔c1 ♖c2# 0-1 This game never ceases to amaze me. Fischer-Mac Hack (Greenblatt) Cambridge, MA (2), 1977 1.e4 e5 2.f4 Like the Romantics in the 19th century, Fischer plays the King’s Gambit. At that time, computers were very materialistic and could not see deep enough to understand White’s compensation. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4 In the footsteps of Anderssen and others. 3 … d5!? 4.♗×d5 ♘f6 5.♘c3 ♗b4 6.♘f3 0-0 7.0-0 ♘×d5 8.♘×d5 ♗d6?! So far, Black’s play wasn’t actually that bad, but only if it was followed up by 8 … f5! 9.♘×b4 f×e4 winning back a piece, since if White removes ♘f3, Black has ♕d4+ and the knight on b4 drops. 9.d4 Now White is much better, in fact close to winning already, thanks to his strong pawn center. 9 … g5?! Trying to hang on to the pawn on f4 only makes matters worse. 10.♘×g5! An easy sacrifice for Fischer. 10 … ♕×g5 11.e5 ♗h3 12.♖f2 ♗×e5 The bishop is also lost after 12 … ♗e7 13.♗×f4 ♕h4 14.g3. 13.d×e5 c6 14.♗×f4 ♕g7 15.♘f6+ ♔h8 16.♕h5♖d8 16 … ♗e6 allows 17.♗h6. 17.♕×h3 ♘a6 18.♖f3 ♕g6 19.♖c1 ♔g7 20.♖g3 ♖h8 Now White can take the queen, but thanks to the pin over the g-file it’s actually mate in one. 21.♕h6#! 1-0 Chess 4.7-Levy Toronto, 1978 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 f5 The Latvian Gambit. 3.e×f5 A fine move while 3.♘×e5 is considered to be even stronger. 3 … e4 4.♘e5 ♘f6 5.♘g4?! d5 6.♘×f6+ ♕×f6 7.♕h5+? ♕f7?! Levy misses the idea 7 … g6! 8.f×g6 h×g6 9.♕×d5 ♖h5! and after for example 10.♕c4 ♘c6 Black will have very quick development. Modern engines consider the position almost lost for White. 8.♕×f7+ ♔×f7 9.♘c3 c6 10.d3! e×d3! 10 … ♗×f5 11.d×e4 d×e4 would be dangerous because of 12.♗c4+ ♔f6 13.g4! ♗g6 14.h4. 11.♗×d3 ♘d7 12.♗f4 ♘c5 13.g4 ♘×d3+ 14.c×d3 White remains a pawn up in the endgame. 14 … ♗c5 15.0-0 h5 16.♘a4 ♗d4 17.♗e3 ♗e5 18.d4 ♗d6 19.h3 b6 20.♖fe1 ♗d7 21.♘c3 h×g4 22.h×g4 ♖h4 23.f3 ♖ah8 24.♔f1 ♗g3? Missing a win with 24 … ♖h3! 25.♔e2 ♖h2+ 26.♔d3 (on 26.♗f2 Black plays the same move) 26 … ♗c8! and Black’s activity is overwhelming. 25.♖e2 ♗c8 26.♔g2 ♗d6 27.♗g1 ♖h3 28.♖ae1 ♖g3+ 29.♔f2 ♖hh3 30.♖e3 ♗a6 31.♘e2 ♗×e2 32.♖1×e2 c5 33.f4 ♖×e3 34.♖×e3 ♖h4? 34 … ♖×e3 35.♔×e3 c4 was about equal, but Levy wants to win this game. 35.♔g3 ♖h1 36.♗f2 ♖d1 37.♖a3? It was beyond Chess 4.7’s horizon to see the line 37.g5! ♖×d4 38.♖e6 ♗×f4+ 39.♔f3 and the black rook keeps getting attacked so that it cannot stay on the fourth rank after which ♗f4 will hang: 39 … ♖c4 40.b3 ♖b4 41.a3. 37 … c×d4 38.♖×a7+ 38 … ♔f8? Necessary was 38 … ♔e8 when it’s equal again. White cannot play 39.♖×g7? because Black comes first: 39 … d3 40.♔f3 d2 41.♔e2 ♖f1! 42.♔×d2 (42.♔×f1 d1♕+) 42 … ♖×f2+ 43.♔d3 ♖×f4. 39.♖d7! ♖d3+ 40.♔g2 ♗c5 41.♖×d5 ♖d2 42.b4! ♗×b4 43.♖d8+ ♔f7 44.♖d7+ ♔f8 45.♖×d4 ♖b2 46.♔f3 ♗c5 47.♖d8+ ♔e7 48.♗h4+ ♔f7 49.g5 g6 50.♖d7+ ♔f8 51.f×g6 ♖×a2 52.f5 ♖a3+ 53.♔g4 ♖a4+ 54.♔h5 ♖d4 55.♖c7 ♗e7 And Levy resigned, not waiting for 56.f6. It was a historic first win by a computer against a master-level player. 1-0 Karpov-Kasparov Moscow (9), 1984 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.♘f3 c5 The Tarrasch Defense. 4.c×d5 e×d5 5.g3 ♘f6 6.♗g2 ♗e7 7.0-0 0-0 8.♘c3 ♘c6 9.♗g5 c×d4 10.♘×d4 h6 11.♗e3 ♖e8 12.♕b3 ♘a5 13.♕c2 ♗g4 14.♘f5 ♖c8 15.♗d4 ♗c5 16.♗×c5 ♖×c5 17.♘e3 ♗e6 18.♖ad1 ♕c8 19.♕a4 ♖d8 20.♖d3 a6 21.♖fd1 ♘c4 22.♘×c4 ♖×c4 23.♕a5 ♖c5 24.♕b6 ♖d7 25.♖d4 ♕c7 26.♕×c7 ♖d×c7 27.h3 h5 28.a3 g6 29.e3 ♔g7 30.♔h2 ♖c4 31.♗f3 b5 32.♔g2 ♖7c5 33.♖×c4 ♖×c4 34.♖d4 ♔f8 35.♗e2 ♖×d4 36.e×d4 ♔e7 37.♘a2 ♗c8 38.♘b4 ♔d6 39.f3 ♘g8 40.h4 ♘h6 41.♔f2 ♘f5 42.♘c2 f6 43.♗d3 g5 44.♗×f5 Karpov sees that his knight will be a better piece than Black’s bishop in this endgame, which is limited by the many pawns on light squares. 44 … ♗×f5 45.♘e3 ♗b1 46.b4 g×h4? A mistake, but the reason why was hard to foresee. 47.♘g2!! A fantastic move. White sacrifices a pawn to create an entry point for his king along the h-file. After 47.g×h4 ♗g6 48.♔g3 ♔e6 49.♔f4 ♗h7 White cannot make progress. 47 … h×g3+ 48.♔×g3 ♔e6 Giving up the h-pawn right away, since Black cannot keep it. 48 … ♗g6 49.♘f4 ♗f7 50.♔h4 ♔e7 51.♘×h5 is similar to the game and 51 … ♗×h5 52.♔×h5 loses quickly: 52 … ♔f7 53.♔h6 ♔e6 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.f4 ♔e6 56.f5+ ♔e7 57.♔g7. 49.♘f4+ ♔f5 50.♘×h5 Threatening ♘g7-e8-c7, therefore the king must retreat. 50 … ♔e6 50 … ♗c2 51.♘f4 ♗b3 52.♘d3 and the a6-pawn will drop soon. 51.♘f4+ ♔d6 52.♔g4 ♗c2 53.♔h5 ♗d1 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.♘×d5+? The first error by Karpov. The winning move was 55.♘h5!. 55 … ♔e6 56.♘c7+ ♔d7 57.♘×a6 ♗×f3 58.♔×f6 ♔d6 59.♔f5 ♔d5 60.♔f4 ♗h1 61.♔e3 ♔c4 62.♘c5 ♗c6 63.♘d3 ♗g2 64.♘e5+ ♔c3 65.♘g6 ♔c4 66.♘e7 ♗b7? Now White is winning again. This famous endgame has been analyzed by many grandmasters. Some of them reached the same conclusion as the modern engines: Black could still draw this position with 66 … ♗h1!. 67.♘f5 ♗g2 68.♘d6+ ♔b3 69.♘×b5 ♔a4 70.♘d6 If Black takes on a3, White’s b-pawn simply runs up the board. 1-0 Kasparov-Anand New York (10), 1995 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♘×e4 This move marks the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez (Spanish) opening. 6.d4 b5 7.♗b3 d5 8.d×e5 ♗e6 9.♘bd2 ♘c5 10.c3 d4 11.♘g5!? This remarkable move was first played by Kasparov’s long-time nemesis Anatoly Karpov, also in the 10th game of his 1978 match against Viktor Korchnoi. 11 … d×c3 11 … ♕×g5 is also playable when White wins back the piece with 12.♕f3. 12.♘×e6 f×e6 13.b×c3 ♕d3 Both players had played without thinking so far because the same moves had also appeared in the sixth match game. Here, Kasparov deviates. 14.♗c2!! This move had been suggested by the former world champion Mikhail Tal and carefully checked by Kasparov’s team with the help of the computer. 14 … ♕×c3 15.♘b3 ♘×b3 Played by Anand after 45 minutes of thought. 16.♗×b3 16 … ♘d4 White was offering his rook on a1 but Anand saw that it’s dangerous to take it straight away: 16 … ♕×a1 17.♕h5+ g6 (17 … ♔d8 18.♗g5+ wins the queen on a1 while 17 … ♔d7 18.♗×e6+! ♔×e6 19.♕g4+ ♔f7 20.♕f3+ ♔e6 21.♕×c6+ ♗d6 22.e×d6 also wins for White) 18.♕f3 ♘d8 19.♕f6 ♖g8 20.♗×e6 ♖g7 21.♗a3! ♕×f1+ 22.♔×f1 ♘×e6 23.♕×e6+ ♗e7 24.♕c6+ and White will be up too much material. 17.♕g4! Kasparov insists. Take my rook! 17 … ♕×a1 17 … ♘×b3 18.♕×e6+ ♗e7 19.♗g5 is a simple win. 18.♗×e6 ♖d8! The best move. 19.♗h6! Kasparov was still playing his moves almost instantly as he had analyzed all this before with the computer. 19 … ♕c3 The best defense. 19 … ♕×f1+ 20.♔×f1 g×h6 21.♕h5+ ♔e7 22.♕f7#. 20.♗×g7 ♕d3 21.♗×h8 ♕g6 22.♗f6 ♗e7 23.♗×e7 ♕×g4 24.♗×g4 ♔×e7 Anand has managed to reach the endgame only a pawn down, and he would have chances for survival if he could run his c-pawn up the board, but Kasparov prevents that with an important move. 25.♖c1! c6 26.f4 a5 27.♔f2 a4 28.♔e3 b4 29.♗d1! Kasparov continues accurately. 29 … a3 30.g4 ♖d5 31.♖c4 c5 32.♔e4 ♖d8 33.♖×c5 ♘e6 34.♖d5 ♖c8 35.f5 ♖c4+ 36.♔e3 ♘c5 37.g5 ♖c1 38.♖d6 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov Philadelphia (1), 1996 1.e4 c5 2.c3 Deep Blue’s team had prepared the Alapin Sicilian, to not let Kasparov reach middlegame positions that he knows very well. 2 … d5 3.e×d5 ♕×d5 4.d4 ♘f6 5.♘f3 ♗g4 6.♗e2 e6 7.h3 ♗h5 8.0-0 ♘c6 9.♗e3 c×d4 10.c×d4 ♗b4 11.a3 ♗a5 12.♘c3 ♕d6 13.♘b5 ♕e7 14.♘e5 ♗×e2 15.♕×e2 0-0 16.♖ac1 ♖ac8 17.♗g5 ♗b6 18.♗×f6! g×f6 Not 18 … ♕×f6? 19.♘d7 and Black loses an exchange. 19.♘c4 ♖fd8 20.♘×b6 a×b6 21.♖fd1 f5 22.♕e3 ♕f6 23.d5! An excellent pawn sacrifice that computers in the 1970s likely wouldn’t have played. 23 … ♖×d5 24.♖×d5 e×d5 25.b3! Before taking on b6, Deep Blue first removes a pawn that was hanging. 25 … ♔h8 26.♕×b6 ♖g8 27.♕c5 27 … d4? Better was 27 … ♕g5 28.g3 f4 29.♘d6 ♕f6 30.g4 ♖g6! 31.♘f5 h5 32.♔f1 h×g4 33.h×g4 ♖×g4 34.♕c3 ♖g6 with equality. 28.♘d6 f4 29.♘×b7! A human playing against Kasparov would consider this too risky, since the knight is so far away from defending its king. Deep Blue, however, has calculated everything. 29 … ♘e5 30.♕d5! f3 31.g3 ♘d3 32.♖c7 ♖e8 33.♘d6! ♖e1+ 34.♔h2 ♘×f2 35.♘×f7+ ♔g7 36.♘g5+ ♔h6 37.♖×h7+ Kasparov resigned because he saw 37 … ♔g6 38.♕g8+ ♔f5 39.♘×f3 (not 39.♖f7?? ♖h1#) 39 … ♖h1+ 40.♔g2 and now both the knight on f2 hangs and a quick checkmate starting with 41. ♖h5+ is threatened. This was a computer’s first victory against the world champion in a classical time control. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (2), 1997 1.e4 e5 Kasparov usually played the Sicilian, but apparently he figured this to be a more solid choice against a strong computer. 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 The Closed Ruy Lopez (Spanish). 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 h6 10.d4 ♖e8 11.♘bd2 ♗f8 12.♘f1 ♗d7 13.♘g3 ♘a5 14.♗c2 c5 15.b3 ♘c6 16.d5 Closing the center. In the old days, humans would be clearly stronger in closed positions than computers but this game kind of changed that idea. 16 … ♘e7 17.♗e3 ♘g6 18.♕d2 ♘h7 19.a4 ♘h4 20.♘×h4 ♕×h4 21.♕e2 ♕d8 22.b4 ♕c7 23.♖ec1 c4 24.♖a3! Preparing to double rooks on the a-file before taking on b5. 24 … ♖ec8 25.♖ca1 ♕d8 26.f4!? At the time, this was considered to be a stunning move because opening a second front on the kingside was considered a very “human-like” concept. As a result, most commentators overerstimated this pawn move a bit. Modern engines prefer the maneuver 26.♗d1! ♘f6 27.♕a2 g6 28.a×b5 ♗×b5 (White’s three heavy pieces on the a-file prevented 28 … a×b5 as 29.♖×a8 wins a full rook) and, after this small positional victory of isolating Black’s pawns on the queenside, to continue maneuvering with 29.♕d2 h5 30.♗c2 ♗g7 31.♘f1. 26 … ♘f6 Better was 26 … e×f4 27.♗×f4 g6. 27.f×e5 d×e5 28.♕f1?! ♘e8?!

After 33.a×b5 a×b4 34.♗×b4 ♖×a2 35.♖×a2 ♘×b5 Black is OK. 33.♘f5! ♗×f5 33 … ♘×f5 34.e×f5 is not better. 34.e×f5 f6 35.♗×d6 ♗×d6 36.a×b5 a×b5 37.♗e4! Another “human-like” move by Deep Blue, depriving Kasparov of the hope to push his e-pawn and bring his bishop to life. 37 … ♖×a2 38.♕×a2 Black has lost the battle over the a-file, and soon White’s heavy pieces will enter his position. 38 … ♕d7 39.♕a7 ♖c7 39 … ♕×a7+ 40.♖×a7 ♖d8 41.♖a5 ♖b8 42.♖a6 ♖d8 43.♖b6 wins a pawn. 40.♕b6 ♖b7 41.♖a8+ ♔f7 42.♕a6 ♕c7 43.♕c6 ♕b6+ 44.♔f1 ♖b8 45.♖a6? A big mistake, due to a bug in the system. Here, Kasparov resigned, not realizing that 45 … ♕e3! saves the draw: 46.♕×d6 and now the key move 46 … ♖e8! when Black’s queen, deeply entered into the enemy position, will pester the white king with endless checks. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (6), 1997 1.e4 c6 The last time Kasparov had played the Caro-Kann in an official tournament game was in 1982. Nevertheless, Deep Blue was fully ready for it … 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 d×e4 4.♘×e4 ♘d7 5.♘g5 ♘gf6 6.♗d3 e6 7.♘1f3 h6? The move that made history, as it was the reason Kasparov would lose this game, and the match. He had gambled that his computer opponent wouldn’t take on e6, but it did, instantly. 8.♘×e6! A piece sacrifice with the intention to keep the enemy king in the center. 8 … ♕e7?! After this, Black is dead lost. Kasparov wants to run with his king to the queenside, but it won’t find safety there. The best continuation was 8 … f×e6 9.♗g6+ ♔e7 10.♗f4 ♘d5 11.♗g3 h5 12.0-0 ♖h6 13.♘h4 and now 13 … ♖×g6! (a return sacrifice to improve the king’s safety) 14.♘×g6+ ♔f7 15.♕×h5 ♘7f6 when Black is clearly worse, but not lost yet. 9.0-0! f×e6 10.♗g6+ ♔d8 11.♗f4 b5 12.a4! ♗b7 13.♖e1 ♘d5 14.♗g3 ♔c8 15.a×b5 c×b5 16.♕d3 ♗c6 17.♗f5 White simply picks up the e6-pawn, so Kasparov decides to give up his queen, but it’s hopeless. 17 … e×f5 18.♖×e7 ♗×e7 19.c4 Crashing through. Kasparov resigned, losing his first match ever. For Deep Blue, which got dismantled after this contest, it was the finest and final victory. 1-0 Topalov-Shirov Linares, 1998 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense. Black allows White to build a pawn center, and plans to attack it later on. 4.c×d5 ♘×d5 5.e4 ♘×c3 6.b×c3 ♗g7 7.♗b5+ c6 8.♗a4 0-0 9.♘e2 ♘d7 10.0-0 e5 Already countering in the center. 11.f3 ♕e7 12.♗e3 ♖d8 13.♕c2 ♘b6 14.♗b3 ♗e6 15.♖ad1 ♘c4 16.♗c1 b5 17.f4 e×d4 18.♘×d4 On 18.c×d4?! Shirov was no doubt planning 18 … f5! to attack the white center even more. 18 … ♗g4 19.♖de1 ♕c5 20.♔h1 a5 21.h3 ♗d7 Black misses a chance to complicate the game with 21 … a4. 22.a4! b×a4 23.♗a2! White simply wanted to remove a defender of the knight on c4. Not 23.♗×a4? ♘b6 24.♗b3 a4. 23 … ♗e8 24.e5 ♘b6 25.f5 ♘d5 26.♗d2? A blunder. Topalov could have won with 26.♕f2! ♕×c3 27.♗b2 ♕b4 28.♗a1! and White is now ready to play 29.f6 and 30.e6 next, leading to a crushing attack, but then we would never have seen Shirov’s beautiful endgame play. 26 … ♘b4! 27.♕×a4 After 27.c×b4 Topalov might’ve hoped for 27 … ♕×d4 28.f×g6 h×g6 29.e6 giving a win for White, but instead, Black counters with 27 … ♕×c2 28.♘×c2 ♖×d2 29.♗b1 a×b4 to win. 27 … ♘×a2 28.♕×a2 ♗×e5 29.f×g6 h×g6 30.♗g5 ♖d5 31.♖e3 ♕d6 32.♕e2 ♗d7 33.c4 ♗×d4 34.c×d5 ♗×e3 35.♕×e3 ♖e8 36.♕c3 ♕×d5 37.♗h6? The only move was 37.♗f6! ♖e2 38.♕g3 when White has enough play against the enemy king to hold the game to a draw. 37 … ♖e5?! Close to winning was 37 … ♕e5! 38.♕f3 ♗e6 39.♕×c6 ♗d5 40.♕a4 ♖b8. 38.♖f3 ♕c5 39.♕a1 ♗f5 40.♖e3 f6 41.♖×e5 ♕×e5 42.♕a2+? After 42.♕a3! White probably has enough counterplay for a draw. 42 … ♕d5 43.♕×d5+ c×d5 44.♗d2 a4 45.♗c3 ♔f7 46.h4 ♔e6 47.♔g1 Now comes one of the most famous moves in chess history. 47 … ♗h3!! A bolt from the blue. This bizarre-looking bishop move happens to be only way to win this position. 48.g×h3 Ignoring the bishop doesn’t help: 48.♔f2 ♔f5 49.♔e3 ♗×g2 50.♔d4 ♔g4 51.♗e1 a3 52.♔c3 f5 53.♔b3 f4 54.♔×a3 ♔f3 55.♔b2 ♔e2 56.♗c3 f3. 48 … ♔f5 49.♔f2 ♔e4 50.♗×f6 50.♔e2 f5 51.♗b2 f4 52.♔f2 d4 and Black simply has too many pawns. 50 … d4 51.♗e7 ♔d3 52.♗c5 ♔c4 53.♗e7 ♔b3 Here Topalov resigned as 54.♔e2 is met by 54 … ♔c2 and one of the pawns will queen. 0-1 l’Ami-Malakhatko Kavala, 2003 1.e4 c5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.d4 c×d4 4.♘×d4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 e5 The Sveshnikov variation of the Sicilian. 6.♘db5 d6 7.♗g5 a6 8.♘a3 b5 9.♗×f6 g×f6 After 9 … ♕×f6?! 10.♘d5 ♕d8 11.♗×b5! a×b5 12.♘×b5 White’s attack is too strong. 10.♘d5 White has a very nice square for his knight on d5, and Black has doubled pawns. Until the 1970s, this was considered to be unplayable for Black. These days the opening named after Evgeny Sveshnikov is well respected. 10 … f5 11.♗d3 ♗e6 12.0-0 ♗×d5 13.e×d5 ♘e7 14.c3 ♗g7 15.♕h5 e4 16.♗c2 ♕c8 17.♖ae1 0-0 18.f3 b4 19.c×b4 ♗×b2 20.f×e4!? L’Ami had prepared this sacrifice. 20 … ♗×a3 21.♖e3 While attacking ♗a3, the rook shifts to an attacking position. He does leave another bishop hanging, though. 21 … ♕×c2 22.♖g3+ ♘g6 23.♖h3 23 … ♖fc8?! Later, stronger engines found that after 23 … ♖fd8! 24.e×f5 ♘e5 it’s Black who is winning: 25.♕g5+ (25.♖×a3 ♕d2 26.♖g3+ ♔f8 27.f6 ♖dc8! or 25.♕×h7+ ♔f8 26.♖×a3 ♕d2 27.♕h8+ ♔e7 28.f6+ ♔d7 29.♕h3+ ♔c7) 25 … ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ ♔c8. 24.e×f5 ♘e5? Now Black loses after all. Here, it was important to return a piece with 24 … ♘f4! 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♕×f4 and then improve the bishop’s position with 26 … ♗b2! when White should take the draw with 27.♕×d6+ ♔g8 28.♕g3+ ♔f8 (not 28 … ♔h8 29.♕h4) 29.♕d6+ or continue the fight with 29.f6!? ♕e2! 30.♕g7+ ♔e8 31.♖hf3. 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ Now we see why c8 was an unfortunate square to put the rook on. 29 … ♔d8 30.♖e1! L’Ami had analyzed this with the computer till the last move. 1-0 Carlsen-Kasparov Reykjavík (rapid), 2004 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.♘f3 ♘f6 4.♘c3 e6 5.♗g5 ♘bd7 6.e3 ♕a5 The Cambridge Springs Defense of the Queen’s Gambit, named after a 1904 tournament in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, where it was played several times. 7.♘d2 Stopping Black’s intended move 7 … ♘e4. 7 … ♗b4 8.♕c2 0-0 9.♗e2 e5 10.0-0 e×d4 11.♘b3 ♕b6 12.e×d4 d×c4 13.♗×c4 Black has isolated White’s d-pawn but White’s pieces are much more active. 13 … a5 14.a4 ♕c7 15.♖ae1 h6 16.♗h4 ♗d6 16 … ♘b6 17.♗d3 ♘bd5 with equality. 17.h3 ♘b6 18.♗×f6! ♘×c4 19.♘e4! Perhaps Kasparov had underestimated this idea. 19 … ♗h2+ The main point is that Black cannot take: 19 … g×f6 20.♘×f6+ ♔g7 21. ♕h7+ ♔×f6 22.♕×h6+ ♔f5 23.g4#. 20.♔h1 ♘d6 21.♔×h2 ♘×e4+ 22.♗e5 ♘d6 23.♕c5 ♖d8 24.d5! A 13-year-old Carlsen is putting maximum pressure on his famous opponent and will soon win a pawn. 24 … ♕d7 25.♘d4 ♘f5 26.d×c6 b×c6 27.♘×c6 ♖e8 28.♖d1 ♕e6 29.♖fe1 Strong was 29.♗c7! after which White can safely play 30.♘×a5. 29 … ♗b7 30.♘d4 ♘×d4 31.♕×d4 ♕g6 32. ♕g4 Keeping the queens on the board with 32.f3 was slightly more promising. 32 … ♕×g4 33.h×g4 ♗c6 34.b3 f6 35.♗c3 ♖×e1 36.♖×e1 ♗d5 37.♖b1 ♔f7 38.♔g3 ♖b8 39.b4 a×b4 40.♗×b4 ♗c4 41.a5 ♗a6 42.f3 ♔g6 43.♔f4 h5 44.g×h5+ ♔×h5 45.♖h1+ ♔g6 46.♗c5 ♖b2 47.♔g3 ♖a2 48.♗b6 ♔f7 49.♖c1 g5 50.♖c7+ ♔g6 51.♖c6 ♗f1 52.♗f2 Black’s pieces are working so well that White cannot make progress despite the extra pawn. ½-½ Kramnik-Leko Brissago (8), 2004 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 0-0 8.c3 d5 This move starts the Marshall Attack. Black sacrifices the e-pawn but will get attacking chances on White’s king. 9.e×d5 ♘×d5 10.♘×e5 ♘×e5 11.♖×e5 c6 12.d4 ♗d6 13.♖e1 ♕h4 14.g3 ♕h3 15.♖e4 White threatens to move this rook to h4, which Black prevents with his next move. 15 … g5 16.♕f1 ♕h5 17.♘d2 ♗f5 18.f3! Creating a square on f2 for the queen, since Black cannot really take the rook anyway. 18 … ♘f6 18 … ♗×e4? 19.f×e4 ♘b6 20.e5 followed by 21. ♘e4 would give White a wonderful position. 19.♖e1 ♖ae8 20.♖×e8 ♖×e8 21.a4 ♕g6 22.a×b5?! Played relatively quickly by Kramnik, who would later state that he gambled a bit here, also because Leko was already getting low on time. Better was 22.♘e4 ♘×e4 23.f×e4 ♗×e4 24.♗×g5 ♗f5 when Black has enough compensation for the pawn, but not more. 22 … ♗d3! 23.♕f2? Kramnik had too much faith in his team’s computer preparation and overestimated his position here. He should have played 23.♕d1 instead and accept a draw by repetition: 23 … ♗e2 24.♕e1 ♗d3 25.♕d1. 23 … ♖e2 24.♕×e2 After 24.b×a6 ♖×f2 25.♔×f2 ♕h5 26.♔g1 White’s a-pawn will become a queen, but too late: 26 … ♗×g3! 27.h×g3 ♕h3 28.a7 ♕×g3+ 29.♔h1 g4! 30.a8♕+ ♔g7 31.♕b7 ♕e1+ 32.♔g2 g×f3+ 33.♘×f3 ♕f1+ 34.♔g3 ♘h5+ 35.♔h4 ♕h1+ 36.♔g4 ♕g2+ 37.♔×h5 ♕h3+ 38.♘h4 ♗e2+ 39.♔g5 ♕g4#. 24 … ♗×e2 25.b×a6 Also here White is not in time.

Two question marks are not enough for what is possibly the biggest blunder in history committed by a (former) world champion. The game should have ended with the following repetition: 34 … ♔g8 35.♘g6 ♗×b2 36.♕d5+ ♔h7 37.♘f8+ ♔h8 38.♘g6+. 35.♕h7# 1-0 Topalov-Anand Sofia (1), 2010 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense, like in Topalov-Shirov. 4.c×d5 ♘×d5 5.e4 ♘×c3 6.b×c3 ♗g7 7.♗c4 c5 8.♘e2 ♘c6 With the knight on e2 instead of f3, 8 … ♗g4 can be answered by 9.f3. 9.♗e3 0-0 10.0-0 ♘a5 11.♗d3 b6 12.♕d2 e5 13.♗h6 c×d4 14.♗×g7 ♔×g7 15.c×d4 e×d4 16.♖ac1 ♕d6 17.f4 f6 18.f5 ♕e5 19.♘f4 g5 20.♘h5+ ♔g8 Against 20 … ♔h8 the Topalov team had prepared the same move as he would play next: 21.h4! ♖g8 and now it’s possible to play 22.♘×f6!? ♕×f6 23.e5 ♕×e5 24.f6 and the f-pawn is quite dangerous.

Anand remembered that this move had to be played, but not in which position. Correct was 23 … ♗d7! 24.♖g3 and only now 24 … ♔f7 25.♗c4+ ♘×c4 26.♖×c4 ♖h8 27.♖×d4 ♗e8 28.♖d7+ ♔f8! (28 … ♗×d7?? 29.♕×d7+ ♕e7 30.♕d5+ loses the rook on a8.) 29.♘×f6 ♕a1+ 30.♔f2 ♕×f6 and White’s attack is only good for a draw: 31.♕b4+ ♔g8 32.♕b3+ ♔f8. 24.♘×f6! A sacrifice that Topalov and his team had prepared with the computer, while Anand’s team was also aware of it. But you can’t remember everything … 24 … ♔×f6 24 … ♕×f6 25.♖h3! ♗d7 26.♖h7+ ♔e8 27.e5! with a winning attack. 25.♖h3! ♖g8 25 … ♕f4 26.e5+! ♔×e5 27.♕e2+ ♔d5 28.♖f1 ♕e5 29.♕f3+ winning ♖a8. 26.♖h6+ ♔f7 27.♖h7+ ♔e8 28.♖cc7 ♔d8 29.♗b5! ♕×e4 29 … ♕×b5 30.♕×d4+ ♔e8 31.♖he7+ ♔f8 32.♕f6#. 30.♖×c8+ Anand resigned because of 30 … ♔×c8 31.♕c1+ ♘c6 32.♗×c6 ♕e3+ 33.♕×e3 d×e3 34.♗×a8. 1-0 Carlsen-Nakamura Stavanger, 2017 1.e4 c5 2.♘f3 d6 3.d4 c×d4 4.♘×d4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 a6 The Najdorf variation of the Sicilian, named after the Polish-Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf. 6.h3 This little pawn move was also played by a young Bobby Fischer. 6 … g6 7.g3 ♘c6 8.♗e3 ♗g7 9.♗g2 0-0 10.0-0 ♘d7 11.b3 ♘×d4 12.♗×d4 ♗×d4 13.♕×d4 b6 14.♘d5 ♗b7 15.c4 e5 Fixing White’s e-pawn on a light square, so that it will keep blocking the bishop on g2.

Kasparov chooses a move that James Mason and Paul Keres have tried in the past. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔e2 A remarkable situation: after four moves the white king cannot castle anymore and is blocking his bishop and queen.

Missing the simple 43 … ♕c6+! after which Black can take the knight. Kasparov would have resigned instantly. 44.♔h1 ♕d1+ 45.♔g2 ♕e2+ 46.♔g1 ♕d1+ 47.♔g2 ♕c2+ 48.♔g1 ♕b1+ 49.♔h2 ♕b2+ 50.♔h1 ♕b1+ 51.♔h2 ♕a2+ 52.♔g1 ♕a1+ 53.♔h2 ♕b2+ 54.♔h1 ♕c1+ 55.♔h2 ♕d2+ 56.♔h1 ♕d1+ 57.♔h2 ♕e2+ 58.♔g1 ♕d1+ 59.♔h2 ♕d2+ 60.♔h1 ♕d1+ With little time on the clock, Karjakin goes for a draw. He could have continued with 60 … ♕c1+ 61.♔h2 ♖f7 but it does look somewhat dangerous: 62.♘h4+ (62.♕b8+ ♔g7 63.♕h8+ ♔h6 64.♘e5 ♕c7) 62 … ♖g7 63.♕b8+ ♔f7 64.♕×a7+ ♔f6 65.♕×b6+ ♔g5 66.♕d8+ ♔h5 67.♘g2. However Black can now trade queens with 67 … ♕c7+ 68.♕×c7 ♖×c7 when the remaining endgame should be a draw. ½-½ Carlsen-Niemann St. Louis, MO, 2022 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 e6 3.♘c3 ♗b4 The Nimzo-Indian Defense, named after the Latvian-born Danish chess player/writer Aron Nimzowitsch. 4.g3 0-0 5.♗g2 d5 6.a3 ♗×c3+ 7.b×c3 d×c4 8.♘f3 c5 9.0-0 c×d4 10.♕×d4 ♘c6 11.♕×c4 e5 12.♗g5 h6 13.♖fd1 ♗e6 14.♖×d8 ♗×c4 15.♖×a8 ♖×a8 16.♗×f6 g×f6 17.♔f1 ♖d8 The opening didn’t go too well for White as he is slightly worse in this endgame. 18.♔e1 ♘a5 19.♖d1 ♖c8 20.♘d2 ♗e6 21.c4 ♗×c4 22.♘×c4 ♖×c4 23.♖d8+ ♔g7 24.♗d5 ♖c7 25.♖a8 a6 26.♖b8 f5 27.♖e8 e4 28.g4?! Here 28.f3 gives better drawing chances. 28 … ♖c5! 29.♗a2 ♘c4?! There was nothing wrong with 29 … f×g4 30.♖×e4 (30.♖e7 ♘c4 31.♖×b7 h5) 30 … f5 31.♖e7+ ♔f6 32.♖f7+ ♔g5 33.♖g7+ ♔h4 and Black is doing well. 30.a4 30.♗×c4 ♖×c4 31.g×f5 ♖a4 32.♖b8 b5 33.♖b6 ♖×a3 34.♔d2 probably didn’t look very attractive to Carlsen, but thanks to the rook on b6 cutting off the black king from participating, White actually has drawing chances here. 30 … ♘d6 31.♖e7 f×g4 32.♖d7 e3! A nice intermediate move. 33.f×e3 Black’s trick was 33.♖×d6?? ♖c1+ 34.♖d1 ♖×d1+ 35.♔×d1 e×f2. 33 … ♘e4 34.♔f1 ♖c1+ Better was 34 … ♖f5+ 35.♔g2 b5. 35.♔g2 ♖c2 36.♗×f7 ♖×e2+ 37.♔g1 ♖e1+ 38.♔g2 ♖e2+ 39.♔g1 ♔f6 40.♗d5 ♖d2 41.♖f7+ ♔g6 42.♖d7? Carlsen again refrains from going into a rook endgame, even though they are notoriously drawish. 42.♖e7! ♖×d5 (42 … ♘g5 43.♗g2) 43.♖×e4 ♔f5 44.♖b4 ♖d7 45.h3! g×h3 46.♔h2 with good chances to draw the game. 42 … ♘g5! Now Black is winning. 43.♗f7+ ♔f5 44.♖×d2 ♘f3+ 45.♔g2 ♘×d2 46.a5 ♔e5 47.♔g3 ♘f1+ 48.♔f2 ♘×h2 49.e4 ♔×e4 50.♗e6 ♔f4 51.♗c8 ♘f3 52.♗×b7 ♘e5 53.♗×a6 ♘c6 54.♗b7 ♘×a5 55.♗d5 h5 56.♗f7 h4 57.♗d5 0-1 Caruana-Giri Bucharest, 2023 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 ♘f6 4.d3 ♗c5 The Giuoco Pianissimo, Italian for ‘very slow game,’ is one of the most popular variations in top-level chess these days. The main reason is that the Berlin Defense (3 … ♘f6) against the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5) is so strong. 5.c3 d6 6.b4 ♗b6 7.a4 a5 8.b5 ♘e7 9.0-0 0-0 10.♘bd2 ♘g6 11.d4 h6 12.♖e1 ♖e8 13.♗a3 Later the same year, Caruana would try the move 13.h3 in this position. 13 … e×d4 14.♕b3 d5! 14 … ♗e6 15.♗×e6 ♖×e6 16.c×d4 is slightly better for White. The text move is a strong, new move after which Black is equal, but only after some very sharp complications. 15.e×d5 d×c3 16.♖×e8+ After 16.♕×c3 ♗f5 Black is perhaps already a bit better. 16 … ♕×e8 17.♖e1! 17 … ♕×e1+! 18.♘×e1 c×d2 19.♘f3 ♘e4 Attacking f2. Black has just enough counterplay for the queen. 20.d6 One of those situations where attack is the best defense. 20 … ♘×f2 21.♗×f7+ ♔h8 22.♘×d2 Now comes the point behind Black’s play. 22 … ♘e4+ 23.♔h1 Of course not 23.♔f1?? ♘×d2+ winning the house. 23 … ♘f2+ 24.♔g1 ♘e4+ 25.♔h1 ♘f2+ 26.♔g1 Caruana had prepared everything and played all moves hardly thinking about them while Giri needed to dig deep in his memory. ½-½",

For those chess fans eager to play through the moves on a chessboard, you will find them below with my annotations. If you prefer to play through them online, you can find the games also at peterdoggers.com/annotated-games. The games are given in algebraic notation; for an explanation I refer to chess.com/terms/chess-notation. Dilaram Problem 1.♖h8+! ♔×h8 2.♗f5+ Note that at the time this problem was composed, bishops could jump over pieces but moved only two squares diagonally. 2 … ♔g8 3.♖h8+! ♔×h8 4.g7+ ♔g8 5.♘h6# Napoleon—Mechanical Turk Vienna, 1809 1.e4 e5 2.♕f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 Napoleon is going for a quick victory on the battlefield. 3 … ♘f6 The Turk is not falling for this beginner’s trick. It would be Scholar’s Mate after something like 3…d6 4.♕×f7#. 4.♘e2 ♗c5 5.a3 d6 6.0-0 Napoleon develops some pieces and castles, showing that he is not a total beginner. 6 … ♗g4 7.♕d3 ♘h5!? 8.h3?! A loss of time. It was high time to develop a new piece; after 8.♘bc3 White is not much worse actually. 8 … ♗×e2 9.♕×e2 ♘f4 10.♕e1? A terrible square for the queen, after which White is dead lost. 10 … ♘d4 After 10 … ♕g5! 11.g4 (11.g3 allows 11 … ♕×g3+! 12.♔h1 ♕g2#) 11…♘×h3+ 12.♔h2 ♕h4 it’s checkmate soon. 11.♗b3?! 11 … ♘×h3+! Here, Napoleon must have realized things weren’t going très bien for him. 12.♔h2 Black’s trick was 12.g×h3 ♘f3+, a “family check” that wins the queen. 12 … ♕h4! A devastating blow. 13.g3 ♘f3+ 14.♔g2 ♘×e1+ The Turk wasn’t a perfect player either. Here, 14 … ♘f4+! would have forced checkmate: 15.g×f4 (15.♔×f3 ♕h5+ 16.g4 ♕h3#) 15 … ♕g4+ 16.♔h1 ♕h3#. 15.♖×e1 ♕g4 16.d3 ♗×f2 17.♖h1 ♕×g3+ 18.♔f1 ♗d4 19.♔e2 ♕g2+ 20.♔d1 ♕×h1+ 21.♔d2 ♕g2+ 22.♔e1 ♘g1 23.♘c3 ♗×c3+ 24.b×c3 ♕e2# It’s safe to say that Napoleon wasn’t too thrilled when this game ended. 0-1 Anderssen-Kieseritzky London, 1851 1.e4 e5 2.f4 The King’s Gambit, arguably the most romantic of openings. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4!? Much more common is 3.♘f3. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔f1 Of course not 4.g3?? f×g3 and White cannot take back the pawn. 4 … b5 A countergambit Kieseritzky had used to beat Anderssen in an earlier game. The idea is to chase the bishop away from the diagonal that attacks f7, and also, Black might be able to attack that bishop more easily. 5.♗×b5 ♘f6 6.♘f3 ♕h6 7.d3 ♘h5 Black now threatens 8 … ♘g3+. 8.♘h4 ♕g5 9.♘f5 c6 On 9 … g6 10.h4 ♕f6 Anderssen was no doubt planning 11.♘c3 after which Black shouldn’t go 11 … g×f5 12.♕×h5 but 11 … ♗b7 would give him a good position. 10.g4?! This attempt to trap Black’s queen is a mistake. Better was 10.♗a4. 10 … ♘f6 11.♖g1 c×b5? 11 … h5! would be in Black’s favor: 12.h4 ♕g6 13.♗a4 (13.g5 ♘g4 shows the main idea behind 11 … h5) 13 … h×g4 14.♗×f4 d5! Black is doing well. 12.h4 ♕g6 13.h5 ♕g5 14.♕f3 White will take the f-pawn with his bishop next, after which Black’s queen would indeed be trapped, so he needs a desperate measure. 14 … ♘g8?! 14 … ♗b7!? was a remarkable option to Black: 15.♗×f4 ♘×g4! 16.♗×g5 ♘h2+ 17.♔f2 ♘×f3 18.♔×f3 but White is close to winning, thanks to his better development and structure. 15.♗×f4 ♕f6 16.♘c3 ♗c5 17.♘d5!? The logical move 17.d4 is very strong as well, but Anderssen probably already saw the fireworks that will soon appear. A romantic mind! 17 … ♕×b2 18.♗d6!? Offering both rooks! This bishop move is the prelude to a wonderful combination which, however, is not entirely correct. With 18.♖e1 White would keep a winning advantage. 18 … ♗×g1? Now Anderssen gets what he wants. Correct was 18 … ♕×a1+ 19.♔e2 ♕b2! attacking c2, when 20.♗×c5 ♕×c2+ 21.♔f1 ♕×c5 22.♕f4 f6 23.♘d6+ ♔d8 24.♘f7+ ♔e8 25.♘d6+ would be a draw by a repetition of moves (not 25.♘×h8? d6 and Black’s extra piece should win the game). 19.e5! Cutting off the a1-h8 diagonal for the queen, so that g7 is not protected anymore. Even stronger was 19.♖e1. 19 … ♕×a1+ 20.♔e2 ♘a6? Allowing a beautiful mate in three that made this game famous. The best defense was 20 … ♗a6 but after 21.♘c7+ ♔d8 22.♘×a6! White would still be winning: 22 … ♕c3 23.♗c7+ ♕×c7 (23 … ♔c8 24.♘d6#; 23 … ♔e8 24.♘d6+ ♔e7 25.♕×f7#) 24.♘×c7. 21.♘×g7+ ♔d8 And now the key idea: 22.♕f6+!! ♘×f6 23.♗e7# 1-0 Anderssen-Dufresne Berlin, 1852 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗c4 ♗c5 4.b4 The Evans Gambit, named after the Welsh sea captain William Davies Evans. 4 … ♗×b4 5.c3 ♗a5 6.d4 e×d4 7.0-0 d3!? Black doesn’t play 7 … d×c3 because after 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.♗g5 ♕g6 White can develop his other knight with 10.♘×c3 while after the text move, the white pawn on c3 keeps the knight away from that square. 8.♕b3 ♕f6 9.e5 ♕g6 Not 9 … ♘×e5?? 10.♖e1 d6 11.♕b5+ winning a piece. 10.♖e1 ♘ge7 11.♗a3 b5? This was not necessary at all. After 11 … 0-0 12.♘bd2 d5! 13.e×d6 (en passant) 13 … c×d6 Black is better. 12.♕×b5 ♖b8 This was Black’s idea: winning time to activate his rook over the b-file. It wasn’t worth a pawn, though. 13.♕a4 ♗b6 Castling would lose a piece: 13 … 0-0 14.♗×e7! ♘×e7 15.♕×a5. 14.♘bd2 ♗b7?! 15.♘e4 ♕f5? Losing too much time. The last try was 15 … d2 16.♘e×d2 ♘d8. 16.♗×d3 Threatening 17.♘f6+ and 18.♗×f5, which is also possible if Black castles. 16 … ♕h5 17.♘f6+!? Objectively speaking, 17.♖ad1 was stronger. 17 … g×f6 18.e×f6 Because ♘e7 is pinned, White will win the piece back and the e-file is opened up. It looks great, but Black can counter, which he does: 18 … ♖g8! 19.♖ad1 ♕×f3? Falling for Anderssen’s brilliant ploy. A better way to make use of the pinned g-pawn was 19 … ♕h3! threatening mate on g2, since 20.♗f1 (not 20.g3? ♖×g3+! 21.h×g3 ♕×g3+ 22.♔h1 ♕×f3+ 23.♔h2 ♕×f2+ 24.♔h3 ♕f3+ 25.♔h2 ♘e5 and it’s Black who has a winning attack.) 20 … ♕f5 leaves neither player with a clear advantage. What follows is one of the most famous combinations in chess history. 20.♖×e7+! ♘×e7 21.♕×d7+!! Just brilliant. 21 … ♔×d7 22.♗f5+ ♔e8 23.♗d7+ ♔f8 24.♗×e7# 1-0 Levitsky-Marshall Breslau, 1912 1.e4 e6 The French Defense. 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 c5 4.♘f3 ♘c6 5.e×d5 e×d5 6.♗e2 ♘f6 7.0-0 ♗e7 8.♗g5 0-0 9.d×c5 ♗e6 10.♘d4 ♗×c5 11.♘×e6 f×e6 12.♗g4 ♕d6 13.♗h3 ♖ae8 14.♕d2 ♗b4 15.♗×f6 ♖×f6 16.♖ad1 ♕c5 17.♕e2 ♗×c3 18.b×c3 ♕×c3 19.♖×d5 ♘d4 20.♕h5 ♖ef8 21.♖e5 ♖h6 22.♕g5 ♖×h3 23.♖c5 On 23.g×h3 comes ♘f3+. Black is winning and can go to almost any square with the queen now, since he has already won a piece, but the spot he chooses is the most spectacular. 23 … ♕g3!! White resigned. The black queen can be taken in three ways after 23 … ♕g3 but they all lose: 24.h×g3 ♘e2#; 24.f×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♖×f1#; 24.♕×g3 ♘e2+ 25.♔h1 ♘×g3+ 26.♔g1 (26.f×g3 ♖×f1#) 26 … ♘e2+ 27.♔h1 ♖c3. 0-1 D. Byrne-Fischer New York, 1956 1.♘f3 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 ♗g7 4.d4 0-0 5.♗f4 d5 6.♕b3 d×c4 7.♕×c4 c6 8.e4 ♘bd7 9.♖d1 ♘b6 10.♕c5 ♗g4 11.♗g5? This allows a brilliant shot. Better was 11.♗e2 when 11 … ♘fd7 12.♕a3 ♗×f3 13.♗×f3 e5! 14.d×e5 ♖e8 is close to equal. 11…♘a4!! 12.♕a3 12.♘×a4 ♘×e4 wins for Black in all lines: 13.♕b4 ♘×g5; 13.♕×e7 ♕a5+ 14.b4 ♕×a4 15.♕×e4 ♖fe8 16.♗e7 ♗×f3 17.g×f3 ♗f8; 13.♗×e7 ♘×c5 14.♗×d8 ♖e8+ 15.♗e2 ♘×a4; 13.♕c1 ♗×f3 14.g×f3 ♕a5+ 15.♗d2 ♘×d2 16.♕×d2 ♕×a4 and d4 will drop. 12…♘×c3 13.b×c3 ♘×e4! Another surprising knight move that involves an exchange sacrifice. It’s all possible thanks to White’s lack in development. 14.♗×e7 ♕b6 15.♗c4 After 15.♗×f8 ♗×f8 White is in big trouble: 16.♕c1 ♘×c3 17.♖d2 ♖e8+ 18.♗e2 ♘×e2 19.♖×e2 ♖×e2+ 20.♔×e2 ♕b5+ 21.♔d1 (21.♔d2 ♗h6+; 21.♔e1 ♗b4+) 21…♕d3+ 22.♕d2 ♗×f3+ 23.g×f3 ♕×f3+ or 16.♕b3 ♘×c3! 17.♕×b6 a×b6 18.♖d2 ♗b4! and also here White will lose material. 15…♘×c3! 16.♗c5 16.♕×c3 is met by 16 … ♖ae8 and 16.♗×f8 ♗×f8 17.♕×c3? ♗b4 is another idea. 16…♖fe8+ 17.♔f1 17.♔d2 ♘e4+ and 17.♘e5 ♗×e5 18.♗×b6 ♗d6+ win for Black. 17…♗e6!! The beautiful point behind the whole combination. 18.♗×b6 18.♗×e6 leads to a pretty mate: ♕b5+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘g3+ 21.♔g1 ♕f1+ 22.♖×f1 ♘e2#. After 18.♕×c3 ♕×c5 19.d×c5 ♗×c3 20.♗×e6 ♖×e6 Black has a winning endgame. 18…♗×c4+ 19.♔g1 ♘e2+ 20.♔f1 ♘×d4+ 21.♔g1 ♘e2+ 22.♔f1 ♘c3+ 23.♔g1 a×b6! Black’s minor pieces are much stronger than White’s queen. 24.♕b4 ♖a4 25.♕×b6 ♘×d1 26.h3 ♖×a2 27.♔h2 ♘×f2 28.♖e1 ♖×e1 29.♕d8+ ♗f8 30.♘×e1 ♗d5 31.♘f3 ♘e4 32.♕b8 b5 33.h4 h5 34.♘e5 ♔g7 35. ♔g1 ♗c5+ 36.♔f1 36.♔h2 ♗d6 is resignable and 36.♔h1 ♘g3+ 37.♔h2 ♘f1+ 38.♔h3 ♗×g2 is checkmate. 36…♘g3+ 37.♔e1 ♗b4+ 38.♔d1 ♗b3+ 39.♔c1 ♘e2+ 40.♔b1 ♘c3+ 41.♔c1 ♖c2# 0-1 This game never ceases to amaze me. Fischer-Mac Hack (Greenblatt) Cambridge, MA (2), 1977 1.e4 e5 2.f4 Like the Romantics in the 19th century, Fischer plays the King’s Gambit. At that time, computers were very materialistic and could not see deep enough to understand White’s compensation. 2 … e×f4 3.♗c4 In the footsteps of Anderssen and others. 3 … d5!? 4.♗×d5 ♘f6 5.♘c3 ♗b4 6.♘f3 0-0 7.0-0 ♘×d5 8.♘×d5 ♗d6?! So far, Black’s play wasn’t actually that bad, but only if it was followed up by 8 … f5! 9.♘×b4 f×e4 winning back a piece, since if White removes ♘f3, Black has ♕d4+ and the knight on b4 drops. 9.d4 Now White is much better, in fact close to winning already, thanks to his strong pawn center. 9 … g5?! Trying to hang on to the pawn on f4 only makes matters worse. 10.♘×g5! An easy sacrifice for Fischer. 10 … ♕×g5 11.e5 ♗h3 12.♖f2 ♗×e5 The bishop is also lost after 12 … ♗e7 13.♗×f4 ♕h4 14.g3. 13.d×e5 c6 14.♗×f4 ♕g7 15.♘f6+ ♔h8 16.♕h5♖d8 16 … ♗e6 allows 17.♗h6. 17.♕×h3 ♘a6 18.♖f3 ♕g6 19.♖c1 ♔g7 20.♖g3 ♖h8 Now White can take the queen, but thanks to the pin over the g-file it’s actually mate in one. 21.♕h6#! 1-0 Chess 4.7-Levy Toronto, 1978 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 f5 The Latvian Gambit. 3.e×f5 A fine move while 3.♘×e5 is considered to be even stronger. 3 … e4 4.♘e5 ♘f6 5.♘g4?! d5 6.♘×f6+ ♕×f6 7.♕h5+? ♕f7?! Levy misses the idea 7 … g6! 8.f×g6 h×g6 9.♕×d5 ♖h5! and after for example 10.♕c4 ♘c6 Black will have very quick development. Modern engines consider the position almost lost for White. 8.♕×f7+ ♔×f7 9.♘c3 c6 10.d3! e×d3! 10 … ♗×f5 11.d×e4 d×e4 would be dangerous because of 12.♗c4+ ♔f6 13.g4! ♗g6 14.h4. 11.♗×d3 ♘d7 12.♗f4 ♘c5 13.g4 ♘×d3+ 14.c×d3 White remains a pawn up in the endgame. 14 … ♗c5 15.0-0 h5 16.♘a4 ♗d4 17.♗e3 ♗e5 18.d4 ♗d6 19.h3 b6 20.♖fe1 ♗d7 21.♘c3 h×g4 22.h×g4 ♖h4 23.f3 ♖ah8 24.♔f1 ♗g3? Missing a win with 24 … ♖h3! 25.♔e2 ♖h2+ 26.♔d3 (on 26.♗f2 Black plays the same move) 26 … ♗c8! and Black’s activity is overwhelming. 25.♖e2 ♗c8 26.♔g2 ♗d6 27.♗g1 ♖h3 28.♖ae1 ♖g3+ 29.♔f2 ♖hh3 30.♖e3 ♗a6 31.♘e2 ♗×e2 32.♖1×e2 c5 33.f4 ♖×e3 34.♖×e3 ♖h4? 34 … ♖×e3 35.♔×e3 c4 was about equal, but Levy wants to win this game. 35.♔g3 ♖h1 36.♗f2 ♖d1 37.♖a3? It was beyond Chess 4.7’s horizon to see the line 37.g5! ♖×d4 38.♖e6 ♗×f4+ 39.♔f3 and the black rook keeps getting attacked so that it cannot stay on the fourth rank after which ♗f4 will hang: 39 … ♖c4 40.b3 ♖b4 41.a3. 37 … c×d4 38.♖×a7+ 38 … ♔f8? Necessary was 38 … ♔e8 when it’s equal again. White cannot play 39.♖×g7? because Black comes first: 39 … d3 40.♔f3 d2 41.♔e2 ♖f1! 42.♔×d2 (42.♔×f1 d1♕+) 42 … ♖×f2+ 43.♔d3 ♖×f4. 39.♖d7! ♖d3+ 40.♔g2 ♗c5 41.♖×d5 ♖d2 42.b4! ♗×b4 43.♖d8+ ♔f7 44.♖d7+ ♔f8 45.♖×d4 ♖b2 46.♔f3 ♗c5 47.♖d8+ ♔e7 48.♗h4+ ♔f7 49.g5 g6 50.♖d7+ ♔f8 51.f×g6 ♖×a2 52.f5 ♖a3+ 53.♔g4 ♖a4+ 54.♔h5 ♖d4 55.♖c7 ♗e7 And Levy resigned, not waiting for 56.f6. It was a historic first win by a computer against a master-level player. 1-0 Karpov-Kasparov Moscow (9), 1984 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.♘f3 c5 The Tarrasch Defense. 4.c×d5 e×d5 5.g3 ♘f6 6.♗g2 ♗e7 7.0-0 0-0 8.♘c3 ♘c6 9.♗g5 c×d4 10.♘×d4 h6 11.♗e3 ♖e8 12.♕b3 ♘a5 13.♕c2 ♗g4 14.♘f5 ♖c8 15.♗d4 ♗c5 16.♗×c5 ♖×c5 17.♘e3 ♗e6 18.♖ad1 ♕c8 19.♕a4 ♖d8 20.♖d3 a6 21.♖fd1 ♘c4 22.♘×c4 ♖×c4 23.♕a5 ♖c5 24.♕b6 ♖d7 25.♖d4 ♕c7 26.♕×c7 ♖d×c7 27.h3 h5 28.a3 g6 29.e3 ♔g7 30.♔h2 ♖c4 31.♗f3 b5 32.♔g2 ♖7c5 33.♖×c4 ♖×c4 34.♖d4 ♔f8 35.♗e2 ♖×d4 36.e×d4 ♔e7 37.♘a2 ♗c8 38.♘b4 ♔d6 39.f3 ♘g8 40.h4 ♘h6 41.♔f2 ♘f5 42.♘c2 f6 43.♗d3 g5 44.♗×f5 Karpov sees that his knight will be a better piece than Black’s bishop in this endgame, which is limited by the many pawns on light squares. 44 … ♗×f5 45.♘e3 ♗b1 46.b4 g×h4? A mistake, but the reason why was hard to foresee. 47.♘g2!! A fantastic move. White sacrifices a pawn to create an entry point for his king along the h-file. After 47.g×h4 ♗g6 48.♔g3 ♔e6 49.♔f4 ♗h7 White cannot make progress. 47 … h×g3+ 48.♔×g3 ♔e6 Giving up the h-pawn right away, since Black cannot keep it. 48 … ♗g6 49.♘f4 ♗f7 50.♔h4 ♔e7 51.♘×h5 is similar to the game and 51 … ♗×h5 52.♔×h5 loses quickly: 52 … ♔f7 53.♔h6 ♔e6 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.f4 ♔e6 56.f5+ ♔e7 57.♔g7. 49.♘f4+ ♔f5 50.♘×h5 Threatening ♘g7-e8-c7, therefore the king must retreat. 50 … ♔e6 50 … ♗c2 51.♘f4 ♗b3 52.♘d3 and the a6-pawn will drop soon. 51.♘f4+ ♔d6 52.♔g4 ♗c2 53.♔h5 ♗d1 54.♔g6 ♔e7 55.♘×d5+? The first error by Karpov. The winning move was 55.♘h5!. 55 … ♔e6 56.♘c7+ ♔d7 57.♘×a6 ♗×f3 58.♔×f6 ♔d6 59.♔f5 ♔d5 60.♔f4 ♗h1 61.♔e3 ♔c4 62.♘c5 ♗c6 63.♘d3 ♗g2 64.♘e5+ ♔c3 65.♘g6 ♔c4 66.♘e7 ♗b7? Now White is winning again. This famous endgame has been analyzed by many grandmasters. Some of them reached the same conclusion as the modern engines: Black could still draw this position with 66 … ♗h1!. 67.♘f5 ♗g2 68.♘d6+ ♔b3 69.♘×b5 ♔a4 70.♘d6 If Black takes on a3, White’s b-pawn simply runs up the board. 1-0 Kasparov-Anand New York (10), 1995 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♘×e4 This move marks the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez (Spanish) opening. 6.d4 b5 7.♗b3 d5 8.d×e5 ♗e6 9.♘bd2 ♘c5 10.c3 d4 11.♘g5!? This remarkable move was first played by Kasparov’s long-time nemesis Anatoly Karpov, also in the 10th game of his 1978 match against Viktor Korchnoi. 11 … d×c3 11 … ♕×g5 is also playable when White wins back the piece with 12.♕f3. 12.♘×e6 f×e6 13.b×c3 ♕d3 Both players had played without thinking so far because the same moves had also appeared in the sixth match game. Here, Kasparov deviates. 14.♗c2!! This move had been suggested by the former world champion Mikhail Tal and carefully checked by Kasparov’s team with the help of the computer. 14 … ♕×c3 15.♘b3 ♘×b3 Played by Anand after 45 minutes of thought. 16.♗×b3 16 … ♘d4 White was offering his rook on a1 but Anand saw that it’s dangerous to take it straight away: 16 … ♕×a1 17.♕h5+ g6 (17 … ♔d8 18.♗g5+ wins the queen on a1 while 17 … ♔d7 18.♗×e6+! ♔×e6 19.♕g4+ ♔f7 20.♕f3+ ♔e6 21.♕×c6+ ♗d6 22.e×d6 also wins for White) 18.♕f3 ♘d8 19.♕f6 ♖g8 20.♗×e6 ♖g7 21.♗a3! ♕×f1+ 22.♔×f1 ♘×e6 23.♕×e6+ ♗e7 24.♕c6+ and White will be up too much material. 17.♕g4! Kasparov insists. Take my rook! 17 … ♕×a1 17 … ♘×b3 18.♕×e6+ ♗e7 19.♗g5 is a simple win. 18.♗×e6 ♖d8! The best move. 19.♗h6! Kasparov was still playing his moves almost instantly as he had analyzed all this before with the computer. 19 … ♕c3 The best defense. 19 … ♕×f1+ 20.♔×f1 g×h6 21.♕h5+ ♔e7 22.♕f7#. 20.♗×g7 ♕d3 21.♗×h8 ♕g6 22.♗f6 ♗e7 23.♗×e7 ♕×g4 24.♗×g4 ♔×e7 Anand has managed to reach the endgame only a pawn down, and he would have chances for survival if he could run his c-pawn up the board, but Kasparov prevents that with an important move. 25.♖c1! c6 26.f4 a5 27.♔f2 a4 28.♔e3 b4 29.♗d1! Kasparov continues accurately. 29 … a3 30.g4 ♖d5 31.♖c4 c5 32.♔e4 ♖d8 33.♖×c5 ♘e6 34.♖d5 ♖c8 35.f5 ♖c4+ 36.♔e3 ♘c5 37.g5 ♖c1 38.♖d6 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov Philadelphia (1), 1996 1.e4 c5 2.c3 Deep Blue’s team had prepared the Alapin Sicilian, to not let Kasparov reach middlegame positions that he knows very well. 2 … d5 3.e×d5 ♕×d5 4.d4 ♘f6 5.♘f3 ♗g4 6.♗e2 e6 7.h3 ♗h5 8.0-0 ♘c6 9.♗e3 c×d4 10.c×d4 ♗b4 11.a3 ♗a5 12.♘c3 ♕d6 13.♘b5 ♕e7 14.♘e5 ♗×e2 15.♕×e2 0-0 16.♖ac1 ♖ac8 17.♗g5 ♗b6 18.♗×f6! g×f6 Not 18 … ♕×f6? 19.♘d7 and Black loses an exchange. 19.♘c4 ♖fd8 20.♘×b6 a×b6 21.♖fd1 f5 22.♕e3 ♕f6 23.d5! An excellent pawn sacrifice that computers in the 1970s likely wouldn’t have played. 23 … ♖×d5 24.♖×d5 e×d5 25.b3! Before taking on b6, Deep Blue first removes a pawn that was hanging. 25 … ♔h8 26.♕×b6 ♖g8 27.♕c5 27 … d4? Better was 27 … ♕g5 28.g3 f4 29.♘d6 ♕f6 30.g4 ♖g6! 31.♘f5 h5 32.♔f1 h×g4 33.h×g4 ♖×g4 34.♕c3 ♖g6 with equality. 28.♘d6 f4 29.♘×b7! A human playing against Kasparov would consider this too risky, since the knight is so far away from defending its king. Deep Blue, however, has calculated everything. 29 … ♘e5 30.♕d5! f3 31.g3 ♘d3 32.♖c7 ♖e8 33.♘d6! ♖e1+ 34.♔h2 ♘×f2 35.♘×f7+ ♔g7 36.♘g5+ ♔h6 37.♖×h7+ Kasparov resigned because he saw 37 … ♔g6 38.♕g8+ ♔f5 39.♘×f3 (not 39.♖f7?? ♖h1#) 39 … ♖h1+ 40.♔g2 and now both the knight on f2 hangs and a quick checkmate starting with 41. ♖h5+ is threatened. This was a computer’s first victory against the world champion in a classical time control. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (2), 1997 1.e4 e5 Kasparov usually played the Sicilian, but apparently he figured this to be a more solid choice against a strong computer. 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 The Closed Ruy Lopez (Spanish). 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 h6 10.d4 ♖e8 11.♘bd2 ♗f8 12.♘f1 ♗d7 13.♘g3 ♘a5 14.♗c2 c5 15.b3 ♘c6 16.d5 Closing the center. In the old days, humans would be clearly stronger in closed positions than computers but this game kind of changed that idea. 16 … ♘e7 17.♗e3 ♘g6 18.♕d2 ♘h7 19.a4 ♘h4 20.♘×h4 ♕×h4 21.♕e2 ♕d8 22.b4 ♕c7 23.♖ec1 c4 24.♖a3! Preparing to double rooks on the a-file before taking on b5. 24 … ♖ec8 25.♖ca1 ♕d8 26.f4!? At the time, this was considered to be a stunning move because opening a second front on the kingside was considered a very “human-like” concept. As a result, most commentators overerstimated this pawn move a bit. Modern engines prefer the maneuver 26.♗d1! ♘f6 27.♕a2 g6 28.a×b5 ♗×b5 (White’s three heavy pieces on the a-file prevented 28 … a×b5 as 29.♖×a8 wins a full rook) and, after this small positional victory of isolating Black’s pawns on the queenside, to continue maneuvering with 29.♕d2 h5 30.♗c2 ♗g7 31.♘f1. 26 … ♘f6 Better was 26 … e×f4 27.♗×f4 g6. 27.f×e5 d×e5 28.♕f1?! ♘e8?! Kasparov missed a chance to equalize the game with 28 … a5! 29.a×b5 a×b4 30.♖×a8 ♖×a8 31.♖×a8 ♕×a8 32.♕×c4 ♕a1+ 33.♔h2 ♕e1! attacking ♗e3 and c3. 29.♕f2 ♘d6 30.♗b6 ♕e8 31.♖3a2 ♗e7 32.♗c5 ♗f8? Apparently, Kasparov had a blind spot for the move 32 … a5 during this game. After 33.a×b5 a×b4 34.♗×b4 ♖×a2 35.♖×a2 ♘×b5 Black is OK. 33.♘f5! ♗×f5 33 … ♘×f5 34.e×f5 is not better. 34.e×f5 f6 35.♗×d6 ♗×d6 36.a×b5 a×b5 37.♗e4! Another “human-like” move by Deep Blue, depriving Kasparov of the hope to push his e-pawn and bring his bishop to life. 37 … ♖×a2 38.♕×a2 Black has lost the battle over the a-file, and soon White’s heavy pieces will enter his position. 38 … ♕d7 39.♕a7 ♖c7 39 … ♕×a7+ 40.♖×a7 ♖d8 41.♖a5 ♖b8 42.♖a6 ♖d8 43.♖b6 wins a pawn. 40.♕b6 ♖b7 41.♖a8+ ♔f7 42.♕a6 ♕c7 43.♕c6 ♕b6+ 44.♔f1 ♖b8 45.♖a6? A big mistake, due to a bug in the system. Here, Kasparov resigned, not realizing that 45 … ♕e3! saves the draw: 46.♕×d6 and now the key move 46 … ♖e8! when Black’s queen, deeply entered into the enemy position, will pester the white king with endless checks. 1-0 Deep Blue-Kasparov New York (6), 1997 1.e4 c6 The last time Kasparov had played the Caro-Kann in an official tournament game was in 1982. Nevertheless, Deep Blue was fully ready for it … 2.d4 d5 3.♘c3 d×e4 4.♘×e4 ♘d7 5.♘g5 ♘gf6 6.♗d3 e6 7.♘1f3 h6? The move that made history, as it was the reason Kasparov would lose this game, and the match. He had gambled that his computer opponent wouldn’t take on e6, but it did, instantly. 8.♘×e6! A piece sacrifice with the intention to keep the enemy king in the center. 8 … ♕e7?! After this, Black is dead lost. Kasparov wants to run with his king to the queenside, but it won’t find safety there. The best continuation was 8 … f×e6 9.♗g6+ ♔e7 10.♗f4 ♘d5 11.♗g3 h5 12.0-0 ♖h6 13.♘h4 and now 13 … ♖×g6! (a return sacrifice to improve the king’s safety) 14.♘×g6+ ♔f7 15.♕×h5 ♘7f6 when Black is clearly worse, but not lost yet. 9.0-0! f×e6 10.♗g6+ ♔d8 11.♗f4 b5 12.a4! ♗b7 13.♖e1 ♘d5 14.♗g3 ♔c8 15.a×b5 c×b5 16.♕d3 ♗c6 17.♗f5 White simply picks up the e6-pawn, so Kasparov decides to give up his queen, but it’s hopeless. 17 … e×f5 18.♖×e7 ♗×e7 19.c4 Crashing through. Kasparov resigned, losing his first match ever. For Deep Blue, which got dismantled after this contest, it was the finest and final victory. 1-0 Topalov-Shirov Linares, 1998 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense. Black allows White to build a pawn center, and plans to attack it later on. 4.c×d5 ♘×d5 5.e4 ♘×c3 6.b×c3 ♗g7 7.♗b5+ c6 8.♗a4 0-0 9.♘e2 ♘d7 10.0-0 e5 Already countering in the center. 11.f3 ♕e7 12.♗e3 ♖d8 13.♕c2 ♘b6 14.♗b3 ♗e6 15.♖ad1 ♘c4 16.♗c1 b5 17.f4 e×d4 18.♘×d4 On 18.c×d4?! Shirov was no doubt planning 18 … f5! to attack the white center even more. 18 … ♗g4 19.♖de1 ♕c5 20.♔h1 a5 21.h3 ♗d7 Black misses a chance to complicate the game with 21 … a4. 22.a4! b×a4 23.♗a2! White simply wanted to remove a defender of the knight on c4. Not 23.♗×a4? ♘b6 24.♗b3 a4. 23 … ♗e8 24.e5 ♘b6 25.f5 ♘d5 26.♗d2? A blunder. Topalov could have won with 26.♕f2! ♕×c3 27.♗b2 ♕b4 28.♗a1! and White is now ready to play 29.f6 and 30.e6 next, leading to a crushing attack, but then we would never have seen Shirov’s beautiful endgame play. 26 … ♘b4! 27.♕×a4 After 27.c×b4 Topalov might’ve hoped for 27 … ♕×d4 28.f×g6 h×g6 29.e6 giving a win for White, but instead, Black counters with 27 … ♕×c2 28.♘×c2 ♖×d2 29.♗b1 a×b4 to win. 27 … ♘×a2 28.♕×a2 ♗×e5 29.f×g6 h×g6 30.♗g5 ♖d5 31.♖e3 ♕d6 32.♕e2 ♗d7 33.c4 ♗×d4 34.c×d5 ♗×e3 35.♕×e3 ♖e8 36.♕c3 ♕×d5 37.♗h6? The only move was 37.♗f6! ♖e2 38.♕g3 when White has enough play against the enemy king to hold the game to a draw. 37 … ♖e5?! Close to winning was 37 … ♕e5! 38.♕f3 ♗e6 39.♕×c6 ♗d5 40.♕a4 ♖b8. 38.♖f3 ♕c5 39.♕a1 ♗f5 40.♖e3 f6 41.♖×e5 ♕×e5 42.♕a2+? After 42.♕a3! White probably has enough counterplay for a draw. 42 … ♕d5 43.♕×d5+ c×d5 44.♗d2 a4 45.♗c3 ♔f7 46.h4 ♔e6 47.♔g1 Now comes one of the most famous moves in chess history. 47 … ♗h3!! A bolt from the blue. This bizarre-looking bishop move happens to be only way to win this position. 48.g×h3 Ignoring the bishop doesn’t help: 48.♔f2 ♔f5 49.♔e3 ♗×g2 50.♔d4 ♔g4 51.♗e1 a3 52.♔c3 f5 53.♔b3 f4 54.♔×a3 ♔f3 55.♔b2 ♔e2 56.♗c3 f3. 48 … ♔f5 49.♔f2 ♔e4 50.♗×f6 50.♔e2 f5 51.♗b2 f4 52.♔f2 d4 and Black simply has too many pawns. 50 … d4 51.♗e7 ♔d3 52.♗c5 ♔c4 53.♗e7 ♔b3 Here Topalov resigned as 54.♔e2 is met by 54 … ♔c2 and one of the pawns will queen. 0-1 l’Ami-Malakhatko Kavala, 2003 1.e4 c5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.d4 c×d4 4.♘×d4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 e5 The Sveshnikov variation of the Sicilian. 6.♘db5 d6 7.♗g5 a6 8.♘a3 b5 9.♗×f6 g×f6 After 9 … ♕×f6?! 10.♘d5 ♕d8 11.♗×b5! a×b5 12.♘×b5 White’s attack is too strong. 10.♘d5 White has a very nice square for his knight on d5, and Black has doubled pawns. Until the 1970s, this was considered to be unplayable for Black. These days the opening named after Evgeny Sveshnikov is well respected. 10 … f5 11.♗d3 ♗e6 12.0-0 ♗×d5 13.e×d5 ♘e7 14.c3 ♗g7 15.♕h5 e4 16.♗c2 ♕c8 17.♖ae1 0-0 18.f3 b4 19.c×b4 ♗×b2 20.f×e4!? L’Ami had prepared this sacrifice. 20 … ♗×a3 21.♖e3 While attacking ♗a3, the rook shifts to an attacking position. He does leave another bishop hanging, though. 21 … ♕×c2 22.♖g3+ ♘g6 23.♖h3 23 … ♖fc8?! Later, stronger engines found that after 23 … ♖fd8! 24.e×f5 ♘e5 it’s Black who is winning: 25.♕g5+ (25.♖×a3 ♕d2 26.♖g3+ ♔f8 27.f6 ♖dc8! or 25.♕×h7+ ♔f8 26.♖×a3 ♕d2 27.♕h8+ ♔e7 28.f6+ ♔d7 29.♕h3+ ♔c7) 25 … ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ ♔c8. 24.e×f5 ♘e5? Now Black loses after all. Here, it was important to return a piece with 24 … ♘f4! 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♕×f4 and then improve the bishop’s position with 26 … ♗b2! when White should take the draw with 27.♕×d6+ ♔g8 28.♕g3+ ♔f8 (not 28 … ♔h8 29.♕h4) 29.♕d6+ or continue the fight with 29.f6!? ♕e2! 30.♕g7+ ♔e8 31.♖hf3. 25.♕g5+ ♔f8 26.♖×h7 ♔e8 27.♕g8+ ♔d7 28.♖×f7+ ♘×f7 29.♕×f7+ Now we see why c8 was an unfortunate square to put the rook on. 29 … ♔d8 30.♖e1!

Perhaps Kasparov had underestimated this idea. 19 … ♗h2+ The main point is that Black cannot take: 19 … g×f6 20.♘×f6+ ♔g7 21. ♕h7+ ♔×f6 22.♕×h6+ ♔f5 23.g4#. 20.♔h1 ♘d6 21.♔×h2 ♘×e4+ 22.♗e5 ♘d6 23.♕c5 ♖d8 24.d5! A 13-year-old Carlsen is putting maximum pressure on his famous opponent and will soon win a pawn. 24 … ♕d7 25.♘d4 ♘f5 26.d×c6 b×c6 27.♘×c6 ♖e8 28.♖d1 ♕e6 29.♖fe1 Strong was 29.♗c7! after which White can safely play 30.♘×a5. 29 … ♗b7 30.♘d4 ♘×d4 31.♕×d4 ♕g6 32. ♕g4 Keeping the queens on the board with 32.f3 was slightly more promising. 32 … ♕×g4 33.h×g4 ♗c6 34.b3 f6 35.♗c3 ♖×e1 36.♖×e1 ♗d5 37.♖b1 ♔f7 38.♔g3 ♖b8 39.b4 a×b4 40.♗×b4 ♗c4 41.a5 ♗a6 42.f3 ♔g6 43.♔f4 h5 44.g×h5+ ♔×h5 45.♖h1+ ♔g6 46.♗c5 ♖b2 47.♔g3 ♖a2 48.♗b6 ♔f7 49.♖c1 g5 50.♖c7+ ♔g6 51.♖c6 ♗f1 52.♗f2 Black’s pieces are working so well that White cannot make progress despite the extra pawn. ½-½ Kramnik-Leko Brissago (8), 2004 1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 ♘c6 3.♗b5 a6 4.♗a4 ♘f6 5.0-0 ♗e7 6.♖e1 b5 7.♗b3 0-0 8.c3 d5 This move starts the Marshall Attack.

Creating a square on f2 for the queen, since Black cannot really take the rook anyway. 18 … ♘f6 18 … ♗×e4? 19.f×e4 ♘b6 20.e5 followed by 21. ♘e4 would give White a wonderful position. 19.♖e1 ♖ae8 20.♖×e8 ♖×e8 21.a4 ♕g6 22.a×b5?! Played relatively quickly by Kramnik, who would later state that he gambled a bit here, also because Leko was already getting low on time. Better was 22.♘e4 ♘×e4 23.f×e4 ♗×e4 24.♗×g5 ♗f5 when Black has enough compensation for the pawn, but not more. 22 … ♗d3! 23.♕f2? Kramnik had too much faith in his team’s computer preparation and overestimated his position here. He should have played 23.♕d1 instead and accept a draw by repetition: 23 … ♗e2 24.♕e1 ♗d3 25.♕d1. 23 … ♖e2 24.♕×e2 After 24.b×a6 ♖×f2 25.♔×f2 ♕h5 26.♔g1 White’s a-pawn will become a queen, but too late: 26 … ♗×g3! 27.h×g3 ♕h3 28.a7 ♕×g3+ 29.♔h1 g4! 30.a8♕+ ♔g7 31.♕b7 ♕e1+ 32.♔g2 g×f3+ 33.♘×f3 ♕f1+ 34.♔g3 ♘h5+ 35.♔h4 ♕h1+ 36.♔g4 ♕g2+ 37.♔×h5 ♕h3+ 38.♘h4 ♗e2+ 39.♔g5 ♕g4#. 24 … ♗×e2 25.b×a6 Also here White is not in time.

Two question marks are not enough for what is possibly the biggest blunder in history committed by a (former) world champion. The game should have ended with the following repetition: 34 … ♔g8 35.♘g6 ♗×b2 36.♕d5+ ♔h7 37.♘f8+ ♔h8 38.♘g6+. 35.♕h7# 1-0 Topalov-Anand Sofia (1), 2010 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6 3.♘c3 d5 The Grünfeld Defense, like in Topalov-Shirov. 4.c×d5 ♘×d5 5.e4 ♘×c3 6.b×c3 ♗g7 7.♗c4 c5 8.♘e2 ♘c6 With the knight on e2 instead of f3, 8 … ♗g4 can be answered by 9.f3. 9.♗e3 0-0 10.0-0 ♘a5 11.♗d3 b6 12.♕d2 e5 13.♗h6 c×d4 14.♗×g7 ♔×g7 15.c×d4 e×d4 16.♖ac1 ♕d6 17.f4 f6 18.f5 ♕e5 19.♘f4 g5 20.♘h5+ ♔g8 Against 20 … ♔h8 the Topalov team had prepared the same move as he would play next: 21.h4! ♖g8 and now it’s possible to play 22.♘×f6!? ♕×f6 23.e5 ♕×e5 24.f6 and the f-pawn is quite dangerous.

Anand remembered that this move had to be played, but not in which position. Correct was 23 … ♗d7! 24.♖g3 and only now 24 … ♔f7 25.♗c4+ ♘×c4 26.♖×c4 ♖h8 27.♖×d4 ♗e8 28.♖d7+ ♔f8! (28 … ♗×d7?? 29.♕×d7+ ♕e7 30.♕d5+ loses the rook on a8.) 29.♘×f6 ♕a1+ 30.♔f2 ♕×f6 and White’s attack is only good for a draw: 31.♕b4+ ♔g8 32.♕b3+ ♔f8. 24.♘×f6! A sacrifice that Topalov and his team had prepared with the computer, while Anand’s team was also aware of it. But you can’t remember everything … 24 … ♔×f6 24 … ♕×f6 25.♖h3! ♗d7 26.♖h7+ ♔e8 27.e5! with a winning attack. 25.♖h3! ♖g8 25 … ♕f4 26.e5+! ♔×e5 27.♕e2+ ♔d5 28.♖f1 ♕e5 29.♕f3+ winning ♖a8. 26.♖h6+ ♔f7 27.♖h7+ ♔e8 28.♖cc7 ♔d8 29.♗b5! ♕×e4 29 … ♕×b5 30.♕×d4+ ♔e8 31.♖he7+ ♔f8 32.♕f6#. 30.♖×c8+ Anand resigned because of 30 … ♔×c8 31.♕c1+ ♘c6 32.♗×c6 ♕e3+ 33.♕×e3 d×e3 34.♗×a8. 1-0 Carlsen-Nakamura Stavanger, 2017 1.e4 c5 2.♘f3 d6 3.d4 c×d4 4.♘×d4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 a6 The Najdorf variation of the Sicilian, named after the Polish-Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf. 6.h3 This little pawn move was also played by a young Bobby Fischer. 6 … g6 7.g3 ♘c6 8.♗e3 ♗g7 9.♗g2 0-0 10.0-0 ♘d7 11.b3 ♘×d4 12.♗×d4 ♗×d4 13.♕×d4 b6 14.♘d5 ♗b7 15.c4 e5 Fixing White’s e-pawn on a light square, so that it will keep blocking the bishop on g2.

Kasparov chooses a move that James Mason and Paul Keres have tried in the past. 3 … ♕h4+ 4.♔e2 A remarkable situation: after four moves the white king cannot castle anymore and is blocking his bishop and queen. In return, he hopes to build up a strong pawn center. 4 … ♕d8?! Not the best move, but not terrible either. Karjakin argues his queen soon needed to leave h4 anyway. 5.d4 ♘f6 6.♗×f4 ♗b4 7.♗g5 Better was 7.♘d5! ♘×d5 8.e×d5 0-0 9.♘f3 ♖e8+ 10.♔f2 with a slight edge for White. 7 … ♗×c3 8.b×c3 d6 9.♘f3 0-0 10.♗×f6 Kasparov first takes the knight as the immediate 10.♔f2?? fails to ♘×e4+. 10 … ♕×f6 11.♔f2 c5 12.h3 ♖e8 13.♕d3 b6 14.♖e1 ♗b7 15.g3 ♘c6 16.♗g2 ♖ac8 17.a3 Anticipating Black’s idea of 17 … c×d4 18.c×d4 ♘b4. 17 … ♘b8 18.♖e3 ♘d7 19.♖f1 ♕e7 20.♔g1??
