      "content": "The First Challenge Have you read the book? Question #1 What college did Peter Thiel attend? Harvard University Oxford University Stanford University Yale UniversityANSWER c Stanford University Peter Thiel attended Stanford University shortly after completing his high school diploma. While at Stanford, he focused his studies on Philosophy in the Twentieth Century. He graduated from Stanford with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy in the year 1989.

Thiel continued to work with the purpose of simply improving himself rather than competing against others. Question #2 What does the title \"Zero to One\" mean? Technology and Vertical progress First Step to Success Neither A or B He never stated what it meantANSWER a Technology and Vertical Progress When Peter Thiel was asked this question in an interview with NPR, he talked about the growing technology of our world's culture. During the interview, he used the example of the Apple iPhone and the invention of the first airplane. He talked about how, before their inventions, there was nothing of that kind in existence. It was this fact that he was hoping to showcase in the title of his book and talk about the changing technology where it all goes from having none of it to simply having one. Question #3 Aside from his skills in school, what is one thing at which Peter Thiel excels? Astronomy Checkers Chess Retro Video GamesANSWER c Chess Growing up, Peter Thiel had a keen interest in playing chess and was highly skilled at a young age. This skill and interest led him to compete in tournaments against other highly skilled players. It wasn't long until Peter claimed the title of Chess Master for himself in the United States. To this day, Thiel is one of the highest ranking Chess Masters to achieve the title under the age of 21. He often integrates what he learned from chess into his teachings about business. Question #4 Which of the following is a tip Thiel gives to creating a business on the Zero to One concept? Divide and Conquer Build and Maintain One Step at a Time Just Do ItANSWER b Build and Maintain Regarding creating a business and making sure it's highly successful, one tip Peter Thiel gives in his book about the \"zero to one\" concept is to build a monopoly and maintain it. After talking about this tip, Peter went on to talk about the importance of monopolies. He also explained how any business or person can create a company that can gain some use from the \"zero to one\" concept. Question #5 Where was Peter Thiel born? Frankfurt Am Main, Germany Foster City, California New York City Toronto, CanadaANSWER a Frankfurt Am Main, Germany Peter Thiel was born in Frankfurt Am Main, Germany in October of 1967 to a Klaus Thiel and Susanne Thiel. At the time, his father worked as a chemical engineer. His family immigrated to the United States when Peter was just one year old. From there, he was raised in Forst City, California. It was in Foster City that he settled and decided to raise his children. Peter also has a brother named Patrick. Question #6 What does Peter believe about business, according to an NPR interview? It's possible to turn any business into a monopoly No Pain, No Gain Getting rid of the competition is the most important move in business Every moment in the history of business only happens onceANSWER d Every moment in the history of business only happens once It was during an NPR interview with Wade Goodwyn that Peter Thiel expressed the belief that there will only ever be one Bill Gates who runs a company that makes operating systems. In this aspect, every person must follow their own path and become successful in their own right. He believes this so deeply that he wants to spread the belief to as many people as he can. It was this philosophy and path of belief that impelled Thiel to write Zero to One.Question #7 Which of the following was founded by Thiel in his college years? Harvard Chess Club College Talk Radio The Sanford Review Reader's DigestANSWER c The Stanford Review The Stanford Review was established on the campus of Stanford University in 1987 with the help of Peter Thiel and The Norman Book. In no time at all, The Stanford Review became known for challenging the social norms at Stanford University as well as around the United States. One prime example of this was the laws against hate speech and political correctness. Today, The Stanford Review is the main source for conservatives and libertarians at Stanford. Question #8 Which of the following did Thiel predict about the US Dollar? Its value would increase It would weaken It would be changed None of the AboveANSWER b It would weaken Peter Thiel made a prediction that the United States dollar would weaken and lose its value over time. He was proven correct in 2003 when the US dollar started to lose its value and dipped below the value of the European Euro. Thiel was also correct in that the US dollar's value would increase again and energy would improve in 2005. However, this increase was not enough to help out Thiel’s company, as Clarium Capital suffered a significant loss. Question #9 What is Clarium Capital? A Software Company An Online Bank A Social Media Website A Marco Hedge FundANSWER d A Macro Hedge Fund Peter Thiel started up Clarium Capital in 2002 in San Francisco, California. It was founded to be an investment company and built to peruse a global macro strategy. Since its founding, it grew to $8 billion in 2008 but then declined to $300-400 million as of 2011. This is partially due to the weakening of the US Dollar in 2003, an event from which Clarium Capital was never able to recover. They eventually moved to New York to be closer to Wall Street.Question #10 What is one of the first statements made in Zero to One? Capitalism and competition are opposites Being innovated is the way to succeed Not all business are created equal Capitalism and competition are one in the sameANSWER a Capitalism and Competition are opposites Capitalism and competition are opposites is one of the first lines in Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One. To many people, this statement is quite controversial. Thiel goes on to explain that the aim of capitalism is to make a profit while the aim of competition is to eliminate profits. He then goes on to state that monopolies are successful only because of their high profits, which allows them to make investments in the future.",

Question #1 Where has Zero to One appeared in the top ten books? Barnes & Noble Amazon New York Times None of the aboveANSWER b Amazon Since its debut release in September of 2014, Zero to One has appeared in the top ten books in three separate categories on Amazon’s website. These categories include Entrepreneurship, Economic Policy, and Economic policy and development. Zero to One has also received a rating of four and a half stars from Amazon users who have read the book. Many of the readers find Zero to One to be very engaging, deeply intellectual, and practical.Question #2 Which of the following is a business co-founded by Peter Thiel? Facebook Amazon PayPal YelpANSWER c PayPal Peter Thiel is a member of a group dubbed the \"PayPal Mafia,\" which is a group of people who worked on the team that established the online bank PayPal.

Many consider Peter Thiel to be \"The Don\" of PayPal.The PayPal Mafia has founded and invested in many other companies, ending with a value of $30 billion. Question #3 What is Peter Thiel's connection to Facebook? Founder User Administrator InvestorANSWER d Investor Back before Facebook was as much of a success as it is today, Peter Thiel showed an interest and invested in the social media platform. He did this by way of convertible note, which would have been converted into equity if Facebook had managed to reach a certain number of users by the year 2004. Unfortunately, the company fell short by a small margin of users by the time 2004 came around. However, Thiel allowed the convertible note to be converted despite the founders not reaching their target number.Question #4 What brought Facebook to Thiel's attention? Reid Hoffman Active Search from Thiel A Conference Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerburg knew each other.ANSWER a Reid Hoffman While Facebook was little more than a small start-up company, the President, Sean Parker, initially went to Reid Hoffman in an attempt to gain a financial investment. Hoffman declined to give Parker the investment needed and told Parker to ask Peter Thiel instead. Thiel met with Mark Zuckerburg shortly after and exchanged his investment for partial ownership of Facebook. From there, Peter Thiel became an investor in the company.

In an interview with Cowen, Thiel stated that people have control of their future, and this is what he hopes to show in Zero to One.Question #6 What is a reason Peter Thiel gives for technology slowing down? Trying a different path Stricter guidelines Failure It hasn't slowed down at allANSWER c Failure One of the main reasons Peter Thiel gives for the slowing down of technology in certain areas is failure, which is often the case of simple human conditioning. When someone fails to get the needed result the first time, it's highly unlikely that they will try again. This is why many people are often deterred from studying nuclear engineering while others continue to show interest in software development. As a result, software has become incredibly successful. Question #7 What did Kirkus Reviews call Zero to One? A brilliant work Innovated and Practical Self-indulgent Forceful and PungentANSWER d Forceful and Pungent The Kirkus Reviews is a book reviewer magazine first published in New York City in 1933.

Neal Stephenson Mark Zuckerburg Tyler Cowen Neil HoffmanAnswer a Neal Stephenson Neal Stephenson is the author of The Baroque Cycle and Snow Crash. He is known best for his works in the science fiction genre and has a four-star review on a majority of his work posted on Amazon.

He also stated that Peter Thiel was a \"one\" in a world that is full of \"zeros.\" Question #9 Which of the following is another company created by Peter Thiel in San Francisco? PayPal Yelp Founders Fund Facebook ANSWER c Founders Fund Peter Thiel created Founders Fund in 2005 along with Ken Howery, Luke Nosek, and Sean Parker. Founders Fund is a venture capital fund based in California with a main focus on companies building revolutionary technologies. It was through this fund that Thiel was able to make investments with companies like Facebook, Yelp, LinkedIn, Yammer, Geni.com, Booktrack, Transfer Wise, and many others. PayPal itself was already established years before in 1998 in San Jose, California.Question #10 In whose interview did Peter Thiel talk about the slowing down of technology? Steve Drobny Kirkus Reviews Neil Hoffman Tyler CowenANSWER d Tyler Cowen In an interview with Tyler Cowen, Peter Thiel expanded on his idea that people have control of their future, and he does not believe that technology stagnation will suddenly come to an end unless people find a way to stop it.

Question #1 What religion was Peter Thiel while growing up? Jewish Evangelical Christian Roman Catholic MuslimANSWER b Evangelical Christian Peter Thiel grew up in an Evangelical Christian household when he was a child. Today, his views on religion do not follow the same path and he considers himself to be a bit of a nonconformist. He believes that Christianity is true but does not feel it is his place to convince others of the same thing. He was greatly influenced by Rene Girard's mimetic desire theory and teachings on scapegoating and sacrificing to solve conflicts. Question #2 What were Peter Thiel's views on PayPal? Just another way to make money It would change the world It would open the door for other banks of its type He had no involvement with PayPalANSWER b It would change the world Peter Thiel mentioned in a 1999 speech that he believed PayPal would change the world as we know it. He stated that, as soon as he and Levchin were able to make PayPal a reality and available to companies outside the United States, people would be able to have more control over their finances than they did before the invention of PayPal. He believed PayPal would stop the government from stealing from their citizens because people could easily switch to a currency more secure than their local one.Question #3 What did Peter Thiel say to American Express? The company would eventually collapse To create a better, more stable, financial structure People should not spend their time in competition with others All of the aboveANSWER c People should not spend their time in competition with others Peter Thiel once told American Express that one of the things he wanted his readers to get from Zero to One was that they should not spend their time in competition with one another.

Thiel also warns against anyone becoming too optimistic and too pessimistic as these could also throw off the success.Question #4 What concept is explained in the interview with American Express? \"Zero to One\" \"Competition vs. Capitalism\" \"Global Domination\" \"Power Law\"ANSWER d \"Power Law\" In his interview with American Express, Peter Thiel explains the dynamic behind the \"power law\" concept from his book, Zero to One. He said that the power law means that things that are very different from each other will often seem perfectly equal at first. He said this because humans have a high tendency to believe that moments seem similar to the other moments that come right before and right after when this isn't usually the case.Question #5 Which of the following did Peter Thiel do before writing his book, Zero to One? Worked at a Taco Bell Worked as a teller at Bank of America Worked as a law clerk for J.L. Edmondson Was unemployedAnswer c Worked as a law clerk for J.L. Edmondson After Graduating from Stanford University and a few years passed, Peter Thiel eventually became a law clerk for J.L. Edmondson.

It was between the years of 1993 until 1996; Thiel was doing work-trading derivatives for the Credit Suisse Group. This is how Edmondson eventually founded Thiel as Capital Management in 1996.Question #6 What trend does Peter Thiel take an issue with? \"Lean Startup\" Bootlegging companies Religion None of The Above ANSWER a \"Lean Startup\" Peter Thiel mentioned in his interview with American Express that he has an issue with the trending concept of \"lean startup.\" Thiel firmly believes that having a bad plan is better than having no plan at all. This is because at least a bad plan can eventually lead to a goal. He goes on to add that companies that do great things have a clear plan rather than randomly choosing their business models. Question #7 Which of the following is NOT a friend Peter met in Stanford? Reid Hoffman David O. Sacks Keith Rabois Mark ZuckerburgANSWER d Mark Zuckerburg Mark Zuckerburg, the founder of Facebook, was one of the people Peter Thiel met when he began investing in companies. Reid Hoffman, David O. Sacks, and Keith Rabois are all friends Thiel met while he was attending college at Stanford University. It was with these people that Thiel was able to create and collaborate with other companies. Rabois, for example, became an executive at LinkedIn, PayPal, Slide, and Square. He also was an investor for Xoom and Yelp.Question #8 What inspired Peter Thiel? Stanford Creating PayPal Watching other companies grow Working at J.L EdmondsonANSWER a Stanford Peter Thiel owes a lot of his inspiration to the time he spent at Stanford University. It was there that he came up with the idea that competition is not actually a good thing. At one point in his college career, he trained to try out for Stanford's basketball team and didn't make the team. He stated that the problem was that he was unknowingly competing against the other team members when he should have been focusing on improving himself first and foremost. Question #9 What does Peter Thiel advise against when developing a product? Finding inspiration from already released products Improving on one's own before competing is against others Understanding the differences between your product and other's None of the aboveANSWER d None of the Above None of the above statements was Peter Thiel's advice against developing a product. What Thiel did advise against was the large thinking at the beginning development of the product at hand. People should avoid the \"world domination\" means of thinking while in early development of their product. The markets that are in the billions should be avoided because they have a large amount of competition but no clear starting point.Question #10 What is one way Peter Thiel uses to encourage people? Focus on yourself Don't be afraid of failure Work for a specific market All of the AboveANSWER c Work for a specific market This is the first step that Peter Thiel encourages people to take when coming up with a \"zero to one\" product or idea. After finding a good idea, it's important for the next step to be \"scaling up.\" Scaling up means to come up with a way that a product can be improved by either performance or convenience. Focus on improving your product by ten times more than the original and existing product. This will help make your product a success.",
