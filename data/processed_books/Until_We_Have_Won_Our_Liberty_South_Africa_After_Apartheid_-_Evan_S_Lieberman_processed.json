      "content": "PREFACE DURING THE LAST WEEK OF April 1994, in villages and cities across South Africa, adults of all ages and colors joined long, snaking lines to cast their votes in an election that was broadcast to observers around the globe. Their participation marked the launch of a highly improbable political experiment. After centuries of White rule, including over forty years under an Apartheid system that separated people according to racial classification, the political landscape was transformed. The electorate, finally incorporating the Black majority, was now eight times larger than it had been during the last all-White election. The voters would choose a previously banned political organization, the African National Congress, headed by a former political prisoner, Nelson Mandela, to lead them. The new government would integrate people, local economies, and political authorities under a single system of law and governance. And they would attempt to do this while adhering to democratic principles with a commitment to the rights of all people. I was just twenty-three at the time of this amazing political transition, and I had already been thinking about and studying South Africa for several years. For me, as an American high school student in the 1980s, Apartheid government presented a rare instance of moral clarity. There was no ambiguity about the fact that this explicitly racist system needed to be abolished, and college students, ordinary citizens, and heads of state the world over supported the cause of regime change. Before I could vote in my own country, the one political position I was certain of was my opposition to Apartheid. Since then, I’ve spent my entire adult life watching and cheering for this country on the other corner of the planet, to see whether it would make good on the anti-Apartheid dreams of a truly democratic and more prosperous future. Looking back now, there is one critical question to ask: Did it work? In this book, I reflect on South Africa’s record with multiracial, democratic government. Can we say it was a success? Or did the quest for democratic integration in this divided society turn into fool’s gold? In the pages that follow, I document what I have learned in my attempts to understand what came before and what came after the transition away from Apartheid. For Americans and for others who confront legacies of institutionalized racism in their own societies, South Africa offers a useful point of reference. Reflecting on its history raises important questions about social justice here and in countries around the world that are grappling with the twin scourges of inequality and intolerance. South Africans themselves vary widely in terms of how they rate their democracy. Frustration is palpable; and commentators’ assessments are often dismal. Is South Africa simply going the way of past failed attempts at democratic development on the African continent? Several facts could be marshalled to support that conclusion: the country suffers from massive unemployment, poor health, poor education, and widespread corruption. By listing the set of social ills South Africans continue to face, one could quickly dismiss this democratic experiment as an unmitigated disaster. In this book, I recognize these serious concerns, but I also try to shed light on relevant outcomes in historical and comparative perspective. In turn, my conclusions are far more favorable than local and national interlocutors have generally shared. In a mere twenty-five years, under elected Black-led governments, South Africans made remarkable gains toward achieving a more just society, with greater respect for the dignity of all people—what I call dignified development. Many problems remain and citizens are understandably frustrated that more has not been accomplished. And yet, we cannot lose sight of the fact that democratic practice has moderated the tensions inherent in governing South Africa’s diverse society. Successive democratic administrations have helped to improve the lives of millions across the country, with housing, basic services, social security, access to education, and more, and they have done so without resorting to political extremism or the complete exclusion of any minority group—a fear that many expressed at the dawn of the democratic era. This book is based on observations from decades of field research in South Africa and a great deal of teaching, research, and analysis along the way. During the months before and after the 2019 election, I made repeated visits to Mogale City, a municipality that serves as something of a microcosm and a key focus of the book. I conducted several dozen interviews there and engaged in various types of participant observation, including attending rallies and council meetings, hanging out around polling stations, and occasionally jumping in a pickup truck to watch a politician engage in constituent service. I followed up on leads and referrals, and tried to use my instincts and knowledge of the context to adjudicate between fact and fiction. A wide range of voices, including those of current and former mayors, local councillors, reporters, clergy, business operators, NGO leaders, and others I met around the municipality, can be heard in the pages and analyses that follow. Throughout the book, I have used the actual names of public figures (politicians, bureaucrats, and NGO leaders) I interviewed but either disguise identities or report no names for all other people interviewed in order to protect their privacy. I also drew on a wide range of primary and secondary sources, including existing high-quality representative surveys, as well as surveys I conducted myself, and a great deal of administrative data. (See “Author’s Note” for additional details on such data, including the acronyms used to identify various surveys and data sets.) My own identity—what some refer to as positionality—has shaped the questions I asked and my access to certain sources of information and data; it has also influenced the conclusions I derived from my analyses. This book is not a memoir by any means, but in some parts I explicitly reflect on my own journey through this country over time. I do this in part because the fact that I saw and heard certain things myself ought to enhance the credibility of those descriptions. To be transparent, it is also important to recognize that it was all filtered through me as a person, and were I not a White American man and an academic with the resources to travel the country comfortably and in relative security, I might have encountered different people and different places, heard different facts and stories, and arrived at different conclusions. Despite more than three decades of engagement, I concede many blind spots remain. South Africa has eleven official languages, and I speak only one of them fluently—English—though I did learn enough Xhosa and a few phrases in Afrikaans to be able to express at least my desire to be empathic toward others’ views and to elicit smiles from my mispronunciations. Like so many others, I was initially drawn to study South Africa because the clear and sustained injustices of the Apartheid system were impossible to ignore. Today, after Apartheid, the politics of the country remain at least as compelling. Still burdened by the legacies of the past, political leaders face the challenge of building a shared future based on an entirely different set of principles, which themselves are still being worked out. Their efforts, successes, and failures offer the rest of us much food for thought about the possibilities for building more just societies around the world.",

      "title": "ON SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL CATEGORIES",
      "content": "ON SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL CATEGORIES WHILE SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL categories bear some similarities to those used in the contemporary United States and other multiracial societies, there are also key differences. As a starting point, most recent official (government) South African documents use the term population group rather than race and do not provide the option for individuals to select multiple categories. In South Africa, four main categories inherited from the Apartheid era continue to be widely used—Black or Black African; White; Indian or Asian; and Coloured—and largely distinguish people based on physical characteristics and continental ancestry. The awkwardness in describing these categories reflects the reality that they are arbitrary social constructions. What made Apartheid South Africa unique was its insistence on rigid classification and legislation—attempting to give scientific foundations to categories that are themselves not scientifically distinguishable. For example, the 1950 Population Registration Act can be quoted verbatim to remind us that these categories are merely conventions: “A White person is one who is in appearance obviously white—and not generally accepted as Coloured—or who is generally accepted as White—and is not obviously Non-White, provided that a person shall not be classified as a White person if one of his natural parents has been classified as a Coloured person or a Bantu.” The term “Coloured” may be particularly jarring to American readers, as it appears both antiquated and offensive given its connection to racial segregation in the United States, but it is important to highlight that the connotation is quite distinct in the South African context. In fact, the term was decried in South Africa as being offensive for some time, but that is largely not the case today, and it is commonly used, including as a proud source of self-identification. Specifically, Coloureds are the descendants of mixed-race parentage; in some cases, like for the South African comedian Trevor Noah, this implies parents of different races, one Black, one White. However, most people who identify as Coloured are the product of many generations of two Coloured parents, each of whose ancestors had much earlier (perhaps going back centuries) engaged in racial “mixing,” frequently in the form of White men and Black African women—typically enslaved or in otherwise subordinate social positions. Thus, the term “Coloured” refers to a specific subset of the population and not to all people “of color.” Most Coloureds largely speak either English or Afrikaans and are predominantly located in the western part of the country. More recently, many who might have been classified as Coloured under Apartheid but trace their ancestry to a distinct group of indigenous people have demanded recognition as Khoisan. In the Apartheid hierarchy, Whites were at the top, Coloureds and Indians next, and Black Africans at the bottom with respect to rights, income, living conditions, and just about every way in which a person could be treated. In turn, references to Blacks sometimes imply a combination of these groups and other times simply to Black Africans. I believe that my use of racial categories in the pages of this book accords well with conventional practice in South Africa today. However, some understandably reject such labels and charge those, including journalists and academics who continue to use them, with perpetuating the very hierarchies that South Africa’s Apartheid system sought to create. Still others prefer the use of alternative categories. My use of these terms is not meant to cast judgment on their inherent legitimacy over other types of social categories but simply to convey my recognition of their salience in politics and society.",

      "content": "1 The Campaign COMMUNICATING FRUSTRATION I HAD JUST SAT down and taken out my notebook when I heard a loud thud. It was a few minutes after 9 a.m. on the last Friday of January 2019. I had come to meet a prospective research assistant at the Chicken Licken in downtown Krugersdorp, about an hour’s drive from Johannesburg. A modest-but-modern fast food restaurant, clean and sparsely furnished, it was one of the most popular spots in a neighborhood that was otherwise filled with unremarkable storefronts, including several tire stores, low-price clothing boutiques, and pawn shops. Signs for quick and easy abortions adorned many of the adjacent buildings. I noticed that the restaurant manager was hurrying around the exterior of the building, slamming shut each of the heavy exterior gates used for security after-hours. The pair of police officers who had been sitting and chatting at the table next to me had disappeared. Most of the other customers eating and drinking there that morning had also left their tables in order to gather close to the exit, huddling under the threshold as they looked out cautiously onto the street. I stood up and joined the small crowd. We all peered out toward the action to our left and could see a loud throng of people toyi-toying. The toyi-toyi is a protest march that became popular in Black townships beginning in the late 1970s in the wake of the growing campaign against White rule in South Africa.1 On that day in January, thousands of people were hopping, dancing, singing, and yelling all along the multiple lanes of Commissioner Street. They held hand-printed placards in their hands proclaiming, “No service, no vote” and “2019 no vote.” It was still morning, but it was already getting hot in the summer sun. Sweat streamed down the protesters’ faces. The manager was closing the metal gates because the previous week, a different protest had turned violent and rubber bullets had broken windows. She wanted to protect the new windows, the restaurant, and, presumably, any customers who remained. Krugersdorp has long been a site of confrontation and conflict. Within a few years of its founding in 1887, it developed rapidly into a hard-drinking, hard-gambling, transient mining town and was frequently likened to the American “Wild West.”2 It was established to serve the booming gold mining industry a year after rich deposits were found in nearby Johannesburg. The allure of quick profits attracted thousands of foreigners, mostly from Britain but also from Australia, Ireland, and America, other parts of Africa, and other corners of the world. Over many generations individual explorers, groups, and sometimes even warring parties came through this town to try to carve out a better life. For most of its history and up until the 1990s, Krugersdorp was designated for Whites only. Black people were permitted to work here only if they carried a special permit, and mostly they were relegated to the neighboring Black townships of Munsieville and Kagiso (pronounced Kah-hee-so). As early as the first few years of the twentieth century, the Krugersdorp Town Council deliberately regulated the movement of Black Africans into and out of well-demarcated areas on the outskirts of town.3 Indeed this distinction between “towns” and “townships” was fundamental to the racial ordering built up throughout South Africa during most of the twentieth century. Today, downtown Krugersdorp is filled with people from all race groups and a wide range of nationalities. By contrast, Kagiso (about seven miles south) and Munsieville (less than four miles north) remain almost all Black, though the latter also hosts Pango Camp, a small informal settlement of poor Whites. On this day in 2019, the approximately two thousand Munsieville residents were marching to see Patrick Lipudi, mayor of Mogale City Local Municipality, which now incorporates all of these areas under a single local government. Lipudi is himself Black. In the 1970s and 1980s, he had served as a union leader, political activist, and protester; and he danced the toyi-toyi during the struggle for Black liberation. Like so many others who once led protest movements and were now serving as government officials, he had become the target of anger and frustration. The protesters were making demands for better water and electricity. It was the last weekend of voter registration for the upcoming national elections, and when interviewed later that day, the protest’s organizer said the people of Munsieville were prepared to boycott further registrations.4 For Lipudi and other government leaders, such boycotts could cost the ruling party precious votes in a close election, and they would be forced to negotiate. FIGURE 1.1. Site of protest outside Chicken Licken, Krugersdorp. Democracy Up Close I had traveled to Krugersdorp, the seat of Mogale City government, to observe the campaign for this national election. I wanted to learn more about how multiracial democracy was faring after twenty-five years. The country’s first multiracial election, in 1994, had marked an important milestone in a highly improbable political transformation. It produced a shift in power away from an economically dominant White minority in favor of universal adult suffrage, resulting in a Black-led government. In terms of population and economic development, ending Apartheid and creating an integrated South Africa was like fusing together the relatively poor African country of Kenya and the much smaller and wealthier European country of Denmark into a single polity in just a few years’ time. Between 1989 and 1994, the size of the electorate increased by a factor of eight, from over 2.5 million to close to 20 million voters.5 During that period, the country transitioned away from civil war—a fact which itself did not bode well for democratic development if one considered the trajectories of other postconflict countries.6 And now it was time to ask: What can students of democracy and social justice the world over learn from this ambitious political endeavor? That a large protest swept right in front of me on my first day—in fact, in the first fifteen minutes of my time in Krugersdorp—was an important reminder of the mood of many of the country’s citizens: they were frustrated, angry, and losing patience. In this chapter and in the next, I share what I observed about contemporary South African politics from the perspective of the 2019 national election as it played out in Mogale City—first the campaign, and then election day itself. This will provide an introduction to the diverse actors and concerns driving the heated political competition in the country. I set my gaze on the midsized South African municipality of Mogale City because, at least from afar, it appeared to be a place that could serve as something of a microcosm for learning more about South Africa. It is racially diverse, prior elections tracked national trends toward greater competitiveness, and it straddles the country’s very different urban and rural areas. On the one hand, the municipality abuts South Africa’s megalopolis—the corridor between “Joburg” and Pretoria, home to over 8 million residents. Yet, even the most urbanized section of Mogale—Krugersdorp, with a population of about 140,000—is still just a town. Streets can get busy during trading hours, but there are no high-rise buildings. Just a few miles away, still very much within Mogale’s borders, lie thousands of acres of farmland. Black and White, rich and poor, urban and rural, and support for different political parties represent the most important sources of diversity in South Africa; and all are contained within Mogale. The municipality is located in Gauteng Province, specifically in an area known as the West Rand—a reference to the Witwatersrand, an approximately thirty-five-mile rock escarpment that elevates its residents over a mile above sea level. The Rand is also quite literally the source of continental divide, as runoff from the plateau feeds the Crocodile, Limpopo, Vaal, and Orange rivers, which in turn drain into the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Wanderers and explorers came here even before the transformative discovery of great mineral wealth in the ground below. No part of Southern Africa has drawn more people into such a concentrated area. And on my drive in from Johannesburg that January day in 2019, I noticed the immodest welcome sign, “Mogale City: Cradle of Humankind,” a reference to rich archaeological discoveries within the municipal boundaries. Mogale’s northern border is drawn by the Magaliesberg mountains, the site of millions of years of human occupation, and at least hundreds of years of known trading and conflict between groups of people moving into and out of the area. Although I never spent any significant amount of time in Krugersdorp or Mogale prior to 2019, I have been studying South African politics for my entire career and adult life. And I wanted to take stock of what had and had not been accomplished since the time of the democratic transition, especially as democracy seemed to be in peril around the world, including in my own country, the United States. Populist leaders and parties have been on the rise around the globe—in Hungary, the United States, Brazil, the Philippines, India, and elsewhere—and they have been characterized by increasingly authoritarian tendencies. South Africa was plausibly fertile ground for such appeals. Anti-immigrant and anti-elite sentiment was already strong in many pockets—and very strong in Mogale City. It would not take much imagination to organize highly racist campaigns; and any of a number of well-worn strategies to identify a culpable elite and/or additional scapegoats had the potential to win votes. FIGURE 1.2. Map of Mogale City Local Municipality in South Africa. Even beyond the seemingly fragile nature of liberal democracy around the globe, South Africa’s 2019 contest appeared pivotal in so many ways: the electoral choices were stark, as the competing parties offered very different candidates and visions; and more than any national election since 1994, this one appeared to be quite competitive. Democracy is about a lot more than just elections, but elections are both necessary and crucial, and I wanted to watch this one up close. I would start by simply observing the process, particularly as it unfolded in this one municipality, asking: What were the leading political parties offering as interpretations of the past and proposals for the future? How were citizens responding to those campaigns? And then I would consider the historical record, look comparatively at other countries, and try to make sense of what I observed with respect to the efforts to forge a new government and to deliver. Ultimately, my goal was to assess the strength and value of South Africa’s still young democracy. When I arrived in Mogale City, the municipality and the nation were just three months from marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s historic electoral victory in the first-ever truly multiracial election, one that was celebrated as a credible promise to redress the types of indignities that befell Black township dwellers like the people of Munsieville. It was also a quarter century, more or less, since the end of Apartheid—literally translated as apartness—a style of government launched in 1948 with the express goal of keeping people from different race groups apart from one another. Institutionalized White supremacy, including in the form of slavery, had been practiced to varying degrees throughout southern Africa almost immediately after the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652. When Krugersdorp was formed, it was contained within the South African Republic, a landmass representing approximately one-quarter of modern South Africa. Many of that government’s harsh rules and practices, including issuing passes to control the movement of Black people, would become the foundation for sustained racial oppression. Of course, southern Africa was not alone in its institutionalization of racial hierarchies. Most of the African continent was at some point colonized by White Europeans; and the African slave trade was built on ideas of racial supremacy. The United States and Brazil both imported massive numbers of slaves, and the lasting results of race-based inequalities are starkly evident in these countries even today. What made South Africa both truly unique and infamous was the degree to which its White government doubled down on segregation and a panoply of racially exclusionary policies during the second half of the twentieth century. When the National Party gained power in a surprising electoral victory just three years after the end of World War II, Apartheid-style government came to define South Africa as a White minority persisted in developing a vision of government and citizenship for Whites only. Apartheid planners tried to market their project to the world as one promoting national self-determination, a language that was more acceptable to postwar sensibilities as the age of empire had come to an end. And yet, there was no mistaking the fact that the Apartheid project sought to forcibly segregate and separate people of color into the least desirable territories in the region and to control them as sources of cheap labor. All of the Apartheid laws and practices were felled in the early 1990s. And yet, the end of Apartheid was not the end of South Africa’s difficult history. Deep Apartheid and pre-Apartheid legacies remained, and while various negotiating parties agreed to adopt a multiracial democracy, its success was hardly preordained. Moreover, a quarter of a century is clearly not sufficient to redress three and a half centuries of racial hierarchy. Nonetheless, the silver anniversary of the first multiracial election presented a fitting opportunity to take stock of what had been accomplished relative to expectations, to the past, and to other countries. In the pages that follow, I show that South Africa’s first twenty-five years of democratic government were extremely successful. Many problems remain and citizens are understandably frustrated that more was not accomplished during this period. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that democratic practice has moderated the tensions inherent in governing South Africa’s diverse society. Successive democratic administrations have helped to improve the lives of millions across the country, in terms of housing, basic services, social security, access to education, and more, and they have done so without resorting to political extremism. Notwithstanding these accomplishments, South Africa’s democracy remains fragile. Democracy itself is an imperfect form of government even under the best of circumstances. Hopes and expectations can quickly outpace concrete change. The machinations of democratic politics are inherently self-critical, and progress is routinely made through shining a bright light on problems, which itself feeds a sense of frustration. While often effective, these processes can contribute to an underappreciation of the enterprise. The Issues and the Parties The very proposition of democratic rule in South Africa has long seemed daunting because of the profound diversity of its citizenry. Even in relatively small and homogeneous societies, attempts to forge binding agreements through democratic processes—those that allow for input from and some form of veto power to ordinary citizens and their representatives—frequently prove to be challenging. Especially with four major race groups, eleven official languages, a relatively even split between those living in rural and urban areas, and the highest level of income inequality in the world, the notion of “common interest” can seem elusive. And yet, one of the great promises of democratic competition is that in the quest for votes, electoral candidates will make appeals to large swaths of the population, forging coalitions among people with otherwise divergent backgrounds. And for the most part, the parties competing in the 2019 electoral contest advanced credible and distinct ideas concerning how to govern South Africa’s highly diverse and unequal society. They provided answers to two central questions that had been asked for over a century, including during the very 1948 election that set the stage for Apartheid. First, there was the race question, or really, a set of race questions: How did the party propose to address the legacies of race-based inequality and conflict? Would it seek to promote integration, autonomy, or something else? And what should be the racial identity of the party’s leaders and of its core supporters? Second, and certainly relatedly, there was the economic question. On the one hand, just about everybody wants a better life in material terms, to have more comfortable shelter, basic services, and opportunities for leisure, and to take advantage of new products and new technologies. But how would the parties address the profound economic inequalities that called into question any sense of a shared humanity? All across the country, and certainly in Mogale City, you could find neighborhoods of people living in modern homes with all the amenities available in the United States or in Europe just a few miles from those living in informal structures of corrugated metal without basic services, such as electricity, clean water, or a flush toilet, let alone access to a decent job. What role should the state play in providing economic opportunities and security? What role for the “market” and competition? Should those who were previously disadvantaged get a leg up? Both issues spoke to a larger question of human worth or dignity. How should people across the color bar be treated by one another and by the state? If politics is about who gets what, and how,7 the South African parties epitomized a good political contest because if nothing else, in 2019, each of the five leading political parties was offering very different answers to these questions. At the center of the election was the African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party for twenty-five years and before that a prominent challenger to White government for eight decades. In 1963, Nelson Mandela and a group of other ANC leaders were arrested for, among other things, sabotage and conspiracy in the wake of their efforts to topple Apartheid. They served harsh prison sentences on Robben Island, but their heroic efforts at liberation were rewarded handily in the first multiracial elections in 1994. Although its support base was overwhelmingly Black African, the party had historically appointed people from various race groups to its leadership posts. It espoused racial inclusion and compromise even if its detractors sometimes argue that it does the opposite. On the economy, the ANC’s approach has been center-left and quite moderate in many ways. The ANC had always had a highly educated middle-class elite in its leadership ranks; but through its links with unions it extended its reach to workers and was even able to appeal to rural peasants through traditional leaders. It promoted economic preference policies (aka affirmative action), but not radical redistribution; and certainly in post-Apartheid South Africa, and in the context of the global economy in the late twentieth century, the organization had bet on the power of competitive markets. For years, Mandela had been celebrated as a saintlike figure. But by 2019, the ANC was treading lightly in its tributes to him and its focus on the organization’s role in ending Apartheid. Months before the election, new critics joined a growing chorus that challenged Mandela’s grand bargain with the very White government that had oppressed Black people. They complained that during the transition of the early 1990s, he had given away too much to Whites. Others, even Black leaders within the ANC, believed that during the first election campaign, he promised too much to Blacks. Either way, the charismatic icon who had passed away five years earlier, at the age of ninety-five, was being quietly blamed for some of the mess the country was in. As the incumbent party, the ANC had to stand on its record. Commentators in the media and the academy shared a steady flow of criticism and sometimes described the country as being “at a precipice” or “on the brink.” Citizens were frustrated by all sorts of issues, not the least of which was the load-shedding or rolling blackouts to ration electricity that was insufficient to meet total demand. Stories of ANC corruption, violence, high rates of unemployment, and newly emboldened as well as newly formed political parties calling for change all dominated the news. In fact, one of the country’s major scandals was centered in Mogale City. It involved Bosasa, a private South African company with headquarters in Krugersdorp that, among other things, provided prison services to the government. In January 2019, the owner—a White businessman with long-standing ANC ties—was caught paying out bribes to ANC officials, all the way up to President Jacob Zuma, in exchange for comfortable government contracts and leniency with respect to affirmative action rules.8 For fifteen years, the country had confronted an almost endless battery of protests like the one that passed by Krugersdorp’s Chicken Licken. While those protests had many messages, they were mostly a rebuke to ANC rule or at least to particular ANC leaders or factions. The main opposition going into the election was the Democratic Alliance (DA). Like the ANC, they were also a big-tent party and by 2019 had a much more racially diverse support base than the ANC. While their leader at the time of the election was a Black man—Mmusi Maimane—most of their leadership was White, and the party was born of White liberals, many of whom challenged, but also lived quite comfortably within the Apartheid system. Unlike the ANC, the DA is more explicitly pro-market, and more critical of Black preference policies, while stopping short of being rabidly laissez-faire. For years the DA had campaigned on good government, arguing that the one province it controlled (the Western Cape) and the several municipalities it governed performed better than in those provinces and municipalities where the ANC was in power. Many of the DA’s White leaders could often be attacked for flat-footed comments that failed to appreciate the challenges still faced by Black South Africans in the post-Apartheid context. When its then-leader Helen Zille tweeted in 2017 about some of the positive legacies of colonial rule, she was eviscerated on social media and faced widespread charges of racism from ANC and other party leaders and commentators. If the DA and the ANC were fighting over a big center and a wide and diverse polity, the other major contenders in the election had much more focused constituencies and distinct answers to the questions of the day. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was a relatively new party, but they were taking up ideas that had been around for generations, espousing a more exclusionary Black nationalism and a very central role for the state in the economy. Although its ideology was strong, the party was very much embodied in the thirty-seven-year-old firebrand, Julius “Juju” Malema, who had been expelled from the ANC, where he had been the leader of their influential Youth League. Malema had been convicted of hate speech and was a divisive figure in an ANC led by an older generation of liberation activists. He epitomized rebellion and nonconformity. He and his EFF had creatively captured the imagination of Black, disaffected urban dwellers, particularly the young, by reminding them of the persistent inequalities and indignities of everyday life in the country and by laying virtually all the blame on the ANC for such outcomes. Malema was clearly a populist candidate in the sense of being someone who tried to appeal to ordinary citizens through anti-elite messages. But unlike many populist contemporaries elsewhere in the world, he did not seek to scapegoat foreigners. In fact, he was outspoken in his rejection of xenophobic violence, promoting instead a pan-Africanist vision. He and his party spotlighted the reality that the country remained deeply, devastatingly unequal and that there had been very little redistribution of land from the White minority to the Black majority even under ANC government.9 Malema was demanding a radical redistribution of income, wealth, and power in one of the most unequal societies on the planet. Malema scared the ANC and he really scared South Africa’s White population, who saw him as the greatest threat since the advent of this multiracial democracy. Whites would certainly be losers in any serious redistributive scheme. To date, they had not paid dearly for the sins of the past, and in the grand scheme, their comfortable lifestyles had remained as such. And Malema would continue to remind them and the Black majority of such basic facts. Beyond these three parties, with their respective ideas, a fourth idea was still very much on the South African political menu. Ethnocultural autonomy was advocated in different ways by two different parties—both with much smaller support bases as compared with the first three, while representing groups that are central to the South African story. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+)10 is largely, but not entirely, the party of extreme-right Afrikaners. While numerically small today—White South Africans who speak Afrikaans at home comprise less than 5 percent of the population11—this group has always managed to carry outsize political influence through military might and tight political organization. As early as the eighteenth century, Dutch descendants, along with French Huguenots and a few other Europeans, increasingly spoke a variant of the Dutch language and came to think of themselves as a people attached to this land. Many began to self-identify as Afrikaners—or, simply, Africans. (They would also self-identify as Boers, or farmers.) The Afrikaners developed a strong identity and political strength by mobilizing around narratives of persecution and the quest for self-rule. Indeed, Krugersdorp’s namesake, and one of the country’s most famous Afrikaners, Paul Johannes Kruger, rose to be president of one of the two Afrikaner republics that predated the formation of modern South Africa. Born in 1825, Kruger was a boy living on the Cape when his parents decided that they could no longer remain under recently imposed British rule, which included banning the use of the Dutch language. They abandoned their home and took Paul, at around the age of nine, to participate in the storied “Great Trek,” the Afrikaner migration from the Cape to the eastern and northeastern parts of southern Africa, including around modern-day Mogale City. Ultimately, the rise of the National Party, which designed and implemented Apartheid, was the product of an Afrikaner effort to wrest control from English-speaking South Africans and those with more capitalist and internationalist orientations. Arguably, one of the most far-reaching affirmative action programs ever implemented—and successful in terms of promoting economic redistribution—was that in favor of Afrikaners during the Apartheid era.12 And now in 2019, a collection of Afrikaners mobilized by the FF+ were playing a similar card decrying cultural oppression by a Black majority and Black-led government. Going into this election, the Afrikaner quest for autonomy was not expressed explicitly in terms of the inherent supremacy of one group over another, but their core political proposition was that different people, marked by language and history, share distinct values and prefer to be among themselves, and to do as they please, at least within their own community. Although they were White and generally economically privileged relative to the majority, they were using the same language of claims-making—calling for recognition and autonomy—in the manner frequently articulated by marginalized indigenous groups in countries around the world. One might say it was a bit of chutzpah. The FF+ had not earned many seats in the national Parliament or in the Mogale City council. But in a tight election in South Africa’s particular electoral system, it could potentially play a decisive role and get at least some of what it wanted. And it continued to broadcast a foundational idea that remained strong in South Africa: address the country’s diversity by staying apart. Like the DA, they rejected affirmative action, arguing that twenty-five years was long enough for Black preference policies. The party’s leaders routinely argued that White people were “scapegoated” for the problems of the ANC government. Also clamoring for ethnocultural autonomy was the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the party most closely tied to the Zulu Kingdom, with Zulus constituting the largest language-based ethnic group in the country. Zulus could boast a long history of military might and recorded numerous strong stands against the incursions of European settlement and eastward expansion. On the one hand, the IFP drew its support from a largely poor, rural, and Black base and was less overtly at odds with the ANC government, which might make it appear quite distant from the FF+. But on the other hand, ironically, like the FF+, the IFP embraced many Apartheid-created institutions, including structures for incorporating traditional leadership and an appeal to a distinctly Zulu electorate. While the IFP certainly advocated for more social spending on the poor, particularly with regard to health care and the elderly, the party’s views on ethnic autonomy were much more aligned with those of the FF+ than with those of the other leading parties. At the dawn of the democratic era, the IFP had been a significant political force, but by 2019, its influence had clearly waned. A Last Push for Votes Despite my long-standing fascination with South African politics, and having traveled to the country regularly over almost thirty years, I had never been present for an election, and I was excited to observe this historic one up close and unfiltered. After my initial visit to Mogale in January and February during the South African summer, I returned in early May to cooler temperatures as winter approached. I arrived at Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport—so named for the celebrated, former ANC leader, Oliver Tambo—on the Friday morning before the election and efficiently made it through passport control and customs and into a rental car. Having driven from the airport so many times, I could almost take for granted the glimmering infrastructure that lines the sides of the wide and modern highway connecting the airport to various corners of the country. I dutifully obeyed the driving instructions broadcasting from my phone, took a couple of turns off the highway, and then became suddenly much more conscious of the goings-on outside my car. My driver’s-seat view of sleek, glassy exteriors had given way to plumes of black smoke on the side of the road. The street-side stores were unevenly finished with hand-painted signs; people were burning open fires and walking across the multiple lanes of the wide street. Several stores advertised that they would either buy or sell metal scraps. The division between road, commerce, and residential life had blurred, and I slowed down as the rules of the road had clearly changed. I was now in Alex—“Alexandra” township—which in the weeks before had been home to multiple election-related protests akin to what I had observed in Krugersdorp a few months earlier. I continued on to ascend a small hill, and when I arrived at the top, I could see out in the not-so-far distance a set of tall office buildings. If you wanted a single image to capture the contrast between the haves and the have-nots, this was the place to take that picture. As I exited Alex, I proceeded into Sandton, one of the wealthiest areas of the country. It is where some of the leading companies—including the large mining concerns and various multinationals at the core of the country’s industrial economy—maintain their corporate offices. Just a few days earlier, on May 1, Julius Malema stood before a packed crowd at a Workers’ Day Rally—held in Alex—in which he communicated the EFF’s aspirations, warning of the revolutionary potential born of such stark inequalities, and had this particular contrast in mind: “How do White people in Sandton sleep when they see their neighbors here in Alex living like this?” he asked. “We keep blaming government‚ yes let us do that, but what are Sandton people doing to help their neighbors? They are not doing anything, but they are staying behind high walls because they are scared of us. They are eating alone and when you are eating alone your subconscious tells you to build high walls before these people come.”13 The message was a powerful one. More than anything else, profound inequality—mostly, but not entirely, race-based—remains the source of political tension in this country. For the have-nots, the question is, who is to blame, and what is to be done about this sorry state of affairs? The parties would need to offer compelling answers to address the frustrations associated with such questions. During the final weekend before the election, each of the three largest parties—the ANC, the DA, and the EFF—would wrap up their campaigns with rallies in Soweto, a name born as an acronym for South Western Townships. It was arguably the country’s most important Black township because of its size, its political history, and its attachment to Johannesburg, the economic heartland of the country. It abuts Mogale City’s largest Black township, Kagiso. ANC Rally The ANC held its rally at Ellis Park soccer stadium. It followed a well-worn approach: warm-up remarks from lower-ranking party dignitaries to build momentum, followed by a clean-up speech by the face on the ballot. Despite the party’s claim to be “of the people,” the stadium floor was filled with VIPs separated from the masses in the bleachers. From the podium, the speaker frequently shouted, “Amandla” (“Power”), extending the middle “a” out over several seconds. The crowd’s dutiful response: “Awaaaaaaay-too” (“Awethu” or “to the people”). When the state president and the ANC lead candidate in the election, Cyril Ramaphosa, finally appeared onstage, he was wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap instead of his usual business suit. At the time, Ramaphosa was sixty-six, and he had lived many lives. He was born in Soweto, attended university, and, like so many liberation leaders, both studied law and faced multiple bouts of incarceration for breaking unjust Apartheid laws. He helped launch a major mine-working union in the 1980s, and the chairman of Anglo American described him as the “toughest, ablest, and shrewdest negotiator he’d had to deal with during his tenure.”14 And though Ramaphosa played a central role in political and constitutional negotiations, his early post-Apartheid career was in business, not politics. In just the first few years of the new democracy, he was widely courted to run various businesses and to sit on multiple corporate boards. He went on to become a leading mining executive, a veritable business titan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He always remained closely tied to the ANC, however, and was generally well regarded by a range of constituents from the different circles in which he traveled. He did have one glaring blemish on his record—one that was still relatively fresh. In 2012, in the wake of a wildcat strike at the Lonmin platinum mine in the town of Marikana—less than fifty kilometers north of the northern boundary of Mogale City—Lonmin’s management asked him to play the role of “fixer” during this moment of growing conflict. Ramaphosa, the former union leader, adopted the views of management and argued that the strikers were acting as criminals, and he called in the police. Approximately 400 members of the South African Police Service arrived with assault rifles and they opened fire, leaving 78 injured and 34 mine workers dead.15 What came to be known as the Marikana Massacre triggered additional strike waves across the mining sector and left many inside and outside of the ANC suspicious of who Ramaphosa really represented. The massacre also fueled anger at an ANC already under fire from its core constituents. Nonetheless, he worked to resuscitate his image; later that year he ran and won an internal ANC election for deputy president of the party. He would soon become deputy president of the state and, following the resignation of Jacob Zuma in 2018, president of the country. On this sunny day in 2019, and with this crowd, he presented himself more as labor organizer and man of the people than as boardroom mogul. He respectfully paid tribute to the local dignitaries present, as well as special guests from other African countries, including the former Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan. Ramaphosa acknowledged the swelling negative sentiment around the ANC. “We admit that we have made mistakes and we put ourselves before our people,” he said, adding: “but it is only those who are doing nothing who don’t make mistakes.” Those convicted for corruption would not be able to serve in leadership roles in the ANC, he promised—leaving aside the question of whether anyone would actually be investigated, let alone convicted. What he wasn’t saying explicitly, but what was well known, was that over the previous two decades, the ANC had become a house divided. Beyond Malema’s actual split from the party, there were major factions within the party, including those who still supported former president Zuma and a style of government that rested on patronage—the granting of favors and appointments for supporters. Ramaphosa was trying to clean up the ANC’s image, to recapture supporters who had left in disgust. Along these lines, he had expressed remorse about the recent direction of the ANC almost a year before, when he reached out to the Nobel prize-winning, octogenarian, and former anti-Apartheid activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu.16 Tutu had made no public statement about whether he accepted the apology, and the uncertainty about Tutu’s vote mirrored the possible uncertainty of many Black voters. On the other hand, Ramaphosa also would not want to fully alienate those card-carrying ANC members who had supported his rivals, certainly not a few days before the general election. Then he pivoted to the issue of voter turnout, smiled, and offered practical advice in a gentler tone. “If you sleep with someone in your bed, wake them up and say, ‘Sweetheart, let’s go and vote.’ ” DA Rally The DA hosted its final rally at the stadium in Dobsonville, Soweto, childhood neighborhood of the party’s leader, Mmusi Maimane, who was born in nearby Krugersdorp. In its early years, the DA attracted mostly White and Coloured supporters. On this Saturday before the election, the audience here looked to be at least 90 percent Black African. Everyone received a T-shirt, a goody bag with snacks, and a large water bottle. One cannot underestimate the importance of the giveaways to induce attendance and create goodwill in the days before the election. The planners smartly avoided booking one of the larger stadiums, as images of empty seats don’t play well anywhere. They seemed to just fill the 24,000-person arena. When Maimane arrived, the crowd predictably erupted. Handsome and slender, with a shaved head and trim beard, wearing a suit and open-collared shirt, he walked around the edge of the stadium. I had to give him credit—Maimane was surely comfortable in a stuffy boardroom, but when the music was blasting and he was on the spot to dance and move while greeting supporters, he appeared totally at ease. He took the stage and bellowed, “Vote us in. If we don’t do what we promise, vote us out!” He outlined lots of policies; not all received the same level of enthusiasm. “I want to reform our politics so that people of all races can work together towards one goal, instead of retreating back into separate corners.… I want every home to have at least one job. That way all South Africans will have the dignity of an income.” I was surprised by how loudly the audience applauded his call for “secure borders.” I had interviewed Maimane a few years earlier, and his precise and philosophical ruminations reflected his advanced degrees in theology and public administration. On this day, he adopted the voice and intonation of a traditional ANC politician, a low and guttural voice, interspersing English and Zulu, and led the crowd in a few call-and-responses of “Amandla” and “Awethu.” He surely delivered very different speeches when addressing audiences in the White suburbs. Trying to appeal to a multiracial, multiclass electorate was a tall order. Yet in a country where mixed-race marriages had long been forbidden and were still rare, the fact that he was married to a White woman suggested that maybe he could be a bridge-builder. Born to a Xhosa mother and a Tswana father, and still under forty, Maimane could be a youthful incarnation of the New South Africa. As the rally reached a climax, the question of “who is us?” returned to the fore. Maimane proclaimed, “They want us to … fear each other.” In response, the campaign slogan is a single word: “One.” EFF Rally Malema started his speech at the EFF rally at Soweto’s Orlando Stadium on a somber note. His beloved grandmother had passed away the day before. And he was clearly shaken. In acts of gracious civility—but ones that were widely expected as appropriate gestures—various party leaders, including Ramaphosa and Maimane, sent notes of condolence, and he acknowledged those with appreciation. “I am because of her.… She stood by me … she always believed in my innocence … I always knew my grandmother was there to support me.” But from there he quickly pivoted to an attack against the older generation of ANC leaders: “They are old … they must all go to old age or straight to prison. They are too old.… We are the future of South Africa.” His speech offered some concrete proposals. Focusing on his youthful core, he called on the government to shift resources from social grants to education. He argued, “That’s what we mean by economic Apartheid. Political freedom without economic freedom is meaningless.” Malema spoke forcefully to the crowd: “I am here to talk about you … ground force of the EFF, you are amazing … you have shaken the A … N … C.” On banks, “why do they hate Black people? … When we say economic freedom, we mean Black people will own productive farms.” He returned to the metaphor he had invoked the previous week in his Workers’ Day speech—referring to food and mealtime as symbolic of material wealth. “You have been watching them eat. Now it’s your time to eat.” He promised, “We are not fighting against White. We are fighting to sit at the dinner table. White people, you will no longer eat alone. We are coming to sit [at] the dinner table, and if you are refusing us … we are going to destroy that dinner table. No one is going to eat until all of us in South Africa eat from the same dinner table.” “Let the people of the West Rand own the mines,” he said, referring to the area including around Mogale City where the country’s wealth was generated through the extraction of gold and platinum upon which the racially unequal economy was built. I imagined that this line was playing well among some back in Mogale City but frightening others. The EFF did not have a record of engaging in serious violence, but in his speech, Malema dared the police to shoot ANC leaders. “If you want to shoot, go to Parliament and shoot the house which is full of criminals.” Was this really a call for murder? No. But the tone and the EFF brand more generally were certainly not focused on civil engagement, and he fired up the base as they smelled political blood. Poles and Polls The final days of the election generated a burst of heat in the winter air. Lamp poles sprouted signs broadcasting the parties’ respective sound bites. From the opposition parties: “Jobs not corruption.” “Jobs in every home.” “Fight back!” From the ruling ANC: “Let’s grow South Africa together.” Depending on the area, such signs would appear in one or more of the country’s eleven official languages. Pundits on talk radio, television, and social media and in the newspapers opined over the issues and prospects for political realignment. After increasingly disappointing results in elections over the previous decade, opinion polls revealed even more apprehension about the ANC. Just a week before the election, a widely publicized poll generated a lot of excitement and attention. It appeared that the ANC’s majority support had stunningly vanished, down to 49.5 percent, a drop of more than 5 points since a February poll; the EFF was up to almost 15 percent, and the DA was holding steady at about 21 percent.17 Other surveys gave the ANC an edge, and of course, there is always sampling error. But the specter of 49.5 percent was powerful. And the influential progressive weekly newspaper the Mail & Guardian published these results with the headline, “IRR Poll Shows National Loss for the ANC.”18 The media loves a good story. And the results showing that the ANC might not get a majority generated page clicks. Their numbers held out the possibility that the ANC would lose not just the Western Cape Province, which had long been in DA hands, but other provinces as well: KwaZulu-Natal, the country’s second-most populous province that was also former president Zuma’s home; and Gauteng, the industrial heartland, which encompasses Mogale City, Johannesburg, and several other municipalities and contains more than a quarter of the country’s population and more than a third of its economic output. And maybe, just maybe, the ANC would even lose the national election. It had the makings of a serious contest. Under different electoral rules, or with a clear ANC majority in sight, small parties like the FF+ and the IFP might not matter very much. But if the election was actually going to be this close, a party with even 1 or 2 percentage points of the vote, translating into a few seats in Parliament, could become the linchpin in forming a coalition after the election. They would use their last days to appeal to their more narrowly defined constituencies. Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi was serving out his final months as head of the IFP at the advanced age of ninety. He had founded the organization in 1975 and had both worked with and opposed the Apartheid government. And he closed out the party’s 2019 campaign with a speech at a rally on May 5 in Ulundi, once the capital of the Zulu Kingdom and still populated almost entirely by Zulus. He took similar swipes at the ruling ANC as the other opposition parties did and urged his constituents to heed the words of Nelson Mandela: “If the ANC does to you what the Apartheid government did to you, then you must do to the ANC what you did to the Apartheid government.” Not once did he explicitly talk about Zulu autonomy, but he made reference to KwaZulu-Natal ten times, making a plea to vote in order to reclaim provincial leadership. He recalled his own more “pragmatic” approach to the struggle against Apartheid, including opposition to economic sanctions and destructive political campaigns in order to “protect the economy.”19 In speeches and official documents, the FF+ was more explicit in its calls for cultural autonomy. “As far as self-determination is concerned, the FF Plus strives for autonomy … in education, care for the elderly, sports, heritage conservation and other similar matters.” And as far as the economy, “The FF Plus is convinced that only the free market can fully unlock economic value.”20 And now, the voters would need to assess what they had heard and what they had seen. The elderly and the infirm would get to vote early and election officials would go to them. Most of the population would head to the polls on May 8. The voters would get to decide the future of the country, no doubt shaped by their views about democracy and Black rule in South Africa over the previous twenty-five years.",

      "content": "2 Citizens Choose ELECTION DAY IN MOGALE CITY ON ELECTION DAY, despite the many differences in the way people actually live in any given democracy, millions perform the same ritual in more or less the same way. I wanted to see this for myself and to hear what was on the minds of the very diverse citizens at the precise time that they were finally being forced to make this important decision. Using the geo-coordinates of the polling stations posted online by the electoral commission (IEC), I planned a tour of Mogale City. I set out to trace the history of the development of the area, while trying to minimize driving distance between stops. In preparation, I charged two mobile phones, one with an American SIM card, one with a local SIM. These devices would guide me throughout the day, and I needed some redundancy in case one failed or got poor service, eventualities I had previously experienced. I also brought a notebook that fit in my back pocket and a few pens. A friend and colleague who is an expert on election observation advised me to wear neutral colors, to carry a clipboard, and to review an election observation handbook.1 During the previous few days, the weather had been absolutely stunning: warm, with clear skies—winter in Gauteng is nothing like its Boston counterpart. On this morning, however, it was distinctively chilly and overcast. Adding to my sense of apprehension, as I departed from my guesthouse at about 6:45 a.m., I saw that several birds had decided to mark this special day by crapping all over my white rental car. FIGURE 2.1. My election day route, Mogale City, May 8, 2019. MONUMENT PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:00 A.M. My first stop was Monument Primary School. Although I had hoped to get there a bit before the election station was set to open, I arrived at exactly 7 a.m. Monument refers to the Paardekraal Monument, just half a mile away, where almost 139 years earlier Paul Kruger and approximately 6,000 fellow Afrikaners built a cairn—a large statue of stones—to mark their unity and common cause in resisting British rule.2 Always a group to mix religion and politics, they declared it a symbol of their covenant with God, recalling unlikely past victories against their foes.3 Monument Primary School sits just a block away from Voortrekker Road—yet another nod to the Afrikaner legacy. In Ward 37, just shy of 50 percent of households speak Afrikaans at home. It had grown to be a solid DA constituency, and in the 2016 local election, that party raked in over 83 percent of the vote here. In this well-manicured neighborhood, large but hardly ostentatious homes are mostly visible from the street. Outside the gates of the school, the DA set up what looked like a small office, with a canopy and a table. I didn’t see any other parties. Either they were conceding this ward, or—more likely—they just had not gotten their acts together to arrive before voting began. Election day is a national holiday in South Africa—a simple tribute to its importance that some have advocated for in the United States.4 But that doesn’t mean everyone had the day off from work, and in any case, many people like to vote early. About sixty people were standing in line outside when I arrived. Apart from one woman, everyone I saw was White; there was a fairly good mix of young and old, and many people came with their kids. A few pulled up in high-end “bakkies,” white, tricked-out pickup trucks, with stainless steel crossbars in the front. One DA sign said, “Stop the ANC and EFF.” In other words, stop the two Black parties. There were no ANC signs around here. In the last election, the ruling party barely eked out 7 percent of the vote in this ward, even though almost 30 percent of the population was Black. On the one hand, because today’s elections were for the provincial and national legislatures, it was not as if a vote in one part of the municipality would have a greater impact than anywhere else in the province. On the other hand, local party officials would be held accountable for each polling station, and the returns in this election would serve as a benchmark for local contests scheduled for two years in the future. The respective parties would make decisions about which local officials could stand in those elections with this information in mind. I found a spot that was outside the IEC’s taped-off boundaries but close enough that I could greet exiting voters. At 7:15, just fifteen minutes after the school opened to voters, I approached a White woman, probably in her thirties, who spoke quickly with a strong Afrikaans accent. “Aagh, they weren’t quite ready for us,” she told me. “The left hand doesn’t know where is the right hand. But it was not too much of a holdup.” She was skeptical that the vote would be totally free: “I think they will try to put in votes,” she said, which I took to mean that the ANC would stuff ballot boxes with fraudulent ballots. Of her friends and family she said, “Most will vote. Some will say it’s not worth it. But we need to try.” When I asked about possible problems so far, she said she was not aware of any vote buying or intimidation. Just before 7:20, I saw that a few ANC party representatives had arrived to set up shop near where the DA decamped. The major parties set up these small booths outside the election stations to provide a last bit of party marketing, to stand by to monitor for any funny business, and to allow party supporters to come by to check in. The actual vote is secret, but this system allows the parties to keep track of who actually shows up on election day. Next, I spoke with a forty-something White man who described the process as very efficient and recounted that he had voted in every previous election. “I think you need a strong opposition … and I think the fear factor of the EFF is what’s causing a lot of people to vote.” A young woman, probably in her early twenties, came out with her father, and when I asked her about her decision to come to vote, she said, “It’s the right thing to do.” As I drove away I saw well-ordered rubbish bins set out at the end of driveways, in greater order than I was accustomed to in my Brookline, Massachusetts, neighborhood on collection day. Basic service delivery was just about 100 percent in Ward 37. But I did notice a few guys picking through the trash bins. The very poor would try to survive on the salable, salvageable items from the detritus of the well-to-do. WEST RAND PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:40 A.M. My next stop was a voting station on the other side of Coronation Park. It was established in 1902 to commemorate Edward VII’s coronation as British king in 1901 and just following the British defeat of the Boers in the 1899–1902 war, also known as the Boer War. The park may have been built over a concentration camp run by the British, largely to contain their Afrikaner enemies, and remains as yet one more remembrance of the bitter tensions that once stood between these two White groups.5 While bloody and costly, the peace for that war paved the way for the formation of the Union of South Africa, which integrated two Boer-run republics and two British colonies. The IEC station here was the second of three in Ward 37 and was set up at the West Rand School, which had a long driveway and well-manicured grounds. As I entered, I cynically assumed it was a place filled with White, square-chinned rugby players. I later learned that it is a multiracial primary school for physically disabled children, many of whom have cerebral palsy, and it was heartening to recognize that the most vulnerable were enjoying access to what appeared to be a beautiful facility. The voters were again mostly White, a mix of old and young. Some likely worked desk jobs; others wore the fluorescent vests and pants that help to protect those working on the street as cleaners, parking attendants, and road pavers. “They already say that the voting papers [ballots] were not stamped,” a White woman, perhaps in her early sixties, said in response to my question about the integrity of the voting process. “They say we must write in a pen.” Apparently, some votes cast somewhere in the country were in pencil and had been changed. The stamps are used on election day by election workers to mark the validity of the ballots. Reports of any malfeasance circulate instantaneously on social media. I asked, why vote? “Actually, it’s a privilege to be part of the process. I have a nineteen-year-old son who did not register but he regrets it. I hope they [young people] have a say. It’s exciting for me to see people get involved. To do something about it.” I saw just one Black African woman, wearing a faded pink cotton apron that peered out underneath her jacket. She was originally from Soweto but had lived in this area for a long time. I made it a point not to ask anyone about their vote choices, but she quickly informed me, proudly, “I am ANC … I have voted in all of the elections.” I saw it was 8 a.m. on my watch, the sun was coming out, and I headed to my car. On my drive, I passed a tall statue of Paul Kruger, the last Afrikaner president of the Afrikaner Republic that predated the Union of South Africa. RAND EN DAL KLINIESKOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:05 A.M. At about 8:05 a.m., I arrived at the first of my two stops in Ward 17, the Rand en Dal Klinieskool. This is in Dan Pienaarville, the site of significant political tension in the 1980s when its White residents clamored for Black residents of nearby Munsieville to be moved because they were, simply, too close for comfort. Dan Pienaarville remains a largely White area, but compared with my first stops, the neighborhood homes were smaller, the grass was less tightly manicured, and there were more vacant, scruffy lots. Nonetheless, most voters arrived in their own cars, reflecting a certain level of wealth or employment status that most South Africans do not enjoy. For the first time that day, I saw a large ANC Mogale City tent. The DA was also there, as was the FF+. The skies turned gray again. “One hundred percent. Nice and smooth,” a forty-something White man with a goatee explained to me as he stood next to his wife. “This was a bit better, because last time they started late. We need to vote for the opposition to try to end the corruption. It’s a beautiful country, but we must set the politics right.” A Black man in his thirties also described the process as smooth. He had moved to the area only six months earlier. “I think it was free and fair, but I would prefer a system like in the United States, where you have the opportunity to vote directly for the president.” I didn’t ask his party, but I did ask what influenced his vote choice. “It’s not easy. You look at the past and, well, job creation is critical. Our economy is moving at a slow pace. We need to get that right.” Any irregularities? “I just saw on TV and social media an issue with some ballot papers,” he said, referring to the same incident that the woman had referenced earlier in the day. “But besides that, nothing.” As I looked around, I was struck by the fact that many people brought their youngish children. I was reminded of the idiosyncrasies of election day: people with children are likely to vote at different times than those without. On a day like today, with changing and unseasonably cold and wet weather, some may not bother at all. At 8:30 a.m., I also felt how chilly it had become, and the South Africans will tell you how much they don’t like the cold. People were still streaming in. Many couples walked to the voting station holding hands. An older White man told me, “No problems. I’ve voted and lived here all my life.” Then he corrected himself: “I came from Namibia in 1978.” At that time, Namibia was controlled by South Africa, essentially governed under Apartheid policies as an additional province and called Southwest Africa. He then uttered a mantra that I would hear throughout the rest of the day: “If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” I supposed that there is a great desire to complain, and if you feel that you will be denied this opportunity if you don’t vote, it’s a small price to pay. He described the system as free and fair. “Yah, I think so. But there are too many parties involved.” Indeed, forty-eight parties had registered for the national election. I asked about people not voting. “In my family, everyone wants to vote. My children, my wife. First, we must try to get rid of the ANC. The next stronger party must be given a chance.” He saw no intimidation or vote buying. He told me that his wife, who is in her sixties and frailer, was able to vote earlier as they let older people vote first. I approached the DA tent and asked the attending representative how the day was going. “It’s cold. That will affect the vote.” Any irregularities? “I haven’t seen anything. But it’s still early.” I went to the ANC tent, where just one man was holding down the fort. I asked if they had many supporters in the area. He didn’t directly respond to my question, but the answer was clear: “Well, it’s mostly White people who live around here.” At 8:48 a.m., I got back into my now thoroughly bird-crap-stained rental car to visit one more voting station in the informally constituted border area between Dan Pienaarville and Munsieville. To do so, I crossed the road that was built in the 1980s expressly to keep these White and Black communities apart.6 It was still working. TOWN VIEW HIGH SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:50 A.M. At Town View High School, I met a thirty-something Black woman who told me, “I want a better life. I need a house. I need work.” Perhaps wishfully, she predicted a coalition would unseat the ANC: “I think the DA and the EFF will win.” At 9:18 a.m., according to my rough plan of allocating thirty minutes per stop, I was right on time, and I headed off to Munsieville Ward 24. If I had been in Cape Town, traveling to the Black township of Khayelitsha or Langa, I would have been preparing for a solid twenty-minute ride, or more with traffic. The Apartheid government kept those townships truly apart from the city center. But key to the whole conflict in Dan Pienaarville of the 1980s was that Munsieville … is right there. And within five minutes, I found myself on Mangope Drive, Mmamogale Drive, and Matlaba Street, arriving at Phatudi Primary School. I was no longer in White South Africa. PHATUDI PRIMARY SCHOOL, MUNSIEVILLE WARD 24, 9:23 A.M. On my way to the voting station, I passed right by the Desmond Tutu Library and a police station that had been burned down by protesters a year earlier. A frustrated group had demanded action on a list of items, including crime, drugs, and human trafficking. One of the bitter ironies of many South African protests held in the name of poor public services is that they frequently involve the destruction of existing ones, contributing to the misery of ordinary citizens. The area had a long history of protest, including in the mid-1950s when Desmond Tutu himself was a teacher at Munsieville High School.7 In 1955, in his early twenties, he decided he could no longer participate in the White government’s administration of inferior “Bantu Education” designed to equip Blacks for a life of servitude and he resigned. (Technically, “Bantu” refers to a group of languages spoken by Black Africans in southern Africa, but that term and “Native” were frequently used by the White government as administrative categories and, in turn, generally rejected as pejorative by Black Africans.) Tutu left teaching for the priesthood, initially as a sub-deacon in Krugersdorp,8 and went on to pursue additional education and opportunities in church councils overseas. Within a few decades, he emerged as one of the world’s most storied liberation activists in his tireless campaigns, not simply against Apartheid but also against sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination. So it was fitting that a library should be built here in his name. Standing in the center of Munsieville, I was now less than two and a half miles from the polling station where I started the morning in Ward 37. However, these were very, very different places. The median household income in Ward 37, where 67 percent of residents were White, was 115,000 rand, and over 20 percent of the households had an annual income of at least 300,000 rand (nationally, just about 8 percent of households were in this bracket). Here in Ward 24, where 99 percent of residents are Black African, median household income was a mere 30,000 rand (about $2,100 US at the time), and just 1 percent of households took in 300,000 or more. Back in Ward 37, about 99 percent of households were built as formal structures and basic service provision (water, toilet, refuse) was over 97 percent. Moreover, 49 percent had a computer, 68 percent had a car, and 71 percent had a washing machine. The situation was very different here: a full 38 percent of households were informal dwellings—shacks or shanties, usually made in large part with corrugated metal. Over 95 percent also enjoyed basic services, albeit of lesser quality. Only 11 percent had a computer, 14 percent a car, and 27 percent a washing machine.9 As I traveled up the hill, I saw a massive taxi depot filled with dozens of the white vans (known as taxis in South Africa) with yellow stripes that bring residents to Krugersdorp, Joburg, and elsewhere. The largely unregulated taxi industry is central to life in South Africa, serving a mostly Black clientele and accounting for approximately 75 percent of all daily transport,10 as neither the Apartheid nor post-Apartheid governments developed successful or integrated mass public transportation systems. On this holiday, the taxis were mostly idle. A few men sat on the passenger floor of a taxi with its door open, their feet hanging over the side. In Munsieville, people live outside. Unlike the subdued atmosphere around Monument and Dan Pienaarville, it was loud with music, and people were laughing. The first person I chatted with was a young woman, maybe in her twenties. When I asked her about her voting experience, she said, “It went well. Took about an hour.” We were now in ANC territory, and 75 percent of the voters here had stayed with the liberation party in the 2016 local elections. It’s also fairly ripe EFF ground, and they managed over 15 percent in those elections, making it unclear what would happen this go-round. “I want to make a change. I don’t want to complain for nothing. I did something about it.” She highlighted the catchall phrase of “services” and called out housing and unemployment as the issues she cared about most. A tall, older but quite sturdy-looking man came through the gates. “I didn’t wait five minutes. Pensioners [senior citizens] get to cut the line,” he explained. “I was born in Munsieville.… Most of us will vote ANC.” I walked over to the ANC tent. “Good turnout?” I asked. “Not yet. But we don’t expect a problem. Some went to work and many will come after 3 p.m.” I was a little surprised to see representatives from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), whose electoral fortunes had waned over the previous quarter century. The organization itself was born out of differences with the ANC regarding how to address the race question. In 1959, ANC leaders had been planning a defiance campaign against the country’s pass laws, but Robert Sobukwe, who rejected many key tenets of ANC philosophy, including “non-racialism,”11 broke away to form this rival organization. In turn, the PAC was behind one of the most important defiance campaigns of all time—the 1960 Sharpeville Protest—during which the peaceful burning of passes was met with a lethal police response. That day, a massacre made martyrs out of those victims and began to turn global opinion against White South Africa. The organization was prominent in Munsieville back in the 1980s and gained some seats in the national Parliament in 1994, but they had not had any representation in Mogale City in recent history, and I had been wondering what had happened to them. One of the three men at the booth said, “We are struggling because of the finances. We have many supporters. We are not buying people to vote. We haven’t changed. We stand for land to Africans today.… At the top of the elections, land is important for survival. For hospitals to build. Land is everything! In the elections of 1994, we focused on land. The other parties did not follow that route. The EFF has been making a big push for land redistribution in recent years, and the ANC has made timid murmurings along these lines.” I asked if the PAC and EFF have similar views on land. “There is a huge difference between the EFF and the PAC,” he said. “On the land issue, the EFF [says] we are only entitled to land taken in the past hundred years. We say, look at the land from 1652 that must be taken.… We believe in Africanism. The ruling party fears us, so we are infiltrated by them.” Land inequality is one of the many remaining sources of wealth inequality, one that remains emotive from decades of forced removals and centuries of land grabs. While a land claims court has settled a handful of cases, the White minority continues to retain the majority of the best land, and the EFF has campaigned hard on this injustice. I had been through this neighborhood several times on past trips, but I was struck again by how different the vibe was on election day compared with White Mogale City. First, the density: the streets are narrower, so many people in so few square meters. The school was noticeably smaller, starker. There was no grass or lawn. I looked at the line into the voting booths, and I noticed that people stood very close to one another, often touching, certainly as compared with the much wider zone of personal space maintained in the White areas. A decent-sized group congregated under the DA tent. Ten years ago, I would never have imagined that this largely White party could have such a presence in a place like Munsieville. But it was clearly building a support base. The sun broke through again and, realizing that I had stayed in this Munsieville ward for longer than my planned half hour, it was time to move on. PRO-PRACTICUM SKOOL, KRUGERSDORP WEST WARD 26, 10:12 A.M. Ward 26 is one of Mogale’s more racially diverse neighborhoods, about 35 percent White and 62 percent Black, according to the 2011 census. I approached the ANC tent outside the Pro-Practicum school, and I introduced myself. The agents quickly referred me to a woman in a different caliber of ANC regalia: a zip-up dress with the party’s green, gold, and black, rather than a T-shirt. She is Peace Mabe, a Member of Parliament. I asked if there were any challenges being made so far, and she could point only to a voter in Magaliesburg, who was turned away on a technicality that might have been an honest misunderstanding of the rules. “We are hoping for the best. We want to win Gauteng.” This was not the “ANC will rule South Africa until the sun doesn’t shine” that I remembered from previous elections. This was a party knowing it might—unlikely though it may be—actually fail to get 50 percent of the votes, particularly in Gauteng. Peace said they were working hard. “Everyone has been out campaigning. We stopped campaigning today to get people out. In other areas, the queues are long.” The line to check in here was certainly longer than at the DA tent. Meanwhile, an EFF car was just now showing up with guys in red plastic hard hats. I spoke with a Black couple in their thirties. The man held a car key in his hand. “We would like to see a few changes in the country and let other parties get a chance. Whoever wins, we need to close the borders. To come, you must have your own money. If that can be processed, it would end crime. People jump over and come to do crime.” As he said this, I could see that his wife cringed a bit, knowing that such talk was not polite. But she did not say anything. The group of young EFF supporters were struggling to get their stand set up, and they were situating themselves pretty far from the entrance. At the Sunday rally, Julius Malema had talked about their disciplined ground game, but it was not evident here. I approached a Black woman who had moved to the area from Soweto in 2002, and I asked how the different race groups got along in this diverse neighborhood. “We only see each other for meetings at school. It goes well. We have different views. You see, we integrated into their space,” she explained with a tone that wavered between empathy and resentment. “For them, integrating us is very difficult. They have to adjust. Since 1994, I think people are beginning to adjust but it’s still very difficult. The majority of the Blacks have voted ANC. Some are loyal to the party. Some would say you can’t be loyal if the leaders are not loyal. Some say the DA is White. Others say they like Mmusi Maimane. We must integrate. We are afraid of one another. We don’t trust one another.” I asked if that lack of trust is also within race groups. “Definitely! Blacks don’t trust one another where our leaders promise but don’t deliver.” Surveys bear out what she said: in one conducted in Mogale City in 2017, only 26 percent said “Most people can be trusted,” while 70 percent said “You need to be very careful.”12 “We focus on faults and downfalls. We build parties on one another’s negativity,” she explained. At 10:55 I got into my car and keyed in the coordinates. Waze, my virtual driving assistant, told me I would have a fifteen-minute trip to my next stop. I had developed a fairly good sense of the geography of Mogale City, traveling around quite a bit and studying maps. But I was not prepared for the fact that within about a minute, I would pass by the entrance to Mintails gold mining. Because the industry had been in such decline in recent decades, apart from the large heaps of mining dumps visible from many vantage points around Mogale City, it can be easy to lose sight of how important mining was to the development of this town and region, and to South Africa more generally. Mintails is now better known as a major culprit of local environmental damage than as a productive contributor to the economy. And as I passed by, I saw a set of old hostels—the often squalid residence halls established for mine workers—in front of which today were rows of men and beer bottles. The hostels looked out onto metal shacks, outdoor plastic toilets, and burning fires. The mostly toxic mining excavations were everywhere, and certainly not where people ought to be living. Many stayed here nonetheless. I took the R28—Main Reef Road—to Paardekraal Drive, and then made a right, away from Krugersdorp, toward Azaadville. It began to rain, lightly, and my heart sank a bit as people are less likely to vote in inclement weather. Rainy election days are bad for democracy. AZAADVILLE COMMUNITY HALL, AZAADVILLE WARD 3, 11:15 A.M. I entered the gate of Azaadville Ward 3, on Taj Mahal Street, one of the few communities that actually maintains an active security gate. It was still drizzling, I needed a caffeine jolt, and my gas tank was getting low, so I pulled up to the Engen petrol station on my right and asked for 200 rand worth of 93. Another guy came up to me asking if I wanted him to check the oil and to wash the car, and I said, no, it’s a rental. Then he pointed to the bird shit all over my car, and he looked at me and explained in so many words that I really can’t have that. I am not known for keeping my own car clean, let alone a rental, but people really take good care of their cars here, and I was apparently an embarrassment. As I went in to get a Diet Coke, he washed the windshield but left the rest of the cleaning for me. Fair enough. I paid for the fuel, tipped him, and drove across the street to the Azaadville community hall. Once again, the cultural terrain changed. Of course, cities the world over have lots of ethnic enclaves. Chinatowns, Little Italys, and Brazilian districts in the United States always provide that sense of arriving somewhere else. The modern remnant of the Apartheid legacy is far more extreme, the result of deliberate machinations to keep groups apart, and Azaadville is not-so-little India. Hanging around the front of the center were several older men, who looked to be of South Asian descent. Families—mostly women with children—entered and exited the center. Almost all were wearing Muslim head coverings. Although South Africa’s Indian community has always been concentrated around Durban, on the east coast of the country, Indians came to represent a small but prominent minority in greater Krugersdorp and remain largely in Azaadville. They came to the town as it was forming in the 1880s and settled geographically between Whites and Blacks.13 This position was forced upon them in a manner that was broadly reflective of the British Empire’s perspective on racial hierarchy and subsequently inherited by South Africa’s White governments. South Africa’s other important “intermediate” racial group—the Coloureds—never comprised a large share of the local population around Krugersdorp or anywhere on the West Rand. Though commonly described as Mogale’s “Indian township,” Azaadville itself is not homogeneous, and certainly not in economic terms. A few months earlier I had visited a much wealthier neighborhood, in which some single-family houses even had small pools. This voting station was surrounded by nondescript blocks of flats or apartments, low-end stores, and a petrol station. For every eight South Asians there were about two Black Africans and no Whites. People hung out around the parking lot of the community center, others coming in and out to vote. ANC, DA, and EFF representatives positioned themselves outside as their counterparts had done elsewhere. The ANC and DA groups were not too receptive to my questions. I spoke some Xhosa with the ANC folks and that lightened the mood, especially when they corrected my broken salutation. I had forgotten that “Thanks very much” is “Enkosi kakhulu” (pronounced “loo” at the end) not “kakhuhle” (with a “lay” at the end). The two EFF reps here were happy to talk. “It’s hard to knock on doors in this area,” they explained. “People live either in closed buildings or behind gated houses,” so the ground game is well-nigh impossible. In front of the community center, a reigning elder seemed to be holding court—a tall man with a curly gray beard and no mustache, sporting sunglasses and a Liverpool soccer club scarf. He arrived here nineteen years ago from Johannesburg near Emirates stadium, still known by its original name, Ellis Park. I introduced myself and asked my standard opening line: “How did the voting go?” “Veeery smooth,” he seemed delighted to report. “Only thing … the IEC guy, I had to teach him a thing or two. He didn’t know the alphabet.” He took out a small slip of paper that was generated as part of the process, and he showed me how it was necessary to match the slip against the individual’s identity card to gain admission. Apparently, the IEC official seemed to be struggling with this. “Now he’s on it.” “I have voted in all the past elections from 1994. Every four years14 it’s something different. What we’ve come through. State capture and corruption. We must make an informed decision about our future. I am a grandfather and we need a better future for all the races. Education, homes, pensions. Everyone should have equal opportunity to prosper.” I didn’t see lines to get into the community center to vote, and I asked him about turnout. “From what I can see, over 90 percent vote. Azaadville is a small community, most people come in the morning. Then afternoon prayer. Oh look, over there, these are the pioneers of Azaadville.” He pointed to some much older men who were slowly descending the steps into the community center. “On our WhatsApp group, one message that came through is that during special voting, some people came with pencils and the ballots weren’t stamped.” I found it amazing that this one story had clearly reached so many South African voters so quickly. “So I came with my own pen. So people are sharing information to make sure to use a pen and verify that the ballot is stamped on the back. We’ve come now twenty-five years, a quarter century. Compared with the first time, the queues were longer then.” A shorter man, also Indian but without a head covering, introduced himself as Farouk. He is an ANC “PR councillor,” which meant he was placed on a party list, not directly elected in a ward constituency, the two options in South Africa’s mixed system of local government. Without mentioning Jacob Zuma’s name, he addressed the cross that ANC ground forces must bear: “The problem is that when an individual does wrong, they associate it with the party. We cling onto the wrong. But there is a lot of good to be appreciated. There is a lot of potential in this country. I am happy we’ve come a long way in 107 years. The current president has a massive job. The ANC has large support, but some swung from the ANC.” I asked about the campaign, and he echoed some of the EFF concerns: “In Azaadville, we don’t go door-to-door—we knock and drop pamphlets.” The man with the Liverpool scarf, Cllr Farouk, and I chatted more about the local concerns, and the standard mantra of “service delivery” came up—a broad label frequently used to decry frustrations with what is not provided usually in the form of basic services but sometimes can mean almost anything at all. I was surprised that Cllr Farouk didn’t take the easy path of pandering to the primacy of his own neighborhood’s concerns: “In Azaadville, some people want speed bumps. In Magaliesburg, some people are suffering without water. What’s more important? In Azaadville, people complain, complain and they have everything.” He looked to the others to nod, but none were forthcoming. “Township people have nothing and they smile.” Of course, many people in the townships are not smiling, but I didn’t disagree with his sentiments and much of my own research supports what he said. Those who have done best under post-Apartheid government have in recent years been the least likely to vote for the ANC.15 Once again, I recognized that in couples, the men were more likely to speak. Several women did come to vote alone or in pairs, and I looked to approach a few of them, but they averted my gaze. I was again very conscious of the male bias in my unsystematic sample. When social scientists conduct systematic surveys, we try to match up the race and gender of interviewers, but I was traveling alone on this day and was reminded of this effect. RIETVALLEI EXTENSION 2 COMMUNITY HALL, RIETVALLEI WARD 3, 12:25 P.M. I got back into my car at 12:05 p.m., and a few raindrops again dotted my windshield. The radio announcers reminded listeners of the duty to vote. “Remember: If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” Maybe that’s why everyone’s saying it, I thought to myself. I headed back out on Taj Mahal Street. I didn’t have time to stop at another voting station in Ward 3, which was mostly Azaadville, but I had noticed on the map that an area just south of Azaadville, Rietvallei, was also in the ward, and decided I would check it out. After pulling over to write down some of my thoughts for about twenty minutes, hoping the pouring rain would stop—which it did—I drove in for a look. It was bleak: an extremely depressing, barren area filled with cinder-block structures and shacks, some gutted and burned out. In the rain, the tall lampposts that tower way above the neighborhood looked like they were spitting fire. There’s very little commerce, except for a few small spaza (informal, home-based convenience) shops. People walked in the middle of the streets, and I drove slowly. The ANC tent there seemed well staffed, as did the EFF tent. It was easy to imagine that this was where the EFF would fare well: if one wanted a narrative of deprivation and failure to deliver a better life, this little pocket would provide just that. THEMBILE PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 10, 1:30 P.M. My next stop was Kagiso, the much larger of Mogale’s two Black townships, which spans several wards. I headed to Ward 10, in the middle. Seventy percent of voters went for the ANC in 2016, but the EFF was also strong with more than 17 percent of the vote. I plotted a course to Thembile Primary School, which is located right next to the Kagiso Methodist Church, where I had visited a couple of times. I had met the pastor there and interviewed a few congregants. I had been struck then, as I was on this day, by the quality of the housing stock, the nice streets, the friendly vibe of the neighborhood. As it had been in Munsieville, election day was a party. The political tents were filled with people, the music was again on full volume, and some people were literally dancing in the street in front of the entrance to the school. I chatted briefly with a man who told me that all the voting had been fine. A man who helped a lady into a van subsequently approached me and asked if I was a reporter. It was a reasonable assumption considering the fact that I was the only White guy for miles and carrying a clipboard. I explained my intentions and he introduced me to the local ward councillor who was on site that day: Councillor Maxwell Kuswayo, a member of the mayoral committee and, according to him, a ward councillor for nineteen years. I knew from my research that there is very high turnover among councillors, so this was indeed an impressive political feat. FIGURE 2.2. ANC party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. I could see that Kuswayo was going to stand here, perfectly legally, but definitely in the path of pretty much anyone who wanted to vote at this station. I asked if he minded if I talked to people coming out of the voting booth, and he thought for a bit and said ok, but as I approached someone to talk, he stayed close by. After this first brief interview, I chatted with him some more. I asked about the low registration among young voters. He boasted that about 80 percent of young people had been registered in the area. “We listen to them all. These kids, their complaint is unemployment. Here it is very high.” Of the EFF, he says, “You can’t promise everything here. How will you pay for it? South Africa is the only country where you can get a free house. We are becoming a welfare state. There are too many social grants. We have seventeen million pensioners.” Kuswayo was born here in 1960. He argued that if you look at this township and consider what it was like back then, you couldn’t imagine the changes. He was an MMC (Member of the Mayoral Committee) for electricity, water, and sanitation. He was the service delivery guy—the very issues so many people are complaining about—and I put it to him that his portfolio is the source of complaint. In response, he highlighted that basic shares of water and electricity were free to the poor. He seemed not ready to discuss some of the more serious concerns—not here, not on election day with this American guy asking questions. Soon enough, it was time for me to go, and I did. TSHOLOTSEGA PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 15, 2:45 P.M. I stopped at several other voting stations in Kagiso, including in Ward 15, at the Tsholotsega Primary School. Ward 15 is a politically interesting area because it houses a strong base of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters, enough to have made it possible to attain a single seat on the Mogale City council in 2016. As I mentioned, the IFP is largely a Zulu-based party, run out of KwaZulu-Natal Province. It is the one major Black party strongly associated with a particular ethnic group; and it was badly hurt when Jacob Zuma, a Zulu himself, headed up the ANC, drawing away the votes of other Zulus from the IFP. A few Zulu speakers are interspersed throughout the municipality, but only in Ward 15 do they constitute a sizable minority (of 32 percent), delivering 15 percent of the total vote share in that ward in the prior local election. The EFF has also been strong here with 17 percent. And the ANC’s position is most precarious for an all-Black area, with less than 59 percent of the vote in the last election. FIGURE 2.3. DA party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The fancy schools of central Krugersdorp were distant memories from the morning; this school had the charm of a passport office, and there was no music or partying outside. This voting station was at the crossroads of a few different communities, also on the edge of a more industrial area. I parked along the sidewalk and walked down to the first booth, the bright red one. “The EFF is very strong in this area because people are tired of the ANC. The ANC doesn’t know how to do groundwork. Even old people want to be members. We’ve got five signups,” the EFF desk rep said proudly showing me the forms. “We have been going door-to-door, every day. Even today. I was very active in the ANC, but I switched at the time they put Zuma in as president.” FIGURE 2.4. EFF party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. As we were talking, a woman with a DA T-shirt came to chat. I smiled and asked, “So you guys get along ok?” “Yah, the DA and EFF are friendly. We don’t want to be near the green and yellow,” she said, referring to the ANC colors. I asked if that extends into her personal life. She nodded. “We don’t have friends who are ANC.” I popped over to the DA tent, where two women and one man were presiding. “We hope all is going well. Seems like it’s a free and fair election. The process is going smooth,” one of the women explained. The man, about my age, wanted to talk and pulled me aside to share his story. “I used to be ANC, three years ago. But I am not happy with how the government was run. There is no system of accountability. Incompetency. Dysfunctional. I studied the manifestoes and thought the DA was for me.” He was the first person I met who complained that there should not be a paper ballot; he feared that some votes would be stolen and believed they should switch to electronic voting. The ANC folks were confident that they would do well in Ward 15. “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a woman, possibly in her fifties, smiled as she repeated the tagline under which Cyril’s name is plastered all over the country. I asked her what she thought were the biggest issues in the ward. “The hostel dwellers. They break our windows, stone our cars.” She pointed down the way to the hostels. “They are vicious people. Some are IFP. Involved in mining. But our resources are almost depleted. So just dumps.” I saw no visible manifestation of the IFP in the area, but they may have been at another polling station within the ward. It was time to leave Kagiso and head north. NOORDHEUWEL COUNTRY CLUB, NOORDHEUWEL WARD 22, 3:30 P.M. The sun came out again around 3:30 p.m., when I arrived at Noordheuwel Country Club, the site of a polling station near where I had started the morning. Looking around, it was clear that I was back in White South Africa. At the entrance, I saw Tjaart Steenkamp, one of Mogale City’s two FF+ councillors. I had interviewed him several months earlier and now he was standing in front of his party’s flag, posted to the side of a walkway. Ward 22 had been solidly DA, close to 90 percent in the last election, but this kind of White, high-income, largely Afrikaans-speaking (over 60 percent) area was fertile ground for the FF+, as many of the typical, White DA supporters were not so sure about a party run by Mmusi Maimane. As I headed down to the voting booth, I could see tennis courts off to the right and a lawn bowling pitch, perfectly manicured, off to my left. I introduced myself to a tall young man with a flop of brown hair, glasses, and a white button-down shirt. He said he didn’t know whom he was going to vote for until he got into the voting booth. The issues? “It’s work … jobs … quotas in sports.” That last one felt out of the blue, and I guessed there must be a back story. There was: he was a cricketer—a sport long dominated by Whites—and frustrated that he had not been initially admitted to university because, according to him, of his color. He shared that he would soon start at the University of South Africa, UNISA. “The biggest thing is my sport. I love it. I just wish we could look past race, gender, identity.” A White man’s pushback against gender- and race-based affirmative action would be familiar in many circles of the United States. I chatted with Tjaart and when I asked how it was going, he smiled. “We’re doing very well. We’ll be strongest in the West Rand.” A key platform for the FF+ is opposition to affirmative action, and the appeal of that message goes beyond Afrikaners to many English-speaking Whites, and even Coloureds and Indians, who say they are overlooked for jobs, promotions, and other opportunities in favor of less-qualified Black Africans. LAST STOPS: RIETFONTEIN SUPERMARKET, RIETFONTEIN, MULDERSDRIFT WARD 23, 4:01 P.M. IMAGES OF AFRICA, CRADLE OF HUMANKIND, WARD 39, 4:40 P.M. After 4 p.m., I made two more stops. The first one was the Rietfontein supermarket in Ward 23 up in Muldersdrift, a rural part of the municipality where I first went on voter registration day; the second stop was at the polling station in Ward 39 located next to a taxidermist, where it is dead quiet. Most of the voters who would cast a ballot in this election had already come and gone. And as the light was getting low, with winter setting in, I decided that it was time to call it a day. As I drove back to my guesthouse on the largely empty road, I continued a conversation in my head that had started as I decided to write this book and persists with me now: Had South Africa’s democratic project been a success? So many of the problems I had learned about for decades were still unresolved, and so many people had grown cynical. But others were proud of what had been accomplished. Quite clearly, my answer could not be a simple “yes” or “no.” But I would aspire to sum up what I could learn with something more useful than “it’s complicated.”",

      "content": "3 The Value of Democracy THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS I raise in this book concern the value of democracy. Specifically, how did political competition and the structure of government change once South Africa adopted truly democratic institutions that incorporated a previously excluded racial majority? Did the quality of people’s lives improve or deteriorate, and in what ways, during this period? And can we plausibly link such changes to democracy itself, to extract more general lessons about the prospects for democratic government in diverse and divided societies? The portrait of the election campaign I painted in the prior two chapters revealed a wide range of perspectives on such questions. Of course, as South African voters went to the polls in May 2019, they were making a choice about what they wanted for the future. Yet, the moment also marked an important opportunity for them to look back and consider whether the prior quarter century of multiracial democracy had been a success. The long struggle against Apartheid government had been a quest for liberty, for freedom from domination by a minority, and to build a more just society. Did those who worked so hard to bring about change get what they wanted? Or were they experiencing a form of buyer’s remorse? Was this really the best solution to institutionalized White supremacy? The ruling ANC party could not simply take a victory lap. The party’s leaders had long been confronting a string of protests of the kind I witnessed in Krugersdorp, frequently organized by their own members. The opposition parties, ranging from a Black nationalist left to White autonomists on the right, were relentless in their critiques. With a few exceptions, citizens seemed more inclined to discuss what had gone wrong than what had gone right. And as the campaign wound down, I considered the fact that in recent years, South African colleagues and acquaintances from a range of backgrounds had begun to express a surprising sentiment, one that occasionally appears in print in serious media outlets: “What this country needs … is a benevolent dictator!”1 Ordinary South Africans had become increasingly disillusioned with democracy.2 In one survey conducted at the end of 2016, 54 percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the way democracy was working.3 And by 2018, the share of “dissatisfieds” had grown to a full 57 percent of the population. In a summary report from Afrobarometer, whose survey data I analyze throughout this book, they cautioned, “Afrobarometer survey findings from mid-2018 show support for democracy weakening and acceptance of authoritarian alternatives growing.”4 It left me wondering: Was South African democracy actually at risk? Listening to the rallies, the campaign speeches, and the incessant commentary on talk radio in and around Mogale City during the first half of 2019, one could not help but be struck by the distinct scent of frustration. Not just with the present but with the whole post-Apartheid project. Even the ANC’s own representatives seemed more apologetic than proud. The expressed antipathies of White South Africans were already very familiar to me. As a White man, I have always had the easiest access to White South Africans. Many unabashedly told me that they longed for the past. “They made this country into a ball of shit,” explained one man, about my age, whom I met while dining at a restaurant in Muldersdrift one evening on my first trip to Mogale. He and his girlfriend were sitting at the table next to mine and they must have heard my American accent while I was placing an order, and like so many in the area, they were friendly and happy to share their political views and reflections with me. The culprit for the country’s decline, in this man’s view, was the Black ANC government. I would hear the same from most of the other White residents I met while touring the area and had heard the same for years in other parts of the country. What I did find more surprising, perhaps even offensive, was the man’s suggestion to me to “ask the Black people around here. They’ll tell you the same thing, that life was better in the old days.” It would be like suggesting that African Americans preferred life under segregation. On the other hand, only with solid data could I debunk such a claim. As part of my research, I conducted a Historical Memories Survey among adults in Mogale City—the results of which I detail in subsequent chapters—and asked citizens to compare their current overall quality of life (theirs and that of their family) to life in the Apartheid days. Is it better today? Worse today? Or about the same? The White responses were fairly predictable: 55 percent said life was worse today. Many Whites truly yearned for the time of White rule. If a politician had appealed to them with the slogan “Make South Africa Great Again,” they would have embraced the message with open arms. To my great disbelief, perhaps shock, it turned out that the White man I had met in Muldersdrift had correctly predicted Black public sentiment and I had been way off the mark in my skeptical reaction to his claims. In fact, a full 50 percent of Black residents surveyed said that life was better then, as compared with 40 percent who said things were better now.5 After months of talking to citizens and leaders around town, I had heard plenty of negative perspectives, complaints about government, crime, lack of jobs, and so forth.6 However, I had not expected that this would be the conclusion of so many in a random sample of forty-and-over adults from a municipality where Apartheid had been harshly enforced. If even Black South Africans were unhappy with the democracy that they had struggled to produce over so many generations, might they consider something else? Only a few years ago, the notion of citizens voluntarily forgoing democracy for authoritarian rule might have seemed radical and unimaginable, but these concerns have become particularly salient because for several years we have been witnessing a global retreat in democratic government.7 Seemingly stable democracies have given way to more authoritarian styles of rule. When my political science colleagues Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, and further developed their argument in a 2018 book, How Democracies Die,8 they provided a powerful wake-up call by connecting the dots to illustrate an emerging pattern: in the United States and in many other countries, the key foundations of democracy were being undone not through military coups or armed insurrections but at the ballot box. Citizens were increasingly choosing leaders who, in their populist bravado, were saying, “I alone can fix everything,” as Donald Trump said on the campaign trail in 2016. Given real and perceived problems in those societies, such calls were warmly received by many voters, and once in power, these leaders have worked to change the rules of the game to help entrench their power, undermining democratic institutions. And perhaps as both a cause and a consequence of such changes, even surprising numbers of Americans no longer take for granted democracy as the “only game in town,”9 imagining other types of political systems as preferable. Many reasons have been offered for the more recent rise of populist authoritarianism that has caused something of a reverse wave away from democracy, but among the most compelling explanations is that large shares of citizens in democratic countries are increasingly dissatisfied with their lot, in large part due to persistent and growing economic insecurity alongside perceived threats to status owing to immigration and other demographic trends.10 Ethnic and racial diversity can provide fodder for frustration and scapegoating. Under such conditions, populists promise swift and assured gains, with little tolerance for “special interests” in the form of ethnic minorities. I argue that the case of South Africa between 1994 and 2019 offers a compelling alternative to populist authoritarianism—a positive model of what democracy can offer truly divided societies: peace, the ability to influence leaders, increased material prosperity especially for the poor, and, ultimately, greater respect for human dignity. These were remarkable achievements in light of the country’s history, and the findings on dignity in particular help paint a fuller view of the value of democracy itself. While the rhetoric of everyday politics can be dismissive of the South African record, a more sober and considered evaluation reveals a democracy that has worked better than is often appreciated—by both pundits and citizens alike. In the remainder of this chapter, I describe why the question of valuing South Africa’s democratic project is a critical one; I outline the approach I took to answer this question; and I summarize the central findings detailed in the subsequent chapters. I highlight the profound value and remarkable achievements of South Africa’s first quarter century of multiracial, democratic government in terms of what I call dignified development, while recognizing the enormity of the problems that remain and that new challenges have emerged. Why Ask? Throughout modern history, historians, philosophers, and social scientists have all reflected on the value of democracy for the human condition. In so doing, they have considered whether democracy is intrinsically valuable, simply as an expression of freedom. And they have asked whether it leads to better outcomes for society. For example, does democracy promote economic development better than other systems of government?11 Is democracy good for the poor?12 Such questions are routinely asked and answered in more general terms, with respect to large numbers of polities. However, I focus on the value of democracy for the single country of South Africa. In this “case study” approach,13 I draw on many relevant comparisons, but I believe the narrowed attention is warranted. To begin with, South Africa is an intrinsically important case. Although only about the twenty-fifth most populous country in the world, the country’s plight has long been central to global political movements and ideas about justice and democracy. In the late twentieth century, perhaps no single political issue galvanized people around the world more than the idea that Apartheid government must come to an end. Apartheid, or apartness, was a full-blown system of social engineering relentlessly implemented on the southern tip of the African continent. It effectively relegated a Black majority to third-class citizenship. In turn, songs, plays, movies, and books captured the injustices of this system, and the very term “Apartheid” came to symbolize the essence of injustice, a retrograde form of internal colonial rule. Over the course of three decades, students at American and other foreign universities followed the lead of their South African counterparts, protesting and staging massive “sit-ins” inside and outside administrative offices to demand divestment from companies doing business in South Africa. Even a youthful Barack Obama cut his teeth in public speaking by railing against the Apartheid regime as a student at Occidental College in 1981, an opportunity he used to also shed light on racial issues in the United States.14 The organizers of major sporting events, including the International Olympic Committee, barred South Africans from competition. The South African government and its privileged White citizenry became global pariahs, while its Black citizens, and especially their famed political leaders—who sat in jail or lived in exile—earned the empathy and support of allies around the world. Sometimes for good and other times for bad, outsiders have always played an important role in the South African story. Citizens and political leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Cuba, and the Soviet Union, and particularly from countries across the African continent, were all intimately involved and/or interested in the long-standing conflict over Apartheid-style government. Depending on their political orientation and their own views on America’s racial order, American political leaders took different sides in support of or against White government. Moreover, while South Africa may be somewhat extreme in the extent to which it combines enormous ethnic and racial diversity along with high levels of income and wealth inequality and a history of conflict, it is not alone in these regards. American history echoes many strands of South Africa’s, an idea expertly documented by George Fredrickson in his classic text, White Supremacy.15 Not just the United States but also Israel, Australia, Brazil, India, Kenya, and many other countries face similar conditions for building cohesion and prosperity given the overlap of diversity and inequality. The degree to which South Africa underwent an extremely deliberate political transition offers possibilities for thinking about how to address such challenges in other contexts. For those interested in the making and breaking of racial boundaries, ultimately one must confront the South African example. As we know now, the formal Apartheid system was dissolved through the removal of discriminatory laws and institutions in the early 1990s. Nelson Mandela went from prisoner to president. South Africa was welcomed back into the global community with open arms, and external scrutiny turned toward other hot spots around the globe. Like dozens of other countries at approximately the same time, South Africa adopted a set of democratic institutions to select its leaders and make its policies. Against this important backdrop, a wide range of interested observers deserve to know what happened. Was it simply “case closed” in the sense that there was a problem, it was fixed, and now it’s time to move on? Given widespread interest, it is important that we get this case right with respect to the success or failure of democracy writ large. Whether South Africa is a case of success or failure has enormous implications for how we think about the promise of democracy more generally. A key concern that motivated me to write this book was my own appraisal that the more recent political history has been mischaracterized. In fact, a dominant narrative argues that the post-Apartheid period has been one of great expectations followed by profound disappointment. In summary form: thankfully, Apartheid finally came to an end; the greatest anti-Apartheid leader, Nelson Mandela, was elected president and ushered in a momentary period of calm and forbearance. But after his one term in office, the country descended into a sea of corruption and incompetence, leaving South Africa, as it is today, at a dangerous precipice. South Africa’s leading scholars and analysts have painted an increasingly grim picture of a still young democratic order, which cannot help but contribute to a sense of dismay about the possibilities for democratic development. For example, Xolela Mangcu, a South African sociologist and journalist, penned his condemnation of the new order in a 2014 book titled The Arrogance of Power: South Africa’s Leadership Meltdown.16 This was a sequel to his 2008 book, To the Brink.17 Alex Boraine, a White politician who helped negotiate the terms of the country’s historic democratic transition behind the scenes and worked closely with Archbishop Desmond Tutu to manage a national reconciliation process in the aftermath of Apartheid, was initially bullish on what could be accomplished. Nonetheless, in his 2014 book What’s Gone Wrong? South Africa on the Brink of Failed Statehood, he shared the notion that things are simply falling apart. Both Mangcu and Boraine recount examples of venal politicians acting in narrow self-interest to the detriment of the greater public good. For example, according to Boraine, “If corruption were an event in the Olympic Games, the ANC government would be festooned with silver and bronze—and perhaps a few gold medals as well.”18 Anton Harber, former editor of the leading South African newsweekly, the Mail & Guardian, documented his riveting and powerful investigation of the politically, economically, and socially dysfunctional township of Diepsloot, which lies on the edge of Johannesburg, not very far from Mogale City. In it, he makes the case: “You want to see South Africa … come to Diepsloot.”19 Foreign scholars have frequently amplified this “glass mostly empty” view of South African democracy. For example, the British university professor Nic Cheeseman analyzed the range of African experiments with democratic rule since the 1990s in his important book, Democracy in Africa (2015). With respect to South Africa, he describes only what has gone wrong since 1994—pointing out real disappointments in terms of government AIDS policy, xenophobia, and other foibles (as I also recount in the chapters that follow). One would not be able to read that book and fathom that almost anything had been accomplished during the period of ANC government.20 From the Zambian economist and best-selling author Dambisa Moyo21 to the British journalist and political analyst R. W. Johnson22 to the foreign correspondents covering South Africa at the New York Times and other leading international news publications, close observers inside and outside the country have identified a range of problems that contribute to a shared understanding of collective failure. And White South Africans—those who left the country, as well as those who stayed—are frequent interlocutors to American and European audiences. Many of them have promoted what I call the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to anyone who will listen. That is, they point to the country to the north, once known as Southern Rhodesia, which was also ruled as a White settler society with an Apartheid-style government. It is a country that similarly experienced a war for liberation and a transition to Black rule a little more than a decade earlier than South Africa did. Under President Mugabe, the country, now called Zimbabwe, went from being a robust exporter of agricultural products to one characterized by hyperinflation, food shortages, corruption, and wide pockets of state failure. And according to this formulation, South Africa is going down the same path. In this final analysis, it is hard not to detect a racist logic—that Black rule inevitably leads to failure. The subtext is often, “You may not have liked Apartheid, but it was better than this” and sometimes more explicitly, “This is what happens when they take over.” And on the day of the 2019 election, when I interviewed dozens of voters around Mogale City, many angrily raised concerns about jobs, lack of basic services, and crime. They were particularly incensed about the persistence of reports of government corruption. Viewed together, very different commentators—ranging from unapologetic Apartheid beneficiaries to former anti-Apartheid activists, from all racial backgrounds—have painted an alarmingly negative portrait of the state of South Africa. In turn, my point is that such a picture can be dangerously misleading if it is presented on its own with the implicit or explicit caption, “This is what democracy delivered.”23 To be clear, I do not dispute the veracity of reports of bureaucratic failure, malfeasance, violence, or abject poverty. I have sat through load-shedding power outages myself; on many trips and tours of South Africa, I have observed the persistent inequality and squalor of many parts of the country firsthand and have analyzed the data confirming broader problems. On various trips, I have worried about my own personal safety, cognizant of the prevalence of violence. I know and trust many of the journalists, scholars, and civil society organizations that focus on these problems. Rather, my concern is that if we take a larger macro-historical perspective—trying to summarize what happened after one of the world’s most anticipated political transitions—we need to present such facts in context regarding what happened in the past and what has been feasible given local and international constraints and challenges—and, most importantly, with respect to what has gone right. In this sense, I follow more in the footsteps of the late Hans Rosling, who urged us to consider the big picture of global human health and development in order to recognize that even when things sometimes seem to be getting worse, they are actually getting better.24 Ultimately, the final judgment about whether the evidence illustrates a case of a glass half full or half empty is in the eye of the beholder. However, I believe that the influential group of interlocutors I just described has overwhelmingly focused on the problems and largely ignored the accomplishments evident in post-Apartheid South Africa. Perhaps this is not surprising given the tendency of human judgment to be characterized by “negativity bias.” That is, the devaluing power of bad things tends to be greater than the redeeming power of good ones.25 Relatedly, we do not expect news outlets to report on the millions of airplanes that land safely—only on the ones that do not, even though those extraordinary stories of statistically outlying events can contribute to a false sense of insecurity. Moreover, democratic practice frequently incentivizes negative over positive appraisal because by design, democratic government opens up channels for dissent and for challenging the exercise of power. Even when they are not governing, opposition parties and social groups, abetted by an open media, can cajole and pressure the government to rethink or revise its policies. Critical dialogue can help citizens to imagine what to even wish for. These are virtues. However, in so doing, democratic practice feeds a degree of discontent. It puts a spotlight on problems, particularly on malfeasance, and it gives special attention to those who are suffering and/or articulating their frustrations. And with the advent of social media, such tendencies are broadcast and shared with greater speed than ever thought imaginable. While such sharing of information plays an important and positive role in driving accountability and social justice, it can lead observers to focus on shortcomings over progress. In turn, social and political commentators must, at least on occasion, take stock of a fuller substantive and historical record in a more holistic manner. In fact, one of the inherent challenges of democracy is that because it is rooted in competition and transparency, citizens and actors are privy to more information about the failings of government performance and leadership, contributing to depressed perceptions relative to what they might experience if facing otherwise similar problems in systems where information and critical voices were absent. One is freer to complain louder in a democracy. Political competition, the media, protests, activists, courts, calls for redress, and dissenting voices are not the problem in South Africa. They are the essence of democracy. Fiery words from political actors—including those that tell the ruling party or president, “Democracy is broken”—may reflect just the opposite. Critical political discourse in democratic practice needs to be separated from evaluation of the quality of democracy itself. This is a subtle but important point. Throughout my research on democratic South Africa, I have found people shouting, more or less, that “everything is awful here,” which would not be possible in strictly authoritarian countries from North Korea to China where everyone must say, on fear of prosecution, “It’s great here.” With respect to the latter, one scholar has aptly observed that the sudden collapse of the East European communist regimes caught many observers by surprise because under this form of authoritarian rule, citizens did not publicly express their views—rather, they engaged in preference falsification.26 For democracy to survive, citizens must ultimately be convinced of its value. And it is certainly conceivable that democracy might not work best. Many organizations—households, firms, universities—operate successfully without truly democratic rules for leadership selection or everyday operation. We should not promote democracy simply as a matter of blind faith. Even the most ardent defenders of democracy point us to certain key limitations, which often prove frustrating to citizens. Two of the most important modern theorists of democratic development offered warnings at the onset of the “Third Wave” of democratization, of which South Africa was a part, concerning what might go wrong and what citizens might prefer instead. Describing several paradoxes of democracy, Larry Diamond observed that in trying to represent diverse interests, democratic governments often move slowly; and compromise can undermine the prospects for effective solutions.27 And Robert Dahl pointed out that citizens may frequently wonder whether they would do better with informed “guardians,” who are experts at governing because of their superior knowledge or virtue, rather than those who convince the citizenry of their credentials.28 Despite real and perceived problems, we must remind ourselves of democracy’s value, and that value may differ somewhat according to the arc of a country’s political development. Democratic retreat will surely continue unless the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of the democratic project can be credibly established and communicated. Yes, we need to recognize what has gone wrong. Nonetheless, South Africa has the potential to demonstrate to democracy skeptics the world over what is possible in a highly unequal, diverse, post–civil war polity. To focus solely on the disappointments is to miss the bigger picture. How to Know? If we are not going to rely simply on the subjective judgments of citizens and local observers and commentators, how does one evaluate the success of a democracy? Indeed, the motivating query for this book—has the post-Apartheid democratic project been successful?—is imprecise and unanswerable without more direction. The first response to that question must be, “Compared to what?” If you were asked whether twenty-three minutes is a good time for a particular road race, it would not be possible to answer that until you knew how long the race was, under what conditions it was taking place, and who else was running. Importantly, one would also want to know what was expected of that runner before the race began. In the same way, my own conclusions about successful democratic development are based on attempts to establish reasonable benchmarks across time and space. Because the outcomes are complex and not easily measured, I use a wide variety of data sources, ranging from my own personal interviews and observations across several decades, a wealth of secondary sources, newspaper archives, more than a dozen individual-level large-sample surveys, including a few I conducted myself, and administrative data from the South African government, research organizations, and various international organizations. Where possible I try to highlight convergences and divergences between these different sources of data and the relationship between subjective perceptions and outcomes that can be measured more objectively. To assess democratic performance using such data, I deploy a few key strategies. First, we need fair comparisons. I try to understand what has been achieved relative to the past (especially as detailed in chapter 4) and compared with other countries that share important similarities (chapters 6–8), especially, but not only, other African and other Upper-middle-income countries. Given South Africa’s political history and using the experiences of many other countries as the basis for expectations, I show that a lot more failure is what we ought to have expected. As a highly unequal society with a harsh history of oppression by a White minority and a long tradition of violence across groups throughout its history, the hard reality is that violence and bloodshed could easily have been the defining features of post-Apartheid South Africa. Indeed, we need to think about the proverbial dogs that didn’t bark to appreciate the history that in fact transpired: genocide akin to Rwanda’s or Yugoslavia’s, economic collapse akin to Venezuela’s, or actual state failure akin to Zimbabwe’s—the latter two countries faced inflation, currency collapse, and food shortages. Second, it is useful to fix some goalposts, lest we create a framework of shifting expectations in which success is not theoretically possible. We can be guided by prior declarations of hopes for a successful democracy, particularly as made by those who enjoyed popular support during periods of political resistance. For example, liberation leaders set forth demands and expectations in the Freedom Charter of 1955 and in the final negotiation for a new democracy, as detailed in the preamble to the 1996 constitution (discussed in chapter 5). Across more than forty years, a key set of hopes remained remarkably consistent, including to develop a democratic and open government, to improve the material quality of life for citizens, and to build unity while redressing past indignities. During these periods, and even earlier in the twentieth century, liberation leaders placed a heavy focus on the protection of basic human rights. Finally, with respect to these various perspectives, we need to consider a diverse range of actors and stakeholders in their lived realities to assess how they have participated in and have been affected by the new political dispensation. In this respect, while I do consider the national picture, I also decided to focus my attention on a single municipality, about which I had no preconceptions of its successes or failures, and which I selected as a plausible reflection of the larger South African story. There is a saying that “all politics is local,” but in South Africa, it might be more apt to argue that “all politics is national,” in the sense that national issues are constantly played out in local arenas, both through centralized political parties that control local government positions and, perhaps more importantly, because the everyday concerns of South Africans frequently relate quite directly to the country’s national history. And this is certainly true in the place I studied, Mogale City Local Municipality. Of course, Mogale’s story, like South Africa’s story, like that of any place, is unique in certain ways. But a focus on this one area—a case within a case—allowed me to dig more deeply into the lives of South Africans, to learn how they relate to one another and why they express the views and take the actions they do. I wanted to hear how people discuss issues, form their attitudes, participate in politics, and simply coexist and to examine the extent to which old patterns have changed or stayed the same, within the confines of a relatively well-bounded geography. Because I was largely unfamiliar with this municipality prior to conducting the research for this book, it allowed me to test ideas that I had generated from observations of other locales in South Africa. And while Mogale City Local Municipality is neither the economic nor the political capital of South Africa, and not even one of the country’s major metropolitan municipalities, its story is both representative of and in some cases surprisingly central to the larger national picture, including in the ways various forms of racial and ethnic conflict played out here, the building of Apartheid, and its eventual fall. Like much of the rest of Africa, South Africa is rapidly urbanizing, and approximately two-thirds of South Africans now live in urban areas. About half of all South Africans reside in midsized local municipalities, ranging from 100,000 to 700,000 people, and Mogale City sits right in the middle of that range. And in recent years, South African politics has become more competitive, particularly in urban areas, a pattern also reflected in Mogale City where in the 2016 local election the ANC lost its competitive edge, slipping below 50 percent of votes cast.29 TABLE 3.1. Racial Demographics 2016, Mogale City and South Africa, Compared Population Group Mogale City Local Municipality Gauteng Province South Africa Black African 76% 80% 81% White 21% 14% 8% Indian or Asian 2% 3% 2% Coloured < 1% 3% 9% Total Population 383,864 13,399,724 55,653,654 Source: SA_CommSurv_2016. My hope was to find a place that might be a plausible microcosm of the larger South African story. And in Mogale City, I found just that: Mogale is ethnically and racially diverse. However, its demographics do not quite reflect the overall national picture. As shown in table 3.1, although the White population is still a minority in Mogale, its population share there is substantially larger, while the Coloured population is substantially smaller (virtually nonexistent), relative to the country as a whole. Much of this disparity owes to the fact that Coloureds live disproportionately in the western part of the country, and Whites are more concentrated in urban areas, especially in Gauteng Province—which contains a quarter of the country’s population and where the racial demographics are much more similar to Mogale’s. What They Got: Dignified Development In the remaining chapters, I will show that the heroic, multigenerational effort to build democracy in South Africa has been extremely successful and delivered important returns to that society. In just twenty-five years, elected, Black-led governments have made remarkable gains in terms of dignified development. That is, citizens have been made more visible and have been increasingly recognized for their equal value as humans through the various institutions of democratic practice, which in modern times have included constitutional commitments to material benefits and respectful treatment for all individuals. Moreover, the logic of political competition has created incentives for elected officials to provide related policies and practices, and this has vastly extended the share of the population living in a manner that could be recognized as a dignified existence. Previously, a majority of the population faced humiliation at the hands of a government controlled by a racial minority.30 Let me be clear that what I mean by democracy is a political system in which all adult citizens can participate in the selection of leaders through elections and enjoy the opportunity to influence how government works by means of representation and civil expressions of their wants and needs. In this sense, democracy is about process. While my central claim is that democracy has favored dignified development in South Africa, I cannot conclude that the routinization of democratic practice is sufficient for this outcome as a general rule. The world is filled with many democratic polities, replete with competitive elections, in which large numbers of citizens feel neither respected nor autonomous. However, a degree of democracy is almost certainly necessary: the sublimation of any real popular choice concerning political leadership or government implies a fundamental lack of respect for citizens’ views and judgments. Relatedly, economic growth is generally neither necessary nor sufficient to experience bouts of dignified development. As we’ve seen in recent years all around the world, the components of economic growth may be unequally distributed in society, offering little for those who face undignified or humiliating treatment; and in fact, if growth exacerbates inequalities, it may have a deleterious effect on dignified treatment. Moreover, redistributive policies and practices in the form of transfers within and across countries may effectively improve the quality of life for many, even in the absence of growth. To be clear, equitable growth can be an engine of dignified development, particularly as people crave jobs, material goods, and the rewards associated with investment. However, if we prioritize a concern for human dignity, the notion that all humans are inherently valuable and deserve respectful treatment, we should not assume that economic growth ought to be the key outcome of interest and that it will naturally benefit the least well-off. While I share the generally optimistic portrait of the value of democracy documented by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their influential work, Why Nations Fail, I soften their focus on material outcomes such as prosperity in order to bring respectful treatment into our field of vision.31 Finally, dignified development is clearly related to broader notions of human development, including health, material well-being, and education. Among others, the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, the acclaimed philosopher Martha Nussbaum, and the United Nations Development Program32 have all described human development in terms of human capabilities, which in turn are critical sources of independence and autonomy. Although these are key components of a dignified life, most research on human development continues to portray citizens as independent and almost atomized individuals. To understand whether people are treated with respect by other citizens and by government, and protected from humiliation, we must also focus on social relations, including patterns of inclusion and exclusion in everyday life. My goal here is not to develop a complete theory of the conditions under which democracy affects dignified development—nor to test such propositions on a global scale—but to focus on this relationship in the particular case of South Africa. In the chapters that follow, I describe the evidence to support this particular claim and conclude by reflecting on whether the pattern might hold in other contexts. I start, in chapter 4, by describing the shaky historical foundations for both democracy and dignified development on the eve of the South African transition in the early 1990s. Subsequent gains should be seen against the remarkable indignities leveled in the prior three centuries of this diverse and divided society. Because it is a human tendency to adjust to current conditions and to recalibrate expectations, it is important to properly set the stage for the democratic era from the perspective of what came before. Next, in chapter 5, I turn to a description of the particular democratic institutions adopted in South Africa in the mid-1990s. Although laws and formal documents do not fully describe democratic practice, they are critical and necessary components and, in many ways, the most transportable aspects of democratic government that can be recommended when needed. By contrast, one cannot will another polity to have a particular set of leaders or mix of civil society organizations, even if those play central roles in democratic success. I am less concerned with the effects of the specific actors at the center of political life than with the processes that have constrained their behaviors. Then, I describe the emergence of dignified development during the post-Apartheid period, and I attempt to show that the very nature of democratic representation—especially South African institutions that are structured on the principle of proportionality—has provided opportunities for people to be heard, to be recognized, and to be valued. Political parties have been forced to seek out the previously marginalized to earn their votes. A protected judiciary has allowed those who have not been treated fairly to seek justice. And the logic of democratic politics has helped to reinforce the notion that citizens are not subjects. In no case is the record in Mogale City or in South Africa writ large an unqualified success. Yet, there is much to celebrate. In chapter 6, I detail the challenges and trends in democratic practice itself. A key goal of generations of political activists and liberation leaders was simply a democratic polity open to all, irrespective of race, gender, or any other category. From this perspective, democracy is not simply a means to an end but an outcome that is intrinsically valued.33 Against tremendous odds, South Africans developed a robust democratic system that in many ways is a model for modern, liberal democratic orders. And despite warnings that the ANC would overtake the country with a one-party state, the system became more competitive. The attempt to build democracy out of division clearly succeeded. Citizens have been able to choose their leaders, to influence policy, and to hold elected officials accountable for poor performance. Although politicians and bureaucrats have inevitably attempted to engage in various corrupt practices, democratic institutions have shined a light on such practices and, at least to a degree, constrained the behaviors of political leaders. In that chapter, I reflect on the contradictions of democratic process and the realities of everyday violence. While democratically elected governments may use violence or threat of violence to maintain order, ultimately, the promise of democracy is that differences of opinion can be resolved through elections, deliberations, court judgments, and other nonviolent means. As I discuss, several scholars studying South Africa and other countries in the Global South have introduced the notion of “violent democracy” to draw our attention to the co-occurrence of the phenomena. While agreeing with the need to keep a careful eye on violent behavior, I view the proposed terminology as a case of modifying the definition of democracy to a point that it sheds its core meaning.34 Instead, I opt to evaluate how the extent and patterns of violence have changed since the advent of multiracial democracy. And if politics gets to the point where citizens are no longer able to make choices or to provide input free from the direct influence of violent pressures, we will have to declare that the country should not be described as a democracy. In chapter 7, I focus on material outcomes. The poorest and most vulnerable have benefited from the provision of basic services and infrastructure, including access to water, electricity, sanitation, and housing, to social support grants, and to improved health care and education. To be certain, expectations have quickly ratcheted up, and citizens have good reason to decry waning quality and to demand universal access, but these cannot minimize the fact that in many areas of social and welfare support, South Africa is a global leader, and democratic practice has underpinned and reinforced these policies. Democratic pressures in the form of elections, the media, and courts have all weighed on elected government officials to deliver, even as they frequently have been tempted to divert material resources toward themselves. In chapter 8, I look more directly at the nature of human interactions. To what extent have citizens and government officials treated one another, especially the most vulnerable, with respect? And how do people perceive such treatment? Apartheid and the centuries of institutionalized White supremacy that came before were examples of harsh indignities, and while related to the other points made in prior chapters, the increased scope of respect extended to people who were so deprived has been a remarkable transformation. As I discuss, one way of creating a sense of shared worth is through the idea of shared belonging, for example, through some degree of unification, such as nation-building. I conclude by returning to the 2019 election—where I left off at the end of chapter 2—assessing the results in light of the findings highlighted in earlier chapters and other cases, including the American record in the aftermath of segregation. Although I am a social scientist, and I marshal various forms of largely descriptive social scientific evidence, the questions posed in this book cannot be answered definitively in the manner that social scientists generally prefer. First, I can only describe plausible links between democratic practice and the key outcomes I describe, but I cannot definitively show that such outcomes would have been different under an alternative political arrangement. Moreover, the question of whether democratic practice, with all its warts and wrinkles, does deliver real value in a divided society is a subjective one, and my goal here is to present what I think is a fair picture for arriving at an answer. In no way can I conclude that democracy will always have salutary effects in South Africa, let alone the same effect in other societies. Others may read the record on dignified development in a different way, and arrive at a different final tally, one that puts more weight on current deficits, especially with respect to unemployment, inequality, and violence. Notwithstanding these important caveats, my own conclusion is that the first quarter century of South African democracy serves as a positive model of what is possible in the future and for other divided societies.",

      "content": "4 Before Democracy SHAKY FOUNDATIONS MILLIONS OF SOUTH AFRICANS could hardly believe what they were hearing on February 2, 1990, when State President F. W. De Klerk announced to a sitting White Parliament in Cape Town, “The time for reconstruction and reconciliation has arrived.” In his epoch-shifting speech, De Klerk spoke of a “new South Africa” and imminent planning for a “realistic and democratic dispensation.” Although he didn’t utter the word Apartheid even once, it was clear that he was delivering the nails in the coffin for this infamous project—the one his own party unleashed on the country more than four decades earlier. De Klerk concluded by promising that Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners would be set free. Just over a week later, on February 11, Mandela appeared in public for the first time in twenty-seven years and addressed the country and the wider world from outside Cape Town City Hall. A full battalion of police, no longer charged with keeping Mandela captive, was now tasked with protecting the still sturdy former boxer, lawyer, and revolutionary icon from the crowds and any would-be attackers. A few weeks of photo opportunities and celebrations followed, many depicting him holding the hand of his wife—a fiery political leader in her own right—Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. A global audience cheered that one of the most unjust systems of rule in modern history was coming to an end. What was less clear was what would come next. I was an undergraduate student at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy at the time. Incidentally, but quite relatedly, I was wholly ignorant of Wilson’s own racist past, a legacy that would lead the university to remove his name from the school more than two decades later. In the winter of 1991, my junior year, I enrolled in a class taught by the former undersecretary of state for Africa, Donald Easum, to study the unfolding political transition in South Africa. We were presented with the incredible opportunity of traveling to the country at the end of the academic year and committed to a two-week study tour. We interviewed stakeholders and leaders from across the political spectrum and eventually published a report based on that research.1 I arranged to stay in the country on my own for an additional month, which proved to be the inspiration for my future career choice. Flying from New York, we transferred in London—American carriers were still not traveling to the country—and had few fellow tourists on the overnight flight to South Africa. It persisted as a pariah state in many ways and the ANC, still a liberation organization and not yet a political party, continued to advocate for economic sanctions against the country. We landed early on a June morning in 1991 at the Johannesburg airport. It was then named for Jan Smuts—a complicated character who was an Afrikaner general, served as prime minister during multiple stints during the first half of the twentieth century, and was instrumental in consolidating White rule,2 while also contributing to the drafting of the International Declaration of Human Rights.3 The energy in the country was exhilarating. Each morning’s newspaper offered the possibility of a shift in momentum. In Johannesburg, I frequently planted myself in the lobby of the Carlton Hotel, which for years had been designated as an “international hotel”—an Apartheid loophole that allowed in guests from different races, making it a cosmopolitan hub. I would secure the right to a lobby table by ordering a Rooibos tea with milk, which I would sip slowly. From that perch, I watched national and international dignitaries, government leaders, executives, and civic luminaries, Black and White, moving swiftly through the corridors from one backroom negotiation to another. Leaders of various organized interests were all jockeying for a seat at the table and for their wants and needs to be met in the new order. On June 16, our group drove up to the First National Bank soccer stadium in Soweto for a commemorative rally. Easum flashed his still valid diplomatic passport, and the guards waved us onto the floor through the VIP entrance. We joined the tens of thousands of screaming and cheering Black ANC supporters in the stands; they had packed the bleachers on this fifteenth anniversary of a famous student-led rebellion to get a glimpse of the legendary freedom fighter himself. When he arrived, again with Winnie at his side, I managed to snap a photo—no selfies back then—from about ten feet away; it was as close to a living legend as I had ever experienced. The stadium was shaking with joy and adulation. This was their messiah and he had finally come to lift them out of the misery of Apartheid. It would be hard to overstate the crowd’s optimism. Millions of South Africans and observers around the world, including me, initially shared that sense of hopefulness for the country’s future. And yet, that sentiment was quickly clouded with anxiety as escalating conflict and violence threatened the prospects for a peaceful regime change. The political transition unfolded in fits and starts, and at times, it seemed that failure—civil war, economic collapse, the rise of a dictator, or even genocide—was as likely as peace and prosperity. Particularly in Johannesburg, I confronted a sense of insecurity that I would not experience in my own country until the September 11 attacks a decade later: We couldn’t enter a major building without going through a metal detector, and the daily news reports recounted bomb blasts and bloody episodes across the country. Even in the speech in which De Klerk promised transformational political reform, he also declared that the government would maintain a state of emergency owing to persistent violence. I was struck by the razor-wire and electric fences that wealthy and not-so-wealthy Whites had built around their homes. More than a year after Mandela’s release, this was not a country at peace. And in localities like Krugersdorp, still very much segregated in practice, the local newspaper was filled with advertisements for handguns and security systems, as well as reports of new consumer boycotts initiated to maintain steady pressure for ongoing political reform. FIGURE 4.1. Michael Goldberg (left) and Evan Lieberman (center) pose with Nelson Mandela (right) in the Johannesburg airport when our flight to Cape Town was delayed on June 20, 1991.

Nonetheless, in order to fully appreciate what transpired during the first quarter century after Apartheid—the subject of all subsequent chapters—it is critical to put into context what was realistically possible and plausible from the vantage point of the BD period. That is, before democracy. And specifically, what were the social, political, and economic conditions leading up to the first multiracial elections? I will not provide a remotely complete account of South Africa’s complex history, including the rise of and resistance to the Apartheid state, in this single chapter. Rather, I describe two sets of critical and related legacies that weighed heavily on South Africa’s future, including in the area that would become Mogale City. The first is the construction of White government—a contested and several-centuries-long process of consolidating political power. There is no doubt that by the second half of the twentieth century, White South Africans had built a relatively strong and effective state, one that for many years promoted rapid economic development. And to a degree, this proved to be a fortuitous inheritance for the democratic era. Yet, it was an undignified development that excluded the Black majority and left indelible memories of poor treatment that would always be fodder for resentment. In creating vast inequalities between groups, it raised the stakes for subsequent political conflict. Moreover, the government deliberately fragmented the society, and political authority itself, leaving little obvious basis for future unification. Second was the resistance movement, which of course was also quite successful in achieving its main goals, culminating in the dismantling of Apartheid. Moreover, many of the organizations and individuals central to the liberation movement led with a human rights orientation that provided a strong moral basis for the democratic order. However, the movement also became violent. Frustrated by the failures of diplomacy, many turned to a strategy that deliberately sought to undermine political order, and did so in ways that would reverberate even once the resistance campaign came to an end. White Government Perhaps it is trite to say this, but it is critical to spotlight a simple reality: the reason most White South Africans did not want to give up White rule is largely because this style of government delivered vast and secure material prosperity to them. When combined with a moral doctrine that justified racial hierarchy, White people could enjoy the good life, and feel good about it. And yet, the development of White South Africa came at the expense of respect for the dignity of Black people, who constituted the overwhelming majority of the population in the region. While the origins of this system can be traced to European theories of racial superiority and the time before Dutch settlers arrived in the mid-seventeenth century, I focus on the development of the area that would eventually become Mogale City. As I mentioned in chapter 1, Afrikaners began to settle in and around the region as part of a mid-nineteenth-century migration from the southwest—the Great Trek. They encountered Black Africans in the area, including some who had been living there for centuries, and others who had arrived more recently, including through violent conquests of their own.4 Possessing greater military might, the Afrikaners quickly became politically dominant. Particularly after the discovery of gold, successive governments created institutions aimed at degrading and dehumanizing those who were not White or “European.” In 1883, Paul Kruger, an avowed Afrikaner nationalist, became president of the Transvaal Republic,5 one of the four White-led governments that would eventually comprise the provinces of the Union of South Africa. Kruger had long professed a deep-seated racism, frequently referring to Black Africans as “savages” who ought to be ruled over with “justice and morality.”6 And this orientation proved highly compatible with the nascent mining economy of the late nineteenth century as companies demanded a steady stream of cheap labor. Kruger did not hesitate to impose new taxes or to facilitate aggressive labor recruiting practices to induce Africans to work the mines.7 The mining companies themselves offered Whites excellent opportunities for advancement, including to supervisory roles, while maintaining poor pay, harsh conditions, and professional stagnation for Blacks. And in 1895, acting on the behest of the mining industry, Kruger’s government introduced a set of laws that required Africans to hold special passes for work authorization or for any form of movement into the Witwatersrand, limiting the influx of Africans from rural areas and granting employers enormous control over their workforces.8 Such pass laws became a cornerstone of institutionalized White supremacy in twentieth-century South Africa. From the start, life in and around Krugersdorp was racially segregated. Blacks recruited to work in the mines lived in compounds or dormitories, or in some cases squatted on White settlements,9 and all were required to shop at “native stores.” While many also participated in the often wild and lawless behavior characteristic of the mining town, they received a different brand of justice for their misdeeds: Black men were routinely apprehended, tried, imprisoned, and hanged for violent behavior, and they faced all-White juries, prosecutors, and judges. White men who committed violence against Blacks tended to be fined rather than imprisoned, and they frequently justified their actions as assaults on “laziness” and “insubordination” among local Africans, which in that context was accepted as a reasonable defense.10 In 1894, a Krugersdorp regulation prohibited Africans from walking on the sidewalks, a response to White complaints of being “jostled” on the pathways; and Whites began to demand separate queues in various public spaces. As early as 1895, White local leaders sought to keep Africans from the town center, especially from the sacred Paardekraal Monument.11 FIGURE 4.2. Map of two Boer republics and two British colonies (c. 1900). FIGURE 4.3.

Today both are protected by electric fencing. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Even amid shared anti-Black racism among European-descended people in southern Africa, there had never been White unity in the region. In fact, during the late nineteenth century, the pressing “race question” was the enduring conflict between the British and Afrikaners. Conflicts erupted over how to govern the highly profitable mining economy, and in 1899, the British Crown went to war with Kruger and the Afrikaner republics. In what initially appeared to be a profound mismatch between a global military power and a small, decentralized guerilla resistance, the Boer War turned out to be a bloody three-year conflagration and severely tested the prowess of the mighty British Empire. Ultimately, the Afrikaners surrendered, but the epic battle ended with Black Africans—not even direct parties to the conflict—losing the most in the peace process. The British had previously appealed to potential Black soldiers that they should serve on their side because a decisive British victory would lead to much better treatment in the future.12 However, hopes for improved conditions were dashed as the 1902 treaty ending the war stated that “the granting of the franchise to the natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.” For a place like Krugersdorp, this meant sustained exclusion, as Blacks had never had the right to vote there and would not get it now. Moreover, the new government enacted a new set of pass laws restricting African movement, and the mines cut African wages.13 Blacks were forbidden from residing in the White town except with special permission and the local government imposed a curfew prohibiting any movement during certain hours.14 It reflected just one of the many ways in which Black adults were treated in a childlike manner. The 1909 South Africa Act establishing the new Union of South Africa largely sealed the fate of Black Africans and other people of color throughout the territory. First, only Whites—constituting less than 22 percent of the population at the time15—would be able to sit in Parliament. Second, in the new provinces constituted by the former Orange Free State, Transvaal, and Natal, only Whites would vote. And third, only in the Cape Province, at least temporarily, Blacks who met stringent qualifications would retain access to the vote, but this right would be short-lived and was removed with the 1936 Native Representation Act.16 Meanwhile, irrespective of race, no women would be allowed the vote, and I am not aware of any evidence that this was raised as a significant political issue. Despite the economic costs of job reservations and residential segregation, the government soon committed itself to the approach. All the local White governments were authorized to do what was already being practiced in Krugersdorp under local laws: control the entry and exit of Black migrants into their towns and require Blacks to live in segregated areas.17 Other legislation codified protections for White labor with reservations for more skilled and better-paying jobs, so they would not face serious threats from an abundant Black African workforce.18 On the gold mines in and near Krugersdorp, where over 42,000 Europeans and over 319,000 people of color were employed in 1945, the wage gap was enormous: Africans working on the Witwatersrand earned approximately 42 pounds per year, while the average annual wage for Europeans was seven to ten times greater.19 During those early years, the government further legislated the “morality” of White supremacy with the 1927 Immorality Act, prohibiting sexual relations between Whites and non-Whites. And yet it was only following the 1948 election of the National Party that the dystopian plan for Apartheid government was realized and the ideology of White supremacy was institutionalized in its most elaborate form. A month before the general election, the party’s leader, Daniel Francois Malan, criticized the ruling United Party government for failing to sufficiently regulate Black movement in the country, especially to the cities; for its neglect of the economy; and for liberal immigration policies—too many Black Africans coming in across the northern border. The “Nats” campaigned on White fears of a “Black peril” and concern for the welfare of poor Whites, a problem that was disproportionately prevalent among Afrikaners.20 Promoting such fear as justification, Malan’s party offered a “solution,” in the form of Apartheid: a series of far-reaching policies and practices that would more definitively realize the goal of a White South Africa. The notorious Apartheid regime has reached such metaphoric status that it remains, even today, a label used beyond South Africa to describe unjust segregation, particularly in a manner that reinforces profound socioeconomic inequality. Within a few years, work, education, housing, landownership, and virtually every sector of society were regulated along racial lines in order to maintain benefits for Whites. The 1950 Population Registration Act required that all adults hold an identity card attesting to their racial classification, which itself would become a virtual internal passport for access to citizenship. In the rare circumstances when people did the same work, Africans earned substantially lower wages compared with Whites.21 Although education had never been truly integrated or equal, the Apartheid architect Hendrik Verwoerd endeavored a more thoroughgoing approach to institutionalize White supremacy. In a speech to Parliament, he targeted not just African students but also their teachers: “The Bantu [African] teacher … must learn not to feel above his community, with a consequent desire to become integrated into the life of the European community.”22 By one estimate, in 1953, the government spent 68 pounds per year to educate White students, 20 pounds for Coloured and Asian students, and just 8 pounds on African students.23 In just about every facet of life, Blacks faced higher costs and tougher constraints, and few earning and other opportunities. They paid higher food prices. They paid sales taxes in White Krugersdorp, which only contributed to the White tax base. They had little access to credit and were highly regulated in their economic activities by the White government.24 And yet, in order to begin to understand how any Black South Africans—particularly in modern Mogale City—could have recalled life under Apartheid government as even minimally acceptable in comparative terms (as discussed in the prior chapter), it is also important to recognize that the White government did provide some basic services. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, like in several urban areas, the government built rows of very small houses, albeit initially without electricity or running water. Eventually, many Kagiso and Munsieville residents would gain access to running water, sewerage and refuse removal, postal services, education, and limited recreational facilities. The government developed an industrial zone on the edge of Kagiso, Chamdor, intended to keep Blacks out of Krugersdorp in line with a strategy of “separate development,” but it also employed thousands of workers.25 Whatever Black development might have occurred during the twentieth century in Munsieville and Kagiso, it was vastly overshadowed by the rapid increases in the quality of life enjoyed by Whites. Successive White governments throughout the twentieth century managed to build a highly effective state, one that helped the private sector prosper, particularly in the extraction of precious metals and minerals. The South African government developed one of the world’s most progressive and efficient tax systems, which in turn contributed to the government’s ability to maintain order, project power, and largely wipe out White poverty—which had been significant in the 1930s.26 GDP growth between 1960 and 1970 ranged from 4 percent to 8 percent,27 faster than that in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, and if the goal was prosperity for Whites, Apartheid was extremely successful. While the British Empire—epitomized by the politician and mining magnate John Cecil Rhodes—had technically won the war to control South Africa’s future, the soul of South African government became fully embodied in the fallen Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger. In 1967, the government treasury minted its first Krugerrand in an effort to market gold—and the country—to the wider world. This one-ounce coin, made almost entirely of pure gold, was a source of value, strength, and history. The front depicted Kruger’s full face and his long, lion-mane of a beard, shaven around the mouth, with no trace of a moustache. And the “rand” refers to the South African currency, which itself was named after the Witwatersrand, where South Africa’s world-class mining industry developed. It is hard to avoid the irony that this man—who sought to insulate himself and his people from the internationalist capitalist project of Rhodes and the British Empire—would adorn this coin, minted in the one true international store of value. The Krugerrand achieved iconic status, at one point accounting for 90 percent of the gold coins in circulation around the world.28 South Africa developed world-class infrastructure, a sophisticated financial sector, and a diversified economy. Throughout the twentieth century, White Krugersdorpers would increasingly enjoy paved streets, lovely houses, and an elected town council. It was not a place for the fabulously wealthy; it wasn’t filled with the famed “Randlord” mansions of Johannesburg’s leafy suburbs. Still, for the sizable White minority, it was comfortable living, largely unlike anything elsewhere on the continent north of the Limpopo River. In its quest to reserve this bounty for Whites, the Apartheid government was wildly ambitious in its social and political engineering. The National Party developed and began to implement what came to be known as “grand Apartheid,” the creation of separate and independent homelands or Bantustans (literally, a home for Bantu people) for distinct Black African groups that, according to the White government, constituted distinct nations. The basic premise was that once a particular language or ethnic group had a corresponding government, individuals from that group would officially become citizens of that new country and be forced to forsake claims on the South African state. The plan did not take into consideration the fact that in many cases, no such “groups” existed in the sense that language was not tantamount to nationhood. Black African social and political organization in no way fit neatly into the categories that the Apartheid government wanted the world to believe existed, let alone was there a match between these language categories and the tracts of land designated as ancestral homes. For the area around Krugersdorp, such a strategy implied that Tswana speakers, who had dominated the area long before Kruger’s arrival, would be assigned to a new country, carved from within South Africa’s borders, called Bophuthatswana. “Bop” was an absurd creation, and its arbitrary boundaries had no historical basis. In fact, because the South African government did not want to upset White property owners, it drew those national boundaries in such a way as to keep those Whites within South Africa. As a result, Bop consisted of nineteen noncontiguous fragments, some separated by hundreds of miles of South African land.29 By decree of the Status of Bophuthatswana Act of 1977, Tswana speakers in the area were overnight made into citizens of a strange new country that would not be recognized by any other state apart from South Africa.30 The South African government did not manage to move most of the tens of thousands of Tswana speakers living around Krugersdorp into this new country, but that was the plan. And it was certainly implemented at least in part, at great financial cost both to the government and to those who were moved: between 1960 and 1980, a total of 3.5 million people were resettled to Bophuthatswana, the Transkei, Ciskei, Venda, and other nascent homelands.31 Although foreign governments did not recognize the homelands as legitimate, these creations still proved consequential for the future in a number of ways. First, the homeland system fragmented the authority of government administration and gave rise to the development of a cadre of government leaders and bureaucrats who would become invested in their new jobs and, in some cases, develop an attachment to their proto-states. In fact, Bop’s president, Lucas Mangope, fiercely resisted the larger political transition and collaborated with White right-wing extremists to try to hang on to power in the early 1990s.32 And perhaps it is only fair to point out that during interviews, a few Mogale residents recalled Bophuthatswana with some fondness, as a place that was reasonably orderly and where education was valued. Of all the former homelands, Bop had the reputation of being the most efficiently administered. FIGURE 4.4. Map of Bophuthatswana “homeland” in South Africa (c. 1980). By creating separate homelands for particular ethnolinguistic groups, the government sowed the seeds of potential Black interethnic division. The noted legal and political scholar Donald Horowitz argued in his forward-looking 1991 book, A Democratic South Africa?, that the homelands reflected one important aspect of a multiply divided society. He concluded that “for the moment, it is obvious that, if attitudes are any guide, a nonracial society is not around the corner. Neither is a nonethnic society.” In turn, with respect to a democratic future, he warned of the “perils of wishful thinking” and the various ethnic and subethnic conflicts that might come to the fore in a post-Apartheid future.33 Resistance: Demands for Dignity and Ungovernability The thoroughgoing and explicitly exclusionary nature of White rule gave rise to one of the most storied resistance movements in modern history. With clear hindsight, we can say that the movement was ultimately successful in bringing decisive change and bestowing an ideologically committed political leadership on the country. The liberation struggle articulated a set of values and demands that would shape many contours of the democratic era and can be used as a benchmark for success even today. Yet, it is also important to recognize that the path to such change was itself divisive and, eventually, deliberately destabilizing. Any examination of life in South Africa in the post-1994 period must appreciate the quality and extent of the dangerous, frequently violent conditions and disruption of political order precipitated by the resistance campaign, all of which were like veritable land mines for future development. Diplomatic and Intellectual Origins Opposition to White rule began peacefully and diplomatically, frequently led by Black intellectuals arguing their case on the basis of appeals to the idea of universal human rights. The first, most concerted challenge to the Union government was ignited in 1912 by the proposal for a Native Lands Act. This policy promised to restrict Black African landownership to about 13 percent of the territory. A group of distraught, Black, mission-educated attorneys and tribal chiefs came together to strategize about how to block this draft bill; and they gave birth to the forerunner to the modern ANC in the form of the South African Native National Congress. The now legendary Black intellectual, journalist, and eventual political mobilizer Solomon (“Sol”) Plaatje wrote of dashed hopes and humiliations in the face of the new Union’s approach to Black Africans. Born in 1876 to Tswana Christians who worked for White missionaries, for many years he had placed his faith in British promises of a more liberal order. Plaatje pleaded, “We have as much right as they to be governed on the same basis of humanity.”34 Plaatje became the first secretary-general of the organization and, as he did in earlier years, took the opportunity to travel to London and to appeal directly to the British, remaining ever hopeful that reason would prevail. He argued his case in the newspaper he edited, Tsala ea Bechuana, and his columns were reprinted in various White newspapers.35 And yet, the writing was soon on the wall that the new South African government would sacrifice prewar promises of racial inclusion for Blacks in favor of White unity.36 Plaatje recalled the “indescribable” disappointment following the passage of the Native Lands Act, which he politely depicted as “full of rude shocks.” He wrote, “Awaking on Friday morning, June 20, 1913 the South African Native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.”37 Notwithstanding such assaults, one of the steadfast contradictions of White rule in South Africa—which Plaatje himself embodied—was the persistence of a few key institutions and opportunities for Black advance that opened space for formulating coherent demands for political freedom. One institution in particular—the University of Fort Hare38—produced an unprecedented legion of visionary Black graduates. Missionaries established the university in 1916 on the site of a former British military stronghold in the eastern part of the Cape Province (today, the Eastern Cape) with just twenty students.39 One of the first African professors to join the faculty from Fort Hare’s earliest days was Davidson Jabavu, the son of a prominent political activist and journalist from Sol Plaatje’s era.40 Jabavu himself studied in London and the United States, including at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, the first institution of African American higher education. His wife, Florence Tandiswa Jabavu (née Makiwane), was a graduate of another noted missionary school, Lovedale College, where she briefly taught, and considered to be an educational equal to her husband, which their community viewed as an important attribute in matches.41 At Fort Hare, Davidson Jabavu wrote about the problems of racial segregation. He and the initially largely White faculty educated a remarkable abundance of South African liberation leaders, albeit with a range of perspectives about how to achieve liberation. These included Sol Plaatje’s cousin Zachariah Keodirelang “ZK” Matthews (an ANC leader and leading academic), Nelson Mandela,42 Robert Sobukwe (who would form the PAC, a breakaway organization from the ANC, one that emphasized “Africanism” over the ANC’s “non-racialism”), and Mangosuthu Buthelezi (who also began his political career with the ANC before founding and leading the IFP). According to Mandela, it was at Fort Hare that he began his lifelong struggle with unjust authority. Despite having initially narrower ambitions of becoming a civil servant and reclaiming his family’s wealth and prestige, political engagement attracted him. For example, as a freshman he organized his fellow “freshers” to challenge a tradition that excluded their participation in community governance. He would only stay for two years, because in refusing to accede to an arranged marriage, he fled to Johannesburg. Nonetheless, at this missionary school he was first introduced to the ANC, the struggle against White supremacy, and his long-time friend and comrade Oliver Tambo.43 The small university’s reach into African liberation politics was astounding. For example, Desmond Tutu served as the school’s Anglican chaplain for a period in the 1960s. And although only approximately 10 percent of the 324 graduates in 1946 were women,44 some, including Vuyiswa “Tiny” Nokwe and Sally Maunye, emerged as dedicated freedom fighters during the decades of political struggle.45 And even far beyond South Africa, Fort Hare educated many of the continent’s liberation leaders. Seretse Khama (first president of Botswana), Julius Nyerere (first president of Tanzania), Kenneth Kaunda (first president of Zambia), Robert Mugabe (long-time president of Zimbabwe), and other prominent future dignitaries were all students there.46 Protest While the ideational foundations for resistance—including calls for greater attention to human dignity—were established during the first half of the twentieth century, the opposition movement gained substantial momentum from the implementation of the Apartheid system. Three key protest events—all of which took place in relative proximity to greater Krugersdorp—proved critical: the launch of the Freedom Charter document at Kliptown, the Sharpeville protest and massacre, and the Soweto uprising. The launch of the Freedom Charter was a peaceful and solidaristic declaration of goals and aspirations for liberation. Z. K. Matthews had proposed in his 1953 presidential address to the ANC’s Cape Province conference that there ought to be a democratic gathering to incorporate ideas about the type of change that was needed in the country.47 Two years later, the call for a “Congress of the People” materialized on June 26, 1955, in Soweto’s Kliptown, about twenty miles south of Krugersdorp. Approximately three thousand Black, White, Coloured, and Indian leaders and delegates from various liberation organizations gathered into a fenced-in open area, marking the most racially representative gathering in the history of the country. They took turns reading aloud the product of those solicitations, which crystallized a shared vision for the future, a demand for dignified treatment, and a fundamental reordering of an increasingly rigid racial hierarchy. The document was written by a small committee, including Matthews and others of various racial identities.48 The charter proposed, as a solution to the problem of racial oppression, a democracy rooted in non-racialism—that is, a universal humanism, rejecting the false biological notion of race.49 This idea, which also appeared in several speeches delivered by ANC leader Albert Luthuli, guided the ANC for decades. And yet, it also proved somewhat controversial because on the one hand, radicals deplored the explicit recognition of “all national groups and races” as being too close to Apartheid thinking,50 while other Black leaders rejected the inclusion of Whites in their resistance, arguing instead for a purely Africanist movement. Nonetheless, the idea of “non-racialism” captured the imagination of millions, remained central to ANC strategy, and won the sympathies of Black and White liberals inside and outside the country. FIGURE 4.5. Proximity of politically relevant sites on the Witwatersrand. The Freedom Charter made several explicit demands: to end segregation and discrimination; for equal rights to the productive resources of the economy and to land; to equal treatment before the law; and to rights to shelter, education, housing, jobs, and health care. These shaped the resistance agenda for decades to come. This impulse to more publicly and forcefully advocate for radical change began to permeate the lives of citizens who resented the system but did not yet fundamentally resist it. It concluded: THESE FREEDOMS WE WILL FIGHT FOR, SIDE BY SIDE, THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES, UNTIL WE HAVE WON OUR LIBERTY As the years dragged on without fundamental change, others who were active in the resistance movement called for more aggressive confrontation, resulting, quite notably, in the pass-burning protest in Sharpeville in 1960. In prior years, the South African government arrested millions of Black people based on invalid or unstamped passes or the failure to carry a pass—what had come to be known among Africans as dompas or “dumb passes.” On March 21, thousands of protesters—organized by Sobukwe’s PAC51—arrived at the Sharpeville police station without their passes, and some brought them simply to overtly destroy or burn them on the police premises. A scuffle prompted a violent police response against an unarmed crowd. Without warning to disperse, police fired hundreds of rounds aimed directly at the people who had gathered to protest. It was an unexpected massacre. Approximately 69 people died and 180 were seriously wounded.52 The massacre marked an entirely new chapter in the resistance movement. The Turn to Violence Even prior to Sharpeville, Nelson Mandela’s political star had been rising, and he increasingly promoted active defiance of the Apartheid regime. Frustrated by the lack of progress, he and others considered the possible need for a violent response. And finally in 1961, in the aftermath of Sharpeville, he joined other key ANC leaders in launching Umkhonto we Sizwe, “Spear of the Nation,” also known as MK, the militant wing of the ANC.53 On December 16, a day notable in various years of Afrikaner nationalist history including the 1838 victory at the battle of Blood River, the 1880 start of the First Boer War, and the opening of the Paardekraal Monument by Paul Kruger in 1891, MK introduced itself to the country with a series of bomb explosions in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and Durban.54 Using homemade bombs, MK soldiers targeted what the famed resistance leader Joe Slovo called “symbols of the economy” like power stations and “symbols of oppression,”55 such as “Bantu Administration” offices. These locations were intentionally targeted while empty, as MK was at this time committed to only sabotage, as opposed to guerilla warfare, terrorism, or revolution, and the only known death that resulted was that of an MK soldier. The MK framed the turn to violence as a response to a “government policy of force, repression and violence,” citing the imposition of martial law and the violence of the Sharpeville Massacre.56 MK followed up with approximately two hundred similar attacks, intended—according to Mandela—to “bring the Government and its supporters to their senses.”57 Sobukwe’s PAC developed its own formidable underground military organization, Poqo, which was particularly strong around Krugersdorp in the Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville. In 1963, four Poqo members were arrested for killing a Black police officer, a charge they denied.58 The “Munsieville Four,” as they were called, were tried and convicted of a politically motivated crime and sentenced to death. They appealed, arguing that they had killed no one and were fighting for land, but the appeal failed.59 The next year, on June 16, they were hanged by the White government, making them martyrs in their community.60 The White government spared no expense to capture MK members. This included increased spending on the police and military as well as expanding tools of control such as bannings and house arrests.61 It extended new powers to its security forces, including the right to detain and hold subjects for “one or more” twelve-day periods, without bringing them before the court.62 In 1963, the Apartheid government’s security forces tracked down and arrested sixteen MK leaders about twenty-five miles east of Krugersdorp who were hiding out in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia. Ten of its leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were tried on a variety of charges, including sabotage and conspiracy, in the Pretoria High Court. From jail, Mandela became a global icon. At times the South African state government managed to convince a few Western leaders that he and the ANC were “terrorists.” But most of the world would recognize them as “freedom fighters,” and their incarceration and banning became lightning rods for opposition to Apartheid. Following Mandela’s arrest, his wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, stepped up her own political activity and leadership, sometimes through violent insurgency.63 With the top ANC leaders all under arrest, the seeds of further Black resistance were more quietly sown in the development of a Black Consciousness movement, one that focused on Black self-reliance and the mental effects of racial domination. Its intellectual founder, Steve Biko—a man frequently likened to and surely influenced by Malcolm X—challenged the multiracial approach of the ANC. And these ideas and the organizations they engendered helped give rise to the ultimately critical political uprisings of the 1970s, including massive labor strikes and the Soweto revolt of 1976.64 Indeed, 1976 was a watershed year in South African political history, one that today connotes a single event: on June 16, thousands of students from Soweto-area high schools participated in what was planned to be a peaceful march and boycott against the indignities of a government decree that Black students learn in Afrikaans. Inculcated in the ideas of Black Consciousness, the student leaders hoped that their defiance would be recognized, and it was, perhaps beyond both their dreams and their nightmares. One Mogale City resident living in Kagiso at the time recalled rising early in the morning to pick up students from various schools, organizing to march with placards in their hands. “We prepared ourselves for tear gas,” which was indeed used against the students. “But then the police started shooting. I remember when the police started shooting. We used the steel lids of the dustbins to protect ourselves.” The students resisted, many by throwing rocks, and the police escalated with live ammunition. The extent of state repression put the country irrevocably on the global map of pariah states. One police station commander, Colonel Johannes Augustinus Kleingeld, later admitted to ordering the use of dog and baton attacks and to personally throwing three canisters of tear gas into the crowd and shooting a machine gun on the first day of the uprising.65 He was eventually absolved of responsibility for killing Hastings Ndlovu, the first casualty of that day, after shooting him at point-blank range. Furthermore, Malcolm Klein, a medical officer from the casualty unit at Baragwanath Hospital, testified that almost all the bullet wounds he attended to were above the belt.66 Police violence continued throughout much of the period of the Soweto uprising. In Alexandra, which experienced the second-highest levels, the local police killed 29 people on June 18 alone.67 Even a government investigation of the events between June 16, 1976, and February 28, 1977, indicated an official death count of 575 across various urban areas throughout the country.68 Of these deaths, at least 23 occurred on the first day and 176 in June 1976. The government’s report noted the police’s widespread use of “dangerous means” to counter protests and riots, including dogs, baton charges, and firearms.69 News of the event spread widely, and the horrific scenes of the confrontation were captured in still and video photography. One image in particular—the limp body of twelve-year-old Hector Pieterson being carried by an older activist—emerged as the iconic symbol of the entire standoff. No Apartheid apologist could deny the obvious: an innocent Black child had been shot dead by the Apartheid police. And although South Africans had just gained access to television earlier that year, broadcasts of government brutality aired overseas. It shook the world and reverberated back in South Africa as White business leaders and diplomats found themselves increasingly condemned and isolated by countries around the world. In the years that followed, protests continued at Black schools. While Black education was already of poor quality, the loss of education for a large share of a generation of students following the 1976 uprising remains a powerful and painful legacy of that time. The government aggressively cracked down on suspected political agitators. Within six months, many Kagiso community leaders disappeared. Six months after that, Rev. Frank Chikane, trying to investigate their whereabouts, found himself under arrest. Chikane had begun a new post ministering in Kagiso just one week before the Soweto uprising started. In the manner of Tutu before him, he became increasingly active in politics. After his arrest, he faced six weeks of interrogation and physical torture, including being forced to stand in one spot for fifty hours, sleep deprivation, and repeated assaults. He noticed that the man supervising his torture was a deacon in the White branch of his Apostolic Faith Church.70 Such cruelty became hallmark Apartheid policy. Famously, in 1977, Steve Biko died from injuries sustained from police brutality under state custody. Chikane managed to survive, despite being instructed by the police that he ought to take his own life. In January 1978, in Krugersdorp court, he was freed when an Afrikaans-speaking judge announced there was no case against him.71 By the 1980s, several strands of the liberation movement committed themselves to making the country ungovernable. Politicized youth, emboldened by the impact of the uprising, continued to mobilize, sometimes in quite destructive ways. For example, in 1984, Tshepo Nzwane—a local councillor I met in Mogale City in 2019—led the Kagiso branch of the Congress of South African Students and, in the tradition of the 1976 youth, repeatedly questioned authority at every turn. His teenage irreverence led him to take an action that he recalled to me with regret. He explained that he was desperate to meet his heroes, including Nelson Mandela, who were serving their prison sentences on Robben Island. He could think of only one way to reach them. I was still at school. But I made a wrong decision. That wrong decision was I bombed a school. I did a petrol bomb. Kagiso high school. The reason I did that, I wanted to be arrested so I could go and see them. To me, it was a big thing, so that I should know what has inspired them. I was advised that it wasn’t charged as being political. It was a public crime … because there’s no political motivation. They beat me. I stayed for three weeks unconscious, and then in the high court I challenged the statement that I was made to sign. Nzwane was just sixteen when he was sent to prison. I was the youngest person in South Africa to stay in detention in solitary confinement for two years. They linked me with a lot of terrorists. They couldn’t trust me because they knew I could mobilize because I used to mobilize people in detention. In 1985, I won the case in July. I was outside the head court and then [subsequently] arrested by someone from the special branch in Krugersdorp … and I was put back … for fourteen days, and then [the] state of emergency was introduced in 1986. Then I was in detention without trial. I would stay up until the end of the state of emergency. I stayed there 85, 86, 87, 88. [In] 89 I was released. Even following De Klerk’s 1990 speech, conflict and violence persisted, including in the area around Krugersdorp. For example, national tensions between ANC and IFP supporters flared up in Kagiso, and deadly fights broke out.72 One of the worst such conflicts occurred in the Swaneville section of Kagiso in May 1991,73 when IFP supporters from one hostel attacked ANC members in their homes with knives, spears, and sticks. As many as fifty were killed in a massacre that was not widely reported at the time. Many others were left disabled, and houses, cars, and personal belongings were destroyed by fire.74 The PAC and ANC also remained mired in conflict. On the one hand, it was philosophical: the ANC “Charterists” subscribed to the non-racialist tenets of the Freedom Charter, while the PAC “Africanists” argued that Black leaders must champion the fight for dignity on their own. Conflicts could also devolve into parochial skirmishes at the local level. PAC leaders accused ANC members in Munsieville of systematically attacking them and driving out seventy of their members. In turn, the ANC accused the PAC of acting in bad faith and jeopardizing unity.75 Much of the anti-Apartheid movement was nonviolent, and I do not discuss here the diverse range of organizations and movements that played critical roles in the larger campaign. Such efforts were highly consequential, in fact sometimes far more central than the violent and exiled segments of the resistance movement, and they laid the foundation for potentially coherent governance during the post-Apartheid era. In particular, the umbrella organizations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), played key roles in mobilizing grassroots organizations and trade unions, respectively.76 Nonetheless, I have highlighted some of the internal divisions and the development of tactics that included promoting ungovernability and violence in order to make clear the extent to which these patterns were becoming ever more deeply rooted in the country, even as Apartheid was crumbling. Existential Crisis and Counterresistance By the late 1980s, South Africa was in a state of existential crisis. The government was under siege within and outside its borders, forced to defend a system decried almost universally as unjust. The South African Defense Force deployed increasing numbers of troops to fight in multiple conflicts in the southern African region, all related to the persistence of Apartheid. Meanwhile ordinary White citizens had grown accustomed to the lifestyles afforded by a century of White government buoyed by a thriving mining industry. South Africa had become the most unequal country on the planet,77 and as Whites sat atop this steep socioeconomic ladder, many desperately wanted to hang on as they began to fear losing it all. In Krugersdorp, the town council tried to placate its White residents by sustaining various segregationist policies that were in retreat in many of the larger cities. For example, in early 1986, the council voted to maintain the local movie theater for “Whites only.”78 And it turned down the library guild’s request to desegregate.79 The best the Krugersdorp public library would offer was a separate location that Indians could use should the need arise. Not all White Krugersdorpers resisted the pressures for change. Many were burdened by the fact that global sympathies were against them. Residents sent letters to the Krugersdorp News about the shame they felt regarding the segregationist policies as change was coming to South Africa. “Why can’t we watch movies together?” One resident highlighted that White and Black futures were intertwined and pleaded that if the policies didn’t change, the town would likely lose their one theater because American film companies were prohibiting the screening of films in segregated theaters.80 Some big businesses appealed to citizens to adapt. For example, Clem Sunter, a “scenario planner” for Anglo-American, one of South Africa’s largest mining houses, wrote a series of books and articles trying to map out the different courses that South Africa might take. In July 1988, he spoke to a packed Krugersdorp Town Hall, describing two possible outcomes, a “high road” and a “low road,” the latter being one of protracted conflict. Sunter asked whether South Africa might become a wasteland, whether the destruction of Beirut might be their future or something that resembled shared prosperity.81 The latter, he said, required compromise and for all actors to move to the “center.” Despite the best efforts of Sunter and others, the compromise-breeds-shared-prosperity thesis did not capture everyone’s imagination. The intransigent spirit of Krugersdorp’s namesake very much lived on among a large number of Whites in the area, particularly in a man by the name of Eugene Terre’blanche, who founded the neo-fascist, Afrikaner nationalist Afrikaner-weerstandsbeweging (AWB) resistance movement in the early 1970s. Terre’blanche was born about eighty miles west of Krugersdorp. His grandfather fought in the Anglo-Boer War, and he served in the South African police force. He was fiercely disillusioned by the partial reforms being undertaken by the National Party, which he took as signs of unnecessary weakness. Like Kruger, he sported a thick beard and cut an imposing figure. In February 1986, Terre’blanche called on AWB branches of the West Rand to form vigilante groups. In November of that year, he held a rally at the Jan Lotz stadium in downtown Krugersdorp. And where the National Party (NP) government had once been viewed as the champion of the Afrikaner, Terre’blanche now said that in its negotiations with the ANC, the NP had become traitorous. To this crowd he proclaimed that “the Government keeps giving to Blacks and the Blacks keep destroying.”82 Terre’blanche’s calls to action quickly translated into bouts of devastating violence: Whites bludgeoned a Kagiso man to death and bodies of Blacks were burned beyond recognition. Terre’blanche had previously been dismissed as a joke—a backward, harmless extremist—but he became very real, arriving with a cavalry and the banner of his AWB, eerily reminiscent of a swastika.83 Terre’blanche’s organization remained outside formal politics, but in 1982, the right wing of the National Party broke off, and its dissidents formed the Conservative Party (CP). As the prospect of the end of Apartheid as they knew it began to come into focus, Terre’blanche and his sympathizers in the Conservative Party began to discuss the idea of an inverted homeland system—one in which Afrikaners would wall themselves into their own Volkstaat.84 In essence, they wanted a return to the Boer republics of the type Paul Kruger had once governed. By 1992, a majority of Whites nationwide said they supported De Klerk’s efforts—a sentiment that the state president elicited by holding an all-White referendum in which two-thirds of voters ticked “yes” next to the question, “Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new Constitution through negotiation?” However, many did so begrudgingly, and a large minority was fully opposed, especially in Krugersdorp. In fact, a week after De Klerk’s speech releasing Mandela, the CP-dominated Krugersdorp council voted to persist with its segregation policies, despite being aware of the economic costs this might impose. It resolved, by a vote of 7–4,85 to keep the library and a health clinic reserved for Whites only.86 Krugersdorp’s local extremists began to use their stage to attract national attention. First, neo-Nazi Terre’blanche rode through Krugersdorp on horseback to remind potential followers and opponents of a powerful legacy of guerilla warfare against British and various Black African groups. Violence followed. In 1993, eight AWB members set up an unauthorized roadblock in Krugersdorp, murdered four Blacks and injured six others, and gruesomely cut off the ear of one of their victims as a trophy that they displayed to their commander.87 Some set their sights on much bigger targets. The most pivotal would be the assassination of fifty-year-old Chris Hani. On April 10, 1993, Janusz Waluś, a far-right Polish immigrant, shot and killed the beloved ANC and MK leader, also an alumnus of Fort Hare. Waluś and a man named Clive Derby-Lewis were imprisoned for his murder. Derby-Lewis was a CP politician from Krugersdorp who had previously expressed his desire to preserve Afrikaner supremacy by declaring support for the forced removal of Black Munsieville residents to make way for the expansion of the White Dan Pienaarville suburb.88 He had even announced he would stand for office in the next election to fill a vacant seat on the Krugersdorp council.89 However, the murder in which he conspired had exactly the opposite effect compared with what he had intended for the future of White South Africa. Nationally, Hani’s death put the country back on the edge of unraveling. Hani had been a revered leader of the liberation movement, particularly among the more radicalized youth, and prior to the unbanning of the ANC frequently trained outside the country as an MK operative. When he returned, he took over the leadership of the South African Communist Party (SACP) and, like Mandela, favored suspension of the armed struggle in order to negotiate peace. After his death, protests erupted and Mandela, still negotiating with the White government, pleaded for calm. But if there was a silver lining to Hani’s tragic death, it was that it hastened the agreement on the timing of the first multiparty election, quickly declared to be in April 1994. Many White Krugersdorpers still wouldn’t relent, and some claimed that Derby-Lewis was “framed” to ensure he didn’t get elected to the council.90 His wife, Gaye, argued against the “tyranny of the ANC” and called for a White resistance movement that would include cutting power and stopping trains.91 But such calls fell on increasingly deaf ears. Derby-Lewis and Waluś were both sentenced to death. (Because the death penalty was abolished in 1995 under ANC government, both sentences were later commuted to life in prison.)92 Predictions and Prognostications By the late 1980s and early 1990s, predictions, opinions, and prognostications for the future of South Africa were conflicted and divided. One thing was certain: no one shared the optimistic euphoria of the wave of African independence from the 1960s. In those days, the promising rise of inspiring nationalist leaders in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, and other countries across the continent along with first elections following the departure of colonizing Europeans were followed by decades of political and economic disarray and the collapse of democratic hopes. And indeed, it was those very failures that the White South African government had long and cynically trumpeted as a raison d’être for their sustained rule: those Black Africans can’t govern themselves, they argued. As balanced pundits noted in the early 1990s, the South Africans certainly had several things on their side. One, ironically, was the cautionary tale of these prior failures.93 They could now more carefully consider the rules of engagement and the possible pitfalls of particular concentrations of power. Few would take for granted that the end of one unjust system would necessarily herald something better. Moreover, South Africa boasted substantial economic resources as an Upper-middle-income country; many sectors of the government functioned well; a strong and vibrant civil society had emerged in the wake of the anti-Apartheid movement; and it had a deep class of liberation leaders, thoughtful and demonstrating strong commitment to broad principles developed over decades of struggle. Along with other speeches and documents, the Freedom Charter made clear a set of goals and aspirations for democracy, dignity, and development. On the other hand, the challenge of managing ethnic and racial diversity in various parts of the world offered discouraging precedents of what could go wrong. For example, the other major political liberalization of the 1990s, which itself contributed to change in South Africa, was the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And as part of that transition, multiethnic Yugoslavia came apart in bloody conflict. Between 1991 and 1995, over 300,000 people were killed in former Yugoslav republics through conventional warfare and deliberate ethnic cleansing.94 The country was eventually divided into ethnically distinct countries, ironically, the very aspiration of the original Apartheid project. In early April 1994, in the small central African country of Rwanda, a horrific tragedy unfolded. In a place that had once been lauded for its developmental prowess, the indignities of a minority having ruled over a majority were settled with ruthless violence. Hutu extremists murdered as many as 800,000 Tutsis in an intense three-month period, and the conflict, born out of decades of violence, displaced at least a million others, making them into refugees in nearby countries.95 Moreover, the United States remained mired in racial conflict. In most states, cities, and neighborhoods, Blacks and Whites lived very much apart, and huge disparities in quality of life persisted on just about every dimension. In 1992, twenty-eight years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, sections of Los Angeles erupted in violent protest after a jury acquitted four White police officers for yet another case of excessive force against an African American man—in this case, a man named Rodney King. Because the incident had been documented on videotape—at a time prior to the ubiquity of cellphone-based cameras—the gulf between crime and lack of punishment for officers was plain for all to see. Dozens were killed and over two thousand injured in the aftermath.96 What kind of shared future could there be in a place like Krugersdorp and its surroundings, where a White local politician had, just one year earlier, been an accomplice in the assassination of a key ANC leader? Where the White council, with popular support, had for so long rejected the idea of even sharing a movie theater, let alone the council chambers, with people of color? Where a very visible White minority lived in nice houses, many with cars and lifestyles familiar to a European town, while the Black majority lived mostly in a mix of very small homes, with few services, many in iron shanties? On just about every dimension, these groups were worlds apart. And the people of this town, let alone the country, were no strangers to violence. In the afterword of his book After Apartheid: The Future of South Africa, penned in the early 1990s, the Economist reporter Sebastian Mallaby captured the sentiment of many observers when he wrote, “It is easy to be glum about the future of South Africa.” Presciently, he pondered, Twenty years from now, today’s pessimism may seem vindicated: if rich America has failed to cure the poverty of the underclass, there seems little chance that South Africa will. And yet there is a danger in despondency, for it may obscure much of what is good. Measured against the high spirits of Nkrumah’s generation, South Africa will indeed fail. Measured against more reasonable yardsticks, there are grounds for hope.97 In the context of the turbulent and frequently violent politics grabbing the headlines, Whites and Blacks living in South Africa proper, and in its nominally independent homelands, began to prepare for the future, however uncertain it seemed. Whites were pessimistic: in 1993, in a national poll, 65 percent predicted they would be “discriminated against” by a non-White government, with less than 20 percent predicting they would be treated fairly. In fact, the majority of Whites surveyed predicted the economy would get worse, that they would become poorer, that there would be more violence, that they would be less secure, that they would be afraid to criticize, and that there would be higher unemployment. In a follow-up survey taken within a year (of a different random sample), the majority of Whites predicted chaos, autocracy, and violence. Unsurprisingly, the majority of Blacks surveyed about their own futures expressed exactly the opposite expectations. About 84 percent predicted that under the future government, they would be treated “fairly.” Moreover, most felt they would be more secure and more free to criticize and believed that the state would be strong. More than four times as many Blacks said they believed they would be richer (44 percent) in the future compared to those who predicted they would be poorer (11 percent). By contrast, 62 percent of Whites felt they would become poorer and just 4 percent imagined they would be richer.98 Black sentiment was almost surely too hopeful and White sentiment too pessimistic. But the future was coming, including to Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, and the farms of Muldersdrift, where Blacks had never known social, political, or economic equality. The formerly powerless were about to see whether power, attained through democratic means, might help them realize the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, of those who burned their passes at Sharpeville, and of the youth who rose up in Soweto, let alone the likes of Nelson Mandela, who continued to echo the sentiments he expressed at the trial that landed him a twenty-seven-year term in prison. The coming election would mark the most profound political watershed on southern African soil since the formation of the Union in 1909, and perhaps even since the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652.",

The final compromise was itself the product of decades of brokered discussions that progressed in fits and starts. For example, Buthelezi tried and failed to forge a workable plan with a White opposition leader as early as 1975. In 1986, two White politicians formed the Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) as a way to connect exiled Black political leaders with potentially reform-minded Afrikaners. A breakthrough came in 1987 with a successful meeting in Dakar, Senegal. However, despite great interest in the proceedings, the White government officially condemned the meeting because it involved direct communication with banned organizations.1 Throughout the 1980s, while still a prisoner of the South African government, and as violent conflict raged on, Mandela met in secret with White political leaders to consider various democratic and power-sharing proposals. Other ANC leaders did the same at venues inside and outside the country. Only after De Klerk’s 1990 speech did political leaders from the National Party, the ANC, and several other organizations, lawyers, foreign governments, and constitutional experts openly engage in wide-ranging discussions. They debated the merits of the very different options for structuring a new government. They did this in closed meetings and in public forums, in newspaper columns, in books, on the radio, and on television. A few principles gained quick assent from those deliberating the new rules of the game: full citizenship would be accorded to all irrespective of race; there would be no more legally segregated areas or amenities; and the next government would undertake ambitious projects to redress the social and economic legacies of the past. And at the center of it all would be a constitutional democracy: choosing leaders through the vote and recognizing a new constitution as the supreme law of the land. That still left quite a bit on the table for deciding how to govern a newly constituted society. Would citizens vote for individuals or for parties? Would power be concentrated or decentralized? How would the chief executive ultimately be selected? What was the vision for the appropriate role of the state in social and economic planning? What role would traditional leaders and former homeland structures play? Even with the best minds in South Africa and around the world trying to steer a mutually acceptable solution, so many obstacles stood in the way. Could you actually reverse engineer the Apartheid system to create a single, democratic polity? Being realistic about all that had happened over the previous several decades let alone the past several centuries, and the depths of divide in the country, success seemed to be a long shot. Even after Mandela’s release and after various political organizations were no longer banned, violent conflicts marred the country, ranging from attacks by the White, right-wing AWB to considerable violence between the ANC and the IFP, let alone sustained conflict in and around the homeland governments. Given skepticism about the prospects for success, many described the attempt to implement a multiracial democracy in this divided society as a “bold experiment.”2 In the remainder of this chapter, I describe the central contours of how this democratic order was established with respect to three key institutions. First, the elections. I explain why the ballots looked the way they did as voters went into their booths—describing the new electoral rules and the particular choices citizens faced. In turn, those rules and choices would channel the “will” of the people into concrete allocations of political power in government. Second, I highlight a few features of the country’s remarkable constitution, including its deep links to the demands of the resistance movement and a strong foundation of protecting human rights. Those principles marked a set of goalposts for evaluating the consequences of democratic practice in the years to come. And third, I describe the plan to reorient the spatial configuration of the country and undo the vision of Apartheid planners. The new local municipality of Mogale City would be established in the context of new provinces and a new local government structure that aspired for integration rather than separation. Finally, I return to Mogale City to consider some of the early challenges associated with implementing this new democracy in practice. In subsequent chapters, I make the link between this brand of South African democracy—the institutions chosen to structure political conflict in this divided society—and patterns of dignified development over the quarter century following the historic April 1994 election. The Election The successful implementation of a first multiracial election was a critical step toward consolidating this new democracy. Tellingly, virtually all of the adult South Africans over the age of thirty-five I surveyed or interviewed myself in 2019 in Krugersdorp, Munsieville, Kagiso, and Muldersdrift could recall with some detail where they were and how they felt as the voting process unfolded between April 26 and 29, 1994. Nomthandazo Sikoto was born in Soweto in 1966 and came to Kagiso in 1987, already a political activist in her early twenties. She woke up on April 27, 1994, at 6 a.m. to join the now iconic winding queues that were photographed at polling stations around the country. She waited until 2 p.m. to finally cast a vote and said that although she hadn’t eaten anything all day, she didn’t feel hungry. It was an emotional day and she gladly participated in the massive celebrations. She would go on to vote in every subsequent election, and when I met her on the eve of the 2019 national election, she told me she had every intention of casting her vote the next day. Juliana Steyn, a White woman whose name and accent revealed her Afrikaans roots, grew up just outside Krugersdorp. Like most young White adults her age, she joined the South African army as she left high school in 1992. And on that election day in 1994, she saluted the about-to-be-old South African flag—which itself depicted the British flag, as well as the flags of Kruger’s South African Republic and the Orange Free State—for a final farewell. Later in the afternoon, she would salute the new, five-color flag with its bold stripes and angles making a sideways Y. As the other White soldiers had been instructed to do, she ran laps until she could properly sing “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika”—a song performed at the South African Native National Congress in 1912 and adopted as the official hymn of the ANC in 1925.3 At least in the near term, “Nkosi” would serve as one of two dual national anthems in the “new” South Africa. Juliana could already sing the other: “Die Stem van Suid-Afrika,” a holdover from the Apartheid past, which would eventually be edited to avoid references to the Great Trek in deference to post-Apartheid sensibilities. Leslie Gama was still four years too young to cast a vote. He had grown up on a few different White-owned family farms but never strayed from Muldersdrift. The area was so-called because of a family by the name of Mulder who settled there in the mid-nineteenth century and the presence of a large drift, or ford, that allowed passage over the Crocodile River. That passage connects Johannesburg to Krugersdorp and onward to the rest of the West Rand. Leslie did what he was told, and that was to remain at home. He was old enough to recognize the enormity of what was about to unfold. The idea of this unprecedented multiracial election filled his head with worst-case scenarios, rendering it the scariest day of his life. Would his parents return home? Would the area be overcome with violence? He had heard nasty rumors that the election itself was just a ploy to round up Black people. These were not simply the imaginations of a child but concerns that were widely shared among adults throughout the area. Leslie would have to wait and see. For Leslie, Juliana, and Nomthandazo, and for just about everyone in and around the still provisional Krugersdorp District, that day held a mix of joy, excitement, and uncertainty. Over 90 percent of the Black respondents and close to 80 percent of the White respondents I surveyed4 around Mogale City in 2019 said that they voted in that 1994 election.5 Not surprisingly, sentiments divided along racial lines. For Blacks, virtually all recalled the day as one filled with euphoria. “I was at home celebrating with my family and I was joyful for a change from the oppressed life I lived before 1994.” “I was in Kagiso happy with the whole community and chanting the struggle songs.” “It felt like God was coming … like the struggle was over.” “I was in Munsieville South—this is not far from where Desmond Tutu grew up—and was happy because everyone was celebrating.” “That day made me happy.” For Whites, many also recalled feeling hopeful, happy, relieved. But others saw only doom ahead. “I was at home and all Whites including me thought the worst is still coming.” “The only thing that comes to my mind was, Black people will fight White people.” “I did not mind that much but was afraid, thinking that Blacks may as well do revenge to us.” “It was a happy and sad mood in our community because of the changes that were going to happen.” One White man from Dan Pienaarville, who was sixteen at the time of the election, was blunt. “I was here in Krugersdorp and wasn’t happy knowing that we will have a Black president.” The election was South Africa’s, but it reverberated far beyond its borders. Given the scope of the anti-Apartheid movement and fascination with the lead actors—the Nobel committee had already jointly awarded its 1993 Peace Prize to De Klerk and Mandela—the day marked a sharp contrast from the images of conflict, protest, and police brutality that for several decades had dominated external views of the country. Ballots: The Rules and the Choices When citizens arrived at their voting stations in Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, Muldersdrift, and throughout the newly constituted republic in April 1994, they immediately experienced the most important new rules of the game. Each voter received two pieces of paper from the temporary electoral commission employees: one marked “RSA” and the other “Prov”—ballots for the respective national and provincial elections. The ballot papers were printed in color, both much longer than they were wide. Each contained the sentence, “Make your mark next to the party you choose,” which was repeated in the ten other official languages, a recognition of the country’s cultural diversity. Below the instructions, the national ballot listed nineteen party names, symbols, and a headshot of each party leader—but not their names. In other words, neither “Nelson” nor “Mandela” appeared anywhere on the page. In this setup, known as a party-list, proportional representation (PR) system, the composition of the Parliament is determined by the share of votes each party receives from the voters. Prior to the election, the parties register ranked lists of their own preferred party members for those positions. Thus if a party is allocated twenty seats after the election results are in, the first twenty names on that party’s list become Members of Parliament (MPs). Each party would develop its own rules and procedures for determining those lists, and not surprisingly, the ANC lists would be replete with liberation heroes. Once seats are allocated, the MPs must vote on who will be the state president in an election determined by a simple majority. The result is generally straightforward if a single party attains more than 50 percent of the seats: the post goes to the person at the top of that party’s list. Failing that, party leaders engage in bargaining to form a coalition, and typically that means that some parties agree to vote for another party’s leader in exchange for some concessions in terms of policies and/or appointments. Once the leader has been elected, they get to make choices about various government appointments. However, even between elections, the leader serves at the pleasure of the Parliament and can be replaced. Such a system has many virtues but also carries certain important risks. First, and most obviously, it affords significant power to parties and weighs against a focus on any single individual. If you are wary of unchecked individuals, this is a good system. However, if you are concerned about the quality or transparency of parties, it might be less preferable. When elections become competitive, the system can incentivize ambitious political leaders to split off to form their own, smaller and smaller parties. This can burden voters with simply too many choices, and parties can tend to become more about individual personalities than about ideas and policy platforms. The design of a PR system is clearly aimed at being more inclusive of a wider variety of perspectives. It allows even relatively small parties to participate in the legislatures, as they can literally get their own seats at the table.6 By comparison, in a typical “two-party” system that tends to emerge with different sets of electoral rules—as in the case of the United States—small parties with a particular focus are almost never officially represented anywhere. In the U.S. system for electing the national legislature, Americans vote for candidates within specific electoral districts, and the individual with the most votes gets the seat reserved for that contest. It is a “winner-take-all” approach, because unless you get the most votes and win the contest, you get zero representation. While representativeness is a virtue, when institutionalized it also implies that more extreme positions will have opportunities to have their voices recognized. Thus, for example, a PR system is more likely to include far-left and far-right parties in the legislature, for better and worse. No solution is perfect. When there is enormous heterogeneity of preferences, and those are reinforced by cultural differences and economic inequalities, no institutional fix can make everyone happy, let alone guarantee shared prosperity. While it is not possible to know for sure how history would have unfolded under different electoral rules, I am largely convinced that proportional representation was the best system for South Africa in order to keep all organized interests vested in democratic politics. Beyond the electoral rules, the logistics of administering the election were daunting. Compared with the previous all-White national election in 1989, in which the government prepared for 5 million eligible voters, at least 22 million were eligible in 1994, and the number of polling stations and polling booths more than tripled. Moreover, the majority of the electorate approached election day without the experience of having voted before, a problem that challenged the electoral commission, which did not have a multiracial voter roll to work with.7 My good friend Michael Goldberg, who had traveled with me to South Africa in 1991, returned to the country after our graduation. (Frankly, I still harbor jealousy about that fact.) He spent the run-up to the election in 1993 conducting voter education workshops for first-time voters. The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and other voter education organizations implemented programs to train community-based Black South Africans to run their own workshops in their own communities. Mundane topics and logistics needed to be addressed to avoid calamity on election day. What type of identification documents would be accepted? Would individuals enter the voting booth alone or with a family member or friend? In many of the rural areas where Goldberg worked, citizens expressed fears that White farmers would intimidate their workers to vote for their preferred candidates. Voter education workshops and materials emphasized “my vote is my secret.” Not surprisingly, many of the faces and symbols printed on the South African ballot in 1994 were those of the leaders and organizations that had been prominent in the political struggles for political change. Although long at odds with much of the rest of the liberation movement, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader at the helm of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), could campaign on some anti-Apartheid credentials. His opportunity to mount a formal campaign was severely truncated by his own decision to boycott the election, one he reversed just a week before it was scheduled to begin. Buthelezi and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, had enjoyed autonomy and a government budget under the Apartheid system. With eight million Zulus in the country, Buthelezi could threaten the stability and legitimacy of the election. In a strange alliance, during the constitutional negotiations process, Buthelezi worked with White separatists and other Black homeland leaders to demand greater provincial autonomy from what would surely be an ANC-run central government. They failed to extract this revision, but perhaps because they did not want to be political outcasts and/or because the ANC promised the maintenance of the monarchy and a royal budget, Buthelezi capitulated. The White Parliament needed to be called back for one last session to amend the interim constitution to allow for this late entry into the electoral contest, but in the end, Buthelezi’s face and party symbol were affixed as a sticker at the bottom of the millions of paper ballots in time for the election.8 And yet, there was no doubt—at least by the time of the election—that the liberation party was the African National Congress, and the photo of Nelson Mandela deserved to be framed on a wall of portraits of other independence leaders, including Ghana’s Nkrumah, Tanzania’s Nyerere, Kenya’s Kenyatta, and others. During Mandela’s time in prison, especially throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, many other individuals and organizations played a critical role in challenging the Apartheid government, including through mass action organized by trade unions and the coalition of civil society organizations embodied in the UDF. The ANC made a formal “tripartite” alliance with the major trade union federation, COSATU, and with the SACP, partners who shared a vision for the future. The arrangement successfully consolidated electoral support as only the ANC would appear on the ballot. In this sense, one of the country’s greatest blessings entering the transition period was that the mantle of leadership for “Black South Africa” had already largely coalesced around Mandela and his ANC. (In 1993, 56 percent of all South Africans and 81 percent of Black Africans said they favored the ANC.)9 The ANC was a diverse organization committed to a pluralist political order. Many Whites, Coloureds, and Indians had actively participated in and sometimes made the ultimate sacrifice for the struggle. And at least initially, the party visibly maintained individuals within its senior ranks from all four Apartheid-recognized race groups. The non-racialism ideals central to the Freedom Charter were routinely on display, especially in the company that Nelson Mandela kept. The 1994 election marked an unprecedented milestone in providing the previously disenfranchised a focal moment in which to make decisions about whom they wanted as leaders. And they were reminded that there was a choice to be made: despite the high legitimacy of Mandela himself and the ANC, nineteen parties were on the first ballot, and many of them enjoyed relatively strong bases of support and were able to compete freely. Amid the profound diversity and inequality of this newly formed polity, millions of people engaged in the exact same process within the period of just a few days: step into a voting booth, mark an X on each of the same two pieces of paper that were distributed throughout the country, and be able to keep their choices secret.10 For the first time ever, Blacks, Whites, Coloureds, Indians, and those not classified under the Apartheid rubric would collectively vote, marking a dramatic new start to what for a very long time would be called the “New South Africa.” And for the first time, being a Black South African citizen was no longer an oxymoron. The Results: ANC Victory, but Not a Supermajority For many expecting the worst, the largely smooth election came as a surprise. As an ANC leader recounted to me: I think with the release of Mandela, the unbanning of political organizations, we then knew that we were going to really have fundamental change in South Africa. So we were preparing ourselves, [but] … just days before the election, people, the whole of South Africa, were really in a tense state. People of all communities, all different walks of life, were really caught up with the fear of the unknown, what will democracy bring? Would it be like some parts of Africa or Europe where things go haywire? And we all caught up the day after elections on that fateful April day. And the sun rose, things were normal, people walked about, and suddenly, it was a huge sigh of relief for all South Africans who have crossed the Rubicon. We’ve done the big change.11 And back in Muldersdrift, Leslie Gama’s parents did come home that day. Despite rumors of a counterrevolutionary force within the military, it did not disrupt the election. For most adults around Krugersdorp and throughout South Africa, fear gave way to excitement. As happened in many new democracies around the world, people proudly displayed the indelible ink marked on their fingers—applied to thwart attempts to vote more than one time. There were a few bouts of violence. And there were some irregularities, including a mismatch between the electoral results in KwaZulu-Natal and preelection opinion polls.12 But none sufficient to impede the consensus that the election was at least “crudely legitimate.”13 Nationwide, approximately 19.5 million votes were cast, and 12.2 million were marked for the African National Congress. By the formulas of the IEC, their 62.7 percent of valid votes counted translated into 252 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly.14 Although the ANC had been widely expected to gain up to 70 percent of the vote, because they received just less than a two-thirds “supermajority,” the party would not be able to unilaterally alter the constitution. This was an outcome that most could live with, and likely a blessing that the party did not come out of the blocks fully dominant. De Klerk’s National Party—the very one that created and later dismantled Apartheid—captured just over 20 percent of the vote, performing well not just among White voters but also among Indian and Coloured voters, the latter being particularly dominant in the Western Cape. After forty years in power, spearheading one of the world’s most reprehensible systems of modern government, but also helping dismantle it, their campaign rehashed old tropes in new clothes. The party’s leaders continued to market the idea of “Black domination” to minority groups who feared retribution in the new order. For example, the National Party had systematically privileged Coloureds over Black Africans during the Apartheid era, and in the Cape, virtually all Coloureds speak Afrikaans. In turn, the NP successfully mobilized this voting bloc around the idea that they were essentially “Brown Afrikaners” and needed to protect themselves from unchecked ANC power. Many listened, and especially in the Western Cape Province, Coloureds overwhelmingly voted for the NP.15 Buthelezi’s IFP was expectedly strong in the Zulu-dominated region of KwaZulu-Natal where many voters viewed the ANC as virtually an enemy, following years of intense ANC-IFP conflict during the transition. The IFP also did well with Zulu-speaking migrant mine workers, including around Krugersdorp. All told, this translated into 10.5 percent of the national vote share. Constand Viljoen, leader of the Freedom Front and successor to the same Conservative Party that controlled the Krugersdorp council at the end of Apartheid, also received over 400,000 votes nationwide. At the time the Freedom Front, promoting a Volkstaat, a separate independent homeland for Afrikaners, gained much of its support from the urban periphery—places like Krugersdorp on the West Rand, where it received almost 6 percent of the vote.16 Nationwide it took in just 2 percent. Despite some strong historical political roots in the country, both the Democratic Party (DP) and the PAC had weak showings; each attracted less than 2 percent of the vote. And on May 9 the Parliament convened, governed by the new Speaker, an Indian woman and human rights lawyer named Frene Ginwala. Their one order of business was to elect the new state president, Nelson Mandela, and they did so without dissent. He and scores of other leaders would depart almost immediately for Pretoria, a two-hour flight away, as the new government adopted many of the old government’s rules and traditions, including keeping the Parliament in Cape Town and the executive government offices in Pretoria, which serves as a second capital city. (The third capital, of the judicial branch, is in Bloemfontein.) This multicitied capital was one of many holdovers from the creation of the Union of South Africa, which itself merged four separate entities. On the following day, May 10, Mandela was inaugurated as the first post-Apartheid president at the age of seventy-five. The ceremony took place at the Union Building, originally completed in 1913 with the two wings meant to symbolize the union of the English and Afrikaner “races.”17 Now, in 1994, South Africa would, once again, mark with an election the unification of people and territory and much greater cultural diversity within its polity. Both within the ruling party and across the parties that had won seats in the new Parliament, citizens of almost any background could find some representative who looked like them and/or represented their interests and values. Very few could have said that they were fully excluded. The day was nothing short of remarkable. At his inauguration, attended by dozens of world leaders, Mandela proclaimed, “Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.… Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.”18 It took a century of struggle, but in the final decade of the twentieth century, demographic reality finally became the basis for political power in South Africa and legalized apartness was over. Indeed, South Africans emerged relatively peacefully through the first election. Mandela, a political activist, and once widely recognized by Whites as a terrorist, was now the shining symbol of the “New South Africa.” The country, and the larger world, could not get enough of him. I also wanted to see for myself. Following my first year of graduate school in June 1995, I traveled with my soon-to-be fiancée, Amy, to Cape Town for a two-week trip to lay eyes on the new version of the country I had last seen under very different circumstances in 1991. As always, it was a painfully long flight from the United States. We stayed in the not-yet-upgraded Breakwater Lodge, on the outskirts of what was still a relatively small waterfront development along the stunning Atlantic seaboard. Sleep-deprived, we were looking forward to getting some rest. Standing in the way were revelers. There was partying in the hotel. Serious partying. And it went on … All. Night. Long. Earlier that day, South Africa had defeated Australia in the first round of the Rugby World Cup, being hosted in the country for the first time, a dividend of huge proportions for the sport-loving White population. Kegs of Castle Lager flowed through the bars, raising the volume into our room each hour. On the bright side, my friend Michael, still working at NDI, had thoughtfully bought us tickets to the next game, which would turn out to be South Africa versus Romania at Newland Stadium in Cape Town. The game itself was fun to watch, but I was not a big rugby fan. Why throw the ball backward? For me, the real spectacle was the fans. Black spectators accustomed to cheering for any team competing against South Africa were now rooting for a group of essentially all-White men, resolved, at least for now, that they were actually on the same side. And watching the massive-bodied White rugby fans do as Juliana Steyn had done, awkwardly mouthing their way through “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika,” and the Black fans willing to reappropriate this team and their symbols as their own—if that wasn’t a spirit of reconciliation, it was hard to imagine what would be. Pessimists became optimists, and of course the fact that the South Africans would eventually win the cup helped generate a collective sense of pride about what had been accomplished as a new nation in relatively short order. And Mandela conspicuously displayed his forbearance toward White South Africa when he opted to don the Springbok jersey—previously a symbol of “White” South Africa—at the final awards ceremony, a moment dramatically captured in the movie Invictus. Constitutional Rights: Foundations for Restoring Dignity The 1994 election was governed by a temporary, interim constitution, and the resulting Parliament immediately acted as a constitutional assembly to produce a permanent replacement. Signed in late 1996, and in effect as of early 1997, that document set a high bar for the types of rights that would be guaranteed to citizens—protections not simply from a potentially intrusive government (as the American constitution emphasized) but from the everyday realities of social and economic despair. It offered a progressive and inclusive vision of what the New South Africa should look like. Jurists and legal scholars around the world have come to regard the South African document as an extraordinary model—the epitome of a modern constitution.19 Much of the content drew quite explicitly on the demands and aspirations of prior generations of the liberation movement. Since its founding, the ANC leadership frequently comprised educated elites who spotlighted the contradiction between the human rights ideal and the reality of how Black people were treated. Sol Plaatje and other attorneys demanded an unbiased judicial system and equal application of the law as early as the first decades of the twentieth century.20 In 1923, the young ANC produced an “African Bill of Rights for South Africa” to remind the country and the world that Black Africans were also human and deserved to be treated in kind. It called for representation, liberty, and the right to property, arguing that African inhabitants of the Union had, “as human beings, the indisputable right to a place of abode in this land of their fathers.”21 In 1943, the organization adopted a document titled Africans’ Claims in South Africa, also known as The Atlantic Charter from the African’s Point of View. It was a response to the Atlantic Charter, advanced by President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which laid the foundation for the formation of the United Nations, and set out a vision for shared global peace and prosperity.22 As stated in the preface of the ANC document, Churchill had intended the charter to apply only to White people. In their documented response, the ANC wanted to make clear that as human beings, Black Africans were entitled to the same. Next, there was the 1955 Freedom Charter, perhaps the most critical document outlining ANC aspirations for a post-Apartheid future. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, this document, the product of months of citizen input, was launched by the Congress of the People at Kliptown, less than fifty kilometers from Krugersdorp. It drew explicitly on the notion of universal entitlement to the protection of human rights. The Freedom Charter took center stage at some of the secret negotiations between exiled Black leaders and White politicians during the late 1980s. And although Nelson Mandela’s landmark three-hour speech delivered in 1964 while a defendant in the Rivonia trial was not an official ANC charter in the manner of the two aforementioned documents, it took on great political weight for its clarity and bravery, contributing to Mandela’s legitimacy as a future leader even as that trial would land him in prison for much of the next three decades. The speech is best known for his final statement in which he proclaimed that for the values and causes he articulated, “I am prepared to die.” Throughout the speech, he reiterated these long-standing human rights demands and expectations. Although the final constitution made no express reference to Apartheid itself, or to any of these key documents that sought to challenge institutionalized White supremacy, even a casual reading reveals very strong links to this history. For example, the preamble of the 1996 constitution states, “We, the people of South Africa, Recognise the injustices of our past.” And like the Freedom Charter, it called for “non-racialism.” And just as the Freedom Charter proclaimed that “the preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime,” so did the constitution: “[Freedom of expression] does not extend to advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.” A set of fairly standard civil and political rights, including freedom of speech, association, and a free press, that appeared in the final constitution were also echoes from the Freedom Charter. Perhaps most remarkable was the extent to which calls for specific social and economic rights, demanded in Africans’ Claims, the Freedom Charter, and “I Am Prepared to Die,” were also enshrined in the highest law of the land. This included access to free education, housing, social security, and health care and freedom from hunger. By making these rights, the South African constitution opened the possibility for lawyers to push for material progress in the courts when offered evidence of gaps and shortfalls. Again reflecting the Freedom Charter, the constitution also emphasized respect for cultural autonomy or group rights by guaranteeing access to education in a choice of one of the eleven official languages. More generally, the constitution reflected the Freedom Charter’s balancing act of advocating “non-racialism” alongside explicit recognition of past racial discrimination and the need for redress. In his “I Am Prepared to Die” speech, Mandela argued that “the lack of human dignity experienced by Africans was the direct result of the policy of White supremacy,” and in turn, the constitution’s Bill of Rights proclaimed, “Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected.” Also revealing is where the documents diverged. Most conspicuously, the constitution did not reflect the aspiration of the Freedom Charter to nationalize the mines, or frankly, to nationalize much of anything. Moreover, the Freedom Charter made very specific demands for “full employment” and a forty-hour work week, which also did not materialize. These exceptions notwithstanding, the human rights values espoused by the ANC and the resistance movements against institutionalized White supremacy were clearly enshrined in the new constitution. In turn, specific directives invited a wide range of political actors to participate in the quest to extend respect for human dignity to all citizens. The Redrawing of Administrative Boundaries The other big question central to the design of democratic government was how to redraw the internal boundaries of the country. After almost a century of intense racial segregation, including forced relocation to several “homeland” governments, a radical reconfiguration was necessary. One option was a centralized approach, more like the French system, which incorporates a high level of uniformity throughout its territory. That might be appealing in terms of its prospects for providing equitable treatment to all South Africans, but it would face the realities of profound disparities in resources and capacities that would make such a system at least initially unworkable. Another option would be to devolve a great deal of decision making and authority to localized governments, as is the case in the United States. By the time of South Africa’s political transition, decentralization and strong local government had become new “international norms.” You want a real democracy? You need to give some power to politicians who live and interact with people in their communities, not in some distant national capital. It was a compelling argument but needed to be implemented in a manner that would be viewed as fair and feasible, not a straightforward task anywhere, let alone in a place with South Africa’s levels of cultural diversity overlaid with inequality. Boundary-making provides almost limitless possibilities for political conflict. Given that South Africans were already highly segregated into racially demarcated neighborhoods and sometimes regions, and that the conditions in White areas were so much better than the rest (and Indian and Coloured areas were also largely better serviced and more prosperous than Black African areas), and assuming that there would be no more forced movement of people—suddenly the stakes of those internal boundaries became quite high. As finalized in the 1996 constitution, South Africa would be a “quasi-federal” polity. The nine new provinces would have substantial discretion in their budgets and in the administration of many policies, but they would not be truly autonomous and would remain almost entirely dependent on the national government for revenue. Reflecting this relationship, elections for provincial legislatures would be jointly coordinated with national elections, all under the auspices of a national electoral commission. Krugersdorp, formerly in the “Transvaal” Province of the old South Africa, as of 1994 would now sit in Gauteng (along with Johannesburg and Pretoria). Cape Town would become the new capital of the Western Cape Province. Durban, the old Natal Province, and the former KwaZulu homeland would become KwaZulu-Natal. In this critical redrawing, the homelands of Apartheid design would be no more. On election day, the borders, laws, and government of Bop, and the three other independent homelands, had no legal basis; Bop’s oddly unconnected territories were integrated into the Northern Cape, Gauteng, and Free State provinces. And similar reconfigurations would occur throughout the country to varying degrees; some provinces would inherit a great deal of former homeland territory, whereas the Western Cape would inherit none. Meanwhile, the hundreds of traditional leaders whose authority was very much vested in the homeland structure would be offered more than a proverbial bone: the government would recognize particular areas as essentially co-governed by such leaders, a government department would be established to provide national-level representation, and the leaders themselves would receive government salaries.23 FIGURE 5.1. South Africa’s post-Apartheid provincial boundaries. Note: What is today Limpopo Province was initially named Northern Transvaal in 1994, and then in 1995, Northern Province; what is today Mpumalanga was initially named Eastern Transvaal in 1994. Particularly contentious was how the boundaries of the more intimate level of local government would be drawn. In this context, the potential gap between promises, expectations, and realities could be seen most visibly for individual citizens. Again, White South Africa had never fully realized its goal of becoming a White country, and as was the case with Krugersdorp, most of the relatively well-off White towns and cities around the country included and/or were surrounded by racially segregated townships. By the 1980s, many of the latter were formally governed by Black Local Authorities (yes, an official term), and unsurprisingly, as these were generally viewed as illegitimate and underresourced, they did not function well. By contrast, the White local governments generally did just fine and expenditures were matched with sufficient tax revenues. The post-Apartheid challenge was to amalgamate these into integrated polities but also to have local government structures. The possibility that decentralization could backfire was not lost on the ANC, whose leaders recognized that devolution was frequently a mechanism to protect the privileges of White people.24 For example, if Krugersdorp would be allowed to remain essentially “as is,” a largely White town with a White tax base, independent and separate from the neighboring Black areas such as Kagiso and Munsieville, then race-based Apartheid could largely survive in practice. Anticipating this possibility, across South Africa’s nine provinces, close to three hundred local governments were either reconfigured or born anew, including a handful of major metropolitan authorities (including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, and today there are a total of eight).25 While many essentially Black-only municipalities would remain, especially in rural, former homeland areas (where virtually no Whites, Coloureds, or Indians reside), this would mark the end of White-only local government, and municipalities in urban areas and on the urban periphery would now be multiracial polities. For the time being, the mosaic of greater Krugersdorp would be known as Krugersdorp District. Although the big prizes for electoral politics were clearly the seats in the national parliament and the state presidency, subnational governments soon emerged as important political arenas, perhaps in large part because this was where the ANC was vulnerable—not always able to attain over 50 percent of the seats needed to control governments. Most prominently, the ANC lost two of nine provinces in that first election: the Western Cape delivered the majority of its votes to the National Party and KwaZulu-Natal to the IFP. As in the national elections, these reflected the fact that race and ethnicity would loom large over voting patterns, and the ANC was defeated in these two provinces because Black Africans were a minority in the Western Cape and because Zulus dominated KwaZulu-Natal. Whatever one might have thought about the merits of these two opposition parties, the fact that they could enjoy visible access to power undoubtedly helped boost their constituents’ confidence in the system. Local Democracy in Practice In Gauteng, South Africa’s industrial heartland, where more than a quarter of the population squeezes into less than 2 percent of the landmass, the ANC was strong in the 1994 contest, certainly strong enough to win, but did not completely dominate as it did in some of the other provinces. It took in 59.1 percent of the votes cast for the national election and 57.6 percent for the provincial legislature. In an important province like Gauteng, the ANC deployed some of its best political talent. Toxyo Sexwale, a man who served time on Robben Island, supported Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness movement, and spent several years in exile, became the first provincial premier. Like Cyril Ramaphosa, Sexwale was immediately viewed as a possible successor to Mandela. By the end of 1994, residents of the newly integrated Krugersdorp District would be led by a trifecta of former political prisoners, because in addition to Mandela as president and Sexwale as provincial premier, in November of that year, a former political detainee, Stephen Motingoa, became the first Black man to be mayor of Krugersdorp. Motingoa was born and raised in Munsieville and in 1986 was detained without trial by the Apartheid government for more than a year. He was subsequently charged with sedition and subversion, but after his release he worked as a union leader and went to London to get a degree in development studies.26 The ceremonial mayoral chain donned by generations of White men would now be worn by a Black man in the town that Pretorius named after Paul Kruger, the site of Paardekraal, a shrine to Afrikanerdom; a town where the British had put Afrikaners in concentration camps and where Whites reconciled their own civil war around the exclusion of Blacks. Like so much in South Africa at the time, the local government was self-consciously provisional—it was called a Transitional Local Council (TLC). As recently as the late 1980s, many White Krugersdorpers would have described the images of a Black mayor and Black president as the coming of the apocalypse. The West Rander newspaper had to concede that the election went smoothly in the area. However, rather than depicting the images of the new Black voters or Black leaders on the cover, the editor chose instead a portrait of the White mayor of nearby Roodepoort, standing in front of the new South African flag, while glumly holding the old one in his hands.27 In my Historical Memories Survey I asked residents to reflect on this “transition period” from 1994 to 1999: “Was it smooth or difficult?” Their recollections were decidedly mixed,28 and again, predictably cleaved along racial and ethnic lines, but also in terms of where they were living. For the most part, Black residents recalled feeling hopeful. One man, in his late twenties at the time, said he “hoped that things would change, that I would have a better life, that the government would provide us with skills to make our lives better, as well as land.” The most frequently used words and phrases that Black residents used to describe this period and their vision of the future included “better,” “optimistic,” “better life,” and “free education.” Particularly for Black Africans in the more urban areas, the memories were largely upbeat: as a Black woman who was fifty-six when Mandela was elected explained, “There was no problem, and we transitioned smoothly.” Another citizen recalled, “It was smooth because houses were built.” But yet another who today lives in the same ward recalls things differently: “I will say it was a tough transition because Whites did not accept the defeat and there were those who still mistreated the Blacks because of that.” Whites in the more urban areas were also largely positive: “It was smooth because we accepted a better chance to live with and among each other, go to school together, have equal job opportunities,” a woman from Dan Pienaarville explained. “During those years, [we] had a smooth transition because we were able to mix with all races and attend church together.” But in the more rural areas—in Muldersdrift, for example, where Leslie Gama stayed home on election day—the recollections were more negative. A Black woman who was twenty in 1999 recounted, “In 1999, it was tough because people were not free to walk in the streets at night, there were people on bikes that were patrolling at night beating people who were walking in the streets.” Many other Black Africans from the area recall being beaten or challenged by Whites during the transition. Political tensions were high, and some Whites chose to display the old flag, a symbol of loyalty to the old regime.29 Many White Krugersdorpers, especially the Afrikaner population, entered the democratic era highly skeptical of the idea of Black government and of the economic redistribution this would inevitably entail. As early as January 1995, just a few months into the new administration, the Krugersdorp News ran a front-page story: “Councillors in the Local Transitional Council Get Paid Handsomely to Do Their Job, or Not To.” The article mentioned the 2.3-million-rand budget for councillor salaries and highlighted, “White ratepayers carry the burden for the expenditures and salaries of the town’s 54 councillors.… According to the town clerk, Koos Richards, no contributions are being received from Kagiso or Munsieville towards these payments.”30 These White South Africans resented the notion of even a transitional period of racially redistributive tax payments toward shared public services. And White councillors frequently complained that the new government, just less than a year old, would soon bankrupt the council. At the most extreme, some still wanted to opt out of the New South Africa altogether. They never gave up on the core ideology that led Paul Kruger’s family to flee the Cape for the Rand. While hundreds of thousands of the country’s wealthier Whites, especially those who spoke English at home, had already departed South Africa for London, New York, Southern California, Sydney, and Perth,31 Krugersdorp was generally not home to such would-be cosmopolitans. Afrikaner-descended families in particular tended not to have social networks or opportunities in Europe or the British commonwealth. As they liked to point out, they are Africans too. In June 1995, a Freedom Front councillor advocated a referendum to include Krugersdorp in the Volkstaat—a proposal Motingoa and others decried.32 That this idea still had traction reflected the degree to which some were resisting the new order. Nonetheless, the Krugersdorp News would soon accept the reality of political change and published a flattering profile of the mayor five months into his term, sharing his personal history and humanizing a Black person in a manner that had been extraordinarily rare in any of the West Rand news outlets. Motingoa humbly refused to make any analogies between his path and Nelson Mandela’s. However, he did attempt to share the new president’s forgiving disposition: “The torture, humiliation and physical injuries left their mark, but I channel my bitterness into working towards peace and reconciliation.”33 Begrudgingly, the News followed up with a headline, “TLC Is Not Too Bad.” The accompanying story highlighted that many residents were happy about the change: “the TLC has made an effort to beautify Munsieville.” Another, from Dan Pienaarville and with an Afrikaans family name, was cautiously skeptical: “We have to wait and see what is going to happen.”34 Until 2000, the local government system remained provisional as details of demarcation of boundaries and assignment of responsibilities were still under review. But that year, Krugersdorp District was formally consecrated as Mogale City Local Municipality. The new council adopted an African name for the entity while maintaining Krugersdorp as the town that would serve as the seat of that government. Mogale was a freedom-fighting chief, the namesake of the Magaliesberg mountains, who suffered various indignities at the hands of Paul Kruger’s relatives and associates in the early part of the nineteenth century.35 The new mosaic epitomized the opportunities and challenges of post-Apartheid South Africa in localized form. And at least initially, in electoral terms, the municipality was a bellwether town. In the 1994 national election, the 81,232 votes cast for the ANC in what was then Krugersdorp District represented 62.6 percent of the vote share36—almost exactly the party’s share of votes nationwide (62.7 percent). In the first official local election in 2000, the ANC received 60 percent of the Mogale City vote, as compared with 65 percent of the vote in local elections throughout the country. FIGURE 5.2.

The new local government institutions added an important wrinkle to democratic practice in South Africa. On the one hand, each local council would function in some ways like the national parliament in the sense that the seats of the council would be allocated via proportional representation, based on voters’ choices for their preferred party. Each municipality would also be subdivided into a series of wards of approximately equal population size, and each voter would cast a ballot for a single ward councillor, some of whom would stand without any party affiliation. In turn, the council would be filled with the ward councillors, and then seats allocated from the various party lists, such that the total number of seats for each party was proportional to the total number of PR votes cast. The ward councillor and committees elected within wards would be citizens’ points of contact to the council. Citizens could also contact “shadow” ward councillors from other parties, as those who had seats from the PR vote would routinely be assigned to wards the party lost in order to stay connected to citizens.37 From “Bold Experiment” to “Miracle” Considering the elections, the new constitution, the reconfigured administrative boundaries, and frankly the new mood in the country, by the late 1990s, the South Africans had clearly overperformed relative to expectations. Observers inside and outside the country routinely described the new democracy as a “miracle.”38 Others called the few years after 1994 a “honeymoon.” In any case, the formal transition from Apartheid to post-Apartheid government was complete. There was no civil war, no massive reprisals, no fundamental challenges to the legitimacy of the new order. Where South Africa had once been banned and sanctioned, now the world was coming in to see this beautiful country and to get a taste of what was going on. In just a few dramatic years, the political landscape of southern Africa was transformed. People around the world, myself included, celebrated the successful transition and the new moral authority the country’s leaders now assumed on the world stage. And it was in this context that Amy and I returned to South Africa in 1997 to live for a year, primarily so that I could carry out research. As part of my preparations, I studied Xhosa—the Black African language spoken most widely in the Cape—and although I never became fluent, I learned to carry on a conversation, and that turned out to be a nice way to break the ice with a lot of people. In the days after we arrived, I learned that the South Africans were as interested in us as we were in them. To be clear, by “us,” I mean they were literally obsessed with Michael Jackson. The arrival of “Jacko,” as they called him, dominated the front pages of newspapers, even amid reports of gangsterism in Cape Town townships and the forging of a new political party by a former homeland leader and a White National Party politician-turned-anti-Apartheid activist. Jackson’s talent for music and performance, and seeming racial ambiguity, piqued interest across the South African color bar. We made arrangements to affiliate ourselves with local institutions. Amy worked at the South African National Gallery and taught art history at the University of Cape Town. I was supported as a Fulbright Fellow, and as part of that process I arranged for an affiliation with the successor organization to IDASA. Now it would be called the Institute for Democracy in South Africa (IDASA). With sizable amounts of foreign funding, it became a think tank and aggregator of civil society organizations, carrying out a range of functions, including voter education, parliamentary monitoring, and budget analysis. Located in a spectacular colonial-era, high-ceilinged building in Cape Town, on 6 Spin Street, just around the corner from the Parliament buildings, several government buildings, and the National Library, it was just about the best spot I could have asked for to witness all that was going on, and I made some lifelong friends who would remain in the field of democratic development (and even read drafts of the manuscript for this book). Outside “experts” were coming through the halls each week, but effectively, those outsiders were learning more than they were teaching—the South Africans were brimming with ideas and high ideals, and I loved coming into the office each day. No one took for granted that in order to build a democracy, citizens needed to learn more about the process and how it would affect them. Government budgets, for example, can be extraordinarily opaque, so members of IDASA’s Budget Information Service would describe the implications of the budget for women or for children in accessible publications and in workshops. Although the organization clearly had great sympathies for the new ANC government, it set up a Parliamentary Monitoring Service to make sure that power was checked and key debates and decisions were shared with citizens. The Public Opinion Service made sure that it was not just government that was carrying out and analyzing surveys and that nationally representative views on key issues could be articulated in representations to government. New policies and practices were sorely needed to realize the ambitions of the new constitution, and creative and energetic South Africans were rising to the occasion to provide these. I sat in on debates in which various political actors engaged in foundational discussions about what a fair and just society ought to look like. My own research was on the tax system, so I attended parliamentary hearings on proposals to revise that system. Tax experts tried to discuss the highly technical topic in politically neutral language, but they could not avoid falling back on fundamental questions. For instance, when it came time to debate taxes on estates—typically a minor source of revenue for the state—a representative of White farmers said that high estate taxes would force many family farmers to sell off large parts of their farms, effectively ending the family business. In turn, an ANC Member of Parliament stood up and asked, “Would that be so bad?” My doctoral advisor, Robert Price,39 introduced me to Andrew Feinstein, a White ANC Member of Parliament, who would become a personal friend while Amy and I lived in Cape Town. Feinstein was just seven years older than me, had been an anti-Apartheid activist, and had spent some time at UC Berkeley, where I was a graduate student at the time. I enjoyed talking with him about shared interests in nation-building and public finance. (And I was particularly excited when he mentioned one of my working papers in a parliamentary debate.) The fact that a White former activist had been chosen by party elites to represent the party in Parliament spoke volumes about the sustained commitment to being racially inclusive. And when I got to know him in 1997–98, Feinstein was pro-ANC all the way. He pointed out that tax policy was becoming a balancing act: initially, Whites had been willing to pay a “transition tax,” but by this point, many of the wealthiest Whites had moved much of their money offshore to avoid taxation and just in case they decided to leave the country altogether. Indeed, quite a few had already left. He shared with me his perception that White South Africans would resist more in the way of taxation, and they were complaining of crime and invoking the “Specter of Zimbabwe,” by speaking of South Africa “going the way of the rest of Africa.”40 Ironically, many of the very countries that had sanctioned South Africa for Apartheid, including the United States, were willing to embrace White South Africans who were taking their skills and resources out of the country, claiming they did not feel safe. With such an escape valve, it would be difficult to engage in too much redistributive policy. During our year in residence, Amy and I happily joined in the sport of Mandela spectating. Where would he be, and could we get a glimpse? We secured tickets to watch him host Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, one of the great African independence leaders, as he addressed the new government in the Parliament building. Nyerere offered an optimistic portrait of Africa’s future and was met with thunderous applause. A personal highlight was the opportunity to stand in the back row of a press conference held jointly with Mandela and President Bill Clinton. As a Fulbright Fellow, I had been invited to tag along with the White House press corps in exchange for my willingness to serve as a tour guide on the bus rides around town, one of which included CNN’s Wolf Blitzer sitting in front and ABC’s Sam Donaldson firing multiple questions at me as he prepared his report. Mandela and Clinton spoke to the world in March 1998 in the gardens of Tuynhuys (pronounced Tane-hace), the Cape Town office of the presidency, used when Parliament is in session. A stunningly clear blue sky hovered above Table Mountain, which itself stands behind, and towers above, the Cape Dutch building. And to our back was the Company’s Garden, created by the very Dutch settlers who had come to these shores in 1652 to cultivate the fruits and vegetables they craved on their transoceanic journeys. We all watched as the leader of the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world was fully eclipsed by the stature of an elder statesman, who deployed grit and forbearance to lead South Africa through a remarkable transition. American presidents were surely used to having their counterparts show deference to them on diplomatic visits, but in this case, the tables were clearly turned. While South Africa was in many ways burdened by its past, the long legacy of resistance also generated a great deal of political capital useful for democratic development. As described earlier, a strong commitment to a rights orientation especially within the ANC provided a coherent framework for creating democratic institutions. A strong “civil society,” the organized and autonomous associations designed to link citizens to the state, similarly proved to be a favorable by-product of a hard-fought resistance. IDASA and others, including women’s organizations and trade unions, had built strong memberships during the anti-Apartheid era and, at least initially, could credibly give voice to citizens’ wants and needs in the post-Apartheid era. Although the Apartheid state had occasionally used emergency powers to suppress journalistic freedoms, a fairly robust, critical media environment had nonetheless flourished. By 1994, a very wide range of newspapers and radio and television stations were already established and offered frequent news updates from a variety of perspectives. Within a few years, internet access expanded throughout the country and along with it, unprecedented access to information. I sent my first wireless email while in South Africa. However, as in countries throughout the world, internet access would be disproportionately available to those in urban areas and to those who could afford it. Moreover, the political resistance to Apartheid produced a number of great legal minds, which helped contribute to the development of a robust and independent judiciary. Mandela appointed Arthur Chaskalson, a member of his defense team at the Rivonia trial (who had formed the Legal Resources Centre [LRC], a human rights law organization), to be the first president of the Constitutional Court. The court would be filled with respected jurists who could make judgments independent of direct political pressures and help legitimate its place in the new democratic constitutional order. In short, the first post-Apartheid elections and Mandela’s presidency exceeded any reasonable expectations for a peaceful transfer of power. However, the successful introduction of new democratic institutions did not imply that a vibrant multiracial democracy had fully taken root and could survive the long winter of political reality. The initial five years were exceptional in many ways, most obviously because Mandela was no ordinary leader. He would be on the short list, and maybe at the top, of any global ranking of most admired and respected individuals of the twentieth century. This meant that during his presidency, he could broker deals between conflicting parties and elicit compromise over conflict. His profound personal history, sacrifices, and acts of forbearance led even his political adversaries to recognize him as verging on “superhuman.” People followed his directives because of who he was and what he had done in his own courageous life.41 While several of Africa’s most promising independence leaders—Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, and Ivory Coast’s Félix Houphouët-Boigny—each stayed in power for more than thirty years, generally to the great detriment of their countries, Mandela’s tenure in government was far shorter. Of course, he was different from these men in all sorts of ways, including the fact that he was much older when he took office. In 1998, during the fifth year of his five-year term, he celebrated his eightieth birthday, and the country began to face the reality of his humanity. The tall, powerful freedom fighter walked with a slower gait and spoke more softly. And that year, he married Graça Machel, herself a teacher, former government minister, and human rights advocate from Mozambique, who was the widow of former Mozambican state president Samora Machel. Mandela said he wanted a bit of time to live out of the everyday spotlight, and he chose not to stay on as state president or as head of the ANC. It is hard to imagine that this period would have been so smooth and peaceful without Mandela’s generous spirit, cloaked in a history of enormous personal sacrifice. Nonetheless, one of the key tenets of democracy is that government should not revolve around a single person. Rather, its institutions are designed with the intention that the people, despite their diversity, can self-govern. The value of introducing this democratic system to South Africa could only be learned over a longer period of time, in the face of new challenges and in the context of very different leaders.",

      "content": "6 Democracy after Mandela A STRESS TEST EVEN DURING THE SURPRISINGLY PEACEFUL and productive first years of the Mandela presidency, not everyone was convinced that South Africa’s future was so bright. A group of prominent South African scholars commissioned a collection of essays investigating how democracy had gone awry in other parts of the world. For example, they wondered if South Africa might soon resemble Mexico, where a liberation party managed to secure political control for over seventy years and engaged in wanton corruption to the detriment of the economy and society.1 After only one election, historians and social scientists were already classifying the ANC as a “dominant party” and suggesting that their own country might be incapable of becoming a liberal democracy. Maybe it was unfair and overly cynical to be worrying about such outcomes this early in the post-Apartheid history. And yet, considering the size of the ANC majority, and the precedents of other liberation leaders and parties becoming autocratic in other parts of the world, it was a plausible concern. If one party got a firm grip on power, would ordinary citizens have any chance of holding politicians accountable? Fast forward to the 2019 election. If I had shared these early predictions with the voters I encountered all around Mogale City, many would have concluded that these skeptics had been soothsayers. During the two decades from the twilight of Mandela’s presidency until the 2019 elections, the once conventional wisdom that the country had emerged as a democratic “miracle” faded into a distant memory. In its place, the airwaves, headlines, and bookstores shared ongoing sagas of government corruption and failed projects. For millions of South African citizens, corruption indeed emerged as the existential problem, and a dominant ANC was to blame. Several important books documented the illicit practices of government officials at all levels with titles such as Licence to Loot, How to Steal a City, and Anatomy of the ANC in Power.2 The latter two describe the precipitous downfall of the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, the metropolitan municipality centered in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape Province. The various authors painted depressing portraits of the undoing of a high-minded, ideologically driven liberation party and the spreading rot of malfeasance in the daily operations of government. It is worth noting, however, that Stephan Hofstatter (author of Licence to Loot) would later be dismissed from the Sunday Times for false reporting and was confronted at a book launch by angry government officials accusing him of misrepresentations.3 Through such books, as well as from print and broadcast news, everyday conversations, and social media, citizens became aware that more than a few politicians were concocting elaborate schemes to divert government resources into their own pockets, while millions of people remained poor, out of work, and without reliable access to basic services. In the weeks and months leading up to the 2019 elections, even ANC supporters and local councillors in Mogale City—including the ANC mayor, Patrick Lipudi—shared with me their awareness of and concerns about the problem of corruption within ANC ranks. The opposition described the ANC as almost uniformly crooked. In 2015, the majority of South Africans said they perceived substantial corruption in all levels of government; over 63 percent said that the level had “increased a lot” in the previous year.4 In fact, when I mentioned to various South Africans in 2019 that I was writing a book about post-Apartheid South Africa, they essentially responded, “Oh, so a book about the corrupt ANC?” Meanwhile, citizens were increasingly resorting to protest in a manner reminiscent of the anti-Apartheid days. Many protests turned destructive and violent, and at least as worrying, on a few occasions, the national government and various local governments used violence against protesting and striking citizens. The prevalence of such well-documented political pathologies begs the question: How could I possibly describe South Africa’s democracy as a “success story” if all of this was going on? It’s a fair question. Democratic practice in Mogale City and throughout South Africa during this period has indeed been uneven, maybe even downright ugly. Many chapters of this history would not find their way into a textbook of civic best practices. Corruption and violence can seem almost routine in some pockets of the country. Nonetheless, democratic politics has operated in a manner that has been increasingly competitive, with substantial opportunities for citizen engagement and oversight from various guardrails within society. Politicians are frequently held accountable for unethical behavior, undesirable policies, or simply being perceived as not doing a good job. While many might have hoped for or even expected a government in which all public servants operated with complete integrity, and that all disputes would be resolved through deliberative debate, such outcomes were highly unlikely given the country’s political history, let alone the record of other countries that have undergone major regime changes like South Africa’s. In fact, many of the wealthiest and oldest democracies still struggle with such problems to varying degrees. This clearly includes the United States, especially of recent vintage. In this chapter, I offer evidence of democratic accountability at work—even in the face of substantial challenges and contradictions—in three steps. First, I review some of the most important ways in which democratic institutions constrained the two longest-serving presidents amid all of their deficiencies. Second, I describe democratic accountability at the local level, especially in Mogale City, again while still acknowledging many of its very real problems. And third, I detail some of the South African patterns of democratic performance and accountability and the extent of corruption and violence in a broader and comparative perspective. To hear South African commentators describe their country’s failures at democratic governance, one might think that theirs was a failed state. In fact, in 2015, more than one-third of surveyed Gauteng residents said it was a failed state.5 But if we consider actual failed states—Somalia, Chad, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, or the Democratic Republic of Congo—we recognize the extent of hyperbole in such assessments of South Africa. The reality of South African government is not nearly so apocalyptic. In many ways, it is highly functional. Constraining Power at the Very Top As I discussed in the prior chapter, of the idiosyncrasies that make South Africa unique, a prominent one is Nelson Mandela. The legendary iconoclast gave South Africa many things, but in becoming president, he did not offer a good test for democracy. Mandela embraced his jailers, repeatedly called for calm and forgiveness over revenge, donned the symbols of oppression in a spirit of reconciliation, and chose to leave office after only one term. He revealed that he was no ordinary politician or person. That South Africa could function effectively with him at the helm left it to the imagination whether it was democracy or his demigod-like stature and self-restraint that ordained such success. Most politicians are instead far more mortal. Almost by definition, they are ambitious and crave power—to a greater extent than the average citizen. Many are very public spirited, but certainly not all, and the pressures and temptations of power can induce greed, unscrupulous efforts to remain in office, and inclinations to favor friends and loyalists for jobs and policies rather than the broader interests of the country. One of the key tests for democratic politics is whether the “people” can constrain such tendencies, especially of those at the pinnacle of power, so that the polity does not become hostage to leaders’ wants and needs or to efforts to divert government resources. After Mandela, the ANC bench was still deep with qualified and impressive possibilities, but this lot was decidedly mortal and offered a solid “stress test” for democratic politics. The office of the presidency alternated to four different men between the time of Mandela’s retirement and the 2019 election. But just two—Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma—led for eighteen of those twenty years. Given their personal biographies, either would have been a viable national leader, irrespective of leadership selection rules. During their tenures in office, national politics was dominated by their deeds, their misdeeds, and their own struggles for power. Mbeki was an ANC stalwart. During the years of struggle, he devoted his life to the organization, joining the youth league at the age of fourteen, working in exile, and receiving military training in the Soviet Union; he was based for many years in Lusaka, Zambia. Moreover, his father, Govan Mbeki, was a politicized Fort Hare graduate, an ANC leader, and jailed with Mandela following the Rivonia trial. Despite membership in the South African Communist Party, Mbeki opposed the ANC becoming a party of socialism, citing a desire to remain a “broad church.” This approach served him well for most of his career, allowing him to become the international face of the ANC and to negotiate effectively with White South Africa.6 His appointment to be Mandela’s deputy president in 1994 put him on a clear path to lead the ANC’s party ticket. Mbeki could seem more professorial than a veteran of a militant liberation movement. Not particularly tall or physically imposing, he wore a beard, spoke in measured paces, and routinely exuded the academic prowess of a man with an advanced degree in economics from Sussex University. He put forward many bold ideas, some productive, including positive visions for African regional integration and upliftment. And yet, like other exiles, especially those involved in the military wing, he had no experience being governed from below. Just prior to becoming state president, one commentator noted Mbeki’s penchant for centralizing power in an essay with the headline, “Mbeki: Democrat or Autocrat?”7 Jacob Zuma was also a former exile from the era of resistance politics. Born in KwaZulu-Natal in 1942, he painted a stark contrast to Mbeki. The son of a policeman and a domestic worker,8 his working-class credentials were a large part of his public appeal: “I never went to school, but I educated myself,”9 he proudly proclaimed. Also not particularly tall, but a sturdier figure, with a clean-shaven face and head, Zuma had been active in the military wing of the ANC, served prison time on Robben Island with Mandela, and also had strong ANC credentials, including working with Mbeki for the cause of liberation. Seen by his comrades as a committed cadre, “fearless, loyal, and affable,”10 he rose in the ranks owing to a strong social IQ and effectiveness as an underground operative. Though visibly proud of his Zulu heritage, he was not a cultural autonomist and stood by the ANC throughout its conflicts with the IFP.11 However, Zuma had few close relationships with White South Africans in the manner that Mbeki or Mandela did. Compared with Mbeki, Zuma exuded more energy and less introspection. He was an antidote to Mbeki’s air of elitism in substance and style. Though he served as deputy president under Mbeki, his ascendancy to the top position was shrouded in some doubt in the midst of not simply ongoing corruption investigations but charges of rape. The latter resulted in a very public trial. Although the court declared that the sex was consensual, during the course of the proceedings, it was revealed that Zuma had had unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman, and he famously declared that it was “ok” because he showered afterward, a statement that even the exonerating judge would condemn for its lack of scientific merit. Notwithstanding such sagas, Zuma was elected ANC president in 2007,12 even as many wondered whether he would be South Africa’s populist autocrat. Both men had great ambitions for themselves, and each tried to subvert democratic procedures in various ways during their respective tenures (1999–2008 and 2009–18). But both were also overtly humbled in their presidential careers through the machinations of direct democratic pressures and internal party struggles for power. The various media outlets challenged each man’s record, and they faced steady and well-organized reactions from civil society; their policies and actions were corrected by the courts; and ultimately their own powers were constrained by their party while the party’s power was constrained by voters at the polls. Violations of Public Trust As I will discuss in the next two chapters, many successful policies were enacted and implemented during Mbeki’s and Zuma’s respective terms. Yet, both men violated the public’s trust on various occasions by hiding or participating in illicit schemes and by making self-serving and counterproductive policies and appointments. One policy episode, for which Mbeki became infamous around the globe, was his heterodox approach to the devastating AIDS pandemic, which had been ravaging southern Africa since the late 1980s. He and his chosen health minister refused to embrace the widely held scientific understanding of the role that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plays in sickness and death. He went so far as to argue that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was not caused by a virus.13 He also rejected the use of scientifically proven anti-retroviral drug therapies, depriving the population of their value for prevention and treatment. Mbeki and his chosen group of advisors came to be known as AIDS denialists. Their approach may have cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people viable opportunities to extend their lives.14 It was a stunning blind spot, and Mbeki was relentlessly stubborn. Owing to these retrograde policies, the South African government, once again, became something of a pariah. I was so struck by the extent to which this problem was spiraling out of control and not receiving the response it deserved that it became the focus of my own research for the next several years.15 A second major scandal involved both Mbeki and Zuma; it came to be known simply as the “Arms Deal.” As early as 1998, while Mandela was still president, the government announced its intention to modernize its defense force and that it would procure billions of dollars in heavy equipment. As a start, the initiative was roundly criticized as inappropriate for a country that faced no apparent defense threats. More notably, the companies that wanted to bid on those contracts and their host governments frequently engaged in various forms of bribery to influence the decision makers to throw the highly lucrative business deals their way. ANC officials accepted luxury cars, money, and other perks. The procurement process was repeatedly found to be irregular in the sense that standards for rating certain bids were changed midstream to favor particular firms.16 Although to my knowledge Mbeki has not been directly implicated in any attempts to gain personally from the deals, he was criticized for blocking open investigations.17 Zuma, on the other hand, has been accused of securing various illegal payments while deputy president and was dismissed by Mbeki for corrupt dealings. In both cases, Mbeki’s wrongdoings were matters of process, of subverting open government and transparency and attempting to centralize power and to protect party insiders while potentially scapegoating political rivals. Zuma, by contrast, sought to enrich himself and his family and friends, taking malfeasance to great new heights. In this regard, his presidency was clearly the blight of the post-Apartheid history. The most egregious of such transactions involved an Indian-born family, the Guptas. The Gupta saga is long and now legendary in South Africa. The family came to South Africa from India in the early 1990s in initially modest fashion. Over the decades, they became so enmeshed in the work of South African government that they gave rise to a term now used frequently in everyday dialogue: “state capture.”18 In their quest for political and economic influence, the family provided jobs to Zuma family members and to those of other politicians. (By one estimate, ANC politicians skimmed tens of billions of dollars from public funds.) They enticed complicity through first-class plane tickets, rides on private planes, jobs, money, and other perks. And in turn, the president and other government leaders gave the Guptas access to lucrative government deals and control over the selection of key government positions. Naturally, their favored selections treated them extremely well in all business dealings, allowing the Guptas to become one of the country’s richest families—in a country where the richest families are very rich, by any standard.19 In sometimes wanton fashion, the Guptas gained access to a military base for a private wedding; they used their influence to attain the post of finance minister for a loyal crony; and they earned millions from shady business deals involving government contracts.20 Relatedly, Zuma and others in the ANC engaged in similar types of dealings with the Krugersdorp-based company Bosasa. The company routinely traded perks and kickbacks in return for government contracts and influence. A whistleblower from the company recounted the ways in which the Bosasa CEO was able to control Zuma’s public statements and actions,21 furthering the notion of a state captured by private interests. Finally, on a much smaller scale in financial terms, but symbolically extremely disquieting for South Africans, Zuma spent approximately 7.8 million rand of public money on upgrades to his personal homestead in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal. These included a swimming pool, a cattle pen, and an amphitheater, amenities that were hidden as expenses under the otherwise allowable rubric of “security upgrades.”22 Responses and Repercussions Together, this set of incursions—Mbeki’s AIDS policies, the arms deal, “Gupta-gate,” Bosasa, and Nkandla—left the ANC’s reputation tarnished when it made its case to the voters in 2019. Along with other inevitable scandals and policy failures, they fed critics daily fodder. What does the fact that such betrayals of the public’s trust could unfold over the first quarter century of post-Apartheid government reflect about the quality of democracy? Here, I think much of the answer lies with how citizens and various actors responded to evidence and allegations. And in this regard, the fact that we know so much about these problems and that government officials have not been able to stem the flow of incriminating information reveals a great deal about the success of South Africa’s democracy. To appreciate the openness, it is important to consider the situation in non-democratic regimes, including Zimbabwe under Mugabe, or in countries such as Bahrain, Qatar, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, where there has been very little space for critics to openly challenge and demand consequences for malfeasance. While citizens in these tightly managed authoritarian countries may perceive corruption or hear about it through rumors, or gain access to some international reporting via the internet or satellite news, the absence of effective opposition parties and the immediate threat of repression have implied a completely different landscape for accountability. In South Africa, citizens and civil society have been emboldened to challenge the state and its various leaders by name. For example, several former anti-Apartheid activists banded together to forge new organizations and movements to speak out against Mbeki’s retrograde AIDS policies. In particular, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC)—led by many former anti-Apartheid activists and exiles—emerged as a global leader in the fight for treatment access. They led marches, held press conferences, and built coalitions to criticize the government’s actions. They developed clever slogans and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase “HIV Positive” in order to counter stigma against the disease. The press relentlessly critiqued government policy while political cartoonists and entertainment personalities routinely mocked officials who persisted in denying the well-accepted science around HIV prevention and AIDS treatment. Medical professionals and social scientists spoke out against the government’s policies, as did leaders of various opposition political parties. If the government was trying to silence or repress any of these actors, they did not do a very good job of it. These organizations won their court cases, and the government obeyed, changing course on its HIV policies.23 Relatedly, throughout the post-Apartheid period, the news media—and as amplified on social media—consistently shined a bright light on allegations and evidence of corruption. In fact, rare has been the day when any major news outlet has not reported on the status of some government corruption allegation or another. In at least one case, the response and resulting impact were almost immediate. When Zuma installed a Gupta ally into the office of the finance minister, the business community and the various news organizations went ballistic, as seen in these headlines: “Firing Nene Proves Jacob Zuma Is the Dolt behind the Bolt,”24 “Finance Minister Switch Seen as Another Zuma Clanger,”25 and “Van Rooyen ‘Bad for ANC in Polls.’ ”26 Within days of the appointment, Zuma faced so much backlash, along with a sharp drop in the markets, that he shuffled the crony to a less central position and appointed the trusted and reliable Pravin Gordhan to the job. This episode also demonstrated the business sector’s autonomy and ability to challenge the government even publicly in the face of poor governance practice.27 That said, like other parties in power, the ANC has frequently sought to keep such information out of the public view and certainly has tried to clamp down on unflattering news. As it turned out, a key whistleblower was Andrew Feinstein, the ANC MP I had met in the first month of my yearlong stay in the country in 1997–98. When Feinstein tried to get to the bottom of the arms deal, he met serious resistance. ANC leaders removed him from the parliamentary public accounts committee.28 The more he pressed, the more he was alienated from the party, and in 2001, he resigned from his beloved ANC. He migrated to London and published a popular book, After the Party, detailing this and other scandals that undermined his confidence in the organization.29 The ANC’s treatment of Feinstein is an obvious blemish on its democratic record. For many, the arms deal was a massive fraud plus cover-up, and critics can point to a weak-toothed commission as having done little to redress the wrongdoing. At the very least, in 2001, the ANC’s Chief Whip, Tony Yengeni, and Zuma’s financial advisor were both sentenced to prison. Even after twenty years, the ANC has not been able to bury the case; public protectors and the media continue to elicit allegations and evidence. A new judge condemned a prior ruling that made light of the case and reopened it for additional scrutiny, a welcome development for many of those who challenged the government in the first place.30 Throughout their tenures, both Mbeki and Zuma faced hard-hitting everyday scrutiny in the news media. In 2004, Archbishop Desmond Tutu began to publicly criticize Mbeki and his administration for bad policies, including on AIDS,31 and for Mbeki’s general failure to encourage open discussion and debate within the ANC.32 Following further public exchanges between them, ANC officials tried to defuse the situation by expressing respect for Tutu’s position.33 Tutu continued to criticize Mbeki throughout the remainder of his term, going so far as to publicly state that neither he nor Zuma would be an appropriate pick for the ANC leadership in 2007.34 By 2008, owing to a wide range of factors, including disappointments about economic policy on the part of trade union and SACP leaders,35 Mbeki lost the support of the ANC and was forced to resign. Two years into Zuma’s presidency, Tutu once again raised his voice as national muse, and again, his challenges were covered widely. He captured the growing frustration with the governing liberation party in a particularly alarming manner when he described it as “worse than the Apartheid government.” He quickly qualified this bold charge with, “because at least you were expecting it from the Apartheid government.” Ever the conscience of the country, Tutu cast his ire on Zuma to a greater degree than he did Mbeki: “Hey Mr. Zuma, you and your government don’t represent me. You represent your own interests … I am warning you out of love. I am warning you like I warned the nationalists [National Party Apartheid government] that one day we will start praying for the defeat of the ANC government. You are disgraceful.”36 Tutu was particularly upset with Zuma’s refusal to grant a visa to Tibet’s Dalai Lama, a move that seemed to reflect greater sympathies for an authoritarian Chinese government than the core human rights values enshrined in the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Relatedly, he was fingering the growing sense that Zuma was inclined to flout the rule of law and needed to be held to account. Widely seen as independent, the courts have even held Zuma personally accountable. He was convicted in the highest court for using state money to upgrade Nkandla. In a unanimous judgment, it ruled, “The President has failed to uphold, defend and respect the constitution as the supreme law of the land.” And indeed, the case came to the court in the first place owing to a March 2014 report of the government public protector.37 The court ordered that he respect the earlier report requiring him to repay the government money.38 And indeed, Zuma eventually did pay, taking out a second mortgage to do so.39 Some might say, not enough punishment for what he did. But it’s important to ask: Where else in the world does a president face such consequences while still in power? By April 2017, protest movements increasingly targeted Zuma directly. A popular hashtag, #ZumaMustFall, circulated widely on social media, and South Africans of every race began to hit the streets insisting that he resign.40 Thousands of South Africans returned to protest following yet another cabinet reshuffle that included the dismissal of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The 2017 protests were organized by Save SA—a collaboration of South African activists41 led by both members of the business community and old ANC stalwarts.42 One protester remarked, “I’m an ANC person but we want our old ANC back.”43 The Gupta-related scandals and the arms deal raised the ire of various government bodies charged with protecting the integrity of the government. The public protector, Thuli Madonsela, forced Zuma to appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate, among other things, his own multiple misdeeds. By the time of the 2019 election, the investigators were hard at work gathering evidence, and in several of my interviews with Mogale City political leaders in the run-up to the election, they had the television on, watching how the inquiry was unfolding and might be reverberating for their own political careers. Electoral Implications Given all of the media attention to the growing level of corruption within the country, the big question that remained was whether the general public—that is, voters—would take action. Again, one of the key features of South Africa’s electoral system is that for most contests, citizens vote for parties, not candidates, which meant that ANC supporters who opposed Zuma could not directly punish him without casting a vote for a less-preferred party. As the 2014 national and provincial election approached, Zuma’s documented bad behavior and various problems in the country amounted to blood in the water for rival political sharks. Political challenges mounted from both the right and the left, from White and Black. Importantly, a generational divide began to split the political arena, as those born in the early 1990s who had never lived under Apartheid—“Born Frees”—were coming of age as voters and as students, and they did not like what they saw. The most significant sources of political opposition during Zuma’s reign were embodied in two men who were both half his age, but in most ways, they could not have been more different. (And both would still be campaigning in 2019, as detailed in chapter 1.) First, there was young Julius Malema, who turned thirty-three prior to the 2014 election and was initially strongly favored by Zuma. The ANC had long recognized the political significance of young people, even before they demonstrated their revolutionary potential in the Soweto uprising. Malema’s supporters could liken him to a radical political leader, like Steve Biko, who on principled grounds challenged the ANC for taking its focus away from the needs of Black people. Alongside his working-class credentials, Malema also received multiple degrees, including in philosophy, and studied for an advanced degree at Wits (the University of the Witwatersrand, pronounced “Vits”), where he helped to politicize fellow students. From scratch, he built a new political party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a self-described “radical and militant economic emancipation movement.”44 Malema keenly used the symbolism of class identity, including the wearing of red hardhats and jumpsuits, to attract a loyal following.45 The EFF has rejected the racially inclusive approach of the ANC, moving from a discourse of “reconciliation” to one of “justice,” and brought ideas like expropriation of land and mines, without compensation, into the mainstream dialogue.46 Second, there was Mmusi Maimane, born in Krugersdorp, raised in the nearby Dobsonville section of Soweto, the product of a Xhosa-Tswana marriage, and ordained as a pastor. In May 2014, Maimane was elected to lead the DA’s parliamentary representation, and in 2015 he defeated Wilmot James (a Coloured academic who had led IDASA while I was an intern there) to become their new leader. For the first time, a Black African took the helm of a party that had previously relied disproportionately on the votes of Whites and Coloureds. It remained to be seen whether the party’s momentum could continue. Both Malema and Maimane relentlessly targeted Zuma for his corruption and bad policies in the run-up to the 2014 national elections. Undoubtedly, many ordinary ANC voters held their noses when they ticked their choices. It did turn out to be the ANC’s worst performance to date. Nonetheless, the party enjoyed a comfortable win with 62.1 percent of all votes. The DA took over 22 percent of the vote, and the EFF, just a year old, earned a remarkable 6.4 percent as third-place finisher, delivering 25 seats to the upstart party, which would afford a prominent and vocal platform for their policies. For now, the ANC and Jacob Zuma were here to stay. However, the everyday problems facing citizens were significant, public sentiment was growing foul, and protests mounted. In 2015, over 60 percent of Gauteng residents said they thought the country was going in the wrong direction.47 And in Parliament in May 2016, Maimane and other opposition party leaders would press and embarrass Zuma in angry exchanges concerning the details of his relationship with the Guptas.48 In this context, in August 2016, South Africans visited the voting booths once again, now to cast ballots to decide local elections. The contest turned out to be a watershed. To begin with, it boasted the highest turnout yet recorded for a local election, alongside an increased voter’s roll from 23 million in 2011 to 26 million in 2016.49 In many parts of the country, that August 3 election was a complete drubbing for the ANC, at least relative to how they had performed in all the previous elections. The party lost political control of several of the largest and most important municipalities, including Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay—the latter centered in Port Elizabeth, a traditional ANC stronghold.50 It still received almost 54 percent of all votes cast nationwide, but that was a huge setback, and the message was clear: the days of ANC “hegemony” were over. Nationwide, the DA increased its take of the vote to 27 percent and despite never having competed in a previous local election, the EFF received over 8 percent. The pushback was a largely urban phenomenon. The ANC failed to secure a majority in five of eight major municipalities (previously it had solidly controlled seven of the eight). This meant it would be in majority power in just three of the biggest cities and in coalition in two others. For South Africa’s increasingly urbanized, cosmopolitan, and multiracial middle class, Zuma was an embarrassment and an affront to the modernizing project they were advancing.51 While Gauteng was installing a high-speed train to move arriving passengers from Oliver Tambo International Airport to Johannesburg and Pretoria, Zuma would be photographed in traditional African regalia. The print media, including foreign media, made reference to his multiple wives,52 a not-so-subtle reminder that he was a traditional polygamist. It’s not as though the ANC lost all their voters in the urban areas. Rather, it was just enough to be consequential for who would govern. And as this was a local election, Zuma was not even on the ballot. To a large degree, all South African elections are referenda on the combined spheres of government and speak to voters’ views of the party in power. The opposition parties persisted in their drive to capture vote share. In August 2017, the DA advanced a motion of “no confidence” in the president, and a secret ballot freed up several ANC members to vote against Zuma in Parliament. This reflected splits within the ANC that had been festering since Mbeki’s presidency, but Zuma’s loss of popular support surely boosted the strength of his ANC rivals. While the motion did not pass, based on the vote count, at least 30 percent of the ANC MPs must have supported it, a telling sign in a country where the ANC had previously maintained strong party discipline.53 When it came time to select the future ANC leadership, the party’s elites had to decide whether to support Zuma’s ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, for more of the same. Zuma was not attempting a play at a third term, but returning another Zuma to the top of the ballot would have spoken volumes about the collective deafness of party insiders to the broader electorate. It was a hard-fought internal battle between rival sections of the ANC. At the December 2017 ANC convention, Ramaphosa—who had been serving as deputy president but in an increasingly strained relationship with Zuma—was selected as the next leader by a slim margin. Under consistent fire, in February 2018, Jacob Zuma finally resigned from office, and Ramaphosa moved into the presidency, turning the page on a dark chapter.54 This is how he became the “incumbent” running in the 2019 election. Closer to the People Analogous questions of politics and accountability have loomed large in local municipalities like Mogale City. By design, local governments were intended to bring democracy “closer to the people” with the notion that citizens would have more direct voice in government, especially through contact with their elected government leaders. As at the national level, several patterns have gnawed at democratic ideals, including the use of violence in politics and a degree of manipulation of political rules toward the end of securing political power. And perhaps quite understandably, these problems have weighed heavily on the attitudes and perceptions of ordinary citizens who are inundated with information about the failings of their government. I wondered whether I would wind up finding a story in Mogale City that was reminiscent of the national scandals documented above or local exposés that have become well-known on South African bookshelves. Yes, there was Bosasa, the Krugersdorp-based company implicated in large-scale national malfeasance. But what about in local government? When I pushed councillors, journalists, and citizens for clear examples of corruption in the form of stealing, they couldn’t come up with any. I didn’t see big luxury cars in the council parking lot, though I was told that at least one councillor maintained an expensive Harley Davidson motorcycle. I heard suspicions of favoritism in the awarding of some local government contracts and read reports of irregularities in processes relative to stated procedures, but I never found any smoking guns in terms of large-scale instances of government fraud. When I pushed for specifics, critics of the local ANC government mostly described bad policies and implementation, inequality, and incompetence. According to the critics, the local government operated with a bloated head count even while being unable to pay certain bulk service providers for the municipality’s access to water or electricity. These are quite fair and important concerns, nothing to celebrate. But this was not massive “state capture” at the local level or an epidemic of greed. Admittedly, the fact that I did not uncover massive fraud in government should not be taken as dispositive. Unlike other academic researchers, journalists, and disillusioned government employees who were embedded in local governments—as was the case in the examples cited above, including those documented in How to Steal a City—I always conducted my research as an outsider, and perhaps potential whistleblowers didn’t trust me to share their stories. Some DA councillors said they were fairly certain that evidence of corruption would eventually rear its head because there were simply too many irregularities in the government accounts to believe otherwise. But speculation is not evidence. Moreover, Mogale has had—at least for certain periods—a comparatively strong record on governance. In a rare nod, the Krugersdorp News reported in 2015, “Auditor General Applauds Mogale City,”55 detailing the fact that the municipality had received a clean audit. The regulator announced, “We are impressed highly by the level of governance in Mogale City and hope that we would be able to learn from the way this municipality has done its work.” And while a skeptic might worry that a government organization is likely to sugarcoat, the Auditor General’s reputation is very strong, and its reports have been generally extremely critical of local governments. In fact, the office titled its 2018–19 report on local government performance “Not Much to Go Around, Yet Not the Right Hands at the Till”; in the introduction it leveled a blanket condemnation of poor financial management for most municipalities.56 Nonetheless, even in that report, the office singled out Mogale City as one of two (out of a total of eight) Gauteng Province municipalities for being proactive and upgrading their financial oversight in line with best practices. Based on these reports, Mogale emerges as one of the better-governed of South Africa’s more than 200 local municipalities, but you would never know it from talking with most residents. In 2017, overwhelmingly, 86 percent of Mogale residents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “Corruption is the main threat to our democracy”—the level of agreement was almost identical to that of residents in all other Gauteng municipalities. Overall, sentiment about the municipality was lukewarm: about 29 percent said they were dissatisfied and another 12 percent very dissatisfied with local government.57 Even the Auditor General’s reports made clear that there was lots of room for improvement, but my larger point is that throughout South Africa, there are important success stories, including in local government, and yet those are rarely acknowledged or internalized. For example, one academic study by South Africa–based scholars simply declared that South African decentralization has failed with almost no recognition of within-country variation, appreciation of constraints, or reference to analogous attempts.58 Bare-Knuckled Competition Especially after 2004, Mogale residents, like millions of citizens across the country, increasingly engaged in some form of protest. (In 2013, just over 2 percent of Mogale residents reported taking part in a protest but that grew to over 8 percent in 2017–18.)59 And like protests in other democracies, these have manifested in a mix of constructive and destructive forms. Sometimes, they offer a unique opportunity for ordinary citizens to have their collective voices heard when it appears that their elected leaders and various elite intermediaries seem oblivious to their wants and needs. Other times, they provide opportunities to play out vendettas, advance agendas for career advancement, and may cause collateral damage in terms of human harm and property destruction. In a 2011 state of the city address, Mogale mayor Koketso Calvin Seerane couldn’t help but recognize that such service delivery protests were an indicator of citizens’ discontent and needed to be addressed by the government.60 Many citizens expected more than they were getting, and many returned to the streets in the manner of protest politics born of the Apartheid days. By the end of the first twenty years of South Africa’s democracy, the country would be forced to embrace the dishonorable label, “The Protest Capital of the World.”61 Concentrated largely in urban areas, in townships like Kagiso and Munsieville, such protests are usually referred to in quotation marks—that is, as “service delivery protests”—because they are largely, but not entirely, and certainly not always, directly motivated by concerns about basic service delivery, in the sense of water, electricity, sanitation, or housing. As they have come to encompass a broader range of demands and grievances, other observers have used the more apt label of community protest.62 For the most part, the protests are directed at local governments. And as several South African analysts note, citizens have used both ballots and “bricks”—a euphemism for the sometimes destructive quality of the protests—to keep politicians on their toes.63 For example, in 2014, unhappy, landless residents from a rural area in the northern part of Mogale City took to the streets and blocked an important thoroughfare, demanding title to land that would allow them to build their own houses. In July 2015, residents of an informal settlement in Muldersdrift, protesting about service delivery issues, burned garbage and blocked a route into Krugersdorp with rocks and trees. They highlighted that they still had just two water taps for almost twelve thousand people and no flush toilets, and that the settlement was on a swamp, which caused beds and personal belongings to frequently get wet. FIGURE 6.1. Informal settlement, Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Such events no doubt contributed to the general sense of citizen dissatisfaction. Alongside news of national scandals, the monumental 2016 local election was held. As happened in several other municipalities, the ANC took a devastating hit in Mogale City. The party fell just short of a majority with 48.9 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, the largely White but increasingly multiracial DA came in a strong second with 34.9 percent. And the EFF took a significant 11.6 percent. And under the PR system, parties with even less support wound up with seats, making them politically important in a close election: the right-wing, largely Afrikaner Freedom Front Plus (FF+)—which took in less than 1 percent of the vote nationally in 2014—got 2.2 percent and 2 seats in Mogale; and the Zulu-based IFP received less than 1 percent of the vote, but it was enough for a single seat on the council. Every seat would matter. With such vote tallies, the ANC wound up just one seat short (38 of 77) of the majority required to vote in its own mayor at the first sitting of the local councillors less than two weeks after the polls closed. A coalition was needed to form a government, and national-level negotiations ultimately determined the political fate of Mogale City: the four opposition parties agreed to band together to kick the ANC out of power. That meant agreeing on who the councillors from these different parties would vote for when asked to select a mayor from among their ranks. Without too much fuss, they cast 39 votes for Lynn Pannall, from the DA, an older White woman with over a decade of experience as a councillor. It’s hard to know who was more shocked: the White Krugersdorpers who watched a Black mayor take charge more than twenty years earlier or these ANC councillors who looked on—“gobsmacked”64—as a White woman became mayor in a municipality that was comprised of more than 75 percent Black voters. Despite the high energy and higher hopes the coalition partners envisioned in their unseating of the ANC, coalition government itself proved extremely difficult, particularly with a bureaucracy now filled with ANC supporters (a reverse of the early post-Apartheid years when ANC political leaders at various levels of government would face seas of Afrikaner bureaucrats). The only thing these parties really shared was a disdain for the ANC. When it came to the priorities of the community, the parties represented distinct constituencies and promoted very different party platforms. For example, the DA was resolutely pro-market, while the EFF called for massive land redistribution. Style-wise, they were oil and water. Less than four months into her mayoral term, Mayor Pannall declared that she was exhausted and in need of medical leave and that she would resign her post just about immediately. (The work of a South African councillor must be one of the most stressful jobs out there; according to my own survey of councillors in 2016, a full 45 percent said they feared violence against them because of their work, a fear that is well-founded given the reality of violence they often face at the hands of rivals and disgruntled constituents.)65 To replace her, the DA put forward Michael Holenstein, a younger, entrepreneurial man, originally from Switzerland. And in short order, he became the second White mayor of the largely Black Mogale City Local Municipality in the post-Apartheid era. Holenstein explained to me that as mayor, he tried to clean house in the administration. Whereas Pannall had indicated a willingness to work with bureaucrats who had long served under the ANC, Holenstein said that he couldn’t get anything done, they were overpaying staff, and there was no clear organization or reporting structures in the administration. He tried to reorganize and to restructure the bureaucracy. Not surprisingly, the ANC did not see Holenstein in a particularly positive light, let alone the fact that they could not stand the notion of being out of power. Holenstein recalled trying to have community meetings and ANC supporters would dance and shout to interrupt him. Within six months, the ANC tabled a motion of no confidence, charging political interference in the administration and that he had put the municipality in a poor financial situation owing to bad policy leadership.66 Theoretically, the DA should have succeeded in rebuffing the motion with a simple majority. Officially, the coalition still stood. But when the ballots were counted, it passed with 39 votes. And when the council voted for mayor—a process that Holenstein decried because contrary to the rules of order, there was a secret vote, and despite being a candidate, the Speaker presided—now the ANC’s Lipudi came out on top.67 Someone—perhaps as many as three councillors—had turned their backs on the coalition. The ANC had clearly persuaded at least one councillor from a rival party to vote for them and insisted on a secret ballot, which would allow the defector to proceed anonymously. When I interviewed them about the unexpected transition, Mayor Lipudi as well as the new Speaker, Noluthando Mangole, recounted the episode in matter-of-fact terms, smiling. There was clearly a part of the story they would not share: how they persuaded a councillor from another party to vote for ANC leaders and who that person was. Mangole said it was justified that the ANC should be in power as they won the most votes: “We don’t have a party that is called coalition in the elections.” Of course, that was beside the point under the prevailing electoral rules for local government. FIGURE 6.2. Mogale City mayor Patrick Lipudi in his office, June 28, 2019. Lipudi passed away from a short illness (details unknown) in January 2020. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The DA was not happy. It implemented a lie detector test within its ranks. One councillor refused to take the test and offered his resignation instead while maintaining that he had not defected in the vote.68 In interviews, several councillors told me they believed the resigning councillor was the defector. They said he was unhappy to not have had a higher position in the local party and had been demoted from the mayoral committee. In turn, at least for a few months, the DA and the other opposition parties played their own game of “make-the-municipality-ungovernable,” and they boycotted the council sitting, making it impossible for the ANC, by council rules, to pass its budget. A DA provincial leader explained, “They have demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to get back into power in Mogale City so they can merely further their corruption. The DA will not stop fighting for the change that the people of Mogale City called for. We, along with our partners, will not simply sit back and let the ANC further plunder municipal resources.”69 The situation got ugly. At the end of August, a raucous council meeting involved a fistfight between EFF supporters and the local security agency sitting in the council gallery, spurned by frustrations around the fragile coalition.70 Meanwhile, street protests and revolts continued. In response, the local government sometimes used force to protect property rights or to quell disobedience.71 In particular, when protests involve squatters or land invasions, the municipality has frequently sent in the Red Ants,72 an infamous private security company that specializes in removing invaders.73 Their tactics remind many of the Apartheid days when the National Party government would infamously bulldoze the homes of Black residents living in White areas, arguing that the dwellings were in contravention of Apartheid law. On the eastern side of Mogale City, a growing informal settlement, adjacent to the thriving and luxurious Cradlestone Mall, stood in the way of further development plans for the owner, ABSA Bank. ABSA coordinated with the municipality to bring in the Red Ants to solve their problem in December 2018. At a cost of over 2 million rand, they moved the squatters to another spot in Muldersdrift, breeding more anger and frustration among residents.74 But Also Accountability In the wake of headline-catching problems and pathologies, the brief democratic history in Mogale—and across many of the urban and near-urban municipalities in South Africa—also reveals some important gains in terms of empowering citizens. Some of this I’ve observed directly, while other gains are only detectable by studying patterns in available data. To begin with, while the 2016 election in Mogale did not bring about lasting change in the composition of government, the hard-fought political battle was certainly evidence of growing electoral competition, which in turn seems to be key for political responsiveness in South Africa and elsewhere. Given the electoral cycle, such that no more than three years goes by without either a local or national/provincial election, there is never a time when a contest is both too far in the future or such a distant memory that any aspiring leader can rest on their laurels. In turn, councillors are well aware that their fortunes can always turn and that they depend on the support of the governed. Politicians say they are compelled to show up in various neighborhoods, to hear complaints, and to respond to them. One could say that talk is cheap, but there is good reason to believe that responsiveness impacts politicians’ careers. For example, Philip Martin, Nina McMurry, and I studied the renominations of elected councillors in Gauteng and around the country and examined whether the leading political parties simply deployed “loyal cadres” to valued local councillor positions or were willing to remove councillors who had lost the faith of citizens. Analyzing the career trajectories of over eight thousand councillors, we found that in areas where political competition was high, the leading parties (the ANC and the DA) were much more likely to end the careers of those who had failed to satisfy their constituents (as measured by responses to surveys). Those who were well regarded by citizens tended to be renominated or promoted. By contrast, in noncompetitive areas, party choices appeared uncorrelated with what citizens said about the quality of services or their own councillor.75 And while citizens may be angered by a lot of what they see, they are nonetheless extremely engaged not simply via protest but in the very institutions designed to channel links between voters and their representatives. In my Historical Memories Survey of Mogale residents who would have been eligible to vote in 1994, almost all Black residents reported having voted in all 5 national elections (average of 4.9 elections) including the 2014 election. For Whites, the average is somewhat lower at 4.7 (although a small share of the sample, those who didn’t vote in 1994, reported having voted much less frequently than those who did).76 Moreover, 41 percent of Mogale residents said they had participated in ward meetings and 41 percent in street committee or residents’ meetings, all of which reflect very high levels of community engagement.77 Despite the common refrain I heard that there is no effective opposition in South Africa, I found several instances of individuals and parties holding the government to account. For example, when I met with Juliana Steyn—the Afrikaner soldier who had to sing “Nkosi” the day of the first election and who in 2019 worked for a government agency—she explained to me that when the opposition parties ask questions in national parliament on designated days, people like her are forced to respond quickly with data and analysis so the relevant government official can provide coherent and factual responses. Such “fire drills” may distract employees from their immediate work, but they also serve an important accountability mechanism given a general fear of embarrassment at all levels. When I visited Mogale local council meetings I repeatedly saw that opposition questions and challenges were often met with resentful glares and words from ANC officeholders, but nonetheless, the engagement provoked research and responses. Relatedly, the Krugersdorp News publishes stories and pointed letters, which are read by many of the municipality’s top political leaders and, in turn, they frequently feel compelled to reply and to defend their positions. Indeed, several said as much to me. Moreover, White Krugersdorpers have largely chosen to engage the democratic system rather than exit it altogether, as one might have predicted in the early 1990s. Even the cultural autonomists in the FF+ who remain very interested in the prospects of developing a separate homeland, or Volkstaat, actively participate in local politics: Whites have found representation in political parties, campaigned, held office, and channeled their frustrations with ballots, not the bullets some extremists had threatened to use prior to Mandela’s inauguration. Perhaps this is not surprising, as Whites do still overwhelmingly constitute the local tax base, and they want to have some oversight regarding how money is spent. Yet, their willingness to scrutinize budgets and to highlight inconsistencies almost surely keeps government officials on their toes in a way that would not be true in their absence. It is also worth highlighting the challenging and important role that ward councillors play, especially in lower-income neighborhoods and townships. These are South Africa’s only directly elected leaders, and for many, this is a tough job. Each councillor represents a constituency of about ten thousand people, and their home address and mobile phone number are known to all. And their phone must be switched on for most of the day. They are regularly called on by their constituents for every type of problem, sometimes way beyond the scope of their legal mandates—including marital and neighborly disputes. I interviewed several ward councillors in Mogale City, and dozens around the country, and many proudly showed me their extensive WhatsApp chats, containing endlessly long back-and-forths with constituents, replete with lists of questions and needs and the responses they provided. Particularly for Black constituents whose families did not benefit from generations of obtaining access to government services, councillors serve as important intermediaries in helping them attain basic documents like proof of residence or ensuring that an ambulance arrives when they need medical care. Ward councillors vary widely in terms of their efforts and how they are received by their communities. But the logic of electoral competition in competitive wards incentivizes responsiveness toward these needs as such outreach seems to affect citizen perceptions and, in turn, party and voter decisions about whether to keep incumbents in place.78 And because these councillors generally live within the communities they serve, citizens hold them accountable through everyday interactions, what one scholar aptly labeled, in a different context, “dignified public expression.”79 Of course, not all are successful—many are downright derelict in their duties—but for those regarded as effective, citizens report that the key traits are demonstration of efforts to attain access to public services and simply being available to listen to their needs.80 Tshepo Nzwane—who came to be a local councillor after a childhood in which he bombed the local school—said that one hundred to two hundred people show up at each of his community meetings. For millions of people who never had a say in government, their votes and opinions are very meaningful with respect to whether that individual keeps their job, and they have the opportunity to inform and be informed by that representative on a regular basis. Much of this is the mundane stuff of everyday democratic government. Still, this is what past generations understandably wished for. Comparative Perspectives: From Laggard to Leader Democratic “success” is a matter of perspective and requires a field of vision that spans both time and space. The notion that South Africa became a relatively robust liberal democracy during the post-Apartheid era might be difficult to see when buried beneath many quotidian realities. As such, it’s important to consider some of the failures and accomplishments in governance in a more comparative perspective. First let’s consider the worries that a single party, the ANC, would dominate politics so thoroughly that South Africa would become like the Mexican one-party state under the PRI. In practice, between 1994 and 2016, citizens went to the polls five times to vote in national and provincial elections, and five additional times for local government elections. The elections have been certified time and again without major instances of vote rigging, ballot-box stuffing, voter intimidation, or the like. Looking back now, we know that South Africa did not become a one-party state. It is true that, as shown in figure 6.3, the ANC received the majority of all votes cast in every electoral contest, and gains in 1999 and 2004 contributed to a sense at the time that South Africa was well on its way to single-party domination.81 But the trends have not moved toward a monopolization of political power. In fact, just the opposite has happened. By the time of the 2019 election, an ANC victory was clearly not a foregone conclusion. Not only has South Africa avoided the problem of “three-termism,”82 no president has served even two full terms. Even when the ANC managed to achieve a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament,83 the party did not use this as an occasion to rewrite the constitution in a manner that would radically tilt the rules in its own favor or to the benefit of its main constituents. While the majority of all constitutional amendments (13 of 17) were implemented from 1999 to 2009, most addressed questions of boundary management and between-election party-switching among elected leaders. To a degree, these may have been designed with ANC interests in mind regarding political control and centralization of power, but they were minor tweaks and, as we know now, certainly did not manage to stem the tide of ANC political losses in subsequent years. FIGURE 6.3. ANC vote share, elections 1994–2016. Source: Author analysis of IEC data. Relatedly, there were and continue to be grave concerns about corruption in South Africa. Throughout history, public officials, entrusted to work on behalf of society, have frequently used their powers and influence to secure private gains for themselves and for their families. Corrupt practices were problematic in the early days of the (White) South African Republic and in the postcolonial Nigerian state. As the German sociologist Max Weber documented with respect to India in the early Middle Ages, government officeholders used their positions expressly to secure benefits for themselves.84 Corruption was notoriously prevalent in various American cities, it has been a problem in Asian success stories, including Japan and China, and it has been at the root of many failures in African governance. The Scandinavian countries and a few others seem to have escaped major corruption problems, but not most. Corruption is highly prevalent in much of Africa, and one compelling explanation for such practice in post-Apartheid South Africa and in other parts of the continent is the theory of the Nigerian political scientist Peter Ekeh. He presciently argued with respect to his own country that following generations of rule under an illegitimate colonial state, many postcolonial bureaucrats felt more compelled to deliver directly to their immediate kinship networks than to serve the broad mandates of what had long been an illegitimate state, designed to plunder.85 When viewed in comparative perspective, the extent of South African corruption, including increases in corruption, does not appear as extreme as South African commentators frequently portray. As a starting point, a substantial amount of government behavior that would be labeled as corruption today was rife under Apartheid. (And that is separate from the fact that the system itself was founded on a wildly unjust proposition, so the degree of bureaucratic “integrity” within such a system is not much to celebrate.) One carefully documented study revealed that the White-run state routinely engaged in corrupt arms and oil deals in order to subvert sanctions.86 The fact that foreign governments and arms corporations would wind up engaged with the ANC in similar practices may say more about the period before democracy than about the recent past. Moreover, on most international comparative scales (based primarily on expert opinion), South Africa still upholds higher levels of government integrity than most. In the 2019 Transparency International rating of 180 countries, South Africa ranked seventieth (least corrupt), tied with Hungary and Romania, above China and India, and fifth among continental countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, knowing a country’s GDP per capita in 1990 predicts two-thirds of the variation in country corruption scores in 2019, and on that basis alone, South Africa’s corruption score is almost perfectly predicted.87 While this may not be much consolation for South African citizens whose public resources are pilfered, it does suggest that the extent of South African corruption may not be as remarkable as sometimes argued. It’s also important to consider the problems of crime and violence, prominent realities in Mogale City and throughout South Africa. Most South Africans identify these as serious concerns, and the scars of violent confrontations are plain to see. As with corruption, we can expect a degree of violence in all societies, but the question is, how much is there, and to what extent does it undermine the democratic project itself? In fact, the very point of democracy is to resolve questions of leadership selection and other conflicts without violence.88 Once again, post-Apartheid South Africa is very much a product of its past. As I discussed in chapter 4, we cannot lost sight of the fact that Krugersdorp itself was born as a violent town and the Union of South Africa was forged out of extraordinarily violent conflict in its original incarnation in the early part of the twentieth century. The institutionalization of White supremacy was a violent process89 that was eventually met with several decades of violent resistance, culminating in civil war. Half-hearted attempts to introduce Black local government under Apartheid government provoked further cycles of violence. For example, on September 3, 1984—“Bloody Monday”—Black township residents throughout the West Rand protested against service fee increases and the perceived illegitimacy of local councillors, resulting in four killed, events followed by increased state repression and mushrooming body counts.90 Combining such history with the country’s vast inequality, it is hardly surprising that violence has persisted in the post-Apartheid era. The prevalence of violence is not at all unique to South Africa’s democracy. In many countries of the Global South—including India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines—it is a routine aspect of political life. Along these lines, one analyst proposed the new label of “violent democracy”91 for South Africa, applicable to these other countries as well. In related research and analysis, observers have highlighted the ways in which inequalities of wealth and power frequently result in violent conflict. Claims made concerning violations of public trust around corruption are sometimes themselves the result of frustrated actors who have found themselves shut out of patronage links.92 Particularly disturbing is the extent of violence involved in the struggle to obtain and to maintain positions in local government councils. Between the start of 2016 and September 2018, approximately ninety politicians were killed in the context of turf battles, struggles for office, and reprisals, including against those who acted as whistleblowers in exposing government corruption.93 To recognize that such violence has strong historical and comparative precedents does not imply that it is tolerable. Whether in South Africa or elsewhere, there may be a tipping point at which we can no longer describe these countries as being governed by ballots but rather by bullets. It is hard to say exactly how to draw that line, but for all the violence that finds a home in contemporary South Africa, it is still not the basis for most leadership selections or policymaking. Violence in South Africa and many other countries can still be understood as awful by-products of still incomplete democratic development. And even wealthy and long-standing democracies like the United States remain vulnerable to violent conflict in political life. Moreover, we should not lose sight of the big picture—that democratic institutions appear to have been central in solving the problem of existential crisis, putting an end to civil war, and lowering the amount of measured political violence in South Africa. For example, based on a systematic coding of social conflicts across the African continent, more than 12,000 deaths resulted from various social conflicts in South Africa between the start of 1990 and April 24, 1994 (preelection). By contrast, for the much longer period after the 1994 election until the end of 2017, the number from such causes was less than 2,500. South Africa went from being the deadliest place on the continent in terms of such conflict-related fatalities to being completely unremarkable in comparative terms.94 While there are important examples of the post-Apartheid government using deadly force against striking workers and protesters, these are still a rarity and the state no longer routinely kills and tortures people to advance its agenda. In fact, a serious mismatch between trends in crime, including violent crime (which has largely gone down), and perceptions and fears of crime and violence (which continue to go up) during the post-Apartheid period perhaps unfairly contributes to concerns about the quality of democracy. For example, the homicide rate in South Africa has fallen dramatically since 1994. Notwithstanding some uptick in recent years, the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people dropped from 63 in 1994 to 35.7 in 2017,95 and yet, I am quite sure you would never learn this from talking to ordinary South Africans in Mogale or almost anywhere else. Two different studies, one for the period 1998–200396 and another that extends to 2016–17,97 both highlight that even with corroborated data revealing either stabilization or decline in crime rates, citizens report feeling more unsafe. Part of the problem may be that even with some reductions, overall South African levels are very high, and it is this persistence that shapes attitudes. Or it might be widespread discussion in the media or social media and/or particular crimes that most affect citizen perceptions. In any case, the notion that during the democratic era things have begun to “spin out of control” simply does not accord with reality in the country. FIGURE 6.4. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. Finally, I want to point out that democratic practice itself has been remarkably successful when seen in comparative terms. For example, based on metrics from the Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) project, and with respect to their Electoral Democracy and slightly more demanding Liberal Democracy indexes, looking back again to the 1980s, South Africa was truly a global laggard in the practice of liberal democracy, ranking 113th out of 169, just above Uzbekistan. But it propelled itself into the top 50 in global rankings in the early 1990s, making one of the biggest jumps worldwide. South Africa’s democratization path is clearly demonstrated in figures 6.4 and 6.5, which depict the V-DEM Democracy scores relative to other Upper-middle-income and other African countries. FIGURE 6.5. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other African countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. And frankly, when considering just about every dimension measured with respect to democratic process—an open media environment that allows for the free circulation of information, including a free press that actively attempts to monitor government practice; freedom for civil society (organizations of people independent from the state); and a judiciary that can similarly act independently of the government and can rebuke practices that contravene the fundamental laws of the land, as established in the constitution—South Africa performs extremely well in comparative perspective.98 On several dimensions, the expert coders report some decline in democratic performance after 2012, no doubt owing to many of the scandals during the Zuma presidency. Nonetheless, relative to the democratic retreat in many other countries, including in Africa, South Africa’s decline was modest and the country mostly held steady in the eyes of observers with a broad comparative framework in mind. Recalling the location of a key set of goalposts, the Freedom Charter offered a set of ideals for a political future, including the idea that multiracial democracy should be understood not simply as a means to an end but an end in itself. And on such scores, given the historical record just presented, the shift from “unfreedom” to “freedom” in the political arena was absolutely profound in South Africa. Many will quite reasonably retort, “You can’t eat freedom.” Which is why it’s also important to consider post-Apartheid trends in material prosperity, the subject of the next chapter.",

      "content": "7 Prosperity THERE SHALL BE HOUSES, SECURITY, AND COMFORT EVEN THE 1955 FREEDOM CHARTER clearly said that “freedom” must imply more than simply citizens being able to choose their leaders. Famously, the document declared, “There Shall be Houses, Security, and Comfort.” Almost forty years later, those dreams were still not realities for millions of South Africans. As such, during its first electoral campaign in 1994, the ANC’s party leaders promised to provide houses, health care, lighting, security, and other sources of material prosperity to those who went without. In fact, when he was speaking to prospective voters, Mandela could sometimes be mistaken for an ordinary politician, as he promised “a better life for all” if elected. Stanley Greenberg, a veteran American political strategist who assisted with the inaugural ANC campaign, recalled Mandela as being a fiercely competitive politician. The liberation stalwart was not satisfied with the idea of simply taking in the votes they would receive because of his organization’s role in the struggle or his own personal stature.1 Mandela wanted to win the election convincing citizens that an ANC government would actually deliver concrete improvements to their lives. Moreover, the 1996 constitution enshrined several material needs as rights, including with respect to health care, reproductive health, sufficient food and water, adequate housing, basic education, and social security for those unable to support themselves. By 2019, even in Mogale City, located in South Africa’s richest province and industrial heartland, citizens routinely asserted that the government had failed to deliver what people needed. The rhetoric surrounding persistent service delivery protests echoed what many residents—Black and White—said to me in interviews: the government has accomplished nothing. And throughout the 2019 election campaign, political opponents pointed to the realities of poverty, inequality, and obvious human want as evidence of the government’s disastrous performance over the previous quarter century. In turn, many suspect that democracy has not been a help but rather a hindrance to human development. To be sure, the record is littered with disappointments. The complaints and protests are rooted in actual instances of deprivation. And South Africa remains a profoundly unequal society. Yet, it is also the case that since the end of Apartheid, South Africa has chalked up some extraordinary accomplishments in terms of improving the material well-being of its citizens, especially the most vulnerable. And much of this can be directly linked to democratic practice—that is, the application of competitive political pressures to enact and to implement development-enhancing policies. Moreover, many of the disappointments and even the severe shortfalls of the post-Apartheid record reflect at least as much about the continued weight of the country’s historical legacies and global conditions as they do about the performance of democratic government. Various government critics have rightly highlighted how social and economic policies and practices could have been more thoroughgoing, implemented earlier and more efficiently. But if we take a step back to focus not just on the critiques but also on what has been accomplished during the first quarter century, we see that much of the record on material progress, especially for the poor, and in light of the country’s history, is quite remarkable. First, I consider the conditions of human settlement, including access to basic services, where the changes are most apparent especially at the local level. Second, I look at the challenge of growing and equalizing cash incomes. And third, I briefly describe the record of investing in human capital, including with respect to health and education. Once again, I try to highlight patterns in Mogale relative to the rest of South Africa, and South Africa in comparative context. Give Me Shelter From 1994, the idea of a “better life” for millions of South Africans largely connoted gaining access to formal housing and basic services—electricity, water, and sanitation. And to varying degrees, politicians from the ANC, and from competing parties, promised during all of the subsequent election campaigns that they would expand access to these.2 For millions of people, the results were life-changing. The most important signature project was the RDP house: RDP is the acronym for the first government’s economic and development strategy, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. In a country where millions of people lacked reliable shelter, the government proposed to build millions of homes. While the design has undergone some revision over the years, it has always been a very basic, rectangular concrete structure with a tin roof, designed to provide accommodation for a single family. The intentions and ambitions were noble: people deserve to live in a real, secure shelter, not in an overcrowded shack. If your household income fell below a certain level, and you were a South African citizen, you would be eligible to get one of these houses. But you had to get in line. Good data on the number of houses actually built are hard to come by. One reasonable estimate that echoes what various government officials have shared with me is that between 1994 and 2015, over 2.8 million houses were delivered, meaning that approximately one-third of all South African residences are fully subsidized by the government.3 Certainly nowhere else in Africa has such a scheme existed, and I have not been able to find anything comparable anywhere in the Global South, let alone in the richest countries. The most generous programs elsewhere involve low-cost loans or subsidies for housing, but not a title deed to a house free of charge. Due in large part to the RDP, in 2016, 79 percent of South Africans lived in formal housing—marking a 21-percentage-point gain since 1995.4 And beyond just houses, statistical data reveal an important and broader portrait of change, one in which democratic pressures have arguably been quite important. First, consider electrification. In 1996, 58 percent of households had electricity connections and by 2016, over 90 percent had access.5 To be sure, the country has in recent years faced long periods of rolling blackouts and sometimes-interrupted power supplies—all of which are the sources of daily frustration and anger. Yet, the transformation in access is both impressive and, to a degree, the cause of such shortages as so many more people now make demands on the system. Consider also basic water and sanitation services. In 1996, just 47 percent of Black Africans had piped water in their dwellings (compared with over 96 percent of Whites).6 By 2011, that figure had jumped to 67 percent for Black Africans (and 99 percent of Whites). By 2015, over 95 percent of all South Africans had direct access to piped water.7 In 1996, just 50 percent of households had access to flush toilets connected to sewerage systems or septic tanks. By 2016, coverage increased to 64 percent of households.8 And in an important related public health trend, in 2000, over 12 percent of the population practiced open defecation, but that was down to less than 2 percent by 2018.9 These are solid jumps in service coverage in the context of a growing population—but I don’t want to overstate the South African picture because in countries around the world, citizens have also enjoyed substantial improvements in recent decades. For example, across sub-Saharan Africa, the gains in electrification coverage were from 16 percent to 43 percent; among Low- and Middle-income countries, the number of households covered went from 65 percent to 85 percent. Nonetheless, South Africa still outperforms these group averages. South Africa also bested neighbors Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Mozambique in terms of gains in service coverage. Only in Botswana was the overall change more significant (17 percent had access to electricity in 1995; 64 percent had it in 2016) but, of course, from a much lower base.10 The fact that we’ve observed all of this progress during the era of democratic politics doesn’t necessarily imply that democracy caused these changes. It’s impossible to know how things would have been under a different type of political system. Looking at the timing and geographic distribution of who got what and when, there are good reasons to think that democratic pressures—starting from the Mandela campaign—did play a role. For example, one excellent study demonstrates that in areas where electricity was provided by the national parastatal (Eskom), during the 1996–2001 period, increased electrification of households was most profound in the areas with the largest numbers of newly enfranchised (i.e., non-White) voters.11 The authors interpret this to imply that since just about everywhere the new pivotal voters were Black and likely without electricity, this would lead the government to want to be responsive to voters in providing this service in order to improve the likelihood of a win in the next election. And they argue that those in power were acting to satisfy a large number of new voters who largely lacked services—a winning strategy if voters value them. Relatedly, for a later period (approximately 2001–11), Daniel de Kadt and I found that changes in levels of citizen support for the ANC across almost three thousand wards was inversely related to changes in the extent of basic service provision, especially of water access. Although initially counterintuitive, we concluded that this was a nuanced form of accountability and now potentially more forward-looking. For those areas that had not yet seen great improvements in service provision, citizens were more likely to continue to support the ANC in the hopes that they would be next, whereas the citizens in now-serviced areas were more likely to be looking to other parties to focus on policies beyond basic service provision.12 Together, these studies highlight the ways in which the links between service delivery and voting can incentivize action, especially when political competition is high. While electoral pressures may always loom large, the courts and appeals to constitutional rights have also proved to be extremely important sources of pressure for government to provide basic services for the poor, including with respect to housing, land rights, health, and education. For example, the legal case Government of the Republic of South Africa vs. Grootboom (2000) was particularly influential. Irene Grootboom and others had been evicted from their informal dwellings by the government, which was trying to build some low-cost housing on their site. In turn, drawing on the constitutional right to shelter, Grootboom went to court to force the government to provide at least temporary adequate housing, especially because children were involved. The court found that, indeed, the government had this obligation, which essentially breathed life into the aspirations of the constitution, saying that these rights were not simply platitudes but needed to be enforced. The ruling argued that the denial of shelter was tantamount to the denial of human dignity and the opportunity to enjoy other rights enshrined in the constitution.13 While that judgment had many positive long-term effects in helping to make the courts an effective vehicle for social transformation, and securing the right to housing, one cannot escape the unfortunate reality that Irene Grootboom herself never got housing and died poor and in a shack in 2008. Many South Africans have been frustrated and frequently engage in protest because supply has not kept up with demand. To put the size of the promise in perspective, each house costs approximately 10,000 USD to build, and South Africa’s per capita income is less than 7,000 USD. Nonetheless, these political pressures continue to keep further development and allocation of RDP houses on the political agenda, often to the dismay of local politicians, who face running lists of people waiting for theirs. Township Life Traveling up and down Mogale City’s rolling hills and around its sometimes narrow streets, I spoke with citizens, politicians, journalists, and civil society leaders. I tried to learn the extent to which the statistical portraits described above resonated with the lived realities in various neighborhoods, with a particular focus on the predominantly Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville and the formal and informal settlements around the more rural Muldersdrift. I concluded in short order that the municipality is not a standout success story by any means, nor is it the opposite. In fact, Mogale’s record of development seems to reflect much of what has transpired in other midsized South African municipalities. Norman Sedumedi, a former teacher who serves as the councillor for Ward 24 in Munsieville, the township in which he was born and raised, provided some history. As an ANC politician with a record to defend, he wanted to highlight progress when I asked if there was any to report. Still, the facts of what he shared with me when I asked, “What’s changed?” were easily corroborated, including by my own site visits. He spoke of Munsieville’s relatively new sports complex and a regional park, as well as the fact that all the streets were tarred and that all the houses, except some small and newer informal settlements, had electricity. He described the high school and the primary schools built to accommodate additional children and to reduce the length of their walk to school. The government had built health clinics and early childhood development and youth centers. He conceded that many of them don’t work as they had hoped or intended. I passed the relatively new senior center on multiple occasions, and indeed, I could see throngs of older residents coming and going, and at least superficially, it appeared to play a vibrant role in the community. By contrast, the tennis courts without nets that stood barren next to a locked recreational center reminded me how public projects can sometimes become white elephants. FIGURE 7.1.

When it came to the subject of housing and service provision, Sedumedi shared both a record of pride and a concern for dependency on the state in the context of low growth and high unemployment. He also expressed a general sense of exasperation that “it is a moving target. You never get it right for as long as people are alive and for as long as we have not fixed the issue of changing the economic landscape. Because the more the economy remains as it is, all of the burden will be for the state.” He said that since 1994, between 3,000 and 4,000 RDP houses had been built in the area. He worried that free housing, health care, and education might be disincentivizing people to work. On the other hand, it’s also hard to imagine how productive people could be without these basic needs. In the larger Black township of Kagiso, I spoke with seventy-nine-year-old Lerato Dube. We met at the Kagiso Methodist Church on a Tuesday afternoon, the time she serves soup to local residents. Her hair was wrapped in a bright green ANC bandana, and it was just a day before the 2019 election. She insisted on being referred to as Gogo (Zulu for Granny) and on serving me as well, so I obliged with some embarrassment at being fed a meal meant for those who actually needed one. But there was more soup available than takers on that afternoon, and this was her preference. So while I ate, I asked her to tell me about her life, what had changed, what had stayed the same. Dube was born in KwaZulu-Natal a few years before Apartheid was implemented14 and recounted what amounted to local transformation. When I [came to] Kagiso [in] 1992, Kagiso wasn’t like this. They were making fires with coal and wood. There was no electricity. They were lighting candles and lamps. There was no road. The taxi was no taxi because there was no road. It looked like a field.15 … Times goes and comes until 1994, then we ask electric and got. Then we asked for water. Even the water, it was very, very slow. The old house, that’s the other side of our house, there was the water on the outside. They were not allowed to make a pipe to put the water inside. If you want to wash, in cold or raining or snowing, you stand outside and do your washing or maybe bathing. After 1994, things [were becoming] better and better because now … we got water everywhere. We got the right toilet everywhere. Then we got the proper houses. Older South Africans, like other South Africans, have many concerns and frustrations about what has not changed, and about the changes they see that are for the worse, including increased drug use and violence among young people. But like Dube, many highlight that the material circumstances of their lives are radically different today from what they previously experienced, particularly for those who moved from shacks and squatter camps to their own homes. Notable exceptions are those who worked as teachers or nurses during the Apartheid days, who tended to have access to simple but formal government houses and some basic services. As of 2018, approximately 20 percent of all Black Mogale residents lived in RDP houses.16 Moreover, basic service delivery has expanded widely. In my sample, of adults forty years of age and older who said they had always lived in the area of Mogale City, as shown in figure 7.2, the racial gap in service delivery closed quite dramatically during the democratic era. In 1994, just 24 percent of Blacks had access to electricity, while 79 percent of Whites had access; by 2019, both approached universal access: 84.5 percent of Blacks and 95.4 percent of Whites.17 For Black South Africans who received RDP houses, they were much more likely to have access to other basic services compared with all other Black South Africans. For instance, in Mogale City, 99 percent of those living in RDP houses in 2019 had access to electricity, flush toilets, and piped water. Among all other Black residents, 15 to 20 percent fewer Black households had access to those services.18 Again, the RDP houses are modest structures generally erected in neighborhoods that look nothing like the established suburbs of Krugersdorp North or Noordheuwel, which are still mostly populated by Whites. While the houses were meant to displace shacks, in many cases, homeowners have built shack “additions,” which they rent out, or they move into the additions themselves and rent out the house. In many cases, homeowners have sold their homes, sometimes to recently arrived foreign nationals, which has generated resentment and has tended to exacerbate the sense of a fundamental housing crisis, certainly in Mogale City. FIGURE 7.2. The Black-White gap in basic service delivery, Mogale City (1970–2019). Source: Author analysis of HMS_2019. Based on survey responses for year of access among respondents who always lived in Mogale City area. All of these patterns are frustrating but quite understandable responses to the basic condition of having an asset but little income. In turn, many RDP housing developments do not present as vibrant communities or the sources of local or national pride that planners once might have hoped. Nonetheless, even well-founded frustrations ought not obscure the fundamental accomplishment of providing formal shelter for so many. Ethembalethu: A Case Study of Possibility Most RDP housing communities are characterized by a somewhat harsh and uninviting design aesthetic, familiar among state-sponsored housing developments the world over. One notable and positive exception is virtually hidden amid the farmlands, light industry, and scenic wedding venues of Muldersdrift in northeast Mogale City. The area typifies “urban periphery,” in the sense that one is surrounded by agriculture and agro-industry, and yet, in just a few minutes you can be in a sizable town, and in less than an hour, a major urban metropolis. A community called Ethembalethu (“ours” in Zulu) proved to be one of the most extraordinary RDP housing developments I’ve seen anywhere in South Africa. I traveled to the area for the first time on the recommendation of a local activist who, having learned of my broader interests, suggested I check it out. The story of how this community came to be offers important reminders of the social and political hurdles that remain for human development even in the post-Apartheid era, as well as the ways in which wealthy White landowners still wield enormous power despite their relatively small numbers. It also highlights the opportunities for organized citizens to achieve their goals and to build robust and prosperous communities, including through democratic participation and engagement. Ethembalethu sits at the end of an unmarked road just off the M5, a few miles north of Krugersdorp. An unoccupied guard station serves as a gateway to the neighborhood. The area is comprised of more than one hundred houses, all with the same basic RDP “core” structure, but most of the owners have expanded their living spaces with sturdy additions. Residents had painted the outsides in bright colors with different finishes, and many owners planted small lawns out front. On the various days I visited, groups of people walked the streets, talking and visiting with neighbors. It was not a luxury development, but from the outside, it radiated a sense of security and comfort and amounted to not simply a set of houses but a coherent community. And unlike in Munsieville and Kagiso, in Ethembalethu, there were no shacks anywhere (a fact I verified with satellite images from Google Maps). To learn more, I was referred to Molefi Selibo. As councillor for Ward 23, Selibo had his champions and his detractors within Mogale City, as most ambitious political leaders do. But even his critics were willing to acknowledge that his efforts in building the Ethembalethu community were successful, and perhaps even exemplary. On a return visit, I contacted Selibo and he agreed to meet with me in his small ward office, situated in a converted shipping container off Clinic Road in Muldersdrift, just south of the RDP community. FIGURE 7.3. Row of RDP houses in Ethembalethu community, Muldersdrift, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Selibo was born near the largely Afrikaner city of Bloemfontein in 1958 and came to the Muldersdrift area in search of work in 1986. An entrepreneur, he built a hair salon business, which he maintained for twenty years, and like barbers and hairdressers the world over, people came to him with their concerns, looking for advice. He recalled his efforts with pride: “A lot of people were interested to come to my salon because of how I handled issues. They said, ‘I think you can assist us as a community leader.’ ” He took on this role and highlighted that Black people in Muldersdrift had long lived with housing insecurity. They tended to stay on the farms where they worked. And if your boss fired you, you also lost your home. Political change offered the promise of new opportunities, but absent any specific promises about how they would get houses, in 1994, Selibo decided to start an organization, mainly to mobilize the community to buy land. And by 1996, they formally established the Muldersdrift Home Trust Foundation. At the time, Selibo himself resided in a small structure built by a White landowner, lived without electricity, and used a pit toilet. The fundamental strategy of the nascent organization was to require members to contribute 100 rand per month in a saving scheme, in order to accumulate the capital needed to buy land and to form a partnership with government. Less than a year later, they identified an appropriate parcel and began negotiations with a landowner, who initially agreed, with a modestly revised counterproposal. However, when other White landowners learned about the deal that was being struck—which would bring a sizable group of Black neighbors to subdivide a plot for housing—they persuaded him to not sell and bought the land away from him. At the time, Selibo had about two hundred members and they persisted, identifying yet another piece of land. This time they were more careful about the negotiations and tried to ensure that White landowners would not get wind of the deal. They negotiated and signed an agreement in 1997. At that point, they began to engage town planners, environmentalists, and others to formalize the arrangement. Yet once again, the prospect of this new community rooting itself in Muldersdrift did not sit well with many White residents from the area. As Selibo explained, “The challenge was that those who were in charge at that time were very close to White landowners in the area. [Ours] was the first organization led by a Black community in the White area … and they were not comfortable with that.” Soon thereafter, Selibo received another cancellation letter, as the landowners had pressured the seller to renege on the agreement. Selibo pushed back and said they had a binding contract. Even in post-Apartheid South Africa, with Black-led local, provincial, and national governments, the system still seemed stacked against them. Selibo recounted, “When the community was visiting the site, the landowners called police who came and arrested the people who were visiting. ‘They are trespassing.’ And they obliged. We were arrested on the property that we bought.” Selibo continued on, and the White landowners tried another tack: they withdrew from their frivolous court case against Selibo’s group and approached him with the offer of an out-of-court settlement. They would pay Selibo’s group for all of their costs, including lawyers’ fees, and for the price of the land including interest, and on top of that, an additional 250,000 rand. The Whites were willing to pay a tidy sum to avoid having Black neighbors. Insulting, of course, but Selibo and his community decided to take the money in a 1999 settlement, and then they identified a new plot that was almost four times the size of the original. Once again, they negotiated with the landowner, but now they didn’t have enough to cover the full price of the larger plot. They wrote to the provincial government and the national government to share their story and to ask for assistance. During that time, it was not easy for a nongovernment organization—for a government to give it money. We were still new in the democracy and didn’t have all the legislation. [The government] was very interested and supportive of our approach in terms of dealing with the housing issue. They were very interested and said we will assist … but we will transfer money to the municipality, and then you and the municipality will enter into a land agreement to drive this forward. From that point, in 2002, Selibo said he continued to meet with members every two weeks to keep them informed. Along with the municipality, they submitted a “township application,” and by local code, this triggered an invitation for local comments. Yet again, White landowners organized and tried in various ways to object. And according to Selibo, many of the people handling housing-related issues in the area were still White and still sympathetic to the landowners, and this led to more delays. The process would be delayed and delayed and delayed. They didn’t realize we were becoming specialists. You do like that to a person you are empowering that person. So now we are able to articulate each and every aspect of development. We were able to do our homework to do deal with the landowners in the area and to defend ourselves in the process, but it took a long time. A “long time” is really an understatement. But the agreements were finally approved. Selibo and his community received the land, and the government agreed to build RDP houses on it. In April 2014, more than 120 houses were finally completed and the government handed them over to waiting residents. The national government news agency released a piece announcing the ceremony, in which a Mogale local government leader proclaimed, “Land is important to human settlements. We need land to build houses and when you have a house, your dignity is restored.”19 For all the endless stories about what has not worked in terms of housing and development in South Africa, I was surprised to find almost no coverage of the ceremony or the development itself in the news media.20 Selibo highlighted that more recently, another 133 houses had been approved for development. When I asked him why he thought that the final product appeared so different from other RDP communities, he emphasized that what made the community unique was that it had developed solidarity through the years, and they created their own informal zoning regulations, which reflected a desire to avoid what had gone wrong elsewhere. Now we have a code of conduct. You can extend, but you can’t have a shack, you can’t sell it. But now the issue is that … it is a beautiful safe village and no one wants to move. Everyone wants to get a space here. They realize we have a treasure here. Especially in that village, their lives have improved significantly and the way we have been doing the work in the area, we have assisted them to get job opportunities, because we have worked as a family for a long time. It’s not easy in the country with high unemployment rate, but in that village, close to 99 percent are working because we have instilled responsibility. Even if they go and work for you … they have instilled a sense of responsibility and built one another. You would be very happy if someone came to work for you given how they conduct themselves. Also discussing how can we build ourselves. Their lives have improved a lot. When I conducted my Historical Memories Survey in Mogale, I decided to “oversample” in Ethembalethu to see whether the assertions of success had any merit. In a typical survey, given the small size of the area relative to the rest of Mogale City, we might have wound up with zero or just a few of the residents. But I was interested to see if the area was “the real deal” from the perspective of the people who actually lived there. We interviewed fourteen owners of these RDP houses, which is still a very small sample—more illustrative than statistically representative—but enough to shed some light on what makes the community unique. For example, 79 percent said they “never” felt unsafe walking in their neighborhood, as compared with 52 percent of Blacks in other areas of the same ward, and compared with just 34 percent of Black RDP owners in Mogale City. It seemed discouraging to find that only 46 percent of Ethembalethu residents said that “most people in their neighborhood could be trusted,” but that’s still much better than 30 percent of RDP owners throughout the municipality. And I asked the survey enumerators to rate the respondent’s “level of cooperation,” and fully 100 percent of the Ethembalethu respondents were “fully cooperative,” as compared with just 82 percent of RDP owners municipality wide. The residents seemed to have higher levels of the “social capital”21 that helps make democracy work. As I spoke with Selibo, I reminded myself to consider the research conducted by one of my former students, Gwyneth McClendon, who wrote an acclaimed book on the topic of envy in politics.22 A central problem she raised was the enormous challenges of delivering public housing because, particularly in South Africa, those who have not yet received this benefit can become very envious of those who have. And that frustration can turn to destructive behavior, leaving everyone worse off. I asked Selibo if that was a problem here, and he said, unequivocally, yes. “It’s a major problem in this area. Especially in this ward. Because now we have this beautiful township and a lot of community members [those in his ward] are still in that poor status. Most of the time we can’t always speak of Ethembalethu because people are not staying there and they are envious.” He went on to mention future plans, and indeed perhaps the best antidote to envious behavior is a credible commitment that the same benefits will be extended to all. On the other hand, given the twenty-year process to get phase one completed, this could be a dangerous proposition if that timetable is not accelerated given the growing impatience with demands. And in fact, Leslie Gama, whom I met in Muldersdrift on the last weekend of voter registration and whose parents went off to vote while he stayed at home during the first election of the new democratic era, showed me his designs to replicate what had been achieved in Ethembalethu. On an individual level, Gama bears some striking similarities to Selibo. He also grew up in a rural area with few human comforts. He stayed in Muldersdrift with his grandparents in a house made of mud bricks, built on a cattle farm. Because the construction process involved smearing cow dung on the bricks, he said that even today when he smells cow dung, he is reminded of his childhood. Leslie and his family had no electricity, and they got their water from a neighboring farm, illegally tapping into an irrigation system. They dug their own pit latrines to use as toilets. And he even worked for a spell in a hair salon. He started his own organization, Umnotho, which for about seven years by the time I met him in 2019 had been collecting money from families who wanted to upgrade their lives from shacks to formal settlements. I was very impressed by the bountiful gardens the community had grown and the detailed plans—including architectural drawings and models—they had commissioned for an integrated community. But just like Selibo, Gama faced the hurdles of local opposition, zoning rules, and occasional theft from his offices, as well as the challenge of getting the right attention from the right officials. Nonetheless, given his tenacity, the cohesion and support of his community, the progress he has detailed to me since we met, and the example of Ethembalethu, I am cautiously optimistic that he’ll succeed in this or a related venture. FIGURE 7.4. Slabs awaiting RDP houses in Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Without active involvement from community leaders like Selibo and Gama, government policies can languish. Too frequently, housing projects get started but remain unfinished owing to lack of planning, funding, and/or oversight, let alone as the result of a stalemate between competing political interests. In Munsieville, I toured a site with a checkerboard of concrete slabs designed to support RDP houses but that, at least for the time being, were nothing but useless eyesores. The latter, of course, tend to capture the imagination of democracy skeptics all around the municipality. While important, my broader point is that such failures are not the whole story. Income, Security, and Equality Beyond shelter and basic services, citizens want jobs, income, and to not be on the wrong end of extreme inequality. In 2019, Ramaphosa and the ANC campaigned on the slogan “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a tacit acknowledgment of what was needed. Nonetheless, while the economic record is certainly not the basis for a victory lap, it is also not dispositive for the value of democracy in the country. Moreover, although unemployment and inequality remain staggeringly high, the government has also provided critical cash grants to provide social security for millions of the most vulnerable. It may not have been rapid economic development, but the record contributed to dignified development. As a liberation movement, the ANC had been on record, including quite explicitly in the Freedom Charter, calling for the nationalization of the mines and of large sections of the economy. Moreover, the organization and its alliance partners, COSATU and the SACP, all drew heavily on Marxist-Leninist thought as guiding principles. They envisioned a new democratically elected government having a very strong hand in all aspects of the economy. As they prepared to govern, and once in power, ANC elites engaged in far-ranging discussions with a variety of economists and others inside and outside the country concerning strategies that would thread the needle between achieving economic growth and attaining some level of adequate redistribution in the near term. They actively and openly debated various models and the lessons to be learned from other countries’ experiences. Like most planners at the time, they wondered how they could emulate the high-performing economies in East Asia. Prominently in the background of such debates and discussions was the collapse of the Soviet Union. The failed record of centrally planned economies provided leverage for White business leaders to strike bargains with the liberation party and its partners to avert nationalization. They made the familiar argument that the new government should not “kill the goose that lays the golden egg.” (White business was the goose here.) Neo-liberal economic principles had gained global prominence and if you didn’t play by those rules, it was clear that international financial institutions would restrict access to credit and investments. Mandela and other top ANC brass were ultimately persuaded against nationalizing and, for that matter, against massive land distribution. As early as 1996, they adopted an economic strategy that involved privatization of state assets, trade liberalization, and bureaucratic reform.23 The compromise solution was to combine a largely free market system, while actively promoting Black economic empowerment. Companies could remain private, but they would need to demonstrate active inclusion of those who had been disadvantaged under Apartheid. And the government would be tasked with providing social support to the poor and extending social benefits widely. In October 1997, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel delivered a keynote speech for a book launch hosted by the Budget Information Service at IDASA. I had just started my work there the previous week and the event immediately highlighted for me the emerging political fault lines on economic policy. Like many of the other government leaders, Manuel had spent several years of his adult life in jail protesting the old government; he had long been a champion of the poor and the working class. Now, he was already being accused of being a lackey for the well-heeled. Critics said that the government’s revised economic strategy, called Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), with its emphasis on fiscal discipline and low inflation, reflected an abandonment of a focus on jobs and development for the impoverished masses. Manuel resisted this characterization. He quoted phrases from the original RDP plan to remind critics that the party had always intended to proceed in a fiscally responsible manner. And he quoted from Capital, in which Karl Marx argued that the burden of budget deficits falls on the working class. He was sharp and persuasive. Given the scale of wants and needs, the challenge of building the economy was enormous. At the very least, most assumed that simply ending Apartheid would yield some important economic benefits. First, the government should attain some savings from the elimination of multiple and inflated homeland governments, which cost much more than they took in, and a reduction in military spending, as it would no longer be at war with much of the country and the region. They would also save on the resources wasted controlling the movement of Black people. International economic sanctions would end, and perhaps foreign investors would flock to South Africa. The most optimistic held out hope that the merging of these two wildly different segments of the economy would quickly lead to everyone living at the level of White South Africans.24 In practice, the period 1994–2007 actually produced solid economic growth, especially compared with the disastrous last decade of Apartheid that preceded it. And during this interval, the incomes, opportunities, and lifestyles for millions of Black South Africans improved, generating widespread expansion of the Black middle class. As in the United States, the term “middle class” means many things to many people—certainly in South Africa, it does not connote an average or the middle of the income distribution but a lifestyle associated with some degree of comfort with disposable income. In other words, millions of Black South Africans began to gain access to the lifestyles that had been enjoyed almost exclusively by Whites: university for their children, the ability to purchase goods at one of South Africa’s many shopping malls, perhaps the ability to own an automobile. By some estimates, in terms of “affluence,” the middle class grew from 2.2 million in 1993 to 4.9 million in 2008 (and by 2008, 20 percent of the 1 million “upper class” were now Black African).25 For many, this was exactly the dream of a post-Apartheid South Africa. On the other hand, growth in this segment of the population gave rise to a growing chasm between Black haves and Black have-nots. For many of the millions without the disposable income to take advantage of new shopping opportunities or to purchase the latest mobile phone, let alone to have a decent roof over their heads, patience began to wear thin. Many criticized the GEAR plan as an abandonment of the poor majority. And then the global financial crisis of 2007–8 ravaged South Africa’s economy. In 2009, the year Jacob Zuma became president, the economy contracted by 1.5 percent—almost 3 percent, when calculated on a per capita basis. After that, the economy failed to sustain a serious recovery throughout his term. Per capita GDP growth practically screeched to a halt at 0.3 percent during those years. All told, between 1994 and 2018, South Africa’s average annual economic growth on a per capita basis was a paltry 1.2 percent.26 There is no single definitive answer for why the South African economy grew at the pace it did. Political conflicts and news of corruption within the ANC surely scared off some potential investments and deprived citizens of resources that would otherwise have been used on public expenditures.27 Insufficient infrastructure investment to meet the demands of citizens and businesses has also surely constrained productivity and growth. It is certainly plausible that the strength of organized labor contributed to wage bills that made some companies uncompetitive. And foreign direct investment into Africa has always been extremely low, and despite the end of Apartheid, investment into South Africa remained modest relative to initial hopes. FIGURE 7.5. GDP per capita growth, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Moreover, it is hard to ignore the extent to which the previous decade was challenging for most Upper-middle-income countries.28 For example, during this period, Brazil chalked up an average annual growth rate of 1.3 percent, almost exactly the same as South Africa’s, and with peaks and valleys that are remarkably similar. If we evaluate South Africa’s economic performance relative to other Upper-middle-income countries29 and to the rest of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as presented in figure 7.5, the country’s lackluster economic performance still appears to lag. However, on average, those countries only grew about 1.2 and 0.8 percentage points faster than South Africa did, and even these comparisons are driven by a few high-growth countries rather than a consistent difference. And within these sets of countries for this period, there is really no discernible difference between democracies and non-democracies (despite some compelling research suggesting that democracies do tend to grow faster on average).30 For those who like to hold out the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to describe Black rule in South Africa, it’s important to dispel the myth that South Africa’s post-Apartheid economic performance has in any way resembled Zimbabwe’s. With respect to the latter, one of my favorite teaching props is a photo I took of a Zimbabwean one hundred trillion dollar note, along with a photo of ordinary Zimbabweans using this currency as wallpaper. With declining government revenues, Zimbabwe’s authoritarian government under Robert Mugabe simply printed more and more money to finance its expenditures amid the president’s lavish lifestyle. In turn, the country experienced hyperinflation and the collapse of its currency. Stores could not set consistent prices nor could they reliably stock goods. Increasingly, citizens were forced to barter with one another to get what they needed. By contrast, South Africans have experienced only minor devaluations of their currency, and their economy has been generally well managed with low rates of inflation, low debt, and small budget deficits. Notably, the post-Apartheid period was marked by steep declines in the mining industry. The country’s gold output decreased steadily since 1994, with some decline already underway between 1980 and 1994.31 The historical discovery of gold near Krugersdorp preceded Mandela’s election by more than a century. The mining went very deep into the Rand, and it simply became much less profitable relative to the degree it once was as the effort-to-yield ratio continually climbed, and it would no longer be a source of easy profits in the new democracy. The collapse of mining has hit Mogale hard. As one resident recounted, “We would grow up seeing [miners] with their hats going down into the mines, and then coming up. It used to be a very vibrant area. But now of late, there’s a lot of unemployment. You feel pity when you see them on the corners staying or sitting idle by the shops, and becoming drunk.” From multiple vantage points within the municipal borders, one can see the large, ugly West Rand Consolidated Mine hill. It’s a reminder of what made this city (gold) and what it is now (essentially without a mining sector). Thousands of able-bodied people are not gainfully employed. Instead, a few informal miners dangerously try to retrieve small treasures where they can, with little regard for personal safety. The failure to grow the economy deprived the country of a key weapon against the Apartheid legacies of high unemployment, high poverty, and high inequality. By any measure, South African unemployment levels have remained staggering—at least 25 percent—in the decades following the end of Apartheid, perhaps over 40 percent if applying a “strict” definition.32 And on surveys, in interviews, and on the radio and other media, lack of jobs was the most important issue that people indicated as a concern for them. In 2017–18, a full 44 percent of Mogale residents surveyed said they were “unemployed and looking for work”—and that figure is low for all of Gauteng Province, where 52 percent responded this way.33 Are democratic politics to blame? As figure 7.6 clearly shows, South African unemployment in 2018, as reported using International Labor Organization models, was very high in comparative perspective—measured as the worst among Upper-middle-income countries. But it was already high at the dawn of the democratic era, so the failure is one of being unable to solve an existing problem rather than creating a new one. The picture of inequality is similar: in the decade after 1995, already high levels of income inequality intensified. After 2005 this trend reversed somewhat, and by 2015 income inequality was at the approximate level it had been in the mid-1990s.34 The fact that a highly unequal society has remained highly unequal is nothing to celebrate. But again, in the current state of the world, in which wealthier people have much better work and investment opportunities,35 the South African story is clearly part of a global one. Even after the 2008 worldwide economic meltdown, increasing numbers of South Africans came to own major household assets—realizing a “middle-class” lifestyle. In 2009, just 15.1 percent owned a computer; by 2015 that number jumped to 22.1 percent. Similar gains were observed with respect to satellite television (13.0 to 35.1 percent), washing machines (27.5 to 35.9 percent), and refrigerators (64.7 to 79.7 percent).36 FIGURE 7.6. Unemployment in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1996–2018). Source: Author analysis of International Labor Organization estimates in WDI. As the United Nations has recently documented, during approximately the period considered here (1990–2015), two-thirds of the share of income going to the top 1 percent increased in 59 of 100 countries with available data.37 Cash Is King One of the most important ways in which the post-Apartheid government has assisted the poor—in the face of a weak economy, dismal employment prospects, and high inequality—has been through direct cash grants, fulfilling a constitutional right and Freedom Charter aspiration to social security. In 2018–19, in a country of 56 million people, 17.6 million were beneficiaries of social grants. The vast majority of these funds are allocated through a Child Support Grant (12.5 million children) and the Old-Age Grant (3.5 million people older than sixty). Other grants are given to people with disabilities, for care dependency, to war veterans, and to support the care of foster children.38 The system is far from perfect, and news stories occasionally pop up about fraud and delays. Yet, this does not go unchecked: for example, in 2012, the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) introduced a biometric scheme in the payout process that saved millions of rand in false claims. Even that was not foolproof, and the DA and others charged that fraud persisted. In 2018, the biometric system was scrapped in favor of a legacy system.39 While such stories and reports frequently contribute to claims and perceptions that the entire agency is corrupt and failing, by and large, most people are paid every month; and the incidence of grant relief has been extremely pro-poor—certainly relative to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and among most Upper-middle-income countries. In many other countries with generous social insurance schemes, particularly in Latin America, the wealthier segments of society manage to capture disproportionate gains, making the net distribution of resources even more unequal. By contrast, according to data from the World Bank ASPIRE database, for the period approximately 2008–16, South Africa provided the most generous transfers with the greatest impact for reducing income inequality by targeting the very poorest.40 Cash grants have contributed to decreasing poverty rates, especially extreme poverty,41 particularly after 2000.42 Although the amount transferred for each grant tends to be modest—about $30 per month for a child grant, for example—getting cash into the hands of the very poor allows individuals and caregivers to buy the essentials. This critical set of grants helped lower the share of the population living under an international poverty line43 from about 34 percent in the period 1993–96 to about 17.5 percent in the period 2010–14.44 Investments in Human Value Reflecting both global trends and the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, South Africa’s 1996 constitution identified access to health care and basic education as fundamental rights of citizenship. Health and education are often described as key components of “human capital,”45 in the sense that investments in these can generate returns in the form of economic productivity. I believe that is too limited a view: we also value better health and education because they are inextricably linked to human autonomy and well-being. Promoting health and education might be better understood simply as investments in and recognition of the value of humans. From the dawn of South Africa’s new democracy, activist critics, journalists, and academics have repeatedly highlighted government failures in meeting crucial needs in these sectors. For example, Section 27, an organization so named for the section of the constitution that details citizens’ social and economic rights, has routinely applied intense pressure to improve both outcomes, especially among the poor, through the media, organized protests, court cases, and direct presentations to government bodies. The LRC, Lawyers for Human Rights, and a host of sector-specific NGOs have developed or adapted their missions to hold the government accountable to make good on constitutional promises. And once again, the list of gaps such organizations have identified is real and observable—especially if one looks at persistent disparities between the haves and have-nots. For example, much like in the United States, the quality of everyday health-care access remains very much a function of ability to pay. The Netcare Krugersdorp Hospital and the Yusuf Dadoo Hospital are situated about a mile apart from one another, but the distance between the quality of facilities and care received is much, much greater. At the former, where people must pay for their care, the outside looks like the glossy Boston hospital buildings I see close to my home and work, and inside, the shelves are stocked and patients can expect to be seen relatively quickly and to receive excellent care. At the latter, citizens report that wait times are long, supplies are frequently unavailable, and the likelihood that the facilities will be clean is low. Similar gaps divide the educational sphere. Notably, there are three types of primary and secondary schools: public schools that are fully free; those in which fees are collected; and private or independent schools. For example, Monument High School, the site of the first polling station I visited on election day in 2019, is a former “Model C” school. These were once White-only public schools and tend to be located in historically White areas. During the early 1990s, as Apartheid was ending, they were afforded greater autonomy, and the government allowed them to collect fees. Today, these are generally the highest-quality public schools, and in Mogale City, both White and Black families who can afford the fees—but not the cost of private school—tend to send their children there. By contrast, most townships, like Munsieville and Kagiso, host public schools in which parents are not expected to pay fees, but the resulting resources and quality—for example, at Munsieville Primary School and Lodirile Secondary School in Rietvallei—tend to be much more modest. As one Mogale City teacher described to me, “These schools are often not that clean and do not look like conducive environments for productive teaching and learning.” And for those who can afford it or who attain scholarships, South Africa boasts many excellent private schools, including in Mogale City, where independent school franchises have come in to meet the growing demand from families—for example, Alma Mater International School and Curro Krugersdorp Independent School, where students can expect access to world-class media resources, relatively small student-to-teacher ratios, and outstanding athletic facilities. These schools also tend to prepare students for possible overseas university education and frequently follow British curricula. As of 2019, of the approximately 75,000 students in Mogale City schools, only about 5 percent attended private schools, and an additional 31 percent attended fee-collecting public schools. As in most things South African, the gulf between what a minority—even if increasingly multiracial—can access relative to the rest is so enormous as to make for frustrating comparisons. As just one important metric of school quality for which objective data are available, I calculated student-to-teacher ratios for Mogale City primary and secondary schools and found that at the 15 independent schools, the ratio was 12:1, at the 23 fee-collecting public schools it was 24:1, and at the 47 no-fee public schools it was 34:1. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, the neighborhoods (wards) for the fee-collecting public schools were 39 percent Black with just 7 percent of the residents living in informal settlements; the no-fee schools were, on average, 91 percent Black and 27 percent of residents in informal settlements.46 In turn, we should not be surprised when we see inequality reproduced across generations given this state of affairs. Even serious concerns about persistent inequities—wholly reminiscent of the American health and educational systems—should not obscure critical efforts and accomplishments or the challenging context that democratic governments have faced. In both sectors, the government has spent heavily, has vastly widened access, and has made some clear and observable inroads, especially in improving the quality of life and capacities of the very poor. In terms of education, in 2019 the South African government spent approximately 50 percent more as a share of GDP (6.5 percent) compared with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (4.3 percent) or the average of all Upper-middle-income (UMI) countries (4.1 percent).47 And with respect to health, government spending increased substantially over the period 2002–18 such that by the latter year South Africa was also vastly outspending peers from these reference groups (4.4 percent/GDP for South Africa compared with 3.2 percent for UMI countries and 1.9 percent for Africa).48 Moreover, in each sector, democratic processes have contributed to important gains and corrections. Health and Health Care Just a few months after his inauguration, Mandela’s government rolled out as a first signature project a new program offering free health care for all pregnant and nursing women as well as all children under six.49 The newly covered population was guaranteed treatment at all public hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. And to accommodate increased demand, the policy was coupled with the construction of new clinics.50 By 2003, free hospital care was extended to children older than six with disabilities.51 In turn, the share of births attended by professional staff grew from 82 percent in 1994 to 97 percent in 2016.52 And in 2017, South Africa had the highest numbers of physicians, nurses, and midwives relative to the size of the population of all non-island, sub-Saharan African countries.53 FIGURE 7.7. Average life expectancy at birth in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income and African countries (1995–2017). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Owing at least in part to the availability of these inputs and other policies, leading indicators suggest that health and well-being for the most vulnerable have improved. The under-5 mortality rate at the time of Mandela’s election in 1994 was 61 deaths per 1,000, and that dropped to a low of 37.1 by 2017. As depicted in figure 7.7, at the beginning of the democratic period the life expectancy rate in South Africa was the lowest of all Upper-middle-income countries but among the highest of all other African countries. However, it took a profound dip in the late 1990s owing to the rash of deaths from the staggering AIDS epidemic. Once the government finally adopted policies and practices of administering anti-retroviral drug therapy, extending the lives of those living with HIV—responding to political pressures as described in chapter 6—estimated life expectancy quickly returned to an upward trajectory, albeit diminished relative to its economic peers. Indeed, the mushrooming of extraordinarily large HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics at the tail end of the Apartheid era proved to be an overwhelming burden on other aspects of the health-care system. As early as the mid-1990s, more than 10 percent of the adult population aged 15–49 was living with HIV, and by 2000, the incidence (new cases) of tuberculosis was almost 800 per 100,000 people. Both disease burdens were much higher than the typical experience of most African and Upper-middle-income country cohorts or, frankly, countries anywhere in the world.54 While it’s true that the ongoing size of these epidemics in terms of numbers infected can be partially ascribed to early government failures in response, it is also important to point out that both HIV and tuberculosis have remained highly prevalent throughout the southern African region, even in countries like Botswana that responded much earlier and more aggressively (in part because successful treatment has kept people alive). Moreover, the South African government, despite its early flawed response under Mbeki, and after relentless democratic challenges from civil society, went on to embark on the world’s largest AIDS treatment program.55 Today, both its AIDS and tuberculosis government responses are far-reaching and world class—and various studies have identified South Africa as leading the way in best practices.56 Moreover, concerns about poor health and health disparities are not simply a matter of access to formal health care. Better infrastructure and living conditions in the form of clean water, sanitation, and shelter are themselves critically important for healthy outcomes, and progress in those areas contributes to better health outcomes for the very poor and is likely reflected in positive trends in life expectancy and infant mortality. On the other hand, the persistence of vast socioeconomic differences in South Africa will no doubt continue to reproduce inequalities in health outcomes for some time, and even the equalization of health-care resources would almost surely not be sufficient to equalize health outcomes in the near term. Along these lines, particularly in Mogale City, the legacy of the country’s mining economy contributes to widespread environmental risks. Despite the metaphorical status of “gold dust,” the reality is that mining dust is a major health hazard. First, for miners who have worked or continue to work deep in the mines, silicosis—also known as “black lung”—is a debilitating disease acquired from the inhalation of the very fine silica dust generated through the process of extraction. It causes shortness of breath and chest pain and makes individuals more vulnerable to tuberculosis, already widely prevalent in the country. Second, Krugersdorp and other mining towns are replete with mine dumps or tailings. When the wind blows, toxic dust fills the air and seeps into the local streams and canals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the brunt of such environmental degradation is again borne by poor and Black citizens, including in Mogale, especially in and around the mines of Kagiso, which are replete with acid mine drainage.57 One notoriously awful site is the Mintails mine I passed on election day. Within these tailings, scientists have detected arsenic, lead, and other chemicals, frequently radioactive. Nonetheless, children routinely play on toxic mining excavations as if they were sand dunes, as they are not sufficiently guarded from the general public.58 Although concerns about the safe cleanup of such sites rarely find their way into electoral politics, pressure from other democratic institutions has proven important to raise awareness and to apply pressure on businesses and government to take action. I became aware of these concerns through my own involvement with the LRC, as I was introduced to a partner of theirs, Mariette Liefferink, sometimes described as South Africa’s “Erin Brockovich” because of her passionate involvement in environmental issues. On our tour of the area, she pointed out the neglect and failings of various mining corporations to properly close the dormant mines, as well as the ways in which they have tried to avoid taking responsibility by selling off their assets to very small companies that could never afford to pay any claims for damages. She, the LRC, and others have been documenting the extent of environmental degradation and the harms caused and have sought justice for those most affected, especially through the courts. Undoubtedly, the democratic era ushered in the opportunities to pursue such work, first by putting an accent on the indignities leveled against those central and/or proximate to the mining economy; and second by actually securing some compensation for them. They highlight, of course, that much work remains, but they have had some important successes. Most notably, owing to a vast class action suit, in May 2018 the mining companies agreed to an unprecedented 5 billion rand (400 million USD) settlement for thousands of miners suffering from silicosis.59 Education As has been the case for health, in terms of equity of access to schooling, particularly to higher levels of education, we can document substantial progress. For example, I consider the distribution of the highest level of education attained by individuals in the Mogale area on two South African census rounds: 1991 and 2011, and just those individuals aged 19 to 29 in each. This restriction helps us isolate the educational opportunities created before and after 1994. In 1991, close to 70 percent of Whites had completed at least their “matric” year—named for the all-important standardized, national high school completion exam—which is viewed as the critical attainment of credentials for high-paying jobs that demand skills. At that time, not even 20 percent of Blacks had those credentials. And more than 50 percent of Blacks lacked even a completed primary education. By 2011, the gap had substantially narrowed: Blacks gained almost 30 percentage points, with just shy of 50 percent completing at least secondary school, and in this later round, less than 8 percent had not completed primary school. And this did not come at the “expense” of White enrollments: by 2011, secondary school rates among Whites had climbed to 76 percent. When considering the national level—and in comparative perspective—secondary school enrollment was already higher in 1990 than the average for Upper-middle-income countries (and much higher compared with African countries). And all the way until 2018, South Africa at least kept pace with growth in enrollment as compared with both of the reference groups.60 Such broad portraits clearly mask critical nuances with respect to the actual quality of education that students receive, let alone the attainment of education as an ultimate goal. The gaps are troubling, and some studies have even concluded that the quality of education overall has decreased during the post-Apartheid period.61 One often-cited indicator of government failure on education is the fact that South African students have generally performed poorly on international tests.62 This is true. On the other hand, South African students were already performing relatively poorly in 1995, and at least achieved some marginal gains, especially between 2001 and 2011 and particularly among the lowest-performing students. As one nuanced assessment of twenty years of South African education has highlighted, such benchmarks need to be viewed in context—especially the fact that most of the other countries that participate in such testing are far richer.63 While many countries around the world face legacies of uneven and unequal educational systems, few are burdened by a history comparable to that of the Apartheid system’s “Bantu Education,” which deliberately sought to limit the potential of a majority of learners with respect to curriculum and promotion of critical thinking skills, which also affected the training of teachers.64 Combine this with persistent de facto residential segregation, and it is not surprising that huge educational gaps remain across racial lines, as well as between students in free public schools, fee-paying public schools, and private schools, where parents also tend to be more educated.65 A particularly grave affront to human dignity lies with the horrific quality of public educational facilities and instruction in rural areas—outside the industrial Gauteng Province. Eighty or more students are routinely forced to crowd themselves into classrooms, and their schools frequently lack running water, functioning toilets, and well-trained teachers. In one tragic account, first documented in the New York Times66 and that subsequently went “viral” in the South African media, two children drowned in pit toilets in a dilapidated school in Mpumalanga Province. The story juxtaposed the greediness of government officials and the disappearance of millions of dollars of funding next to a tragic and truly unpleasant death of young people, providing powerful fodder for citizen anger. Ten days after the publication of the original article, and no doubt spurred on by the embarrassing revelations, President Ramaphosa announced the launch of a new program, the Sanitation Appropriate for Education Initiative. According to Ramaphosa, the initiative would “spare generations of young South Africans the indignity, discomfort and danger of using pit latrines and other unsafe facilities in our schools.”67 The good news? One NGO subsequently calculated that the initiative resulted in the upgrading of toilets in twenty thousand schools. The bad? The same NGO estimated that at this pace, it would take nineteen years to complete the job on a national scale.68 Did the news story cause the policy change? The proximity of the actions and the responses suggests that it certainly triggered the timing of the reactions, but it’s hard to imagine that the story would have come to light if there were not already so much political attention being paid to sanitary conditions and if civil society organizations and public interest lawyers were not already applying pressure through political campaigns and sometimes through appeals to constitutional law in the courts. Like many gains in a democratic polity, it was victory from a million cuts. For people in remote rural areas, democratic political pressures ultimately led to government actions that would bring visibility and material improvements to their lives. In a polity that valued economic growth above all else, rural schoolchildren might have been deliberately overlooked as a necessary casualty of “development.” In the context of democratic South Africa, at the very least, no one can publicly question the deservingness of these children to receive the same opportunities and services. Continuing to shine a light on deficiencies sometimes elicits action, even if rarely sufficient to close substantial gaps. Palpable Progress, if Incomplete For every material gain I’ve detailed here, one could add valid caveats and qualifications. Electrification? But what about rolling blackouts? Social grants? Those are too small to be meaningful! Housing? Too many people still waiting and the construction is shoddy! All of these are fair concerns and useful grist for the democratic mill. In no country in the world do people think that all of their material needs have been met, and by any objective standard, most South Africans still have much to wish for, not the least of which are better opportunities to work, to earn a steady income, and to gain access to high-quality education and health care. Nonetheless, I think it’s hard to deny that the overall gains have been quite substantial for millions of people who hoped for material comfort and a degree of economic security after Apartheid. When asked, people can document meaningful change. In fact, perhaps this entire book is motivated by the transformation I’ve observed with my own eyes over the past several decades: I have continued to return to the very places I first toured almost thirty years ago, including largely Black townships on the outskirts of the three largest South African cities: Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban. Observable conditions have improved substantially, sometimes dramatically. Back then, raw sewage ran through the streets, and electrical connections were rare. At night, in many areas, high-mast street lamps projected harsh, bright light over large areas, as if for an airport rather than a human settlement. During June and July—wintertime in the southern hemisphere—the putrid smell of burning garbage could sting your nose for miles around as people sought to keep warm. Today, Soweto is a city unto itself, one in which poverty persists, but alongside an increasingly thriving Black middle class with upscale amenities. In Khayelitsha, near Cape Town and Kwamashu, near Durban, and in townships and locations across the country, tarred roads have replaced dirt passageways; more people live in houses and flats (apartments) rather than shacks; and millions more enjoy electricity, lighting, piped water, and flush toilets. Since my first visit to South Africa, I have traveled to every one of the country’s nine provinces and have been to urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Now, having in mind the many other African contexts I have visited in the meantime, including rural and urban Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, it is hard to imagine many South Africans wanting to trade places with their counterparts on the respective socioeconomic ladders of any of the countries north of the Limpopo River. Only in the small (and also democratic) countries of Mauritius, Cape Verde, and Botswana and the small, oil-rich, but not democratic country of Gabon do measured overall levels of service provision consistently approximate what South Africans enjoy.69 And these accomplishments were set against the extremely challenging background of high inequality, a difficult global economic environment, an evaporating mineral economy, and substantial backlogs in the development of human capital. With respect to the latter point, we should not forget that the New South Africa was comprised of millions of Black South African adults who had been previously denied a decent education and yet were called on to run vast government agencies and fill the management ranks of businesses. Moreover, we can blame Jacob Zuma for many things, but not for the global economic meltdown that coincided with the start of his presidency. The social and economic legacies of South Africa’s past have not been easily overcome. Life in the still largely White suburbs around Krugersdorp remains far, far more comfortable than in the townships of Munsieville and Kagiso. Nonetheless, the conditions of the latter have measurably improved, with much greater parity in access to government services. This pattern is repeated in much of the country. Political competition, citizen pressure, and respect for the constitutional order have all contributed to such dignified development and reflect well on the value of democracy in South Africa.",

      "content": "8 Respect, Belonging, and Recognition IN EARLY FEBRUARY, still a few months before the 2019 election, I prepared for a meeting with three of Mogale City’s local religious leaders. Questions about basic service delivery were still very much on my mind. To what extent was the gap between poverty and prosperity being closed in terms of concrete outcomes such as housing, water, electricity, and jobs? Given the importance of religion in the lives of South Africans (three-quarters of citizens say that religion is important to them, as compared with 20 percent or lower in most European countries, China, and Japan)1 and the fact that religious leaders like Tutu and Chikane played such key roles in local and national politics, I was optimistic they could shed valuable light on the political history I was studying. I had contacted Rev. Armando Sontange of the Kagiso Presbyterian Church requesting an interview, and he offered to invite a few colleagues from other churches to join us for a discussion. We agreed to meet around 11 a.m. at the Mugg and Bean, South Africa’s most ubiquitous coffee chain, this one in the bustling Presidential Square shopping center in downtown Krugersdorp.2 Once we placed our orders and exchanged introductions, I threw out a softball question in the hopes of generating some responses: “How have basic housing conditions changed for your congregants during the past twenty-five years?” They nodded that indeed they had seen substantial improvements over this period, and they described aspects of the record I detailed in the previous chapter. Lots of upgrades, but still room for improvement. And always new people moving in. However, as we continued to engage in conversation, they urged me to redirect my focus. “It’s not just about material things,” Sontange said, “but about Ubuntu. About a human being human.” He and his colleagues took turns reminding me of earlier times, when Black people, irrespective of education or occupation, were confined to townships, their lives heavily controlled. For men like them, in their fifties, sixties, and older, the legalized caste-like system of Apartheid South Africa and the everyday indignities it perpetuated were still etched in their memories. They wanted to emphasize the fact that the apparent “normalcy” of three Black men having coffee with a White man in Krugersdorp should still be cherished as a stark departure from the past.3 The term “ubuntu” roughly translates to “humanness,” “humanity,” or “personhood” in several languages spoken in South Africa (Zulu, Xhosa, and Ndebele) and is most commonly associated with the Zulu proverb umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, which translates to “a person is a person through other persons.”4 The concept of ubuntu has been particularly influential in South Africa and in Zimbabwe owing to efforts to promote indigenous philosophies in the aftermath of White rule.5 Much like the analogous term “dignity,” ubuntu is an articulation of a core human value, one that demands moral obligations in various ways, including respect for others, the promotion of harmony, and the reduction of discord. Perhaps unique in their abilities to see through the noise of everyday life, the pastors collectively made the case that post-Apartheid South Africa had come much closer to realizing this ideal at least compared with what they had experienced before. At one point in our conversation, Rev. Monwabisi Moses, from the Kagiso Methodist Church, suggested that I look outside. A line of people moved slowly in pursuit of cash from the automated teller facing the parking lot just outside the Mugg and Bean. He explained that the line was long because the government had deposited social grants into their accounts via electronic transfer that morning. In a Socratic engagement, he asked if I noticed anything “interesting” about the line. FIGURE 8.1. Location of the Mugg and Bean at the President Hyper, Krugersdorp. Slightly embarrassed to always be focusing on race, I nonetheless offered up my first impression, “There’s that one White guy on line, otherwise comprised of Black people.” He nodded with a smile. “During Apartheid, [the line] would only be White people. You see that White guy, even if there were a queue, he would have had a preference. But not today.” At the time we spoke, I still had very little sense of where we were sitting—an artefact of being relatively new to the area and doggedly following the instructions delivered to me by my phone-as-navigational assistant. Just beyond the parking lot lay two sets of conflicting historical legacies with diametrically opposite messages for the core concerns we were discussing. On the one hand, we were less than half a kilometer from the town council’s Centennial Hall, where only a few decades earlier White local councillors had, time and again, voted to maintain the most petty of Apartheid’s discriminatory policies. Layered on top of residential segregation, as late as the 1980s, Krugersdorp still maintained racially separate restrooms. As one Black councillor recounted to me, when she came into town during the Apartheid years she had to use the “Nie Blankes” (Non-Whites) bus stop. The message of profound disrespect was clear and mortally insulting. On the other hand, we were also just eight miles from a 50,000-hectare tract of land, the Cradle of Humankind, which UNESCO declared to be a world heritage site. In 1947, the year before the onset of Apartheid, Robert Broom discovered fossils of early human ancestors of approximately 2.5 million years in vintage—artefacts that changed the way scientists understand the pattern of human development. And in December 1998, far within the depths of the Sterkfontein Caves on this land, located less than ten miles north of the Paardekraal Monument, another research team from Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand unearthed what would amount to the nearly complete skull of a 3.5-million-year-old human ancestor.6 The stunning on-site visitor center—only a decade old—argues strongly in favor of ubuntu philosophy: there is more that unites us in our common ancestry as humans than the superficiality of the various traits that seem to divide us. The idea of “race” that was almost fanatically developed on South African soil, with significant help from Europe and the Americas, is just one of many sources of human diversity. The Cradle offers scientific evidence of shared human origins—the types of facts that undergird calls for universal human rights and the ideal that all humans have inherent dignity, or value, and deserve to be accorded with commensurate levels of respect. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the bitter irony that the immediate dangers and long-term health consequences of the early excavations were disproportionately borne by Black mine workers, let alone the multiple ways in which Black people have been treated with profound disrespect in the area around the Cradle. And to this day, many Black Africans squat and reside in informal settlements on its outskirts, a legacy of the state’s historical lack of appreciation for equal human worth. The existential question—of what our shared humanity ought to mean in practice—thus looms particularly large in Mogale City. The removal of segregated coffee shops, segregated bus stops, and legalized Apartheid was just a starting point. Starting in 1994, South Africans from all of their diverse backgrounds proved they could vote together and select leaders peacefully. And the government began to close some gaps in service delivery. Yet, the fight to end Apartheid was not just about getting the vote, electricity, a flush toilet, or a job. The Freedom Charter, Nelson Mandela’s fiery “I am prepared to die” speech, and the new constitution all explicitly aspired to realize the goal of restoring human dignity. What is dignity, after all? I wanted to make sure I understood what the South Africans had in mind. So I decided to ask around. After our meeting at the Mugg and Bean, I asked Rev. Moses if I could come to his church in Kagiso to pilot the very Historical Memories Survey that I’ve been describing in the chapters of this book, and I would use that opportunity to ask this sample of citizens how they might define the term (in addition to trying out lots of other questions). I hired a young woman from his congregation—a recent university graduate—to work as a research assistant and to conduct interviews in English and Tswana. We posed the following question: “The constitution says that the Republic of South Africa is founded on the value of HUMAN DIGNITY. What does the word DIGNITY mean to you?” We only interviewed twenty-five congregants, a mix of men and women, all over the age of forty, and with few exceptions, their answers were overwhelmingly consistent: dignity is about respect and being valued. “Simply means we need to respect one another and have faith in each other and not be against each other.” “Dignity I would say is to have value to yourself, be respectful, respected wherever you are and be treated equally.” “Dignity to me means respecting other human beings, conducting myself in a manner that doesn’t undermine, discriminate any other human being. Ascribing to values, to norms that are acceptable in the society without undermining anyone.” Given the importance of respectful treatment as a goal and value, in this chapter, I reflect on patterns and trends in human relations during the democratic era. Because race was such a fundamental basis for exclusion and indignity during the period before democracy, I focus here on what the post-Apartheid governments did to try to improve social cohesion, integration, and unity across racial lines, and with what consequences. There are many other dimensions along which citizens in South Africa and elsewhere are frequently made to feel devalued, and I consider a few of those here—in particular, discrimination on the basis of gender and being a foreign national. Once again, a contemporary snapshot of South African society reveals many gaps and shortcomings in the extent of dignified treatment: ongoing racial discrimination, sexism, gender-based violence, and homophobia. And yet, the persistence of everyday headlines and political movements within South Africa to address these shortcomings also reminds us of the value of democracy at work. Individuals, organizations, and even government actors have been steadfastly attempting to transform a society that infamously set standards for forcing people to suffer indignities along so many dimensions in the decades prior to the democratic transition. Without losing sight of the remaining needs, we can also recognize that South Africa has made enormous strides in extending respect for human dignity and, in many ways, has become a global leader in the defense of human rights—and this can be traced to the institutions of the democratic dispensation and the ethos they engendered. Putting Ideals into Actions The idea that an ANC-led government would pursue a nation-building and human-rights agenda to address the country’s racist history had deep roots. The ANC cofounder, Sol Plaatje, espoused such values in his writing and newspapers and in his opposition to the Native Lands Act during the first decades of the twentieth century.7 Like so many of the aspirations of the democratic era, the 1955 Freedom Charter provided a written blueprint to overcome the racial hierarchy and other dimensions of intolerance: “All national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride; The preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime.… All shall enjoy equal human rights!” Forceful appeals to such values would nonetheless leave open the question of how they would be realized in practice. Important answers were revealed in the first years of the Mandela presidency: the enshrining of those values in the new constitution, promoting a new nation-building myth, holding a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, distributing new symbols that would recognize the role of liberation leaders, and developing a set of democratic institutions that would facilitate a more inclusive sense of nationhood. In fact, the totality of government-led initiatives to generate a more inclusive South African society, particularly during the first few years after the 1994 election, was extraordinary. It is hard to identify a government anywhere in the world that has been more deliberate in trying to recognize and to accommodate such a diverse citizenry, with keen attention to rights and respectful treatment. Among its many virtues, the 1996 constitution enumerated various protections to recognize the ubuntu ideal. And although the term “ubuntu” was mentioned explicitly only in the interim 1993 constitution, legal scholars have highlighted that the notion of “dignity” essentially implies a similar norm of respect for the value of all humans and of humanity.8 Section 39 of the constitution would direct courts to “promote the values that underlie an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.”9 And in 1995, the government launched its constitutionally mandated South African Human Rights Commission to raise awareness of, monitor, and seek to protect various human rights. Beyond these written ideals and protections, Munsieville’s favorite son, Desmond Tutu, stepped up to play a pivotal role in the promotion of solidarity in two key nation-building projects designed to further the goal of mutual respect. First, in 1994, Tutu coined the term “rainbow nation” to evoke a positive image of the diverse cultures coming together as one imagined community.10 He had previously described demonstrators of various races participating in a 1989 defiance campaign as the “rainbow people of God.”11 Mandela and other leaders invoked the Rainbow Nation idea, and at least for the first few years of post-Apartheid South Africa, they did so frequently. People on the outside—this author included—ate up the idea that a shared sense of collective identity could be forged in short order, particularly under the tutelage of a small band of Nobel Peace Prize–winning leaders. In a place where national identity had been so important as a legitimating basis for oppression, a new narrative was clearly necessary. Second, Tutu chaired the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), along with Alex Boraine as deputy (he cofounded IDASA, the institute that had hosted peace-building missions during Apartheid). The idea for an amnesty process was already enshrined in the provisional 1993 constitution, justified in ubuntu philosophy: The adoption of this Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South Africa to transcend the divisions and strife of the past, which generated gross violations of human rights, the transgression of humanitarian principles in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear, guilt and revenge. These can now be addressed on the basis that there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for victimisation. In turn, Boraine helped draft the 1995 Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act establishing the TRC, which began its hearings in 1996. The TRC hearings continued on while Amy and I lived in South Africa in 1997 and 1998, and for us, the weekly “Truth Commission Special Report,” hosted by the progressive journalist Max du Preez, was just about the most gripping television we could have imagined. Each week, we sat in front of our small television watching recaps of testimony from a wide cast of characters; and on a few occasions, when hearings were in Cape Town, I sat in the gallery transfixed. The drama frequently involved heavily Afrikaans-accented former government operatives recalling their role in often brutal interrogation and even torture—and then watching them face the families of victims describing their pain and the lasting scars. These hearings often, but not always, concluded with scenes of Black African families—usually, a mother or a grandmother—tearfully hugging the killers of their kin in acts of forgiveness.12 It was an attempt to restore a sense of humanity to people who had been either victims or perpetrators of tragically dehumanizing acts. The commission received 7,127 applications for amnesty, and it listened to and recorded 21,298 statements over a two-year period.13 To be granted amnesty, the commission needed to be persuaded that the acts were politically motivated and directed (which generally meant that they were tied to a specific organizational mission) and that the applicants provided full disclosure for all relevant acts.14 It ultimately granted amnesty in 849 cases and refused it in 5,392,15 almost 70 percent of which were refused because the acts were deemed to have no political objective,16 highlighting that this was not simply a pro forma process. For example, a group of policemen petitioned for amnesty for killing four Black men from Cradock—the birthplace of Paul Kruger—in 1985. The commission was not impressed with the sincerity of the apology or the claim on the part of the White police officers that the murders were either ordered or necessary to achieve their political ends, and their application for amnesty was denied.17 The TRC proved controversial, including with respect to concerns that perpetrators ought to face harsher justice, that victims deserved more generous reparations, and that the whole enterprise would cost a lot and change little. There was no shortage of people involved with the process, or who looked on from the outside, describing it as having been unhelpful and/or unfair.18 Such valid concerns notwithstanding, what would have been better? No amnesty process? A different one—like the Gacaca courts used in post-genocide Rwanda? Those also met a very mixed reaction from the citizenry.19 Indeed, the TRC might have carried out aspects of its mission in different ways. However, it was a central component of the transition and it is hard to imagine—given the history—how a peaceful transition could have moved forward without such a process. Along the way, the commission documented the inner details of a horrific history, and while it certainly did not equate the Apartheid crimes with those committed in the struggle for liberation, it served to acknowledge that many human rights violations also occurred in the latter. It implied a degree of give-and-take in assigning blame that was consistent with the compromising and conciliatory spirit Mandela and Tutu had each advocated. Outside the commission hearings, more visible symbols and iconic imagery inherited from before 1994 would also literally stand out all around the country as reminders of past indignities. They were in tension with the new values and composition of an integrated South Africa, and over the years, many actors have demanded deliberate responses. One strategy has been to transform and to create novel symbols of what it means to be South African. As I mentioned earlier, the national flag and the national anthem were reworked in time for Mandela’s inauguration. And at the finals of the Rugby World Cup in 1995, Mandela reappropriated the old South Africa’s Springbok symbol to be acceptable for the New South Africa. Beyond that, the faces of nightly television news, especially on the South African Broadcasting Company, would always depict the country’s racial diversity. National government media and publications have marketed the ideal of diversity, a strategy that has mostly been mirrored in the private sector as well. A related strategy has been to use museums as a vehicle for telling a new story about nationhood—for consumption by the outside world, visiting school groups, and the general population.20 When Amy and I were living in Cape Town in 1997–98, she worked in the education department of the South African National Gallery and observed curators and staff actively trying to project a more nuanced and diverse portrait of the new nation within the confines of a building that was just steps away from the national parliament. For example, the museum prominently displayed the Butcher Boys, an anti-Apartheid sculpture depicting three gruesome part-human, part-animal figures sitting on a bench. It was intended to critically highlight the banality of dehumanization that transpired under that regime. Fabricated in 1986 by Jane Alexander, the artwork had previously been displayed at Johannesburg’s Market Theater, a venue that managed to welcome multiracial audiences and even perform anti-Apartheid plays for many years before the end of the regime. In 1991, the National Gallery obtained the sculpture, moving it from the sphere of private protest to national treasure, embracing rejection of Apartheid as part of the new national narrative. Cape Town and Johannesburg were rising cosmopolitan cities, within which there was more elite consensus concerning the future direction of the country—at least in terms of disavowing its past. In other parts of the country, however, such reengineering proved to be more fraught. For example, Carolyn Holmes tellingly describes a duo of war memorial museums located at opposite ends of a river near the small town of Dundee in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The first, dedicated in 1947, tells the Afrikaner side of an 1838 battle, and the second, financed and dedicated by the government in 1998, tells the Zulu side. As she explains, even the literal creation of a physical bridge to cross the river and facilitate collective recognition of these perspectives has failed to integrate the predictably distinct sets of patrons who visit each.21 Located on the urban periphery, Mogale City also offers a set of sometimes contradictory messages in its museums. On the one hand, the national visitor’s center to the Cradle of Humankind is thoroughly modern in appearance and hews closely to the inclusive vision of the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Meanwhile, just a few doors away from the downtown Krugersdorp Chicken Licken and facing the Mogale City Hall is the municipality’s local museum, which appeared neglected and run-down when I visited. On display were multiple layers of national stories: one, constructed more recently and hastily, in which Black Africans rose up after a long period of victimhood; and one that was previously understood by Krugersdorpers as the only relevant history, that of White English and Afrikaners forging unity after a period of bitter conflict.22 Presented next to one another, these layers remained separate, as if two distinct histories—much like in Dundee. More frequently viewed than museum exhibitions is the everyday iconography of statues, monuments, and street and place names. In recent years, some White residents have decried the efforts to change names as a waste of time and money. Yet, it is worth recalling that even after the Boer War, at the start of the twentieth century, the victorious British similarly sought to alter the local symbology. For example, they anglicized some of the road and place names from the quintessentially Afrikaner—Kemp and Viljoen—to British ones, such as Tindall, Philips, and Tominson.23 The British also made efforts not to antagonize the previously defeated Afrikaners, and when Lord Chamberlain visited Krugersdorp, he offered to repair the war-time damage to the Paardekraal Monument, and town planning was increasingly implemented with an eye toward balance and fairness across the two White groups—for example, locating a sports ground in between Paardekraal and Coronation Park, respective symbols of Boer and British pride.24 The post-Apartheid government sought to more explicitly recognize iconic resistance leaders and other notable Black individuals, whose contribution to history had been made invisible under Apartheid. Very soon, Black South Africans would see themselves and their leaders in the form of statues and symbols, with their names and languages inscribed on the walls of buildings used in the business of government and on various street signs. A statue of the town’s namesake, the Batswana chief Mogale wa Mogale, stands between city hall and the local museum. Given the regime change, the question had to be raised concerning what to do about the White symbols, especially those closely associated with committing atrocities against Black people throughout the twentieth century and earlier. The approach to this sensitive task has varied to a degree across the country, no doubt a function of the demographics, sentiment, and organization of local populations. For example, Krugersdorp, within Mogale City, is still called Krugersdorp, named after Paul Kruger, whose very resentment of Black people and British abolition of slavery led him to take actions that set South Africa on its path toward extreme racial exclusion. Nationally, and in recent years, the figure most squarely in protesters’ crosshairs has been Cecil Rhodes. For university students in countries around the world, including South Africa, Rhodes’s name has long been associated with academic excellence: it is synonymous with the prestigious fellowship that allows students to study at Oxford. And one of South Africa’s leading universities also bears his name. Just as in the case of America’s Woodrow Wilson, Rhodes’s own history of racism turned out to be too profound to ignore, and owing to his involvement in education, his likeness has literally stared politically active students in the face throughout the post-Apartheid period. Starting in 2015, students at the University of Cape Town forcefully argued for removal of a prominent Rhodes statue. Some protesters flung human excrement at it.25 And it was eventually removed. The effort sparked protests around the country, loosely coordinated on social media with the slogan #Rhodesmustfall. It articulated the idea that respect for the dignity of Black South Africans means not having to look at his figure, literally elevated onto a pedestal. Not surprisingly, such protests have not been without controversy. Just as many American southerners have clung to symbols of the Confederate South, despite the clear offense to African Americans, many White South Africans still value symbols and figures of White icons as sources of pride. Within Mogale City, statues of Kruger and Rhodes can be viewed via a short trip on Voortrekker Drive or on roads named after Afrikaner leaders, Potgieter or Pretorius. Though gated to visitors, Paardekraal remains as a shrine to Afrikanerdom. Representatives from political parties such as the Freedom Front Plus say that these are a part of history and should be viewed as part of a cultural, not political, landscape. Perhaps given the greater numbers and influence of Whites in Mogale, and especially of Afrikaners—and their demonstrated commitment to this symbology—Rhodes and Kruger remained standing as of 2019. And while the efforts described above might be understood as consequences of the give-and-take of democratic practice, democracy itself has provided a powerful recognition of South Africa’s diverse society. In particular, the proportional representation electoral institutions have facilitated a strong degree of “descriptive” representation26—that is, where the racial (and gender) composition of legislatures resembles that of their constituents—at all levels of government. For example, after the 2016 election, approximately 18 percent of Mogale’s councillors were White, 4 percent Indian, and 78 percent Black African; and approximately one-third were women, which came much closer to the actual population demographics than any represented body ever in the history of the country. While it’s true that when Ramaphosa took office in 2017 he was the fifth Black African man from the ANC in a row to be president—a pattern that is likely to continue—the office has been held by individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds: Mandela and Mbeki were Xhosa, Motlanthe a Pedi, Zuma a Zulu, and Ramaphosa a Venda. Overcoming the Racial Divide? Such initiatives, policies, and practices could only encourage, not determine, how people in this divided society would treat one another and, in turn, whether they would feel respected and valued. Could deliberate efforts to reverse three and a half centuries of institutionalized racism create a respectful and unified nation within the span of twenty-five years? In a word, no.27 It is impossible to ignore the obvious: race is still the basis for huge social, political, and economic divides in South Africa, particularly in cities and on the urban periphery, which are racially diverse (as compared with many rural municipalities which are 99 percent Black African). In prior chapters I’ve described the substantial leveling of political rights across racial boundaries and the partial but very far from complete effort to reduce the material gaps in racial inequality. In each case, legacies still overshadow modern efforts. And not surprisingly, all of this, alongside awareness of the country’s political history, contributes to suspicion and lack of trust across groups, and between citizens and the state. For Americans, the story will sound eerily familiar, especially since we have a longer history of anti-discrimination policy, and yet racial inequalities and evidence of the pernicious effects of discrimination remain powerful and everyday features of life in our society. Nonetheless, given the starting point of the late 1980s and early 1990s, there’s been measurable progress in race relations and even nation-building under democratic government. Consider first the situation of Mogale City: for my Historical Memories Survey, one criterion for inclusion in the study was that the respondents had to have actually lived through at least a few years of Apartheid and its aftermath. I asked them to compare their present life (in 2019) to what it was like under Apartheid, specifically in terms of how they were treated by people from other race groups. A full 47 percent of Black respondents said they were treated better now, while 23 percent said worse now, and 24 percent said things had not changed.28 Of those who said everyday life had improved on this dimension, many adopted a stance similar to the one advanced by the three pastors: Don’t lose sight of how things once were. I asked about their hopes pre-1994 and their reflections on the period 1994–99, and unprompted, a great many referred to their optimism and subsequent happiness about not having to carry a “dompas” or pass. “When Mr. Nelson was out of jail he made sure that there was no violence, we stopped carrying dompas, our identity documents changed, and we were allowed to vote.” “We could all walk around free without carrying any dompas.” “We are not slaves, we have a choice not to be slaves or work as domestic workers. We walk free in our streets without carrying a dompas and we can enter any restaurants.” Understandably, for many others, merely being “free from slavery” in the sense of the end of draconian Apartheid legislation was too low a bar to celebrate. Many expected more, and received less, especially in the early years of the transition. For example, in an extended interview, Pamela Esso, who in her activist youth and participation in the Soweto uprising was hopeful for change, recalled that she continued to experience harsh discrimination in the area even into the 1990s, as the country underwent its transition. After years of hard work as a government-employed nurse, she wanted her family to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle. In 1992, about a year after the removal of the Group Areas Act that restricted where Blacks could live and own property, Esso decided to build a house from scratch in a Krugersdorp suburb. She could afford a place with all of the modern amenities and wanted to live in an area that was fully serviced by the municipality and among neighbors. Esso knew that they would be living around White people, mostly Afrikaners—in fact, they would be the very first Black family in the neighborhood—but she was not deterred. When the Essos finally moved in, the neighbors didn’t show up with welcoming meals. And she did not receive any invitations to visit anyone in their homes. Instead, her house was repeatedly robbed and vandalized, and neighbors called her and her family names. Local kids harassed her children on the way to school, once they arrived at school, and on their way back home. Esso told me this story while sitting beside her adult daughter, who nodded and grimaced as she was reminded of this painful past. By the late 1990s, some of the hostility seemed to subside. But her family never felt welcome. Esso told me she could not recall instances of White South Africans being kind to her. Her account was by no means unique: various Black political leaders, activists, and ordinary citizens, particularly around Mogale City, highlighted to me how at every turn, their intelligence and integrity were questioned by Whites, including work colleagues. In my survey, many Black residents said they perceived enduring resentment from Whites, and that Whites did not view them as being fully human: “Fear divides Black and White because most White people fear that Black people are monkeys and we are full of ourselves.”—42-year-old woman in Ward 4 “We are divided because of color of skin. White people have better jobs and even if we have the same position at work they earn more money than Blacks.”—44-year-old woman in Ward 27 “Life between Black and White is different because of culture they have and they hate the Black people’s culture.”—63-year-old man in Ward 4 “Apartheid has played a role in a division of South Africans—for example, you can’t eat with a White person in the same table because they are disgusted by Black people, they call Black people pigs.”—49-year-old man in Ward 26 For the most part, Black South Africans recalled the period before democracy as one filled with painful and fraught memories, disrespect and discrimination. But there were exceptions, and Black South Africans who lived through Apartheid recalled a wide range of experiences. For example, Bobie Tlapu, a fiery Black EFF councillor in his sixties, spoke of being treated like a family member on a White farm. And some, like the Black DA councillor Margaret Mohube, described frustration with the violent nature of the anti-Apartheid struggle even as she supported the goals of the political activists. Whites described their frustrations with the state of race relations, but from a very different perspective. If there were ever a spirit of White regret for Apartheid and hopeful reconciliation around Mogale City, it was not palpable to me in 2019. In interviews and more casual conversations, many bristled at the very premise that racial prejudice directed at Blacks was a concern worth exploring further; and if anything, the tables had turned. Younger (White) adults were quick to point out, “This was not our fault. Why are we being blamed?” In terms of older adults, it is so difficult to find anyone willing to admit they ever supported Apartheid that one might conclude that this whole set of institutions was forced on them by an out-of-touch, alien government. Amanda de Lange, a Freedom Front Plus councillor, described in an interview with me her recollection of the past with memories distinct from the ones Black citizens shared: From the mid-1970s, I grew up in the countryside. We were very innocent and naive. We were still friends on the farms with the Black children. My best friends were Black boys and girls; when I visited my grandparents’ farm, we had fun, we did naughty things and we were all over the farm. I didn’t have White friends at that stage … I didn’t understand where all of these political issues came from. I didn’t get this Apartheid thing and “you guys are oppressing us.” Then this thing came up, and people were spending a lot of time on it, and there was a lot of upheaval in those years. Then we got blamed … for this Up until this day, I feel like we are blamed for things, we were dead good country folks … we don’t all understand this. I heard similar sentiments time and again from Whites. Jacqueline Pannall, a DA councillor, said that her father’s workers “were like our family. We never saw color. We weren’t raised to see color.” Most White South Africans conceded that Blacks were once treated unfairly, but they also argued that the time had come to stop demanding apologies or for their privileged position in the present. And they routinely recounted, “We were not racist.” Such views echoed the White responses to a nationwide survey fielded in late 2016, asking, “Which one of the following categories best describes you when thinking about the injustices of South Africa’s past?” Among Whites born in 1970 or earlier (and thus aged twenty or older at the time De Klerk released Mandela), less than one-third accepted the notion of racial privilege, which included 5 percent who described themselves as “Perpetrators,” 22 percent as “Bystanders,” and 6 percent as “Beneficiaries.” As for the rest, 15 percent said they were “Victims,” 10 percent were “Resisters,” and 41 percent said they could not be described by any of those terms.29 In a survey the previous year, a full 31 percent of Whites said they felt racially discriminated against “often” or “always”—as compared with 12 percent of Black Africans who reported discrimination in the current dispensation.30 In Mogale, the White respondents amplified this point:31 “Race is the biggest divide. The government forces racial hatred on the public.”—54-year-old man in Ward 22 “The biggest divide is the BEE policy [affirmative action] because it excludes other races in the country.”—53-year-old man in Ward 32 “Black people want to exterminate White people.”—46-year-old woman in Ward 17 “Black people cannot tolerate White people.”—63-year-old woman in Ward 22 White South Africans continue to command more power and more external attention than their size in the population would warrant, and I recognize that I may be perpetuating this pattern by the extent of attention they receive in the pages of this book. However, like in other countries with economically dominant minorities,32 the advent of democracy invited theoretical and quite practical questions of whether they would be ruthlessly targeted in a post-Apartheid dispensation and/or act as spoilers. Indeed, as I discussed earlier, many Whites in Mogale City actually expected some form of coordinated revenge for the past and/or worried about total political domination under multiracial democracy. More recently, survey responses, interviews, and reports in the media all point to a common refrain: a large share of Whites feel aggrieved in the New South Africa. Many, and certainly in Mogale City, prefer what was to what is. This is not entirely surprising given that 1994 marked a stark reversal of political fortune in terms of relative power and influence. To be sure, the post-Apartheid government has implemented a number of policies to favor Black Africans. Like the young man I met on his way to the voting booth in May 2019, many others say that were it not for their skin color, they would have much greater opportunities in terms of university acceptance, jobs, and other areas. But is that unfair? Of course, fairness, like success, is in the eye of the beholder. In Mogale City, and in most other parts of the country, many White South Africans complain that they pay high taxes and yet must also pay for private security and sometimes for essentially private provision of other services, such as personal generators. Moreover, they point to being unfairly targeted as victims of violence and generally ignored by government. Like several other relatively privileged minorities in the world—including Catalans in Spain and certain sections of the White population in the United States—they too are essentially making claims for greater respect for their dignity. Representing the most conservative and largely Afrikaner segment of the population, Afriforum is an organization that has tried to raise such concerns, as well as related issues of Afrikaner dignity. It has argued against changing place-names (for example, from Pretoria to Tshwane) and removing Afrikaner statues. Their complaints have sometimes gained the sympathies of White nationalists in other countries, including the prize of a coveted tweet from President Donald Trump in August 2018. He expressed concern that large-scale killings of White farmers and takeovers of their farms needed to be investigated.33 Afriforum’s active media campaigns have helped to reinforce a conventional wisdom among a broader White population that they have been unduly victimized since the end of Apartheid, and especially in recent years. Undoubtedly, there have been some brutal and tragic murders of White farmers, and there have been several notable land invasions.34 Yet, it’s also hard to ignore the bigger picture that by and large, White South Africans have been extremely fortunate in the post-Apartheid dispensation, and their collective complaints are vastly disproportionate to realities. They continue to enjoy an enormously high quality of life and have paid a relatively minimal price in terms of net material transfers. Despite the grave atrocities committed by the White government and many within society, they were offered a truth and reconciliation process, not large-scale revenge. And compared with the extent of crime and violence that Black Africans face, the reality for White South Africans is one of relative security. Of the 20,000 murders recorded in the year prior to Trump’s tweet, just 46 were White people killed on farms.35 One study highlights the ways in which Afriforum managed to gain outsized domestic attention to a statistically very rarely occurring phenomenon by effectively rebroadcasting brutal imagery.36 Post-Apartheid governments have actually protected Whites in various ways. Several instances of anti-White and anti-Afrikaner hate speech have received enormous media attention, have been condemned by the SA Human Rights Commission and other bodies, and, in a few rare occasions, have been sanctioned or punished.37 In Mogale City, where a disproportionately large share of the country’s otherwise very small poor White population resides, the government has provided the same social protections, including RDP houses, that Black South Africans receive. In short, it would be very hard to maintain the argument that the dignity of White South Africans has been substantially disrespected during the era of multiracial democracy. Moreover, notwithstanding these sentiments, we still must ask, has there been change in terms of intergroup relations? Both in terms of attitudes and behaviors, I think the answer, unequivocally, is yes. For example, Gauteng residents were asked in a survey whether “interracial dating/marriage is acceptable.” In Mogale City, 66 percent of Whites agreed, while a sizable, but much smaller 18 percent disagreed with the proposition. The very foundations of Apartheid were built on the notion that Whites and Blacks were so different, they were almost different species. Now, about two-thirds of Whites were rejecting this premise. Meanwhile, 79 percent of Blacks agreed and 12 percent disagreed that interracial marriage was acceptable.38 By comparison, in the United States in 2009, just 63 percent of all Americans, and 61 percent of Whites, said they would be “fine if a family member were married to someone of a different race/ethnicity.”39 Relatedly, for over three decades, the World Values Survey has been asking citizens around the world to identify “who would you not like to have as a neighbor.” And when they were interviewed in 1982, as shown in figure 8.2, more than 40 percent of a representative sample of South African Whites said “someone from a different race group.” That statistic dropped dramatically to 13 percent in 1996 and has gone up and down since, but it has certainly remained well below the Apartheid-era level of widespread animosity. While just over 10 percent of Black South Africans mentioned someone of another race in 1982, that figure increased somewhat, peaking at 28 percent of Blacks mentioning this bigoted preference in 2001, but by 2006, this dropped to a historic low of 8 percent, and then went back up to 19 percent in 2013. While Black intolerance has increased markedly, and should not be ignored, it is also not nearly as widespread as White racial intolerance twenty-five years earlier. Even among people from whom one might have expected resentment, contemporary attitudes can be surprisingly embracing of the other. Eunice Sagathle was an activist with the anti-Apartheid UDF and detained in 1986 at the age of fourteen at Krugersdorp Prison for a year and a half. By the mid-1980s, thousands of young people under the age of eighteen, some as young as ten years old, were similarly imprisoned and treated like adults.40 Nonetheless, she went on to get an education, including as a student at the University of Bophuthatswana, and took advantage of an opportunity to participate in a student exchange program in Norway. When I spoke with her in 2019, she was working in the Mogale administration after many years serving as a local councillor. As an ANC member, she described the challenges her party faces, but I was surprised by her response when I asked her about the (White) opposition: “I must say I like them, they are not like [at the national level]. They are very passionate about the development of the city. As the Speaker, I had a good working relationship with them. Even now I have a good working relationship with them.” FIGURE 8.2. Aversion to having a neighbor of a different race in South Africa (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi and Afrob_2015. In practice, intergroup tolerance and acceptance is largely practiced at arm’s length, and multiracial families are still very much the exception. For example, analyzing the composition of households included in a nationally representative survey from 2016, I found that just under 4 percent included at least one pair of related individuals from different race groups; and of that, most mixed households only included people of color (i.e., Black Africans, Coloureds, or Indian/Asians).41 What about national sentiment? Do South Africans increasingly see themselves as part of one nation? A “rainbow nation”? That is, a political community tied to the South African state in which diversity of background and culture is shared and mutually respected among its members. If Apartheid implied the separation of race and (Black) language groups, has there been a coming together at least in terms of a shared attachment to the larger nation? It wasn’t completely crazy to think that this was possible—recall that English and Afrikaners fought a bloody and bitter war at the turn of the twentieth century, and despite lingering cultural chauvinism, most Whites came to see themselves as part of a shared (White) nation within a few decades. FIGURE 8.3. Pride in being South African (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi. Note: 4-point response scale recoded to 0–1, with 1 representing “very proud.” Lines depict average scores by race group. Over the course of six waves of the World Values Survey, respondents were asked, “Are you proud to be South African?” As shown in figure 8.3, White and Black South Africans trended in exactly opposite directions for the history of the survey. As one might expect,42 very few Black South Africans reported feeling proud in the first survey in 1982 (just 36 percent saying “very proud” as compared with 75 percent of Whites). In 1990, similar proportions of both groups said they were very proud. More Blacks tended to increase to a peak of 81 percent in 2006, falling to 68 percent in 2013. By 2013, over 80 percent of Whites and over 90 percent of Black Africans said they were “proud” or “very proud.” Notwithstanding some ups and downs, that might seem to be quite a strong showing for the nation-building project. To be fair, when asked this way, the question allows citizens to think about the South African nation however they want—and not necessarily as the multiracial nation envisioned in the constitution, let alone by Desmond Tutu. Twenty-five years after Mandela’s election, in my survey of Mogale residents, I asked respondents to reflect on this question: “Let’s talk about what it means to be a South African. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once talked about the idea of a Rainbow Nation in South Africa. For some people, this meant a coming together and unity of people from different languages and races. Which of the following statements BEST approximates your view?” The answer was clear: the most ambitious ideals of multiracial nation-building had not yet been realized. Only 28 percent of those interviewed said that Tutu’s ideal had been realized or might be relatively soon. By contrast, “I am not convinced that South Africans can ever come together to be a rainbow nation” was the preferred response for 31 percent of the sample. Nevertheless, there were more doubters and fewer optimists in a national sample of South African public opinion in 1994, when 36 percent said the country would continue to be comprised of different nations. Although Black Africans were much more optimistic than Whites in the earlier, national sample, in the 2019 survey of Mogale residents, the distribution of answers was extremely similar across race groups.43 South African citizens seem to feel attached to the country—and perhaps it is this very attachment that has made political contests such high-stakes endeavors. For example, one survey asked, “Do you agree or disagree with the following—‘I would rather be a citizen of South Africa than of any other country in the world.’ ” Reference to “country” is clearly different from reference to a “people” or “nation” but still reflects a commentary on the collective, and 85 percent of those surveyed agreed, including 69 percent of Whites, who have been most likely to leave South Africa for other shores.44 Respect for the Dignity of Women? While I have mostly focused on concerns about racial and income/class inequalities, I think most observers would agree that South Africa has long been a male-dominated society. The country’s extreme brand of institutionalized White supremacy involved the explicit control of sexuality and gender relations, which contributed to a more thoroughgoing form of patriarchy. This was most obvious in various laws prohibiting marriage and sexual relations across the color bar throughout the twentieth century. Different laws and penalties for men and women who violated those laws were also reflected in different social norms and expectations across gender lines. Income, power, status, and wealth all accrued disproportionately to men. Even comparatively, White South Africa was a laggard compared to some of its peers: White women were only granted the right to vote in 1930—well after suffrage was achieved by women in the settler societies of New Zealand (1893), Australia (1901), Canada (1918; but only for federal elections), and the United States (1920). The first woman, Leila Reitz, was elected to the House of Assembly in 1933, and Helen Suzman,45 who served as a Member of Parliament for thirty-six years, was an outspoken voice against Apartheid. In both cases, those women spent several years as the only women in an otherwise all-male assembly. The liberation movement arguably made some significant gains with respect to female empowerment. Various women’s organizations were founded throughout the decades of Apartheid, some multiracial, some not. For example, the Black Women’s Federation was created with inspiration from the Black Consciousness movement in 1975, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela served as an executive member. Women across racial groups and socioeconomic classes played pivotal roles in the struggle against racial inequality, dating back to struggles against the pass system in the early 1910s, and these were recognized by key liberation leaders.46 Nonetheless, Apartheid left a gendered legacy of poverty in South Africa,47 and the fight for gender equality was consistently subordinated to that for racial equality until the late 1980s.48 Women were only granted full membership in the ANC at the time the organization’s Women’s League (ANCWL) was founded in 1943. And although a multiracial coalition of women helped draft an initial Women’s Charter that called for the removal of all laws and customs denying equal rights to women in anticipation of the Congress of the People in 1955,49 they were often relegated to secondary roles within movements.50 The political transition ushered in during the early 1990s provided a clear opening to make needed change. And once again channeling language from the Freedom Charter, the authors of the 1996 constitution declared the republic to be founded on not just the values of human dignity and non-racialism but also non-sexism. In turn, various institutions were established with the explicit goal of “mainstreaming” gender issues into South Africa’s legislation and public policies.51 Reflecting today on the record, the results are similar to what I’ve described along the racial dimension: progress has been significant, clearly more rapid and thoroughgoing than during any other period in South African history. Perhaps most notably, after almost a century of virtually all-male legislatures, following the 1994 election, 111 (of 400) women were seated in Parliament. Many went on to have a considerable impact on substantive policy issues and legislation.52 As the ANC was the only political party with a gender quota at the time, it accounted for 90 (81.1 percent) of these seats.53 Women’s representation in Parliament has been amplified in the form of parliamentary committees including, for example, the establishment of the Women’s Budget Initiative, which pushed for government ministries to consider gender issues in the formulation of their budgets.54 By 2019, South Africa ranked tenth among all countries in the world in terms of the number of women in Parliament.55 As shown in figure 8.4, under Apartheid, South Africa truly lagged in terms of rates of female political empowerment, particularly compared with other Upper-middle-income countries. When considering female political empowerment—measured in terms of women’s civil liberties, civil society participation, and descriptive representation in political positions—the South African record shot up in 1994 and stayed very high relative to the rest of the countries. Similarly, in terms of gender-based exclusion—denial of access to services or participation based on gender identity—again, South Africa compares particularly favorably relative to other countries, but only beginning in 1994. In 2019, South Africa ranked 66th out of 167 countries on the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security overall empowerment index, virtually tied with Namibia, Mauritius, and Rwanda as the overall leaders for Africa, a region that otherwise populates most of the bottom rankings internationally.56 FIGURE 8.4. Female political empowerment scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. These broad patterns belie important caveats and remaining concerns. Scholars have frequently found that because of lack of resources and/or insufficient commitment within government agencies, the impact of gender oversight commissions is often limited.57 And the country’s electoral system ensures that parliamentarians are vulnerable to party discipline, which limits the substantive ability of female parliamentarians to strike out on their own without the blessing of generally male-dominated party leadership. And following South Africa’s democratic transition, the women’s movement became increasingly fragmented and demobilized due both to the recruitment of its most competent leaders to the political system and to the ANC Women’s League’s declining prominence.58 And while it is true that at least a few female politicians can be found in the upper rungs in all of the leading parties, nationally and in Mogale City, top leadership remains a very male-dominated club, and the country has yet to seriously consider a woman for the position of state president. These facts are not lost on the female politicians in Mogale City, including Noluthando Mangole, the Black ANC Speaker; Eunice Segatlhe, the Black former ANC Speaker and current government bureaucrat; Amanda de Lange, the White Afrikaans-speaking FF+ councillor; or Sharon Govindasamy, an Indian DA councillor. In so many ways, these women could not be more different in terms of their personal backgrounds and policy preferences. But in my separate conversations with them, they each had remarkably similar responses to my line of inquiry on at least one question: that is, on the issue of how they are treated as women within their parties and in South African society. Mangole was born and raised in Munsieville. At council meetings, she is responsible for keeping meetings in order and councillors in line, following rules of debate, and so forth and has a commanding presence in the chamber. Despite being in the number two position in council, she worried about what she saw as reversing trends in gender parity: Remember that the gender issue was brought by the ANC Women’s League into government.… But that discussion is also now fading away. The ANC took a decision that said in the deployment you can have 50–50 or can have 60–40 in favor of women. But that is fading away. For example, [look at] the ANC outcomes of elections in 2017, you see one female and five males. When you would have expected at least three females, three males. It’s about power relations. Segatlhe, also from Munsieville, decried the problem of men sidelining outspoken women. In politics, nowadays when you are vocal, when you can stand your ground, if you are principled, they put her aside, “she talks too much,” they just put you there, “she thinks she is educated,” they just put you there, and it is such a pity, because even those women who are in leadership positions today here, you’ll find that they are there, but not there, because their male counterparts are telling them when to speak and when to raise issues which is so unfortunate.… Lots and lots of female leaders that are unemployed with degrees and because they are independent thinkers they are sidelined. De Lange similarly told a story of unfinished business. Despite representing a small, minority party, she cast a strong presence in local politics, speaking often in meetings and writing to the Krugersdorp News on a regular basis. Nonetheless, she highlighted a male-dominated culture within the party that creates a “glass ceiling” for competent female leaders. The FF+, being the conservative party that it is, stemmed mainly from the male fraternity and I think it’s always been like that. There have always been good and competent women, but they never wound up in the structures or the senior positions, leadership positions. Only of late, since the rest of the country and the opposition parties started to push women forward, that the awareness was created, that we needed to move with it, because we were still seen as a men’s party, or a party where men featured and men ruled. Before me, there were many women who were very good and they sort of just dwindled away … I do find still that some of the very senior leadership is still not acceptable to the fact, that I am not just a woman, but outspoken and decisive, and I come with my ideas and it should be incorporated because of the merits, and not declined because it’s a woman who brings it to the table. It is still difficult, yes. She argued for a greater representation of women in the seats of power toward better ends. I certainly feel that if we had more women in senior positions in this country, matters would have been much more stabilized because women just bring a sense of stability in any community and any organization. It’s just because, and I don’t want to generalize, but I think history has taught us that men are more inclined to go for war, whereas women are more level-headed. Again I don’t want to generalize, I just think women bring more stability. I’ve seen it in places where I’ve worked. I’ve seen it everywhere. I do believe if we could have more women and stronger women in power we could definitely see a lot of changes in this country. And as for Govindasamy, another woman who described for me a very full daily agenda in her work as a PR councillor and was active in her home ward of Azaadville, she largely echoed the views of her councillor colleagues from rival parties. In some ways, this was most surprising, as the DA has had a woman as its national leader (Helen Zille), and the Mogale City local leadership of her party is also largely female. But she said that when it comes time to make decisions around advancement, male perspectives dominate: “I think we are being downplayed in South Africa. [There are] more women as councillors, but more men are promoted to status positions. It’s tough being a woman in politics.” Beyond questions of political leadership, in recent years, concerns for the dignity of women have come to the fore as various activists have tried to shine a light on gender-based violence. As just one example, the 2019 rape and murder of a university student set off a wave of protest marches and demonstrations across the country. In turn, more perpetrators of such violence are being held accountable, and the critical issue has attracted unprecedented attention from government and society. Both the ANC and the DA included mention of gender-based violence in their respective 2019 election manifestoes. But the problem of this highly prevalent and grave indignity is very far from being solved. (Lack of) Respect for the Dignity of Foreigners While the post-Apartheid South African governments have clearly and deliberately pursued far more inclusionary approaches than any of their predecessors, almost any nation-building process inevitably bumps up against a difficult problem: the task of defining who is South African, entitled to the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and who is not. And just as countries around the world have, in recent years, been forced to reconsider how open or closed they would like to be with respect to people traveling across borders in search of new opportunities, so too have the South Africans. In practice, the country has not been regarded as very welcoming, to say the least. Throughout South Africa’s history, various attempts to build harmony, solidarity, or nationhood among some have accompanied the harsh exclusion of others. When Paul Kruger and his Voortrekkers arrived in the area around what would become Mogale City, to build their Afrikaner community, they used force to relegate a group of Black Africans—the Ndebele—to an area that would later become Zimbabwe. When Kruger tried to build the South African Republic as a sovereign state for Afrikaners, he despaired of the British, American, and other foreigners who came in search of gold. And sustained interest in that gold was at the root of a war that generated concentration camps and graves, again, a short walk from where I was sitting having coffee with the three pastors. The new Union of South Africa, born in 1909, bridged intra-White divides alongside the near total exclusion of Black Africans, despite the fact that the latter constituted the overwhelming numerical majority in the region. And just as when foreigners flocked to the area in search of gold in the late nineteenth century, the end of Apartheid came to resemble another gold rush. Particularly given all of the advantages I have described with respect to the benefits of being South African relative to other countries, it is not surprising that so many Africans would come to their southern neighbor in search of better opportunities. Whatever challenges South Africans face, the situation in almost all of the rest of Africa is worse. This is most evident with respect to the Ndebele people in modern Zimbabwe. In fact, the founding king of the Matabele Kingdom (of the Zimbabwean Ndebele, also known as Northern Ndebele), Chief Mzilikazi, was himself from South Africa’s Zululand. Through conquest, he had settled in the area around modern Mogale City, especially in the Magaliesberg mountains. When the Afrikaners arrived during the Great Trek, they defeated Mzilikazi in military conflicts, forcing him and his Ndebele followers to retreat to the north. As far as I know, the modern South African state affords no special path for citizenship for these descendants, despite the fact that approximately one million culturally similar Ndebele live as South Africans today. Zimbabweans, and other Africans for that matter, came to be recognized as foreigners. Reports of violence targeted at foreign nationals emerged almost immediately after the country’s transition to democracy in 1994.59 The first, most notable outbreak was almost fourteen years later, on May 11, 2008, in Alexandra township, a place primarily known for its history of anti-Apartheid activism.60 Over the course of approximately two weeks, violence spread to other urban areas in the country61 and led to approximately 60 deaths—in addition to over 700 seriously injured and 100,000 displaced residents.62 Then-president Thabo Mbeki was widely criticized for his initial characterization of these attacks as random acts of criminality.63 The prevalence of xenophobic attitudes in South Africa was acknowledged as early as the late 1990s in government policy documents,64 and research carried out two decades later suggests that such violence became normalized.65 As in other places where anti-immigrant violence is rife, many theories have been advanced as to why, and there is no single answer, especially as the migrants themselves are quite varied in their origins and activities, as are the local contexts where they settle. Some migrants are perceived to be economic threats in competing for jobs and/or are resented for their success in building new businesses. Some are resented for their cultural differences, some for antisocial behavior. On a national survey conducted in 2015, 63 percent of South Africans said immigrants cause increases in crime; 44 percent said they bring disease; and 64 percent said they use up the country’s resources, again with little difference in the distribution of responses across race groups.66 Nationally, and certainly in Mogale City, citizens blame many of the long-standing challenges of the country on these foreigners—a blanket act of scapegoating. Along these lines, a few comments recorded on the Historical Memories Survey were quite typical of widespread sentiment: “Foreigners are a threat to us. All South Africans must stick together to keep them out.”—63-year-old White man from Ward 26 “Foreigners are selling drugs while Pakistanis are raping our kids, they take all our jobs and bring rotten food in South Africa.”—52-year-old Black woman from Ward 23 The editor of the Krugersdorp News said to me with respect to border security, “So many South Africans agree with Donald Trump … what he’s trying to do.” I gasped. A wall? The idea had not been seriously raised by any South African politicians. But on my survey of Mogale residents, I asked whether they agreed with this statement: “The Government must urgently secure the borders to keep out foreigners.” More than 70 percent of Whites and more than 70 percent of Blacks selected 10—fully agreed.67 The South African story resonates widely with other postcolonial accounts of growing intolerance of “others,” including in Rwanda and Ivory Coast. Tragically, the development of a sense of membership and belonging frequently goes hand in hand with efforts to exclude. Reconciliation: A Dream Deferred It would be easy to focus on a snapshot of human relations in South Africa and find much that is wanting relative to an ideal benchmark of universal respect for human dignity. Relatedly, South Africans in all their diversity have not yet cohered into a strong and inclusive nation. Nonetheless, a fair assessment of human relations and government-citizen relations during the democratic era reveals a profound set of transformations that ought not be taken for granted in a country that literally was at civil war along several dimensions in the years just prior to the 1994 election. Social boundaries that once appeared impenetrable are breaking down. Relative to generations of South Africans, frankly for the whole of modern history, those who have faced indignities because of who they are—for example, along the lines of race or gender—now have recourse in ways that were previously never available. South African government policy is also remarkably inclusive of members of the LGBTQ community, those with disabilities, and other groups. To a degree, these trends mirror those in other countries at approximately the same time, but it is worth noting that in many African countries, state leaders have strongly resisted greater tolerance and acceptance, particularly with respect to gender and sexual orientation. In South Africa’s democratic context, it became the first on the continent to legalize same-sex civil unions. And in no African country has there been more deliberate progress toward protecting respect for human dignity than in South Africa of the past quarter century. The end of Apartheid did not preordain that the country would become the leader it now is in the promotion of human rights in Africa, with unparalleled domestic capacity to monitor and to protect those rights on the part of government and nongovernment organizations. The ongoing quest to extend respect for human dignity and to raise the bar for what that implies has been enabled and fueled by democratic government and competitive politics.",

      "content": "9 The Final Tallies SOUTH AFRICA’S WINTER sun was already setting by the time I arrived back at my Krugersdorp guesthouse, the Rabbit Hole, a little after 5 p.m. on May 8. The polls for the 2019 election would officially close in less than four hours. I parked my car in one of the covered spots, a late attempt to shield it from further aviary attack. When I returned to my room, I kept my jacket on and fired up the electric space heater, as a cool day had turned into a cold night. And now it was time to learn what the South Africans had collectively decided about this election and to reflect on the broader democratic experiment in this divided society. The television was filled with scenes much like the ones I had witnessed earlier: people waiting in lines, usually short ones, and emerging from voting booths more or less happy to have done their civic duty. Various commentators, election commission officials, and police officers addressed concerns that had been raised throughout the day. One video of a lone man in Limpopo Province carrying a voting box, presumably with nefarious intent, had gone viral. A few polling stations never opened, and a few others ran out of ballots. In response, the officials credibly assured the public that these had been isolated incidents, and in their estimation, it had been a valid election. Some of the smaller parties nonetheless raised charges of unfair electoral procedures and threatened legal action against the state. I was immediately skeptical of the veracity of these challenges because in order to appear on the ballot, each party had to put up 200,000 rand for the national election, and/or 45,000 for the provincial one, and if they didn’t win at least one seat, the money was not returned. Such policies were designed to discourage extremely low-support organizations from overwhelming the ballot list. The IEC might not have liked all the headaches associated with the 48 parties in the national contest, but at least they got to keep over 16 million rand (at the time, about a million U.S. dollars) worth of deposits from the losers.1 The IEC promised the results would be available no later than Saturday, and counting began immediately on that Wednesday evening. By the middle of the day after the election, the numbers were showing that the ANC was in strong shape to win the national election, albeit with the universally predicted diminished majority. Gauteng Province, however, was a nail-biter. One interim count had the ruling party at 49.5 percent, and I imagined emotions at various party headquarters were running high: if the ANC just barely failed to get a majority, at least one small party might realize its dream of becoming a “king-maker” in a coalition government. Meanwhile, confirming preelection polls, the DA was already looking like the big loser relative to their high hopes following years of upward growth. While the country was still in electoral purgatory awaiting final results, I went to follow up with several of the people I had gotten to know around Mogale City over the previous five months to get their take. I had spent a lot of time over at the Krugersdorp News, talking to reporters and looking through their old bound volumes. I emailed the editor and asked if I could chat with her and a few of the reporters about what everyone had observed and heard, and I would share my impressions as well. She kindly accepted, and I went to the newsroom in the morning with a bag of baked goods, my own form of enticement in exchange for their time. When I arrived, the newsroom was full—she had invited all of the reporters and a bunch from their sister newspaper, the Roodepoort Record, owned by the same company, to participate. As I sat down at the head of a long table, I faced several cameras atop tripods: in a world of social media all the time, they broadcast the meeting live on Facebook. I learned that on election day, the reporters had divided up the municipality; and as I had done, they interviewed voters as they exited the polling stations. Their stories and impressions of a largely smooth election confirmed what I had heard. Unlike me, the staff members also participated in the vote and could share their personal experiences. “For me, this election was kind of big,” said one reporter. “I thought this was going to be a watershed election.” Another said, “People were optimistic for change. People wanted change.… I think they wanted the change … [but] it doesn’t look like anything big will happen.” When it came to the role of race in politics, the reporters were not of one mind and clearly varied according to their own racial identities. Most of the Krugersdorp News reporters were White, and one said she wondered if this was the election in which the country could finally “get past” race. A Black reporter who had visited the upscale and largely White neighborhood of Ruimsig said, “I noticed that the racial tension was there … maybe they didn’t want to talk with a Black journalist.” I asked the reporters whether they felt they cover enough good news in Mogale City. Did the fact that they tend to write about what fails leave citizens more skeptical than the reality warranted? What about Ethembalethu? I initially faced a room of blank stares, as most were unaware of the place that was on my mind. One Black reporter confirmed he had been there, described it, and agreed that it was a successful community. Another reporter mentioned that the News did cover a more recent story of the handover of 100 RDP houses, but yet another asked if it was right to give a pat on the back to government for delivering 100 houses after twenty-five years. The editor added that they do cover some good news stories, including of people reaching out in positive ways to members of other communities, which was true. I thanked them for their time, knowing they had a newspaper to put out, and headed over to the Mogale City Council Speaker’s office to discuss her views about the election. I had met with Noluthando Mangole a few times on prior trips, and I knew she’d be working hard on this election. Though slight in stature, she was usually big on energy and presence. On this day, she seemed tired and down, even as she was fully decked out in ANC regalia, with her hair covered in a green and gold ANC scarf. “It was hectic,” she uttered a common South African expression. “To a large extent, Mogale City seemed not to have performed quite well in Gauteng and the results seem to be so low.” She complained of the problem of factions within the party, which affect daily governance in the municipality and the coordination of the campaign. She said she was surprised and a bit disappointed that there had not been any rallies in Mogale City. “In previous years, we used to have rallies around here. But resources were a bit of a challenge this time around.” Despite Mangole’s pessimistic tone, by midday Saturday, it was official: the election was declared “free and fair,” and for all the excitement, the talk of political change, the effective balance of power remained exactly as it had been: Ramaphosa would continue on as president of the country, as the ANC secured 57.5 percent of the national proportional representation vote. Eight of the nine provinces, including Gauteng with its just barely enough 50.1 percent of the votes, went to the ANC. Considering the results in Mogale City, the municipality proved, once again, to be broadly reflective of trends in Gauteng, and in South Africa more generally, albeit weighted toward its proportionally larger White and Afrikaans-speaking population. And in fact, the ANC did better than the Speaker lamented to me when we met in her office that Friday afternoon, receiving 52.1 percent of the votes cast in the municipality. Although ANC leaders were disappointed to be shedding seats in national and provincial legislatures, implying fewer key jobs for party insiders and evidence of the erosion of their electoral dominance, they had to be relieved. Like any election, at least in the near term, it was a success for the winners and viewed as the opposite for the losers. The question for the longer term is whether such competitive practice and the other trappings of democracy benefit the larger whole, particularly with respect to dignified development. I address such questions in the remainder of this conclusory chapter. First, I consider what we can learn from this particular election with respect to the hopes and concerns of prior decades and as documented in earlier chapters. Second, I discuss the South African case in relation to the analogous American experiment with post–civil rights desegregation, drawing many key parallels. And finally, I try to extract some lessons about democratic practice amid diversity from all that we’ve learned in this investigation, for South Africa and other divided societies. Done and Dusted: Another Election in the Books The May 2019 election was a fitting bookend to the first quarter century of democratic government. Electoral performance is shaped by many factors, and no vote tally can offer a fully clear or complete mandate concerning the “will of the people.” Nonetheless, the election conveyed a great deal of information about citizens’ wants and needs, it reflected the further routinization of liberal democracy, and it offered a feedback mechanism for reinforcing gains in dignified development. First of all, it does appear that the contest was indeed free and fair, and its legitimacy was essentially unchallenged. It’s impossible to know for sure the extent of irregularities, but few were reported, and those that were brought to light could not have materially affected the results. Back in Mogale City, the election mostly went well, though not perfectly. A non-trivial 8.5 percent of Black Africans said that they had been threatened with violence in the weeks leading up to the election. And it was almost double that in Munsieville’s Ward 27. Almost no one reported having been offered money for their votes. But about 10 percent of Black Africans said that in the weeks prior to the election, representatives from a political party had bought groceries for them. Threats of violence were clearly undemocratic, but grocery parcels struck me as fair game in a democratic polity so long as there was no explicit or enforceable quid pro quo in the form of votes.2 However, as expected, especially with the chilly and rainy weather I experienced on election day—and which blanketed much of the country—turnout was disappointing. Just 66.1 percent of the registered voters cast their ballots, and only about 3 of 4 citizens eligible to vote were registered. The turnout metric according to voting age population was under 47 percent, which is low by international standards, particularly as compared with 1999 when more than 70 percent of eligible voters actually voted.3 It was a middling performance compared to other African countries’ turnout in recent years.4 Second, the election reflected that South African politics was becoming more competitive. The ANC was still strong, but the results offered more evidence that the country had not become the one-party state that some feared as an inevitable fate. It was the ANC’s worst showing in a national election, while several small parties enjoyed substantial gains. Despite its several-year rise, the DA was not the prime beneficiary of the ANC’s losses. The party would remain as official opposition with 20.8 percent of the national vote and 24.6 percent of the Mogale vote, but this was a substantial drop-off from 2014, when they received 22.2 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The DA’s support in the Western Cape was also diminished, but they still received enough votes to remain in charge of that province. By contrast, the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+ enjoyed the biggest gains nationally, albeit from much smaller bases. Only six years old, the EFF took in 10.8 percent of the national vote and was massively successful in Mogale, with 12 percent. Next was the IFP with 3.4 percent, which also marked an increase from the prior election. And the FF+ made big gains from less than 1 percent to 2.4 percent nationally, while in Mogale their vote share was a substantial 7.1 percent. Increased representation of several parties implied more inclusion and pluralism. Yet, the implications of growing support for these particular parties—the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+—was double-edged, because each had advocated ethnic autonomy or even exclusion during the campaign. They might not have said so explicitly in their party manifestoes, but these parties had defined themselves in terms of particular racial or ethnic groups, and together, they doubled their combined 8.3 percent vote share from the 2014 national election to 16.6 percent in 2019. While the ANC’s decline was notable, the election could also be seen in a slightly different light: given widespread perceptions of poor performance and reports of corruption filling the airwaves in the months prior, as well as some polls showing that they might not win a majority of votes, the ANC also exceeded many expectations. One plausible interpretation is that Ramaphosa’s appeal stemmed from a credible commitment to resist the “state capture” of the Zuma years.5 In other words, despite a shared party brand, Ramaphosa managed to shed some of the ANC’s accumulated baggage by distancing himself from the Zuma faction. It would be an overstatement to suggest that the election was itself a referendum on the previous twenty-five years. On the other hand, the likelihood that citizens voted for the ANC was clearly associated with their views of the past, even if not in a strictly causal manner. For example, in my survey of Mogale City residents, 81 percent of Black Africans who said life was better now were also likely to say they supported the ANC. A smaller share of those who said that life was worse now also said they were supporting the ANC—but it was still 66 percent. Although far fewer Whites supported the ANC, positive views about post-Apartheid life were associated with an 11-percentage-point jump in the proportion of those reporting ANC support.6 Not surprisingly, racial dynamics were clearly at play in the election, although race and ethnicity were much less determinative of voters’ choices than many democratic theorists had once feared. For example, while both of the “big-tent” parties in terms of geographic, ethnic, and racial reach may have shed vote share, virtually all of government would remain in these parties’ respective hands after the election. Combined, the ANC and the DA took in 78.3 percent of the national vote. The ANC was no longer espousing the type of “non-racialism” it once did, but it was also still fairly moderate in its approach and certainly did not employ racially exclusionary rhetoric to attract supporters. In a country that is about 80 percent Black African, the fact that just over 50 percent of the vote went to the ANC meant that many Black voters opted for other parties. Moreover, many Whites I spoke with in and outside of Mogale said they voted for the ANC, even if it was not the party they most favored, because they preferred to see an ANC government to a coalition that might include the EFF. Indeed many Black voters went for the EFF, some for the IFP, and others for the DA. Presumably, many Zulu voters who had gone with the ANC under Zuma now returned to the IFP fold—a full 95 percent of the IFP’s votes came from the Zulu-dominant KwaZulu-Natal Province. And its only significant support in Mogale City was in Ward 15, with its substantial Zulu minority. However, the party did not perform well in other wards with sizable Zulu shares. The EFF most likely gained its support from a combination of ANC defectors and young new voters angry with the ANC for various reasons. Beyond Zulu-based support for the IFP, however, there is very little evidence supporting the idea that African language was a good predictor of party support in Mogale, Gauteng Province, or nationwide. Among Whites, the DA was still the most popular choice, but in this election, many voted for the FF+. The FF+ took in at least one-third of the White vote in the municipality.7 In seven wards, they attained 19 percent or more of the vote, including in Ward 22, where I had seen the FF+ councillor expressing confidence on election day. With Mmusi Maimane, a Black man, at the head of the DA ticket, and with other policy changes intended to attract a broader constituency, many Whites no longer felt represented by this self-avowed “non-racial” party. Moreover, FF+ support was not simply White but Afrikaner-based, reflecting the fact that the old inter-White cleavage never fully disappeared.8 Citizens had real choices, and changes in vote shares within voting districts across the country made clear that citizens were using their votes to send signals to politicians about what they did and didn’t like.9 In fact, one of the most profound findings from analysis of voting returns is the degree to which extreme levels of party support as measured at individual voting stations and at the ward level were reversed from the 2016 election. That is, both the ANC and the DA each tended to shed the most votes in the areas where they had done best and gained the most votes in the areas where they had done worst. Several other factors, discussed in the three prior chapters, also helped to predict vote choices, citizen views about how life compared now to under Apartheid, or both.10 For example, engagement in democratic practice and perceptions of quality of governance were important predictors of positive views: Black Africans were substantially more likely to say they viewed post-Apartheid life favorably if they had attended a ward committee meeting in the past month or if they said they felt a ward councillor listened to “someone like them.” Views about the post-Apartheid era and vote choices were also predicted by the material conditions in which people reported living, but the patterns were not particularly strong or even in the direction many might predict. For example, 54 percent of Black respondents who lived in a formal dwelling and had a job said life was better now; by contrast only 31 percent of those Blacks with neither a formal house nor a job said that life was better today. Among the Black Africans surveyed in Ethembalethu—the successful, subsidized housing development in Muldersdrift described in chapter 7—72 percent said life was better now. And in qualitative responses, overwhelmingly, citizens pointed to a lack of jobs and the fact that jobs were easier to get under Apartheid as reasons for selecting life was better “then.” Higher-income Blacks looked at the present more favorably than those with lower incomes. And those with an electric connection, a flush toilet in their home, and/or piped water were more likely to report that life was better now than before. The more service delivery problems people experienced, and the more they felt unsafe in their neighborhood, the more likely they were to reflect favorably on the past. While the South African government had made enormous progress in delivering basic services to millions more people than under Apartheid, millions were still waiting, and were clearly frustrated. Nonetheless, material conditions were not good predictors of ANC support among Blacks in Mogale City. For example, the same proportion of those with jobs and formal houses supported the ANC as was the case for those who lacked both (about 68 percent). Looking at actual levels of and shifts in voter support for the ANC, the picture was more mixed when considering levels of service provision and the degree of expressed concerns about service problems. In short, it was not necessarily the case that those whose lives materially improved under ANC government were the ones rewarding them with their votes relative to the rest.11 Far and away, the strongest predictor of citizen responses to the question about quality of life was how individuals reported being treated by others: by members of other race groups and by government, as well as their optimism about the viability of a rainbow nation. For Blacks who said they were treated better now by Whites compared to under Apartheid, 63 percent said life was better now. By contrast, among those who said they have been treated the same or worse by Whites, less than 19 percent said their lives were better now. (And a similar pattern holds among Whites.) Moreover, I found that Blacks were much more likely to support the ANC when they reported being treated better by members of other race groups (81 percent versus 57 percent for those who said they were treated worse). Indeed, in their more open-ended responses in which I asked respondents to elaborate on their quality-of-life concerns, many talked about the very types of race relations that the three pastors emphasized in our conversation over coffee, which I described in chapter 8. For example, a forty-four-year-old Black man talked about the present relative to the past: “Before, there were two doors in one shop for Whites and Blacks and my uncle once got beaten up for using a White door. We were not allowed to walk in the street after 19h00 [7 p.m.]. If found in the street I would be asked three questions like why aren’t you at school, work, [or] jail.” A seventy-six-year-old Black woman reflected on the question in terms of greater equality of opportunity: “Today’s life is good, we are free, we can do business freely without White people taking our stuff. We have freedom of education and we can attend school with White people.” It is not obvious why some respondents feel more respected by people from other race groups within the same geographic location. Self-reports of interracial contact or interracial friendships were themselves not predictive of how citizens described treatment by members of other race groups, nor were factors such as education, wealth, or the demographics of one’s ward. Nonetheless, it is clear that how people view the “big picture” of post-Apartheid democracy and reconciliation is very much colored by or at least predicted by their own sense of everyday treatment by government authorities and by other citizens, especially across the racial divide. The likelihood that citizens in diverse societies will experience democratic government as successful may be strongly affected by empathy for, respectful treatment by, and fellow-feeling with the “other.”12 This ought to serve as a strong reminder for political leaders of the value citizens place on dignified treatment. Of the Same Cloth: South Africa and the United States For Americans reflecting on our own elections and the factors that drive vote choices, it’s hard to avoid seeing parallels with the 2019 South African contest. Race, material conditions, and the role of views of the other are all similarly highly predictive of vote choices.13 I decided to write this book about South Africa, but admittedly, the contemporary and historical United States has loomed large as a basis for comparison. While South Africa’s Apartheid system of race relations and its precursors were more thoroughgoing, America’s long history of slavery, segregation, and other formal and informal systems of race-based discrimination is also quite profound. And although formal discriminatory structures were dismantled in both countries, informal forms of racism persist, and their legacies remain strong and almost ubiquitous. Any attempt at comparison bumps up against certain key differences between the countries, including in terms of racial demographics: throughout its history until the present, the United States has been a majority White country (even Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana are all majority White, and less than 40 percent of residents are African American). In the years after the U.S. Civil War and the end of slavery, the treatment of African Americans varied by region to a greater extent than regional variation in the implementation of Apartheid: in the American South, where most Blacks live, a form of segregation that is frequently compared with South African Apartheid persisted. The dawn of America’s multiracial experiment came thirty years earlier than South Africa’s, with the promulgation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed race-based segregation and promoted various forms of integration. As in South Africa, the civil rights era was met with a mixed response from within society, and the mere imperative to change did not translate into transformation. This is apparent today, more than fifty years later, and certainly was true in the twenty to twenty-five years after the Civil Rights Act.14 In fact, a 1985 New York Times article titled “The Races in Mississippi: Old Order and New” might just as well have been a story about present-day Mogale City. It highlighted that a local Black newspaper, the Jackson Advocate, printed an article announcing that the state had sworn in the first Black member of the state supreme court next to an article titled “Cross Burned—Youth Abducted and Beaten in Strife-Torn Durant.” The Times article juxtaposed substantial political gains against slow progress in terms of relationships and contact between the races. The fact that many people, Blacks and Whites, died so that Blacks could use a restroom in a public place or walk through the front door of a restaurant and be served is somewhat lost, or at least blurred, by the amount of change. “It’s so different from what it was that for people who’ve never experienced the other, it’s just hard to realize what has changed,” observed Frank E. Smith, who represented Mississippi in Congress for 11 years.15 Similarly, Whites and Blacks offered divergent recollections of the past: The lynchings of Blacks and denials of basic rights are part of the legacy of the state that, by far, was considered by almost all Blacks as the very toughest in the South, racism at its worst. But to many White Southerners at the time, there was nothing wrong with segregation of the races; as a matter of fact, they believed it was wrong, even immoral, for Blacks and Whites to live together, go to the same schools, socialize and marry. On politics, race remained a critical predictor of how individuals would vote: “Whites won’t vote for a Black candidate,” one politician observed. And on frustration among Blacks with not being able to lead a better life even two decades after the legal end of segregation: Many Blacks live in two- to four-room wooden shacks with tin roofs and cardboard or plastic nailed up to windows that have no panes. Only 14 percent of Tunica’s Blacks over the age of 25 have high school educations: the first high school for Blacks was not opened until 1952. Sugar Ditch Alley, a Black settlement, takes its name from a one-and-a-half-mile ditch running behind the shacks. It is there that the residents dump their human waste, for there are no indoor toilets. They may also have to walk several houses away to obtain water from an outdoor hydrant. When Americans elected the country’s first Black president, Barack Obama, in 2008, that marked a truly significant step toward redressing this history of indignities. Yet just eight years later, although more Americans voted for his opponent, Donald Trump won the election for the White House. It was eerily reminiscent of the 1948 election in South Africa, when the National Party got to take power, despite failing to win the most votes. Trump’s diatribes against people of color, foreigners, and even Africans bore more than a passing resemblance to the Nats’ fear-mongering around a “Black Peril,” and even to Paul Kruger’s White nativist orientation. The 2016 election in the United States reflected a deep lack of consensus among White Americans about our own journey toward racial integration. Moreover, despite its symbolic importance, Obama’s presidency, let alone several decades of post–civil rights politics, did not erase the racial disparities remaining in just about every dimension of American life: in terms of job opportunities, educational opportunities and attainment, life expectancies, health care and health outcomes, where people live, and who has political and economic power. As is now well known, African American men face a disturbingly high rate of incarceration and are routinely unfairly treated by the police throughout the country. Repeated indignities have fueled a movement, Black Lives Matter, whose core claim centers around a lack of equal respect for the dignity of Black people. Not surprisingly, the movement resonated in South Africa as well. Both in America and in South Africa, political resistance and democratic politics have marked many important advances for greater social justice. Looking at the present from the perspective of the segregationist American South circa 1960 or Apartheid South Africa in 1980, there’s no denying that much has changed for the better. And yet, when seen together, the history of these two countries demonstrates that institutionalized White supremacy dies hard, and their respective economies and societies continue to be defined by race-based disparities, high levels of prejudice, and conflict. Unfortunately, cycles of reproducing inequality in the form of various intergenerational transfers are extraordinarily difficult to break. Healthy, wealthy, and well-educated parents routinely transfer all of these outcomes to their children through their home environments, passing on not just assets but also human capital and social networks. The material and social-psychological legacies of past indignities are both strong and self-reinforcing, presenting perpetual new challenges in the quest for dignified development through democratic practice. We can and should acknowledge serious and persistent shortcomings and aspire for democracy to work better in both places. It is also important to consider the alternatives. As just a few examples, the catastrophic and recent plight of the Uighurs in China,16 the Rohingya in Myanmar,17 and perpetual repression in Rwanda18 all reflect what can happen to ethnic minorities and competitors in the absence of the light and protections associated with well-institutionalized democratic rule. The government assault on human rights in the non-democracies of China and Russia, including in the form of violent repression of critics,19 has been without parallel in contemporary America or South Africa. Lessons for and about Democracy and Dignified Development Are there lessons to be learned—even if more modest ones—from South Africa’s bold political experiment to launch democracy? The challenges the country faced in the early 1990s, of a racially divided and highly unequal society, were extreme but not entirely unique. Countries around the world are simultaneously becoming more diverse and more unequal, and those conditions have frequently given rise to exclusionary and populist authoritarian tendencies. How might such polities fare under more robust democratic rules? Focusing on the history of one country, it’s hard to know whether democratic practice actually caused the outcomes that followed. Was it any particular democratic institution or episode? Or a combination? Would such results hold in a different context? A case study like the one I’ve carried out here is not well designed to answer any of those questions adequately because so many changes have unfolded simultaneously. Rather, the value of the story I’ve told here—about the development of multiracial democracy in South Africa for twenty-five years after Apartheid—is more heuristic: it helps to demonstrate what is possible and plausible, including to challenge the notion that some groups simply can’t coexist or co-govern—that “ancient hatreds” will always stand in the way. And it affords the opportunity to discuss what is valuable and desirable for the good life. Others will surely disagree with my particular calculations of what went right and what wrong, and the relative import of both—but my goal has been simply to consider the record more deliberately. Looking at this past quarter century in light of South Africa’s history, patterns in other countries, and in Mogale City in particular suggests further reflection about three key areas: democratic practice, the forging of political communities, and the role government should play in helping people fulfill their aspirations for a better life. I cannot, from this study, say that the introduction or consolidation of democracy will lead to dignified development with any particular likelihood. Democratic institutions are certainly not sufficient for this outcome. Rather, I do think they are necessary. To feel truly empowered and autonomous, citizens require robust opportunities to participate in the selection of leaders and to influence policy without fear of repression. For example, Israel is one of many divided societies that continues to face existential dilemmas around who should be included, who excluded, and on what basis, and the South African experience is surely relevant. Israel had a “Mandela–De Klerk” dynamic in the form of Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, Nobel Prize winners, who signed an accord for Palestinian self-rule just days after Mandela’s election in 1994. Their negotiations were toward a “two-state” solution, but the settlement was undone by aggressions and pullbacks on both sides and, notably, the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by an Israeli extremist who resented the peace accords. While reminiscent of Chris Hani’s assassination, in the Israeli case, the murder derailed the negotiations, and after many years of repeated attempts, one noted scholar of Israeli politics concluded that the “two-state solution” appeared largely untenable.20 Maps of the Middle East, which carve out strangely shaped Palestinian territories with restrictive borders in the middle of Israel, are powerfully reminiscent of South Africa’s homeland structures, especially as the conditions within them are largely deplorable relative to the largely prosperous country that surrounds. Indeed, the term “Apartheid” has often been used to describe the nature of power and authority in Israel, even though it is met by many with grave consternation given the connotations. For many White South Africans who observe the Israeli situation, and speak despairingly of what befell their own country, they describe the South African case more as a warning rather than as a model for emulation. And such difference of interpretation is one of the main reasons I wrote this book: we need to understand what South Africa is a “case of.” Perfect? No. Nonetheless, quite successful given the conditions and the very possible alternatives, especially if one focuses on the most vulnerable segments of society. For Jews and Arabs who find it difficult to fathom a peaceful solution in which they coexist in a single democratic order, South Africa offers one critical lesson: former enemies can, in fact, live and govern relatively peacefully and productively, within the span of a generation. While it is difficult to parse out which of South Africa’s democratic institutions had what particular effects on politics and society, two general principles stand out: multiple opportunities for participation and the norm of proportionality. With respect to the first, I am reminded that on election day, many repeated the incantation, “You can’t complain if you don’t vote.” That might imply that voters are the biggest complainers. In fact, political participation was associated with more positive views of life in South Africa—and it’s hard to know whether contentedness causes political participation or the reverse. As it is in other countries, political participation is important. Because of the staggered approach to national/provincial elections and local elections, the longest period that South Africans wait between elections is three years. Moreover, high-density local governments that blanket municipalities with ward councillors and ward committees alongside a still strong and active civil society offer robust opportunities to participate, at least in urban areas. Where people participate and where political competition is high, political parties have been more responsive. While it has not been a focus of this book, democratic practice in rural areas, especially those co-governed by traditional leaders, remains underdeveloped, and with little in the way of interparty competition.21 I am also largely persuaded that the norm of proportionality, including the specific electoral institution of proportional representation—rather than a “winner-take-all” system like we have in the United States—was the right choice for South Africa. In a diverse and divided society, proportionality has offered important recognition to a wide range of people according to their identities and ideas about how government should be run. The system has also kept minority elites engaged in politics in a meaningful way, realistically keeping their hopes alive of influencing policies and key outcomes, even without large numbers of supporters. Proportionality has allowed citizens to see themselves represented in and thus to become more attached to the government. And it has opened up space for new parties, born of new ideas, to emerge, and this has contributed to a more dynamic democratic environment. Soon enough, such a system may reveal its limits. If and when the ANC is no longer able to capture a majority of the voters, and if the country is governed through coalitions, frustrations could ensue, just as they did in Mogale City following the 2016 local election. Optimistically, disparate elites could engage in workable compromise to the benefit of all. However, frustrating polarization could breed paralysis and/or potentially induce the type of opaque manipulation the ANC used to wrest control of the municipality. The ability to weather such political storms may depend on the degree to which political elites and ordinary citizens can find common ground in joint projects and a sense of shared purpose and not view the political arena as a zero-sum game. In short, formal institutions will never be enough to hold South Africa together—there must also be elite and citizen goodwill. Along these lines, the post-Apartheid “experiment” was not just about the practice of democratic politics but also about reinventing a society that had been divided by deliberate design. As in the contemporary United States, a key challenge is how to address the indignities of the past without reinforcing and reproducing the sense of deep division and difference that bred such practices in the first place. The “rainbow nation” was one solution for overcoming racial divide. Perhaps it was too hokey, too contrived to be fully embraced in a lasting manner, especially when intergroup inequalities remain so stark. Yet, all national myths are aspirational and, by design, unnuanced. Moreover, it’s difficult to discount the value that this particular idea played during the period of political transition in the mid-1990s. Echoing that early period, in November 2019, South Africa’s rugby team claimed a World Cup victory; and on that occasion, the team was more racially diverse and, for the first time, led by a Black man—Siya Kolisi—who was also outspoken in promoting an optimistic, “keep dreaming” message. The win garnered lots of favorable news coverage and offered a symbolic reminder of what the country was becoming and still could be. Could the idea stick? Not everyone was convinced. As a columnist for the largest Black newspaper, the Sowetan, argued, “Winning [the] rugby world cup doesn’t mean we’re together.”22 Nonetheless, the expressed sentiments surrounding the 2019 World Cup revealed that there remains an appetite and possibility for nation-building and the politically useful notion that “we are in this together.” Unfortunately, the development of a sense of “us” is too often built upon exclusionary and intolerant perspectives concerning who is not, or who is “them.” While it would be naive on a number of levels to suggest that fully open borders are the solution, like the United States, South Africa must square the desire to enforce such boundaries with an approach that also recognizes the dignity of foreign nationals. A cursory glance at history reminds us that many of those today seen as “foreigners” are deeply rooted in the country’s history, including having jointly suffered from the indignities of White supremacy. Relatedly, it’s worth asking whether a recently liberated people, facing significant disparities in income, wealth, and services, should really focus their attention on issues of symbolic recognition. Do statues and street and place names really matter? The color and gender of political representatives? In a recent book and related writing, Francis Fukuyama has argued that the quest for recognition can displace the more “important” political project of material advance and equitable development.23 I think Fukuyama’s argument underappreciates the quest for such recognition not simply as an end in itself but as a means for fostering efficacious and involved citizens. A sense of identity and pride are important foundations for the types of deliberate actions that breed prosperity. When people feel devalued, they are not likely to be contributing members of the community. I am not suggesting that every form of recognition is valuable or consequential, but following centuries of indignities, these are more than simply hollow symbols. They provide daily reminders of who and what are valued by their democratic society. The analyses presented throughout this book also raise the question of what role government ought to play in the economy and society in the future. To the extent that South African citizens still have a large reservoir of unmet wants and needs, they must decide whether those are best addressed through direct government action, privately, or in some combination. The global record of state-planned economies is simply too dismal to contemplate as a comprehensive solution, and the South African government has already demonstrated its limited capacity even in delivering basic services. Nonetheless, the rights orientation of the constitution has usefully enshrined a role for government to protect a fundamental respect for human dignity, both in terms of minimum standards for material living conditions and for treatment by government itself and other citizens. I admit that, like many, I was initially skeptical of the heavy rights orientation of the South African constitution when I first learned of all that was protected. How could you “guarantee” all of these social and economic benefits? I imagined that it would amount to a plethora of unfulfilled promises. And yet in practice, the language and ethos of rights have proven quite central in changing the politics of inequality in South Africa, highlighting that the previously invisible ways in which people were excluded from full participation in society were no longer acceptable. A rights orientation opened up a critical discussion of what it means to be fully human: Should free health care be a right? Free primary education? Free university education? Quality education? Access to the internet? While there is no universally accepted bundle of goods that constitutes a human minimum, and clearly, context matters, a rights orientation offers a platform for the least well-off in unequal societies, and their allies, to make strong claims to direct public resources their way in search of a more just distribution. Overcoming Cynicism There’s no denying that democracy remains fragile and messy in Mogale City and in South Africa. If the political order were to go up in flames, I would be crestfallen but not wholly surprised. From the vantage point of just over a quarter century since the end of Apartheid, it would be sheer hubris to assume that a relatively peaceful multiparty democracy will last forever. The multitude of challenges the country still faces could ultimately overwhelm the still emerging political order. However, if it does come apart, it will be one of the great tragedies of the early twenty-first century, because South Africa’s democratic order is surely one of the great accomplishments of the late twentieth. That so much is left to be done to achieve a just and prosperous society does not mean that democratic government is to blame or that much would be better under a different system, tempting as it is to wonder aloud about such options. In many ways, South Africa is just muddling along, but that in and of itself is pretty remarkable in the wake of the legacies it inherited. Moreover, in just twenty-five years the country went from laggard to leader on multiple dimensions. So much that was once thought impossible is now taken for granted. As I highlighted in chapter 3, and have shown throughout this book, one of the hallmark traits of democratic practice is the public and vociferous airing of grievances about the status quo. This is healthy and drives change. And yet when we combine this behavior with a tendency toward negativity bias, sentiment can turn cynical. I have tried to offer a reality check. Proponents of democracy’s virtues have never enjoyed a period of unwavering support for their theories. History has always generated cases of democracies gone bad and of authoritarian regimes that managed to succeed in various ways. The present period is a particularly difficult one for democracies around the world. When protesters took to the streets in countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa during the 2010s, marking a period that came to be known as the “Arab Spring,” they appeared to be paving the way for a more democratic order in the world’s most autocratic region. Among their many concerns were government corruption, lack of jobs, and economic inequality. And yet, a decade later, liberal democracy has completely failed to take root. Established democracies in every world region have come under pressure from those seeking to gain or to hold onto power through illiberal tactics, circumventing democratic procedures. In this context, South Africa needs to be understood as the largely successful case that it is, and it is fair to say that democracy saved South Africa from a fate that could have been quite disastrous given where the country was headed. The fact that it can be largely successful here does not tell us that it will work the same way everywhere, but it provides an important heuristic for what’s possible and lessons for plural societies. Was this just a fluke of history? To be certain, following the wave of multiparty elections endeavored mostly during the decade of the 1990s, very few African countries developed robust democratic institutions and practices.24 And yet, those that did offer analogous lessons to what I found in South Africa. Citizens of Cape Verde, Ghana, Botswana, Benin, Senegal, Namibia, and others have benefited from democratic practice relative to the largely disastrous experience of authoritarian rule in neighboring countries on the continent. The politics and policies of these other African democracies are similarly imperfect, and their domestic critics similarly numerous and vociferous. Nonetheless, they also have much to share in terms of the virtues of political freedom, including with respect to dignified treatment, that were previously available only to small minorities. Progress requires the constant readjustment and ratcheting of hopes and dreams. In practice, especially within democratic systems, this means never accepting the status quo as fully satisfactory, and at least rhetorically dismissing the past and the present as unacceptable. But sometimes progress must be measured and appreciated. For generations, Black South Africans, from Sol Plaatje to Desmond Tutu to Chris Hani to Nelson Mandela, as well as the freedom fighters in Munsieville, Kagiso, and beyond, all labored to free themselves and their society from the shackles of institutionalized White supremacy and Apartheid. And they succeeded. When the Congress of the People gathered to read the Freedom Charter in 1955, few South Africans or outside observers would have predicted a day when so many of their aspirations would be largely fulfilled: irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability, South Africans of 2019 were all clearly citizens, not subjects. Political leaders had to come to them asking for their votes, appealing to their sense of what was right and fair. Democracy in South Africa is working: it is becoming more competitive; people are living better lives with more dignity; citizens are advancing their interests in a range of democratic channels—through the vote, in the media, in citizen campaigns, in the courts, and in their growing confidence of what it means to be a democratic citizen. Their story leaves me hopeful.",

      "title": "EPILOGUE",
      "content": "EPILOGUE LESS THAN A YEAR following the May 2019 election, South Africa’s democratic government—like governments all around the world—faced an unprecedented new burden when it was forced to confront the deadly coronavirus pandemic. In fact, one particularly contagious strain came to be known as the “South African variant,” and its prevalence intensified the challenge to keep citizens healthy and alive under already difficult conditions. The human toll has been devastating: as of December 2021, the country was home to the largest number of documented cases on the African continent (3.2 million), and over 90,000 Covid-related deaths.1 These deaths came over multiple waves of rapidly accelerating case counts. The first confirmed case of Covid-19 in South Africa was diagnosed on March 5, 2020, the first death on March 25, and the first death in Gauteng Province was a seventy-nine-year-old man in Krugersdorp.2 As of early July 2021, there were at least 500 confirmed deaths in Mogale City, and at least one of the people I interviewed for this book (Pamela Esso) was included in this tragic statistic.3 Moreover, the pandemic seems to have slowed already slow economic growth and to have increased already high levels of unemployment. Once again, reminiscent of so much I have written in this book, it might be tempting to blame the government for these tragic outcomes—one more deadly mishap in a string of failures. For the history of modern epidemics, long-predating Covid-19, observers have wondered whether democracy is well suited for controlling outbreaks of contagious disease. Would it be better to have a government that insisted on conformity without dissent in order to ensure compliance with demands for contagion-reducing behaviors?4 Among other things, the pandemic put an accent on the severe inequalities between and within countries in terms of capacities to adapt and the needs of the most vulnerable. As such, it put questions about the value of democracy for dignity and development squarely on the global agenda. In the South African case, even as we must recognize the enormity of what citizens have been forced to endure, we should not conclude that outcomes would have been better if government leaders could have operated without democratic oversight. In fact, much of the response was impressive, though not perfect; and democratic feedback helped push the government toward a more just and human-centered approach. In short order, Cyril Ramaphosa’s government announced a deliberate and aggressive response plan. From the very start, government leaders tried to demonstrate that they would not repeat the Mbeki fiasco with respect to AIDS. In facing Covid, the government would adopt science-based strategies in line with emerging global best practices.5 It also drew heavily on the administrative resources developed in combatting HIV and tuberculosis in order to try to stem the tide of infections. Covid quickly became a priority for all levels of government. On April 1, 2020, the Krugersdorp News reported on local councillors checking in on local retail outlets to make sure citizens were practicing social distancing and that stores were prioritizing the needs of the elderly.6 On April 3, the BBC reported on South Africa’s “ruthlessly efficient fight against coronavirus,” highlighting that the country already had drive-through testing centers and that the political leadership was acting urgently to prepare for what might come but that police were harshly enforcing lockdown rules.7 And on April 9, the president announced that he and cabinet ministers and deputy ministers would take a 33 percent pay cut for three months, donating the proceeds to a national solidarity fund; he encouraged private business leaders to do the same.8 At the time, President Donald Trump was still proclaiming that the pandemic was no big deal, the stance he would largely maintain throughout the remainder of his term in office. As in the United States, as restrictions on movement and activities were put into place, it soon became clear how much more difficult this would prove to be for the large, poor, and mostly Black majority, living cheek by jowl in smaller domiciles and crowded townships and often relying on publicly shared water sources and toilets. For middle-class and wealthier families, living in larger homes with high-speed internet access, quarantine was more of an inconvenience than great sacrifice. The government initially failed to address the needs of the most vulnerable in many important ways, opting for a strict and uniform approach. It faced a barrage of criticism, from the press, academics, and civil society organizations, and reports mounted of corruption and mismanagement. Government security officers were frequently too quick to use force to maintain order in the name of social distancing, and the police made a shocking number of arrests—over 200,000 during the initial lockdown.9 And in turn, political opponents took aim at perceived shortcomings; for example, the EFF’s Julius Malema proclaimed, “Our government loves … to keep white people happy and safe, even at the expense of Africans.”10 Nonetheless, in a vein reminiscent of much of the rest of the book, I would highlight that the South African national government readily acknowledged the Covid threat early on and attempted to tackle it using the best available public health policies. A main source of concern has been that the government was too aggressive and not sufficiently respectful of people’s autonomy and individual needs. And true to the democratic form I have described throughout, challenges to government Covid policy frequently resulted in procedural and practical adjustments. These included even more expansive social protections—for example, cash transfers.11 On May 18, 2020, President Ramaphosa shared his weekly letter from the desk of the president, “The government welcomes dissenting viewpoints around our Coronavirus response,” in which he sought to explain the government’s approach while also celebrating citizen engagement.12 One could counter that talk is cheap, but when we consider both the actions and the rhetoric of so many other government leaders around the world, and again, especially the words from the office of President Donald Trump, it is hard not to admire aspects of the emerging South African response at least in relative terms. Similarly, when compared with the persistent denialism and lack of respect for the poor and vulnerable ethnic and racial groups observed in countries such as Brazil and India—and observing the horrendous ways in which those epidemics progressed—the South African political and government response during the first eighteen months of the pandemic appears far more impressive than many critical commentators have acknowledged. In the case of Brazil, where President Bolsonaro took a “hands-off” approach, the poor suffered far worse than their South African counterparts.13 India’s populist prime minister, Narendra Modi, did impose some early lockdowns, but again, several accounts link his brand of autocratic populism to the unfolding of a disastrous response with a staggering human death toll.14 In many authoritarian governments, we have little accurate picture of how the epidemic unfolded because information has been so tightly controlled. Along these lines, in November 2021, South African scientists and government officials openly shared their findings about the Omicron variant, a contribution to global public health that might not have been forthcoming from a closed society. Compared to many other countries, including those with greater financial and administrative resources, South Africa’s liberal democratic order fared admirably in terms of initial process and outcomes. Whether such efforts will have been in vain given the spread of new variants and the challenge of obtaining and dispensing vaccines remains to be seen. Just as South Africa was facing a painful third wave of Covid infections, the country also suffered an outbreak of violence, looting, and arson. This unrest was an almost immediate response to the incarceration of former president Jacob Zuma, who began a fifteen-month jail term for contempt of court in early July 2021. For many, although Zuma’s imprisonment was hardly compensation for the harms he wrought on the country, it offered a bit of public reassurance during a particularly trying time that even heads of state must be held accountable under democratic government. For Zuma loyalists, they supported his innocence and rejected his incarceration as unjust. Most of the unrest occurred in Zuma’s home province of KwaZulu-Natal, where throngs of looters, not necessarily politically motivated, ransacked shopping malls. Much of the same transpired in parts of Gauteng, and it is still not entirely clear why it occurred there but not in other parts of the country. It amounted to the most violent episode of the post-Apartheid era, with more than 350 dead, many more injured.15 While the motivations for all large-scale episodes of such nature are multifaceted, it seems clear that a combination of political rivalry, long-standing frustration, and more recent exhaustion from Covid all contributed. Facing the twin challenges of Covid and unrest, many South African commentators resuscitated some of the very questions that motivated this book: Was South Africa a “failed state”? On the verge of collapse? Once again, news of the demise of South Africa’s democracy landed as premature. As I write, the country remains under enormous stress, and its future is uncertain. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that citizens were quite resilient and a wide range of civil society groups, the news media, churches, and government officials all stepped up to try to stamp out intolerant attitudes and behaviors and to restore order with a minimal amount of force, and the spate of violence was largely contained to a less than two-week period. South Africans are frustrated and angry, and understandably wonder about how to achieve systemic change. The notion of abandoning liberal democratic government will continue to be a tempting option. However, the alternatives are unlikely to solve the extraordinary challenges before this diverse society, and democratic government still holds the greatest promise for dignified development.",

      "title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS",
      "content": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I HAVE ACCUMULATED A mountain of intellectual and personal debts during several decades studying South African politics and society. And while I can’t possibly acknowledge them all here, I am enormously grateful to an amazing assortment of individuals and organizations, including my extended family, friends, and mentors, for their generosity and support. Most important, I want to thank the hundreds of people in Mogale City who recounted the histories of their lives and took time to help me understand the politics of this extraordinary place. Several individuals met with me on multiple occasions, including Nomfezeko “Fezi” Mgilane and the staff of the Krugersdorp library, the speaker of the Mogale council, Noluthando Mangole, Councillor Tshepo Nzwane, Councillor Amanda de Lange, Councillor Jacqueline Pannall, Bianca Grossett, and Leslie Gama. Rev. Monwabisi Moses hosted me at his Kagiso Methodist Church and kindly introduced me to several of his parishioners. Mariette Liefferink provided a jaw-dropping tour of the environmental damage associated with mining excavations. Janine Viljoen and the staff of the Krugersdorp News welcomed me to their offices on multiple occasions. A small army of research assistants helped out with various aspects of the project and I couldn’t be more appreciative of their diligence and feedback. In South Africa, Sinoxolo Hashe interviewed dozens of residents and provided feedback on the pilot of the Historical Memories Survey in addition to carrying out other research. The research firm Plus94 did an excellent job fielding the survey. I am also grateful to Tshegofatso Shibuyi and Gabo Kgomongwe, who helped me organize and conduct interviews my first weeks in Mogale; and to Gillian Jena for help with library research based in Johannesburg. At MIT, several doctoral students contributed to various aspects of the research and analysis of troves of data: thanks to Jasmine English, Nicole Wilson, Paige Bollen, and Blair Read; and in particular to Rorisang Lekalake and Gabriel Nahmias—South Africanists in their own right who each provided terrific research and feedback. Thanks also to key members of the research support staff, Eliza Riley, Danny Tobin, and Nico Studen. I was lucky to collaborate with Daniel de Kadt, Philip Martin, and Nina McMurry while they were graduate students on various papers that helped inform my thinking about accountability, and those works are cited in the pages above. I am grateful to Julia de Kadt—a former student who went on to do great work at the Gauteng City Regional Observatory—for making various introductions and helping me gain access to the terrific data they have collected. I started my research while a fellow in the democracy program of the Ash Center for Democratic Governance at Harvard’s Kennedy School. I am particularly appreciative of Archon Fung’s generosity in allowing me to be part of this group and for his friendship and advice along the way, as well as for the feedback and encouragement from the other fellows in my cohort. I am also grateful to MIT, my home Department of Political Science, and the School for the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences for financial and other support. In particular, thanks are due to Maria DiMauro, Susan Twarog, and Paula Kreutzer for helping me sort out various administrative issues that make such work possible. I value the encouraging and constructive feedback from several readers and audiences, especially the two anonymous reviewers from Princeton University Press, Gwyneth McClendon, Richard Goldstone, and Joel Motley. I presented a few chapters at the Oxford University Comparative Politics Series (via Zoom) and am particularly grateful for comments from Giovanni Capoccia and Rosie Pinnington. I also received terrific feedback from my colleagues in the Boundaries, Membership and Belonging working group sponsored by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Thanks to Greg Bates, who provided helpful early editing on a few chapters; Rachel Schultz, who created the GIS-based maps; and Jocelyn Capshaw, who created the illustrated maps based on my (far less attractive) sketches. The manuscript benefited from the helpful comments of several good friends. Marc Favreau and Melani Cammett both offered sage advice when I was just getting started and several times along the way. I was inspired by the message and impact of Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt’s terrific book, How Democracies Die. They each provided characteristically smart feedback—Ziblatt did so on many masked walks during the height of the Covid pandemic. I am lucky to have started my long South African journey with Michael Goldberg, and I am grateful for his willingness to again share memories with me for this book. I am also eternally grateful for the friendships that began during my years at IDASA in Cape Town, particularly with Helen Macdonald and Albert Van Zyl, which have persisted and extended to their wonderful families. It is always a joy to see them and to learn from them about South Africa; both provided helpful feedback on the research and the manuscript. Albert’s great work at the International Budget Project, including his more recent efforts with Asivikelane, is emblematic of what I have admired about South African democratic practice. Several colleagues, including Gcobani Qambela, Nicoli Nattrass, Jeremy Seekings, Vinothan Naidoo, and Bob Mattes, have guided me sufficiently along the way that I want to acknowledge them here as well. I continue to admire the great work of the LRC and have learned a great deal from my interactions with staff and attorneys there. Various members of the Spira family have housed or fed me in South Africa; I have really appreciated their hospitality and engagement. Princeton University Press has been a terrific partner in this endeavor. It is no secret that Bridget Flannery-McCoy is an outstanding editor and offered a wealth of helpful suggestions, including the title of the book, and I thank her for believing in this project from the start. I am also very grateful to Eric Crahan, Alena Chekanov, and the whole Princeton University Press staff for their efforts, and to Jenn Backer for copyediting. I am very grateful to my family, including parents, siblings, and cousins, who have supported me along this journey. Both of my sons, Gideon Lieberman and Jonah Lieberman, read and provided comments on sections of the manuscript, and I appreciated their willingness to discuss related issues around the dinner table on many evenings, especially during our long quarantine together. As always, Amy Lieberman has been my best friend and biggest cheerleader, and she read every chapter, sometimes more than once. I love and appreciate her every day. Despite all the great help and support I have received, I am sure several errors of fact and/or interpretation remain; and for those, I take full responsibility. Like all democracies, no book is perfect.",

Specifically, I am referring here to the conquests of Mzilikazi—the warrior who conquered much of the region during the period known as the Mfecane but was subsequently vanquished by a group of Voortrekkers that included Paul Kruger as a child. See Peter Becker, Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matabele (London: Panther, 1966). Note that an important source of politically motivated intellectual debate in South Africa concerned the timing of the arrival of various groups to the Witwatersrand area, with many White authors propagating the “empty land” notion—that when the Whites arrived, the area was largely unpopulated and the timing of the arrival of White and Black was approximately the same. This myth has long been debunked; one leading scholar details compelling evidence that the Tswana resided in the area for several centuries prior to the arrival of White settlers. See Fred Morton, “Settlements, Landscapes and Identities among the Tswana of the Western Transvaal and Eastern Kalahari before 1820,” South African Archaeological Bulletin 68, no. 197 (2013): 15–26. 5.

In the early part of the twentieth century, White South Africa did indeed develop a “social welfare state” that in many ways was comparable to that of many advanced industrialized countries, and it did so on the basis of a sense of cross-class White solidarity. See, e.g., Lieberman, Race and Regionalism. However, it is important to recognize that this was a contested process that proceeded in fits and starts. See, e.g., Jeremy Seekings, “The Carnegie Commission and the Backlash against Welfare State-Building in South Africa, 1931–1937,” Journal of Southern African Studies 34, no. 3 (2008): 515–37. 25.

More generally, South Africa may be victim to what has been described as the “middle-income trap,” which prevents them from upgrading to high-income status. See Indermit S.

      "content": "PREFACE DURING THE LAST WEEK OF April 1994, in villages and cities across South Africa, adults of all ages and colors joined long, snaking lines to cast their votes in an election that was broadcast to observers around the globe. Their participation marked the launch of a highly improbable political experiment. After centuries of White rule, including over forty years under an Apartheid system that separated people according to racial classification, the political landscape was transformed. The electorate, finally incorporating the Black majority, was now eight times larger than it had been during the last all-White election. The voters would choose a previously banned political organization, the African National Congress, headed by a former political prisoner, Nelson Mandela, to lead them. The new government would integrate people, local economies, and political authorities under a single system of law and governance. And they would attempt to do this while adhering to democratic principles with a commitment to the rights of all people. I was just twenty-three at the time of this amazing political transition, and I had already been thinking about and studying South Africa for several years. For me, as an American high school student in the 1980s, Apartheid government presented a rare instance of moral clarity. There was no ambiguity about the fact that this explicitly racist system needed to be abolished, and college students, ordinary citizens, and heads of state the world over supported the cause of regime change. Before I could vote in my own country, the one political position I was certain of was my opposition to Apartheid. Since then, I’ve spent my entire adult life watching and cheering for this country on the other corner of the planet, to see whether it would make good on the anti-Apartheid dreams of a truly democratic and more prosperous future. Looking back now, there is one critical question to ask: Did it work? In this book, I reflect on South Africa’s record with multiracial, democratic government. Can we say it was a success? Or did the quest for democratic integration in this divided society turn into fool’s gold? In the pages that follow, I document what I have learned in my attempts to understand what came before and what came after the transition away from Apartheid. For Americans and for others who confront legacies of institutionalized racism in their own societies, South Africa offers a useful point of reference. Reflecting on its history raises important questions about social justice here and in countries around the world that are grappling with the twin scourges of inequality and intolerance. South Africans themselves vary widely in terms of how they rate their democracy. Frustration is palpable; and commentators’ assessments are often dismal. Is South Africa simply going the way of past failed attempts at democratic development on the African continent? Several facts could be marshalled to support that conclusion: the country suffers from massive unemployment, poor health, poor education, and widespread corruption. By listing the set of social ills South Africans continue to face, one could quickly dismiss this democratic experiment as an unmitigated disaster. In this book, I recognize these serious concerns, but I also try to shed light on relevant outcomes in historical and comparative perspective. In turn, my conclusions are far more favorable than local and national interlocutors have generally shared. In a mere twenty-five years, under elected Black-led governments, South Africans made remarkable gains toward achieving a more just society, with greater respect for the dignity of all people—what I call dignified development. Many problems remain and citizens are understandably frustrated that more has not been accomplished. And yet, we cannot lose sight of the fact that democratic practice has moderated the tensions inherent in governing South Africa’s diverse society. Successive democratic administrations have helped to improve the lives of millions across the country, with housing, basic services, social security, access to education, and more, and they have done so without resorting to political extremism or the complete exclusion of any minority group—a fear that many expressed at the dawn of the democratic era. This book is based on observations from decades of field research in South Africa and a great deal of teaching, research, and analysis along the way. During the months before and after the 2019 election, I made repeated visits to Mogale City, a municipality that serves as something of a microcosm and a key focus of the book. I conducted several dozen interviews there and engaged in various types of participant observation, including attending rallies and council meetings, hanging out around polling stations, and occasionally jumping in a pickup truck to watch a politician engage in constituent service. I followed up on leads and referrals, and tried to use my instincts and knowledge of the context to adjudicate between fact and fiction. A wide range of voices, including those of current and former mayors, local councillors, reporters, clergy, business operators, NGO leaders, and others I met around the municipality, can be heard in the pages and analyses that follow. Throughout the book, I have used the actual names of public figures (politicians, bureaucrats, and NGO leaders) I interviewed but either disguise identities or report no names for all other people interviewed in order to protect their privacy. I also drew on a wide range of primary and secondary sources, including existing high-quality representative surveys, as well as surveys I conducted myself, and a great deal of administrative data. (See “Author’s Note” for additional details on such data, including the acronyms used to identify various surveys and data sets.) My own identity—what some refer to as positionality—has shaped the questions I asked and my access to certain sources of information and data; it has also influenced the conclusions I derived from my analyses. This book is not a memoir by any means, but in some parts I explicitly reflect on my own journey through this country over time. I do this in part because the fact that I saw and heard certain things myself ought to enhance the credibility of those descriptions. To be transparent, it is also important to recognize that it was all filtered through me as a person, and were I not a White American man and an academic with the resources to travel the country comfortably and in relative security, I might have encountered different people and different places, heard different facts and stories, and arrived at different conclusions. Despite more than three decades of engagement, I concede many blind spots remain. South Africa has eleven official languages, and I speak only one of them fluently—English—though I did learn enough Xhosa and a few phrases in Afrikaans to be able to express at least my desire to be empathic toward others’ views and to elicit smiles from my mispronunciations. Like so many others, I was initially drawn to study South Africa because the clear and sustained injustices of the Apartheid system were impossible to ignore. Today, after Apartheid, the politics of the country remain at least as compelling. Still burdened by the legacies of the past, political leaders face the challenge of building a shared future based on an entirely different set of principles, which themselves are still being worked out. Their efforts, successes, and failures offer the rest of us much food for thought about the possibilities for building more just societies around the world.",

      "content": "PREFACE DURING THE LAST WEEK OF April 1994, in villages and cities across South Africa, adults of all ages and colors joined long, snaking lines to cast their votes in an election that was broadcast to observers around the globe. Their participation marked the launch of a highly improbable political experiment. After centuries of White rule, including over forty years under an Apartheid system that separated people according to racial classification, the political landscape was transformed. The electorate, finally incorporating the Black majority, was now eight times larger than it had been during the last all-White election. The voters would choose a previously banned political organization, the African National Congress, headed by a former political prisoner, Nelson Mandela, to lead them. The new government would integrate people, local economies, and political authorities under a single system of law and governance. And they would attempt to do this while adhering to democratic principles with a commitment to the rights of all people. I was just twenty-three at the time of this amazing political transition, and I had already been thinking about and studying South Africa for several years.

      "title": "ON SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL CATEGORIES",
      "content": "ON SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL CATEGORIES WHILE SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL categories bear some similarities to those used in the contemporary United States and other multiracial societies, there are also key differences. As a starting point, most recent official (government) South African documents use the term population group rather than race and do not provide the option for individuals to select multiple categories. In South Africa, four main categories inherited from the Apartheid era continue to be widely used—Black or Black African; White; Indian or Asian; and Coloured—and largely distinguish people based on physical characteristics and continental ancestry. The awkwardness in describing these categories reflects the reality that they are arbitrary social constructions. What made Apartheid South Africa unique was its insistence on rigid classification and legislation—attempting to give scientific foundations to categories that are themselves not scientifically distinguishable. For example, the 1950 Population Registration Act can be quoted verbatim to remind us that these categories are merely conventions: “A White person is one who is in appearance obviously white—and not generally accepted as Coloured—or who is generally accepted as White—and is not obviously Non-White, provided that a person shall not be classified as a White person if one of his natural parents has been classified as a Coloured person or a Bantu.” The term “Coloured” may be particularly jarring to American readers, as it appears both antiquated and offensive given its connection to racial segregation in the United States, but it is important to highlight that the connotation is quite distinct in the South African context. In fact, the term was decried in South Africa as being offensive for some time, but that is largely not the case today, and it is commonly used, including as a proud source of self-identification. Specifically, Coloureds are the descendants of mixed-race parentage; in some cases, like for the South African comedian Trevor Noah, this implies parents of different races, one Black, one White. However, most people who identify as Coloured are the product of many generations of two Coloured parents, each of whose ancestors had much earlier (perhaps going back centuries) engaged in racial “mixing,” frequently in the form of White men and Black African women—typically enslaved or in otherwise subordinate social positions. Thus, the term “Coloured” refers to a specific subset of the population and not to all people “of color.” Most Coloureds largely speak either English or Afrikaans and are predominantly located in the western part of the country. More recently, many who might have been classified as Coloured under Apartheid but trace their ancestry to a distinct group of indigenous people have demanded recognition as Khoisan. In the Apartheid hierarchy, Whites were at the top, Coloureds and Indians next, and Black Africans at the bottom with respect to rights, income, living conditions, and just about every way in which a person could be treated. In turn, references to Blacks sometimes imply a combination of these groups and other times simply to Black Africans. I believe that my use of racial categories in the pages of this book accords well with conventional practice in South Africa today. However, some understandably reject such labels and charge those, including journalists and academics who continue to use them, with perpetuating the very hierarchies that South Africa’s Apartheid system sought to create. Still others prefer the use of alternative categories. My use of these terms is not meant to cast judgment on their inherent legitimacy over other types of social categories but simply to convey my recognition of their salience in politics and society.",

      "content": "1 The Campaign COMMUNICATING FRUSTRATION I HAD JUST SAT down and taken out my notebook when I heard a loud thud. It was a few minutes after 9 a.m. on the last Friday of January 2019. I had come to meet a prospective research assistant at the Chicken Licken in downtown Krugersdorp, about an hour’s drive from Johannesburg. A modest-but-modern fast food restaurant, clean and sparsely furnished, it was one of the most popular spots in a neighborhood that was otherwise filled with unremarkable storefronts, including several tire stores, low-price clothing boutiques, and pawn shops. Signs for quick and easy abortions adorned many of the adjacent buildings. I noticed that the restaurant manager was hurrying around the exterior of the building, slamming shut each of the heavy exterior gates used for security after-hours. The pair of police officers who had been sitting and chatting at the table next to me had disappeared. Most of the other customers eating and drinking there that morning had also left their tables in order to gather close to the exit, huddling under the threshold as they looked out cautiously onto the street. I stood up and joined the small crowd. We all peered out toward the action to our left and could see a loud throng of people toyi-toying. The toyi-toyi is a protest march that became popular in Black townships beginning in the late 1970s in the wake of the growing campaign against White rule in South Africa.1 On that day in January, thousands of people were hopping, dancing, singing, and yelling all along the multiple lanes of Commissioner Street. They held hand-printed placards in their hands proclaiming, “No service, no vote” and “2019 no vote.” It was still morning, but it was already getting hot in the summer sun. Sweat streamed down the protesters’ faces. The manager was closing the metal gates because the previous week, a different protest had turned violent and rubber bullets had broken windows. She wanted to protect the new windows, the restaurant, and, presumably, any customers who remained. Krugersdorp has long been a site of confrontation and conflict. Within a few years of its founding in 1887, it developed rapidly into a hard-drinking, hard-gambling, transient mining town and was frequently likened to the American “Wild West.”2 It was established to serve the booming gold mining industry a year after rich deposits were found in nearby Johannesburg. The allure of quick profits attracted thousands of foreigners, mostly from Britain but also from Australia, Ireland, and America, other parts of Africa, and other corners of the world. Over many generations individual explorers, groups, and sometimes even warring parties came through this town to try to carve out a better life. For most of its history and up until the 1990s, Krugersdorp was designated for Whites only. Black people were permitted to work here only if they carried a special permit, and mostly they were relegated to the neighboring Black townships of Munsieville and Kagiso (pronounced Kah-hee-so). As early as the first few years of the twentieth century, the Krugersdorp Town Council deliberately regulated the movement of Black Africans into and out of well-demarcated areas on the outskirts of town.3 Indeed this distinction between “towns” and “townships” was fundamental to the racial ordering built up throughout South Africa during most of the twentieth century. Today, downtown Krugersdorp is filled with people from all race groups and a wide range of nationalities. By contrast, Kagiso (about seven miles south) and Munsieville (less than four miles north) remain almost all Black, though the latter also hosts Pango Camp, a small informal settlement of poor Whites. On this day in 2019, the approximately two thousand Munsieville residents were marching to see Patrick Lipudi, mayor of Mogale City Local Municipality, which now incorporates all of these areas under a single local government. Lipudi is himself Black. In the 1970s and 1980s, he had served as a union leader, political activist, and protester; and he danced the toyi-toyi during the struggle for Black liberation. Like so many others who once led protest movements and were now serving as government officials, he had become the target of anger and frustration. The protesters were making demands for better water and electricity. It was the last weekend of voter registration for the upcoming national elections, and when interviewed later that day, the protest’s organizer said the people of Munsieville were prepared to boycott further registrations.4 For Lipudi and other government leaders, such boycotts could cost the ruling party precious votes in a close election, and they would be forced to negotiate. FIGURE 1.1. Site of protest outside Chicken Licken, Krugersdorp. Democracy Up Close I had traveled to Krugersdorp, the seat of Mogale City government, to observe the campaign for this national election. I wanted to learn more about how multiracial democracy was faring after twenty-five years. The country’s first multiracial election, in 1994, had marked an important milestone in a highly improbable political transformation. It produced a shift in power away from an economically dominant White minority in favor of universal adult suffrage, resulting in a Black-led government. In terms of population and economic development, ending Apartheid and creating an integrated South Africa was like fusing together the relatively poor African country of Kenya and the much smaller and wealthier European country of Denmark into a single polity in just a few years’ time. Between 1989 and 1994, the size of the electorate increased by a factor of eight, from over 2.5 million to close to 20 million voters.5 During that period, the country transitioned away from civil war—a fact which itself did not bode well for democratic development if one considered the trajectories of other postconflict countries.6 And now it was time to ask: What can students of democracy and social justice the world over learn from this ambitious political endeavor? That a large protest swept right in front of me on my first day—in fact, in the first fifteen minutes of my time in Krugersdorp—was an important reminder of the mood of many of the country’s citizens: they were frustrated, angry, and losing patience. In this chapter and in the next, I share what I observed about contemporary South African politics from the perspective of the 2019 national election as it played out in Mogale City—first the campaign, and then election day itself. This will provide an introduction to the diverse actors and concerns driving the heated political competition in the country. I set my gaze on the midsized South African municipality of Mogale City because, at least from afar, it appeared to be a place that could serve as something of a microcosm for learning more about South Africa. It is racially diverse, prior elections tracked national trends toward greater competitiveness, and it straddles the country’s very different urban and rural areas. On the one hand, the municipality abuts South Africa’s megalopolis—the corridor between “Joburg” and Pretoria, home to over 8 million residents. Yet, even the most urbanized section of Mogale—Krugersdorp, with a population of about 140,000—is still just a town. Streets can get busy during trading hours, but there are no high-rise buildings. Just a few miles away, still very much within Mogale’s borders, lie thousands of acres of farmland. Black and White, rich and poor, urban and rural, and support for different political parties represent the most important sources of diversity in South Africa; and all are contained within Mogale. The municipality is located in Gauteng Province, specifically in an area known as the West Rand—a reference to the Witwatersrand, an approximately thirty-five-mile rock escarpment that elevates its residents over a mile above sea level. The Rand is also quite literally the source of continental divide, as runoff from the plateau feeds the Crocodile, Limpopo, Vaal, and Orange rivers, which in turn drain into the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Wanderers and explorers came here even before the transformative discovery of great mineral wealth in the ground below. No part of Southern Africa has drawn more people into such a concentrated area. And on my drive in from Johannesburg that January day in 2019, I noticed the immodest welcome sign, “Mogale City: Cradle of Humankind,” a reference to rich archaeological discoveries within the municipal boundaries. Mogale’s northern border is drawn by the Magaliesberg mountains, the site of millions of years of human occupation, and at least hundreds of years of known trading and conflict between groups of people moving into and out of the area. Although I never spent any significant amount of time in Krugersdorp or Mogale prior to 2019, I have been studying South African politics for my entire career and adult life. And I wanted to take stock of what had and had not been accomplished since the time of the democratic transition, especially as democracy seemed to be in peril around the world, including in my own country, the United States. Populist leaders and parties have been on the rise around the globe—in Hungary, the United States, Brazil, the Philippines, India, and elsewhere—and they have been characterized by increasingly authoritarian tendencies. South Africa was plausibly fertile ground for such appeals. Anti-immigrant and anti-elite sentiment was already strong in many pockets—and very strong in Mogale City. It would not take much imagination to organize highly racist campaigns; and any of a number of well-worn strategies to identify a culpable elite and/or additional scapegoats had the potential to win votes. FIGURE 1.2. Map of Mogale City Local Municipality in South Africa. Even beyond the seemingly fragile nature of liberal democracy around the globe, South Africa’s 2019 contest appeared pivotal in so many ways: the electoral choices were stark, as the competing parties offered very different candidates and visions; and more than any national election since 1994, this one appeared to be quite competitive. Democracy is about a lot more than just elections, but elections are both necessary and crucial, and I wanted to watch this one up close. I would start by simply observing the process, particularly as it unfolded in this one municipality, asking: What were the leading political parties offering as interpretations of the past and proposals for the future? How were citizens responding to those campaigns? And then I would consider the historical record, look comparatively at other countries, and try to make sense of what I observed with respect to the efforts to forge a new government and to deliver. Ultimately, my goal was to assess the strength and value of South Africa’s still young democracy. When I arrived in Mogale City, the municipality and the nation were just three months from marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s historic electoral victory in the first-ever truly multiracial election, one that was celebrated as a credible promise to redress the types of indignities that befell Black township dwellers like the people of Munsieville. It was also a quarter century, more or less, since the end of Apartheid—literally translated as apartness—a style of government launched in 1948 with the express goal of keeping people from different race groups apart from one another. Institutionalized White supremacy, including in the form of slavery, had been practiced to varying degrees throughout southern Africa almost immediately after the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652. When Krugersdorp was formed, it was contained within the South African Republic, a landmass representing approximately one-quarter of modern South Africa. Many of that government’s harsh rules and practices, including issuing passes to control the movement of Black people, would become the foundation for sustained racial oppression. Of course, southern Africa was not alone in its institutionalization of racial hierarchies. Most of the African continent was at some point colonized by White Europeans; and the African slave trade was built on ideas of racial supremacy. The United States and Brazil both imported massive numbers of slaves, and the lasting results of race-based inequalities are starkly evident in these countries even today. What made South Africa both truly unique and infamous was the degree to which its White government doubled down on segregation and a panoply of racially exclusionary policies during the second half of the twentieth century. When the National Party gained power in a surprising electoral victory just three years after the end of World War II, Apartheid-style government came to define South Africa as a White minority persisted in developing a vision of government and citizenship for Whites only. Apartheid planners tried to market their project to the world as one promoting national self-determination, a language that was more acceptable to postwar sensibilities as the age of empire had come to an end. And yet, there was no mistaking the fact that the Apartheid project sought to forcibly segregate and separate people of color into the least desirable territories in the region and to control them as sources of cheap labor. All of the Apartheid laws and practices were felled in the early 1990s. And yet, the end of Apartheid was not the end of South Africa’s difficult history. Deep Apartheid and pre-Apartheid legacies remained, and while various negotiating parties agreed to adopt a multiracial democracy, its success was hardly preordained. Moreover, a quarter of a century is clearly not sufficient to redress three and a half centuries of racial hierarchy. Nonetheless, the silver anniversary of the first multiracial election presented a fitting opportunity to take stock of what had been accomplished relative to expectations, to the past, and to other countries. In the pages that follow, I show that South Africa’s first twenty-five years of democratic government were extremely successful. Many problems remain and citizens are understandably frustrated that more was not accomplished during this period. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that democratic practice has moderated the tensions inherent in governing South Africa’s diverse society. Successive democratic administrations have helped to improve the lives of millions across the country, in terms of housing, basic services, social security, access to education, and more, and they have done so without resorting to political extremism. Notwithstanding these accomplishments, South Africa’s democracy remains fragile. Democracy itself is an imperfect form of government even under the best of circumstances. Hopes and expectations can quickly outpace concrete change. The machinations of democratic politics are inherently self-critical, and progress is routinely made through shining a bright light on problems, which itself feeds a sense of frustration. While often effective, these processes can contribute to an underappreciation of the enterprise. The Issues and the Parties The very proposition of democratic rule in South Africa has long seemed daunting because of the profound diversity of its citizenry. Even in relatively small and homogeneous societies, attempts to forge binding agreements through democratic processes—those that allow for input from and some form of veto power to ordinary citizens and their representatives—frequently prove to be challenging. Especially with four major race groups, eleven official languages, a relatively even split between those living in rural and urban areas, and the highest level of income inequality in the world, the notion of “common interest” can seem elusive. And yet, one of the great promises of democratic competition is that in the quest for votes, electoral candidates will make appeals to large swaths of the population, forging coalitions among people with otherwise divergent backgrounds. And for the most part, the parties competing in the 2019 electoral contest advanced credible and distinct ideas concerning how to govern South Africa’s highly diverse and unequal society. They provided answers to two central questions that had been asked for over a century, including during the very 1948 election that set the stage for Apartheid. First, there was the race question, or really, a set of race questions: How did the party propose to address the legacies of race-based inequality and conflict? Would it seek to promote integration, autonomy, or something else? And what should be the racial identity of the party’s leaders and of its core supporters? Second, and certainly relatedly, there was the economic question. On the one hand, just about everybody wants a better life in material terms, to have more comfortable shelter, basic services, and opportunities for leisure, and to take advantage of new products and new technologies. But how would the parties address the profound economic inequalities that called into question any sense of a shared humanity? All across the country, and certainly in Mogale City, you could find neighborhoods of people living in modern homes with all the amenities available in the United States or in Europe just a few miles from those living in informal structures of corrugated metal without basic services, such as electricity, clean water, or a flush toilet, let alone access to a decent job. What role should the state play in providing economic opportunities and security? What role for the “market” and competition? Should those who were previously disadvantaged get a leg up? Both issues spoke to a larger question of human worth or dignity. How should people across the color bar be treated by one another and by the state? If politics is about who gets what, and how,7 the South African parties epitomized a good political contest because if nothing else, in 2019, each of the five leading political parties was offering very different answers to these questions. At the center of the election was the African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party for twenty-five years and before that a prominent challenger to White government for eight decades. In 1963, Nelson Mandela and a group of other ANC leaders were arrested for, among other things, sabotage and conspiracy in the wake of their efforts to topple Apartheid. They served harsh prison sentences on Robben Island, but their heroic efforts at liberation were rewarded handily in the first multiracial elections in 1994. Although its support base was overwhelmingly Black African, the party had historically appointed people from various race groups to its leadership posts. It espoused racial inclusion and compromise even if its detractors sometimes argue that it does the opposite. On the economy, the ANC’s approach has been center-left and quite moderate in many ways. The ANC had always had a highly educated middle-class elite in its leadership ranks; but through its links with unions it extended its reach to workers and was even able to appeal to rural peasants through traditional leaders. It promoted economic preference policies (aka affirmative action), but not radical redistribution; and certainly in post-Apartheid South Africa, and in the context of the global economy in the late twentieth century, the organization had bet on the power of competitive markets. For years, Mandela had been celebrated as a saintlike figure. But by 2019, the ANC was treading lightly in its tributes to him and its focus on the organization’s role in ending Apartheid. Months before the election, new critics joined a growing chorus that challenged Mandela’s grand bargain with the very White government that had oppressed Black people. They complained that during the transition of the early 1990s, he had given away too much to Whites. Others, even Black leaders within the ANC, believed that during the first election campaign, he promised too much to Blacks. Either way, the charismatic icon who had passed away five years earlier, at the age of ninety-five, was being quietly blamed for some of the mess the country was in. As the incumbent party, the ANC had to stand on its record. Commentators in the media and the academy shared a steady flow of criticism and sometimes described the country as being “at a precipice” or “on the brink.” Citizens were frustrated by all sorts of issues, not the least of which was the load-shedding or rolling blackouts to ration electricity that was insufficient to meet total demand. Stories of ANC corruption, violence, high rates of unemployment, and newly emboldened as well as newly formed political parties calling for change all dominated the news. In fact, one of the country’s major scandals was centered in Mogale City. It involved Bosasa, a private South African company with headquarters in Krugersdorp that, among other things, provided prison services to the government. In January 2019, the owner—a White businessman with long-standing ANC ties—was caught paying out bribes to ANC officials, all the way up to President Jacob Zuma, in exchange for comfortable government contracts and leniency with respect to affirmative action rules.8 For fifteen years, the country had confronted an almost endless battery of protests like the one that passed by Krugersdorp’s Chicken Licken. While those protests had many messages, they were mostly a rebuke to ANC rule or at least to particular ANC leaders or factions. The main opposition going into the election was the Democratic Alliance (DA). Like the ANC, they were also a big-tent party and by 2019 had a much more racially diverse support base than the ANC. While their leader at the time of the election was a Black man—Mmusi Maimane—most of their leadership was White, and the party was born of White liberals, many of whom challenged, but also lived quite comfortably within the Apartheid system. Unlike the ANC, the DA is more explicitly pro-market, and more critical of Black preference policies, while stopping short of being rabidly laissez-faire. For years the DA had campaigned on good government, arguing that the one province it controlled (the Western Cape) and the several municipalities it governed performed better than in those provinces and municipalities where the ANC was in power. Many of the DA’s White leaders could often be attacked for flat-footed comments that failed to appreciate the challenges still faced by Black South Africans in the post-Apartheid context. When its then-leader Helen Zille tweeted in 2017 about some of the positive legacies of colonial rule, she was eviscerated on social media and faced widespread charges of racism from ANC and other party leaders and commentators. If the DA and the ANC were fighting over a big center and a wide and diverse polity, the other major contenders in the election had much more focused constituencies and distinct answers to the questions of the day. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was a relatively new party, but they were taking up ideas that had been around for generations, espousing a more exclusionary Black nationalism and a very central role for the state in the economy. Although its ideology was strong, the party was very much embodied in the thirty-seven-year-old firebrand, Julius “Juju” Malema, who had been expelled from the ANC, where he had been the leader of their influential Youth League. Malema had been convicted of hate speech and was a divisive figure in an ANC led by an older generation of liberation activists. He epitomized rebellion and nonconformity. He and his EFF had creatively captured the imagination of Black, disaffected urban dwellers, particularly the young, by reminding them of the persistent inequalities and indignities of everyday life in the country and by laying virtually all the blame on the ANC for such outcomes. Malema was clearly a populist candidate in the sense of being someone who tried to appeal to ordinary citizens through anti-elite messages. But unlike many populist contemporaries elsewhere in the world, he did not seek to scapegoat foreigners. In fact, he was outspoken in his rejection of xenophobic violence, promoting instead a pan-Africanist vision. He and his party spotlighted the reality that the country remained deeply, devastatingly unequal and that there had been very little redistribution of land from the White minority to the Black majority even under ANC government.9 Malema was demanding a radical redistribution of income, wealth, and power in one of the most unequal societies on the planet. Malema scared the ANC and he really scared South Africa’s White population, who saw him as the greatest threat since the advent of this multiracial democracy. Whites would certainly be losers in any serious redistributive scheme. To date, they had not paid dearly for the sins of the past, and in the grand scheme, their comfortable lifestyles had remained as such. And Malema would continue to remind them and the Black majority of such basic facts. Beyond these three parties, with their respective ideas, a fourth idea was still very much on the South African political menu. Ethnocultural autonomy was advocated in different ways by two different parties—both with much smaller support bases as compared with the first three, while representing groups that are central to the South African story. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+)10 is largely, but not entirely, the party of extreme-right Afrikaners. While numerically small today—White South Africans who speak Afrikaans at home comprise less than 5 percent of the population11—this group has always managed to carry outsize political influence through military might and tight political organization. As early as the eighteenth century, Dutch descendants, along with French Huguenots and a few other Europeans, increasingly spoke a variant of the Dutch language and came to think of themselves as a people attached to this land. Many began to self-identify as Afrikaners—or, simply, Africans. (They would also self-identify as Boers, or farmers.) The Afrikaners developed a strong identity and political strength by mobilizing around narratives of persecution and the quest for self-rule. Indeed, Krugersdorp’s namesake, and one of the country’s most famous Afrikaners, Paul Johannes Kruger, rose to be president of one of the two Afrikaner republics that predated the formation of modern South Africa. Born in 1825, Kruger was a boy living on the Cape when his parents decided that they could no longer remain under recently imposed British rule, which included banning the use of the Dutch language. They abandoned their home and took Paul, at around the age of nine, to participate in the storied “Great Trek,” the Afrikaner migration from the Cape to the eastern and northeastern parts of southern Africa, including around modern-day Mogale City. Ultimately, the rise of the National Party, which designed and implemented Apartheid, was the product of an Afrikaner effort to wrest control from English-speaking South Africans and those with more capitalist and internationalist orientations. Arguably, one of the most far-reaching affirmative action programs ever implemented—and successful in terms of promoting economic redistribution—was that in favor of Afrikaners during the Apartheid era.12 And now in 2019, a collection of Afrikaners mobilized by the FF+ were playing a similar card decrying cultural oppression by a Black majority and Black-led government. Going into this election, the Afrikaner quest for autonomy was not expressed explicitly in terms of the inherent supremacy of one group over another, but their core political proposition was that different people, marked by language and history, share distinct values and prefer to be among themselves, and to do as they please, at least within their own community. Although they were White and generally economically privileged relative to the majority, they were using the same language of claims-making—calling for recognition and autonomy—in the manner frequently articulated by marginalized indigenous groups in countries around the world. One might say it was a bit of chutzpah. The FF+ had not earned many seats in the national Parliament or in the Mogale City council. But in a tight election in South Africa’s particular electoral system, it could potentially play a decisive role and get at least some of what it wanted. And it continued to broadcast a foundational idea that remained strong in South Africa: address the country’s diversity by staying apart. Like the DA, they rejected affirmative action, arguing that twenty-five years was long enough for Black preference policies. The party’s leaders routinely argued that White people were “scapegoated” for the problems of the ANC government. Also clamoring for ethnocultural autonomy was the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the party most closely tied to the Zulu Kingdom, with Zulus constituting the largest language-based ethnic group in the country. Zulus could boast a long history of military might and recorded numerous strong stands against the incursions of European settlement and eastward expansion. On the one hand, the IFP drew its support from a largely poor, rural, and Black base and was less overtly at odds with the ANC government, which might make it appear quite distant from the FF+. But on the other hand, ironically, like the FF+, the IFP embraced many Apartheid-created institutions, including structures for incorporating traditional leadership and an appeal to a distinctly Zulu electorate. While the IFP certainly advocated for more social spending on the poor, particularly with regard to health care and the elderly, the party’s views on ethnic autonomy were much more aligned with those of the FF+ than with those of the other leading parties. At the dawn of the democratic era, the IFP had been a significant political force, but by 2019, its influence had clearly waned. A Last Push for Votes Despite my long-standing fascination with South African politics, and having traveled to the country regularly over almost thirty years, I had never been present for an election, and I was excited to observe this historic one up close and unfiltered. After my initial visit to Mogale in January and February during the South African summer, I returned in early May to cooler temperatures as winter approached. I arrived at Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport—so named for the celebrated, former ANC leader, Oliver Tambo—on the Friday morning before the election and efficiently made it through passport control and customs and into a rental car. Having driven from the airport so many times, I could almost take for granted the glimmering infrastructure that lines the sides of the wide and modern highway connecting the airport to various corners of the country. I dutifully obeyed the driving instructions broadcasting from my phone, took a couple of turns off the highway, and then became suddenly much more conscious of the goings-on outside my car. My driver’s-seat view of sleek, glassy exteriors had given way to plumes of black smoke on the side of the road. The street-side stores were unevenly finished with hand-painted signs; people were burning open fires and walking across the multiple lanes of the wide street. Several stores advertised that they would either buy or sell metal scraps. The division between road, commerce, and residential life had blurred, and I slowed down as the rules of the road had clearly changed. I was now in Alex—“Alexandra” township—which in the weeks before had been home to multiple election-related protests akin to what I had observed in Krugersdorp a few months earlier. I continued on to ascend a small hill, and when I arrived at the top, I could see out in the not-so-far distance a set of tall office buildings. If you wanted a single image to capture the contrast between the haves and the have-nots, this was the place to take that picture. As I exited Alex, I proceeded into Sandton, one of the wealthiest areas of the country. It is where some of the leading companies—including the large mining concerns and various multinationals at the core of the country’s industrial economy—maintain their corporate offices. Just a few days earlier, on May 1, Julius Malema stood before a packed crowd at a Workers’ Day Rally—held in Alex—in which he communicated the EFF’s aspirations, warning of the revolutionary potential born of such stark inequalities, and had this particular contrast in mind: “How do White people in Sandton sleep when they see their neighbors here in Alex living like this?” he asked. “We keep blaming government‚ yes let us do that, but what are Sandton people doing to help their neighbors? They are not doing anything, but they are staying behind high walls because they are scared of us. They are eating alone and when you are eating alone your subconscious tells you to build high walls before these people come.”13 The message was a powerful one. More than anything else, profound inequality—mostly, but not entirely, race-based—remains the source of political tension in this country. For the have-nots, the question is, who is to blame, and what is to be done about this sorry state of affairs? The parties would need to offer compelling answers to address the frustrations associated with such questions. During the final weekend before the election, each of the three largest parties—the ANC, the DA, and the EFF—would wrap up their campaigns with rallies in Soweto, a name born as an acronym for South Western Townships. It was arguably the country’s most important Black township because of its size, its political history, and its attachment to Johannesburg, the economic heartland of the country. It abuts Mogale City’s largest Black township, Kagiso. ANC Rally The ANC held its rally at Ellis Park soccer stadium. It followed a well-worn approach: warm-up remarks from lower-ranking party dignitaries to build momentum, followed by a clean-up speech by the face on the ballot. Despite the party’s claim to be “of the people,” the stadium floor was filled with VIPs separated from the masses in the bleachers. From the podium, the speaker frequently shouted, “Amandla” (“Power”), extending the middle “a” out over several seconds. The crowd’s dutiful response: “Awaaaaaaay-too” (“Awethu” or “to the people”). When the state president and the ANC lead candidate in the election, Cyril Ramaphosa, finally appeared onstage, he was wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap instead of his usual business suit. At the time, Ramaphosa was sixty-six, and he had lived many lives. He was born in Soweto, attended university, and, like so many liberation leaders, both studied law and faced multiple bouts of incarceration for breaking unjust Apartheid laws. He helped launch a major mine-working union in the 1980s, and the chairman of Anglo American described him as the “toughest, ablest, and shrewdest negotiator he’d had to deal with during his tenure.”14 And though Ramaphosa played a central role in political and constitutional negotiations, his early post-Apartheid career was in business, not politics. In just the first few years of the new democracy, he was widely courted to run various businesses and to sit on multiple corporate boards. He went on to become a leading mining executive, a veritable business titan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He always remained closely tied to the ANC, however, and was generally well regarded by a range of constituents from the different circles in which he traveled. He did have one glaring blemish on his record—one that was still relatively fresh. In 2012, in the wake of a wildcat strike at the Lonmin platinum mine in the town of Marikana—less than fifty kilometers north of the northern boundary of Mogale City—Lonmin’s management asked him to play the role of “fixer” during this moment of growing conflict. Ramaphosa, the former union leader, adopted the views of management and argued that the strikers were acting as criminals, and he called in the police. Approximately 400 members of the South African Police Service arrived with assault rifles and they opened fire, leaving 78 injured and 34 mine workers dead.15 What came to be known as the Marikana Massacre triggered additional strike waves across the mining sector and left many inside and outside of the ANC suspicious of who Ramaphosa really represented. The massacre also fueled anger at an ANC already under fire from its core constituents. Nonetheless, he worked to resuscitate his image; later that year he ran and won an internal ANC election for deputy president of the party. He would soon become deputy president of the state and, following the resignation of Jacob Zuma in 2018, president of the country. On this sunny day in 2019, and with this crowd, he presented himself more as labor organizer and man of the people than as boardroom mogul. He respectfully paid tribute to the local dignitaries present, as well as special guests from other African countries, including the former Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan. Ramaphosa acknowledged the swelling negative sentiment around the ANC. “We admit that we have made mistakes and we put ourselves before our people,” he said, adding: “but it is only those who are doing nothing who don’t make mistakes.” Those convicted for corruption would not be able to serve in leadership roles in the ANC, he promised—leaving aside the question of whether anyone would actually be investigated, let alone convicted. What he wasn’t saying explicitly, but what was well known, was that over the previous two decades, the ANC had become a house divided. Beyond Malema’s actual split from the party, there were major factions within the party, including those who still supported former president Zuma and a style of government that rested on patronage—the granting of favors and appointments for supporters. Ramaphosa was trying to clean up the ANC’s image, to recapture supporters who had left in disgust. Along these lines, he had expressed remorse about the recent direction of the ANC almost a year before, when he reached out to the Nobel prize-winning, octogenarian, and former anti-Apartheid activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu.16 Tutu had made no public statement about whether he accepted the apology, and the uncertainty about Tutu’s vote mirrored the possible uncertainty of many Black voters. On the other hand, Ramaphosa also would not want to fully alienate those card-carrying ANC members who had supported his rivals, certainly not a few days before the general election. Then he pivoted to the issue of voter turnout, smiled, and offered practical advice in a gentler tone. “If you sleep with someone in your bed, wake them up and say, ‘Sweetheart, let’s go and vote.’ ” DA Rally The DA hosted its final rally at the stadium in Dobsonville, Soweto, childhood neighborhood of the party’s leader, Mmusi Maimane, who was born in nearby Krugersdorp. In its early years, the DA attracted mostly White and Coloured supporters. On this Saturday before the election, the audience here looked to be at least 90 percent Black African. Everyone received a T-shirt, a goody bag with snacks, and a large water bottle. One cannot underestimate the importance of the giveaways to induce attendance and create goodwill in the days before the election. The planners smartly avoided booking one of the larger stadiums, as images of empty seats don’t play well anywhere. They seemed to just fill the 24,000-person arena. When Maimane arrived, the crowd predictably erupted. Handsome and slender, with a shaved head and trim beard, wearing a suit and open-collared shirt, he walked around the edge of the stadium. I had to give him credit—Maimane was surely comfortable in a stuffy boardroom, but when the music was blasting and he was on the spot to dance and move while greeting supporters, he appeared totally at ease. He took the stage and bellowed, “Vote us in. If we don’t do what we promise, vote us out!” He outlined lots of policies; not all received the same level of enthusiasm. “I want to reform our politics so that people of all races can work together towards one goal, instead of retreating back into separate corners.… I want every home to have at least one job. That way all South Africans will have the dignity of an income.” I was surprised by how loudly the audience applauded his call for “secure borders.” I had interviewed Maimane a few years earlier, and his precise and philosophical ruminations reflected his advanced degrees in theology and public administration. On this day, he adopted the voice and intonation of a traditional ANC politician, a low and guttural voice, interspersing English and Zulu, and led the crowd in a few call-and-responses of “Amandla” and “Awethu.” He surely delivered very different speeches when addressing audiences in the White suburbs. Trying to appeal to a multiracial, multiclass electorate was a tall order. Yet in a country where mixed-race marriages had long been forbidden and were still rare, the fact that he was married to a White woman suggested that maybe he could be a bridge-builder. Born to a Xhosa mother and a Tswana father, and still under forty, Maimane could be a youthful incarnation of the New South Africa. As the rally reached a climax, the question of “who is us?” returned to the fore. Maimane proclaimed, “They want us to … fear each other.” In response, the campaign slogan is a single word: “One.” EFF Rally Malema started his speech at the EFF rally at Soweto’s Orlando Stadium on a somber note. His beloved grandmother had passed away the day before. And he was clearly shaken. In acts of gracious civility—but ones that were widely expected as appropriate gestures—various party leaders, including Ramaphosa and Maimane, sent notes of condolence, and he acknowledged those with appreciation. “I am because of her.… She stood by me … she always believed in my innocence … I always knew my grandmother was there to support me.” But from there he quickly pivoted to an attack against the older generation of ANC leaders: “They are old … they must all go to old age or straight to prison. They are too old.… We are the future of South Africa.” His speech offered some concrete proposals. Focusing on his youthful core, he called on the government to shift resources from social grants to education. He argued, “That’s what we mean by economic Apartheid. Political freedom without economic freedom is meaningless.” Malema spoke forcefully to the crowd: “I am here to talk about you … ground force of the EFF, you are amazing … you have shaken the A … N … C.” On banks, “why do they hate Black people? … When we say economic freedom, we mean Black people will own productive farms.” He returned to the metaphor he had invoked the previous week in his Workers’ Day speech—referring to food and mealtime as symbolic of material wealth. “You have been watching them eat. Now it’s your time to eat.” He promised, “We are not fighting against White. We are fighting to sit at the dinner table. White people, you will no longer eat alone. We are coming to sit [at] the dinner table, and if you are refusing us … we are going to destroy that dinner table. No one is going to eat until all of us in South Africa eat from the same dinner table.” “Let the people of the West Rand own the mines,” he said, referring to the area including around Mogale City where the country’s wealth was generated through the extraction of gold and platinum upon which the racially unequal economy was built. I imagined that this line was playing well among some back in Mogale City but frightening others. The EFF did not have a record of engaging in serious violence, but in his speech, Malema dared the police to shoot ANC leaders. “If you want to shoot, go to Parliament and shoot the house which is full of criminals.” Was this really a call for murder? No. But the tone and the EFF brand more generally were certainly not focused on civil engagement, and he fired up the base as they smelled political blood. Poles and Polls The final days of the election generated a burst of heat in the winter air. Lamp poles sprouted signs broadcasting the parties’ respective sound bites. From the opposition parties: “Jobs not corruption.” “Jobs in every home.” “Fight back!” From the ruling ANC: “Let’s grow South Africa together.” Depending on the area, such signs would appear in one or more of the country’s eleven official languages. Pundits on talk radio, television, and social media and in the newspapers opined over the issues and prospects for political realignment. After increasingly disappointing results in elections over the previous decade, opinion polls revealed even more apprehension about the ANC. Just a week before the election, a widely publicized poll generated a lot of excitement and attention. It appeared that the ANC’s majority support had stunningly vanished, down to 49.5 percent, a drop of more than 5 points since a February poll; the EFF was up to almost 15 percent, and the DA was holding steady at about 21 percent.17 Other surveys gave the ANC an edge, and of course, there is always sampling error. But the specter of 49.5 percent was powerful. And the influential progressive weekly newspaper the Mail & Guardian published these results with the headline, “IRR Poll Shows National Loss for the ANC.”18 The media loves a good story. And the results showing that the ANC might not get a majority generated page clicks. Their numbers held out the possibility that the ANC would lose not just the Western Cape Province, which had long been in DA hands, but other provinces as well: KwaZulu-Natal, the country’s second-most populous province that was also former president Zuma’s home; and Gauteng, the industrial heartland, which encompasses Mogale City, Johannesburg, and several other municipalities and contains more than a quarter of the country’s population and more than a third of its economic output. And maybe, just maybe, the ANC would even lose the national election. It had the makings of a serious contest. Under different electoral rules, or with a clear ANC majority in sight, small parties like the FF+ and the IFP might not matter very much. But if the election was actually going to be this close, a party with even 1 or 2 percentage points of the vote, translating into a few seats in Parliament, could become the linchpin in forming a coalition after the election. They would use their last days to appeal to their more narrowly defined constituencies. Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi was serving out his final months as head of the IFP at the advanced age of ninety. He had founded the organization in 1975 and had both worked with and opposed the Apartheid government. And he closed out the party’s 2019 campaign with a speech at a rally on May 5 in Ulundi, once the capital of the Zulu Kingdom and still populated almost entirely by Zulus. He took similar swipes at the ruling ANC as the other opposition parties did and urged his constituents to heed the words of Nelson Mandela: “If the ANC does to you what the Apartheid government did to you, then you must do to the ANC what you did to the Apartheid government.” Not once did he explicitly talk about Zulu autonomy, but he made reference to KwaZulu-Natal ten times, making a plea to vote in order to reclaim provincial leadership. He recalled his own more “pragmatic” approach to the struggle against Apartheid, including opposition to economic sanctions and destructive political campaigns in order to “protect the economy.”19 In speeches and official documents, the FF+ was more explicit in its calls for cultural autonomy. “As far as self-determination is concerned, the FF Plus strives for autonomy … in education, care for the elderly, sports, heritage conservation and other similar matters.” And as far as the economy, “The FF Plus is convinced that only the free market can fully unlock economic value.”20 And now, the voters would need to assess what they had heard and what they had seen. The elderly and the infirm would get to vote early and election officials would go to them. Most of the population would head to the polls on May 8. The voters would get to decide the future of the country, no doubt shaped by their views about democracy and Black rule in South Africa over the previous twenty-five years.",

It was a few minutes after 9 a.m. on the last Friday of January 2019. I had come to meet a prospective research assistant at the Chicken Licken in downtown Krugersdorp, about an hour’s drive from Johannesburg. A modest-but-modern fast food restaurant, clean and sparsely furnished, it was one of the most popular spots in a neighborhood that was otherwise filled with unremarkable storefronts, including several tire stores, low-price clothing boutiques, and pawn shops. Signs for quick and easy abortions adorned many of the adjacent buildings. I noticed that the restaurant manager was hurrying around the exterior of the building, slamming shut each of the heavy exterior gates used for security after-hours. The pair of police officers who had been sitting and chatting at the table next to me had disappeared. Most of the other customers eating and drinking there that morning had also left their tables in order to gather close to the exit, huddling under the threshold as they looked out cautiously onto the street. I stood up and joined the small crowd. We all peered out toward the action to our left and could see a loud throng of people toyi-toying. The toyi-toyi is a protest march that became popular in Black townships beginning in the late 1970s in the wake of the growing campaign against White rule in South Africa.1 On that day in January, thousands of people were hopping, dancing, singing, and yelling all along the multiple lanes of Commissioner Street. They held hand-printed placards in their hands proclaiming, “No service, no vote” and “2019 no vote.” It was still morning, but it was already getting hot in the summer sun. Sweat streamed down the protesters’ faces. The manager was closing the metal gates because the previous week, a different protest had turned violent and rubber bullets had broken windows. She wanted to protect the new windows, the restaurant, and, presumably, any customers who remained. Krugersdorp has long been a site of confrontation and conflict. Within a few years of its founding in 1887, it developed rapidly into a hard-drinking, hard-gambling, transient mining town and was frequently likened to the American “Wild West.”2 It was established to serve the booming gold mining industry a year after rich deposits were found in nearby Johannesburg. The allure of quick profits attracted thousands of foreigners, mostly from Britain but also from Australia, Ireland, and America, other parts of Africa, and other corners of the world. Over many generations individual explorers, groups, and sometimes even warring parties came through this town to try to carve out a better life. For most of its history and up until the 1990s, Krugersdorp was designated for Whites only. Black people were permitted to work here only if they carried a special permit, and mostly they were relegated to the neighboring Black townships of Munsieville and Kagiso (pronounced Kah-hee-so). As early as the first few years of the twentieth century, the Krugersdorp Town Council deliberately regulated the movement of Black Africans into and out of well-demarcated areas on the outskirts of town.3 Indeed this distinction between “towns” and “townships” was fundamental to the racial ordering built up throughout South Africa during most of the twentieth century. Today, downtown Krugersdorp is filled with people from all race groups and a wide range of nationalities. By contrast, Kagiso (about seven miles south) and Munsieville (less than four miles north) remain almost all Black, though the latter also hosts Pango Camp, a small informal settlement of poor Whites. On this day in 2019, the approximately two thousand Munsieville residents were marching to see Patrick Lipudi, mayor of Mogale City Local Municipality, which now incorporates all of these areas under a single local government. Lipudi is himself Black. In the 1970s and 1980s, he had served as a union leader, political activist, and protester; and he danced the toyi-toyi during the struggle for Black liberation. Like so many others who once led protest movements and were now serving as government officials, he had become the target of anger and frustration. The protesters were making demands for better water and electricity. It was the last weekend of voter registration for the upcoming national elections, and when interviewed later that day, the protest’s organizer said the people of Munsieville were prepared to boycott further registrations.4 For Lipudi and other government leaders, such boycotts could cost the ruling party precious votes in a close election, and they would be forced to negotiate. FIGURE 1.1. Site of protest outside Chicken Licken, Krugersdorp. Democracy Up Close I had traveled to Krugersdorp, the seat of Mogale City government, to observe the campaign for this national election. I wanted to learn more about how multiracial democracy was faring after twenty-five years. The country’s first multiracial election, in 1994, had marked an important milestone in a highly improbable political transformation. It produced a shift in power away from an economically dominant White minority in favor of universal adult suffrage, resulting in a Black-led government. In terms of population and economic development, ending Apartheid and creating an integrated South Africa was like fusing together the relatively poor African country of Kenya and the much smaller and wealthier European country of Denmark into a single polity in just a few years’ time. Between 1989 and 1994, the size of the electorate increased by a factor of eight, from over 2.5 million to close to 20 million voters.5 During that period, the country transitioned away from civil war—a fact which itself did not bode well for democratic development if one considered the trajectories of other postconflict countries.6 And now it was time to ask: What can students of democracy and social justice the world over learn from this ambitious political endeavor? That a large protest swept right in front of me on my first day—in fact, in the first fifteen minutes of my time in Krugersdorp—was an important reminder of the mood of many of the country’s citizens: they were frustrated, angry, and losing patience. In this chapter and in the next, I share what I observed about contemporary South African politics from the perspective of the 2019 national election as it played out in Mogale City—first the campaign, and then election day itself. This will provide an introduction to the diverse actors and concerns driving the heated political competition in the country. I set my gaze on the midsized South African municipality of Mogale City because, at least from afar, it appeared to be a place that could serve as something of a microcosm for learning more about South Africa. It is racially diverse, prior elections tracked national trends toward greater competitiveness, and it straddles the country’s very different urban and rural areas. On the one hand, the municipality abuts South Africa’s megalopolis—the corridor between “Joburg” and Pretoria, home to over 8 million residents. Yet, even the most urbanized section of Mogale—Krugersdorp, with a population of about 140,000—is still just a town. Streets can get busy during trading hours, but there are no high-rise buildings. Just a few miles away, still very much within Mogale’s borders, lie thousands of acres of farmland. Black and White, rich and poor, urban and rural, and support for different political parties represent the most important sources of diversity in South Africa; and all are contained within Mogale. The municipality is located in Gauteng Province, specifically in an area known as the West Rand—a reference to the Witwatersrand, an approximately thirty-five-mile rock escarpment that elevates its residents over a mile above sea level. The Rand is also quite literally the source of continental divide, as runoff from the plateau feeds the Crocodile, Limpopo, Vaal, and Orange rivers, which in turn drain into the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Wanderers and explorers came here even before the transformative discovery of great mineral wealth in the ground below. No part of Southern Africa has drawn more people into such a concentrated area. And on my drive in from Johannesburg that January day in 2019, I noticed the immodest welcome sign, “Mogale City: Cradle of Humankind,” a reference to rich archaeological discoveries within the municipal boundaries. Mogale’s northern border is drawn by the Magaliesberg mountains, the site of millions of years of human occupation, and at least hundreds of years of known trading and conflict between groups of people moving into and out of the area. Although I never spent any significant amount of time in Krugersdorp or Mogale prior to 2019, I have been studying South African politics for my entire career and adult life. And I wanted to take stock of what had and had not been accomplished since the time of the democratic transition, especially as democracy seemed to be in peril around the world, including in my own country, the United States. Populist leaders and parties have been on the rise around the globe—in Hungary, the United States, Brazil, the Philippines, India, and elsewhere—and they have been characterized by increasingly authoritarian tendencies. South Africa was plausibly fertile ground for such appeals. Anti-immigrant and anti-elite sentiment was already strong in many pockets—and very strong in Mogale City. It would not take much imagination to organize highly racist campaigns; and any of a number of well-worn strategies to identify a culpable elite and/or additional scapegoats had the potential to win votes. FIGURE 1.2. Map of Mogale City Local Municipality in South Africa. Even beyond the seemingly fragile nature of liberal democracy around the globe, South Africa’s 2019 contest appeared pivotal in so many ways: the electoral choices were stark, as the competing parties offered very different candidates and visions; and more than any national election since 1994, this one appeared to be quite competitive. Democracy is about a lot more than just elections, but elections are both necessary and crucial, and I wanted to watch this one up close. I would start by simply observing the process, particularly as it unfolded in this one municipality, asking: What were the leading political parties offering as interpretations of the past and proposals for the future? How were citizens responding to those campaigns? And then I would consider the historical record, look comparatively at other countries, and try to make sense of what I observed with respect to the efforts to forge a new government and to deliver. Ultimately, my goal was to assess the strength and value of South Africa’s still young democracy. When I arrived in Mogale City, the municipality and the nation were just three months from marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s historic electoral victory in the first-ever truly multiracial election, one that was celebrated as a credible promise to redress the types of indignities that befell Black township dwellers like the people of Munsieville. It was also a quarter century, more or less, since the end of Apartheid—literally translated as apartness—a style of government launched in 1948 with the express goal of keeping people from different race groups apart from one another. Institutionalized White supremacy, including in the form of slavery, had been practiced to varying degrees throughout southern Africa almost immediately after the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652. When Krugersdorp was formed, it was contained within the South African Republic, a landmass representing approximately one-quarter of modern South Africa. Many of that government’s harsh rules and practices, including issuing passes to control the movement of Black people, would become the foundation for sustained racial oppression. Of course, southern Africa was not alone in its institutionalization of racial hierarchies. Most of the African continent was at some point colonized by White Europeans; and the African slave trade was built on ideas of racial supremacy. The United States and Brazil both imported massive numbers of slaves, and the lasting results of race-based inequalities are starkly evident in these countries even today. What made South Africa both truly unique and infamous was the degree to which its White government doubled down on segregation and a panoply of racially exclusionary policies during the second half of the twentieth century. When the National Party gained power in a surprising electoral victory just three years after the end of World War II, Apartheid-style government came to define South Africa as a White minority persisted in developing a vision of government and citizenship for Whites only. Apartheid planners tried to market their project to the world as one promoting national self-determination, a language that was more acceptable to postwar sensibilities as the age of empire had come to an end. And yet, there was no mistaking the fact that the Apartheid project sought to forcibly segregate and separate people of color into the least desirable territories in the region and to control them as sources of cheap labor. All of the Apartheid laws and practices were felled in the early 1990s. And yet, the end of Apartheid was not the end of South Africa’s difficult history. Deep Apartheid and pre-Apartheid legacies remained, and while various negotiating parties agreed to adopt a multiracial democracy, its success was hardly preordained. Moreover, a quarter of a century is clearly not sufficient to redress three and a half centuries of racial hierarchy. Nonetheless, the silver anniversary of the first multiracial election presented a fitting opportunity to take stock of what had been accomplished relative to expectations, to the past, and to other countries. In the pages that follow, I show that South Africa’s first twenty-five years of democratic government were extremely successful. Many problems remain and citizens are understandably frustrated that more was not accomplished during this period. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that democratic practice has moderated the tensions inherent in governing South Africa’s diverse society. Successive democratic administrations have helped to improve the lives of millions across the country, in terms of housing, basic services, social security, access to education, and more, and they have done so without resorting to political extremism. Notwithstanding these accomplishments, South Africa’s democracy remains fragile. Democracy itself is an imperfect form of government even under the best of circumstances. Hopes and expectations can quickly outpace concrete change. The machinations of democratic politics are inherently self-critical, and progress is routinely made through shining a bright light on problems, which itself feeds a sense of frustration. While often effective, these processes can contribute to an underappreciation of the enterprise. The Issues and the Parties The very proposition of democratic rule in South Africa has long seemed daunting because of the profound diversity of its citizenry. Even in relatively small and homogeneous societies, attempts to forge binding agreements through democratic processes—those that allow for input from and some form of veto power to ordinary citizens and their representatives—frequently prove to be challenging. Especially with four major race groups, eleven official languages, a relatively even split between those living in rural and urban areas, and the highest level of income inequality in the world, the notion of “common interest” can seem elusive. And yet, one of the great promises of democratic competition is that in the quest for votes, electoral candidates will make appeals to large swaths of the population, forging coalitions among people with otherwise divergent backgrounds. And for the most part, the parties competing in the 2019 electoral contest advanced credible and distinct ideas concerning how to govern South Africa’s highly diverse and unequal society. They provided answers to two central questions that had been asked for over a century, including during the very 1948 election that set the stage for Apartheid. First, there was the race question, or really, a set of race questions: How did the party propose to address the legacies of race-based inequality and conflict? Would it seek to promote integration, autonomy, or something else? And what should be the racial identity of the party’s leaders and of its core supporters? Second, and certainly relatedly, there was the economic question. On the one hand, just about everybody wants a better life in material terms, to have more comfortable shelter, basic services, and opportunities for leisure, and to take advantage of new products and new technologies. But how would the parties address the profound economic inequalities that called into question any sense of a shared humanity? All across the country, and certainly in Mogale City, you could find neighborhoods of people living in modern homes with all the amenities available in the United States or in Europe just a few miles from those living in informal structures of corrugated metal without basic services, such as electricity, clean water, or a flush toilet, let alone access to a decent job. What role should the state play in providing economic opportunities and security? What role for the “market” and competition? Should those who were previously disadvantaged get a leg up? Both issues spoke to a larger question of human worth or dignity. How should people across the color bar be treated by one another and by the state? If politics is about who gets what, and how,7 the South African parties epitomized a good political contest because if nothing else, in 2019, each of the five leading political parties was offering very different answers to these questions. At the center of the election was the African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party for twenty-five years and before that a prominent challenger to White government for eight decades. In 1963, Nelson Mandela and a group of other ANC leaders were arrested for, among other things, sabotage and conspiracy in the wake of their efforts to topple Apartheid. They served harsh prison sentences on Robben Island, but their heroic efforts at liberation were rewarded handily in the first multiracial elections in 1994. Although its support base was overwhelmingly Black African, the party had historically appointed people from various race groups to its leadership posts. It espoused racial inclusion and compromise even if its detractors sometimes argue that it does the opposite. On the economy, the ANC’s approach has been center-left and quite moderate in many ways. The ANC had always had a highly educated middle-class elite in its leadership ranks; but through its links with unions it extended its reach to workers and was even able to appeal to rural peasants through traditional leaders. It promoted economic preference policies (aka affirmative action), but not radical redistribution; and certainly in post-Apartheid South Africa, and in the context of the global economy in the late twentieth century, the organization had bet on the power of competitive markets. For years, Mandela had been celebrated as a saintlike figure. But by 2019, the ANC was treading lightly in its tributes to him and its focus on the organization’s role in ending Apartheid. Months before the election, new critics joined a growing chorus that challenged Mandela’s grand bargain with the very White government that had oppressed Black people. They complained that during the transition of the early 1990s, he had given away too much to Whites. Others, even Black leaders within the ANC, believed that during the first election campaign, he promised too much to Blacks. Either way, the charismatic icon who had passed away five years earlier, at the age of ninety-five, was being quietly blamed for some of the mess the country was in. As the incumbent party, the ANC had to stand on its record. Commentators in the media and the academy shared a steady flow of criticism and sometimes described the country as being “at a precipice” or “on the brink.” Citizens were frustrated by all sorts of issues, not the least of which was the load-shedding or rolling blackouts to ration electricity that was insufficient to meet total demand. Stories of ANC corruption, violence, high rates of unemployment, and newly emboldened as well as newly formed political parties calling for change all dominated the news. In fact, one of the country’s major scandals was centered in Mogale City. It involved Bosasa, a private South African company with headquarters in Krugersdorp that, among other things, provided prison services to the government. In January 2019, the owner—a White businessman with long-standing ANC ties—was caught paying out bribes to ANC officials, all the way up to President Jacob Zuma, in exchange for comfortable government contracts and leniency with respect to affirmative action rules.8 For fifteen years, the country had confronted an almost endless battery of protests like the one that passed by Krugersdorp’s Chicken Licken. While those protests had many messages, they were mostly a rebuke to ANC rule or at least to particular ANC leaders or factions. The main opposition going into the election was the Democratic Alliance (DA). Like the ANC, they were also a big-tent party and by 2019 had a much more racially diverse support base than the ANC. While their leader at the time of the election was a Black man—Mmusi Maimane—most of their leadership was White, and the party was born of White liberals, many of whom challenged, but also lived quite comfortably within the Apartheid system. Unlike the ANC, the DA is more explicitly pro-market, and more critical of Black preference policies, while stopping short of being rabidly laissez-faire. For years the DA had campaigned on good government, arguing that the one province it controlled (the Western Cape) and the several municipalities it governed performed better than in those provinces and municipalities where the ANC was in power. Many of the DA’s White leaders could often be attacked for flat-footed comments that failed to appreciate the challenges still faced by Black South Africans in the post-Apartheid context. When its then-leader Helen Zille tweeted in 2017 about some of the positive legacies of colonial rule, she was eviscerated on social media and faced widespread charges of racism from ANC and other party leaders and commentators. If the DA and the ANC were fighting over a big center and a wide and diverse polity, the other major contenders in the election had much more focused constituencies and distinct answers to the questions of the day. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was a relatively new party, but they were taking up ideas that had been around for generations, espousing a more exclusionary Black nationalism and a very central role for the state in the economy. Although its ideology was strong, the party was very much embodied in the thirty-seven-year-old firebrand, Julius “Juju” Malema, who had been expelled from the ANC, where he had been the leader of their influential Youth League. Malema had been convicted of hate speech and was a divisive figure in an ANC led by an older generation of liberation activists. He epitomized rebellion and nonconformity. He and his EFF had creatively captured the imagination of Black, disaffected urban dwellers, particularly the young, by reminding them of the persistent inequalities and indignities of everyday life in the country and by laying virtually all the blame on the ANC for such outcomes. Malema was clearly a populist candidate in the sense of being someone who tried to appeal to ordinary citizens through anti-elite messages. But unlike many populist contemporaries elsewhere in the world, he did not seek to scapegoat foreigners. In fact, he was outspoken in his rejection of xenophobic violence, promoting instead a pan-Africanist vision. He and his party spotlighted the reality that the country remained deeply, devastatingly unequal and that there had been very little redistribution of land from the White minority to the Black majority even under ANC government.9 Malema was demanding a radical redistribution of income, wealth, and power in one of the most unequal societies on the planet. Malema scared the ANC and he really scared South Africa’s White population, who saw him as the greatest threat since the advent of this multiracial democracy. Whites would certainly be losers in any serious redistributive scheme. To date, they had not paid dearly for the sins of the past, and in the grand scheme, their comfortable lifestyles had remained as such. And Malema would continue to remind them and the Black majority of such basic facts. Beyond these three parties, with their respective ideas, a fourth idea was still very much on the South African political menu. Ethnocultural autonomy was advocated in different ways by two different parties—both with much smaller support bases as compared with the first three, while representing groups that are central to the South African story. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+)10 is largely, but not entirely, the party of extreme-right Afrikaners. While numerically small today—White South Africans who speak Afrikaans at home comprise less than 5 percent of the population11—this group has always managed to carry outsize political influence through military might and tight political organization. As early as the eighteenth century, Dutch descendants, along with French Huguenots and a few other Europeans, increasingly spoke a variant of the Dutch language and came to think of themselves as a people attached to this land. Many began to self-identify as Afrikaners—or, simply, Africans. (They would also self-identify as Boers, or farmers.) The Afrikaners developed a strong identity and political strength by mobilizing around narratives of persecution and the quest for self-rule. Indeed, Krugersdorp’s namesake, and one of the country’s most famous Afrikaners, Paul Johannes Kruger, rose to be president of one of the two Afrikaner republics that predated the formation of modern South Africa. Born in 1825, Kruger was a boy living on the Cape when his parents decided that they could no longer remain under recently imposed British rule, which included banning the use of the Dutch language. They abandoned their home and took Paul, at around the age of nine, to participate in the storied “Great Trek,” the Afrikaner migration from the Cape to the eastern and northeastern parts of southern Africa, including around modern-day Mogale City. Ultimately, the rise of the National Party, which designed and implemented Apartheid, was the product of an Afrikaner effort to wrest control from English-speaking South Africans and those with more capitalist and internationalist orientations. Arguably, one of the most far-reaching affirmative action programs ever implemented—and successful in terms of promoting economic redistribution—was that in favor of Afrikaners during the Apartheid era.12 And now in 2019, a collection of Afrikaners mobilized by the FF+ were playing a similar card decrying cultural oppression by a Black majority and Black-led government. Going into this election, the Afrikaner quest for autonomy was not expressed explicitly in terms of the inherent supremacy of one group over another, but their core political proposition was that different people, marked by language and history, share distinct values and prefer to be among themselves, and to do as they please, at least within their own community. Although they were White and generally economically privileged relative to the majority, they were using the same language of claims-making—calling for recognition and autonomy—in the manner frequently articulated by marginalized indigenous groups in countries around the world. One might say it was a bit of chutzpah. The FF+ had not earned many seats in the national Parliament or in the Mogale City council. But in a tight election in South Africa’s particular electoral system, it could potentially play a decisive role and get at least some of what it wanted. And it continued to broadcast a foundational idea that remained strong in South Africa: address the country’s diversity by staying apart. Like the DA, they rejected affirmative action, arguing that twenty-five years was long enough for Black preference policies. The party’s leaders routinely argued that White people were “scapegoated” for the problems of the ANC government. Also clamoring for ethnocultural autonomy was the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the party most closely tied to the Zulu Kingdom, with Zulus constituting the largest language-based ethnic group in the country. Zulus could boast a long history of military might and recorded numerous strong stands against the incursions of European settlement and eastward expansion. On the one hand, the IFP drew its support from a largely poor, rural, and Black base and was less overtly at odds with the ANC government, which might make it appear quite distant from the FF+. But on the other hand, ironically, like the FF+, the IFP embraced many Apartheid-created institutions, including structures for incorporating traditional leadership and an appeal to a distinctly Zulu electorate. While the IFP certainly advocated for more social spending on the poor, particularly with regard to health care and the elderly, the party’s views on ethnic autonomy were much more aligned with those of the FF+ than with those of the other leading parties. At the dawn of the democratic era, the IFP had been a significant political force, but by 2019, its influence had clearly waned. A Last Push for Votes Despite my long-standing fascination with South African politics, and having traveled to the country regularly over almost thirty years, I had never been present for an election, and I was excited to observe this historic one up close and unfiltered. After my initial visit to Mogale in January and February during the South African summer, I returned in early May to cooler temperatures as winter approached. I arrived at Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport—so named for the celebrated, former ANC leader, Oliver Tambo—on the Friday morning before the election and efficiently made it through passport control and customs and into a rental car. Having driven from the airport so many times, I could almost take for granted the glimmering infrastructure that lines the sides of the wide and modern highway connecting the airport to various corners of the country. I dutifully obeyed the driving instructions broadcasting from my phone, took a couple of turns off the highway, and then became suddenly much more conscious of the goings-on outside my car. My driver’s-seat view of sleek, glassy exteriors had given way to plumes of black smoke on the side of the road. The street-side stores were unevenly finished with hand-painted signs; people were burning open fires and walking across the multiple lanes of the wide street. Several stores advertised that they would either buy or sell metal scraps. The division between road, commerce, and residential life had blurred, and I slowed down as the rules of the road had clearly changed. I was now in Alex—“Alexandra” township—which in the weeks before had been home to multiple election-related protests akin to what I had observed in Krugersdorp a few months earlier. I continued on to ascend a small hill, and when I arrived at the top, I could see out in the not-so-far distance a set of tall office buildings. If you wanted a single image to capture the contrast between the haves and the have-nots, this was the place to take that picture. As I exited Alex, I proceeded into Sandton, one of the wealthiest areas of the country. It is where some of the leading companies—including the large mining concerns and various multinationals at the core of the country’s industrial economy—maintain their corporate offices. Just a few days earlier, on May 1, Julius Malema stood before a packed crowd at a Workers’ Day Rally—held in Alex—in which he communicated the EFF’s aspirations, warning of the revolutionary potential born of such stark inequalities, and had this particular contrast in mind: “How do White people in Sandton sleep when they see their neighbors here in Alex living like this?” he asked. “We keep blaming government‚ yes let us do that, but what are Sandton people doing to help their neighbors? They are not doing anything, but they are staying behind high walls because they are scared of us. They are eating alone and when you are eating alone your subconscious tells you to build high walls before these people come.”13 The message was a powerful one. More than anything else, profound inequality—mostly, but not entirely, race-based—remains the source of political tension in this country. For the have-nots, the question is, who is to blame, and what is to be done about this sorry state of affairs? The parties would need to offer compelling answers to address the frustrations associated with such questions. During the final weekend before the election, each of the three largest parties—the ANC, the DA, and the EFF—would wrap up their campaigns with rallies in Soweto, a name born as an acronym for South Western Townships. It was arguably the country’s most important Black township because of its size, its political history, and its attachment to Johannesburg, the economic heartland of the country. It abuts Mogale City’s largest Black township, Kagiso. ANC Rally The ANC held its rally at Ellis Park soccer stadium. It followed a well-worn approach: warm-up remarks from lower-ranking party dignitaries to build momentum, followed by a clean-up speech by the face on the ballot. Despite the party’s claim to be “of the people,” the stadium floor was filled with VIPs separated from the masses in the bleachers. From the podium, the speaker frequently shouted, “Amandla” (“Power”), extending the middle “a” out over several seconds. The crowd’s dutiful response: “Awaaaaaaay-too” (“Awethu” or “to the people”). When the state president and the ANC lead candidate in the election, Cyril Ramaphosa, finally appeared onstage, he was wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap instead of his usual business suit. At the time, Ramaphosa was sixty-six, and he had lived many lives. He was born in Soweto, attended university, and, like so many liberation leaders, both studied law and faced multiple bouts of incarceration for breaking unjust Apartheid laws. He helped launch a major mine-working union in the 1980s, and the chairman of Anglo American described him as the “toughest, ablest, and shrewdest negotiator he’d had to deal with during his tenure.”14 And though Ramaphosa played a central role in political and constitutional negotiations, his early post-Apartheid career was in business, not politics. In just the first few years of the new democracy, he was widely courted to run various businesses and to sit on multiple corporate boards. He went on to become a leading mining executive, a veritable business titan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He always remained closely tied to the ANC, however, and was generally well regarded by a range of constituents from the different circles in which he traveled. He did have one glaring blemish on his record—one that was still relatively fresh. In 2012, in the wake of a wildcat strike at the Lonmin platinum mine in the town of Marikana—less than fifty kilometers north of the northern boundary of Mogale City—Lonmin’s management asked him to play the role of “fixer” during this moment of growing conflict. Ramaphosa, the former union leader, adopted the views of management and argued that the strikers were acting as criminals, and he called in the police. Approximately 400 members of the South African Police Service arrived with assault rifles and they opened fire, leaving 78 injured and 34 mine workers dead.15 What came to be known as the Marikana Massacre triggered additional strike waves across the mining sector and left many inside and outside of the ANC suspicious of who Ramaphosa really represented. The massacre also fueled anger at an ANC already under fire from its core constituents. Nonetheless, he worked to resuscitate his image; later that year he ran and won an internal ANC election for deputy president of the party. He would soon become deputy president of the state and, following the resignation of Jacob Zuma in 2018, president of the country. On this sunny day in 2019, and with this crowd, he presented himself more as labor organizer and man of the people than as boardroom mogul. He respectfully paid tribute to the local dignitaries present, as well as special guests from other African countries, including the former Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan. Ramaphosa acknowledged the swelling negative sentiment around the ANC. “We admit that we have made mistakes and we put ourselves before our people,” he said, adding: “but it is only those who are doing nothing who don’t make mistakes.” Those convicted for corruption would not be able to serve in leadership roles in the ANC, he promised—leaving aside the question of whether anyone would actually be investigated, let alone convicted. What he wasn’t saying explicitly, but what was well known, was that over the previous two decades, the ANC had become a house divided. Beyond Malema’s actual split from the party, there were major factions within the party, including those who still supported former president Zuma and a style of government that rested on patronage—the granting of favors and appointments for supporters. Ramaphosa was trying to clean up the ANC’s image, to recapture supporters who had left in disgust. Along these lines, he had expressed remorse about the recent direction of the ANC almost a year before, when he reached out to the Nobel prize-winning, octogenarian, and former anti-Apartheid activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu.16 Tutu had made no public statement about whether he accepted the apology, and the uncertainty about Tutu’s vote mirrored the possible uncertainty of many Black voters. On the other hand, Ramaphosa also would not want to fully alienate those card-carrying ANC members who had supported his rivals, certainly not a few days before the general election. Then he pivoted to the issue of voter turnout, smiled, and offered practical advice in a gentler tone. “If you sleep with someone in your bed, wake them up and say, ‘Sweetheart, let’s go and vote.’ ” DA Rally The DA hosted its final rally at the stadium in Dobsonville, Soweto, childhood neighborhood of the party’s leader, Mmusi Maimane, who was born in nearby Krugersdorp. In its early years, the DA attracted mostly White and Coloured supporters. On this Saturday before the election, the audience here looked to be at least 90 percent Black African. Everyone received a T-shirt, a goody bag with snacks, and a large water bottle. One cannot underestimate the importance of the giveaways to induce attendance and create goodwill in the days before the election. The planners smartly avoided booking one of the larger stadiums, as images of empty seats don’t play well anywhere. They seemed to just fill the 24,000-person arena. When Maimane arrived, the crowd predictably erupted. Handsome and slender, with a shaved head and trim beard, wearing a suit and open-collared shirt, he walked around the edge of the stadium. I had to give him credit—Maimane was surely comfortable in a stuffy boardroom, but when the music was blasting and he was on the spot to dance and move while greeting supporters, he appeared totally at ease. He took the stage and bellowed, “Vote us in. If we don’t do what we promise, vote us out!” He outlined lots of policies; not all received the same level of enthusiasm. “I want to reform our politics so that people of all races can work together towards one goal, instead of retreating back into separate corners.… I want every home to have at least one job. That way all South Africans will have the dignity of an income.” I was surprised by how loudly the audience applauded his call for “secure borders.” I had interviewed Maimane a few years earlier, and his precise and philosophical ruminations reflected his advanced degrees in theology and public administration. On this day, he adopted the voice and intonation of a traditional ANC politician, a low and guttural voice, interspersing English and Zulu, and led the crowd in a few call-and-responses of “Amandla” and “Awethu.” He surely delivered very different speeches when addressing audiences in the White suburbs. Trying to appeal to a multiracial, multiclass electorate was a tall order. Yet in a country where mixed-race marriages had long been forbidden and were still rare, the fact that he was married to a White woman suggested that maybe he could be a bridge-builder. Born to a Xhosa mother and a Tswana father, and still under forty, Maimane could be a youthful incarnation of the New South Africa. As the rally reached a climax, the question of “who is us?” returned to the fore. Maimane proclaimed, “They want us to … fear each other.” In response, the campaign slogan is a single word: “One.” EFF Rally Malema started his speech at the EFF rally at Soweto’s Orlando Stadium on a somber note. His beloved grandmother had passed away the day before. And he was clearly shaken. In acts of gracious civility—but ones that were widely expected as appropriate gestures—various party leaders, including Ramaphosa and Maimane, sent notes of condolence, and he acknowledged those with appreciation. “I am because of her.… She stood by me … she always believed in my innocence … I always knew my grandmother was there to support me.” But from there he quickly pivoted to an attack against the older generation of ANC leaders: “They are old … they must all go to old age or straight to prison. They are too old.… We are the future of South Africa.” His speech offered some concrete proposals. Focusing on his youthful core, he called on the government to shift resources from social grants to education. He argued, “That’s what we mean by economic Apartheid. Political freedom without economic freedom is meaningless.” Malema spoke forcefully to the crowd: “I am here to talk about you … ground force of the EFF, you are amazing … you have shaken the A … N … C.” On banks, “why do they hate Black people? … When we say economic freedom, we mean Black people will own productive farms.” He returned to the metaphor he had invoked the previous week in his Workers’ Day speech—referring to food and mealtime as symbolic of material wealth. “You have been watching them eat. Now it’s your time to eat.” He promised, “We are not fighting against White. We are fighting to sit at the dinner table. White people, you will no longer eat alone. We are coming to sit [at] the dinner table, and if you are refusing us … we are going to destroy that dinner table. No one is going to eat until all of us in South Africa eat from the same dinner table.” “Let the people of the West Rand own the mines,” he said, referring to the area including around Mogale City where the country’s wealth was generated through the extraction of gold and platinum upon which the racially unequal economy was built. I imagined that this line was playing well among some back in Mogale City but frightening others. The EFF did not have a record of engaging in serious violence, but in his speech, Malema dared the police to shoot ANC leaders. “If you want to shoot, go to Parliament and shoot the house which is full of criminals.” Was this really a call for murder? No. But the tone and the EFF brand more generally were certainly not focused on civil engagement, and he fired up the base as they smelled political blood. Poles and Polls The final days of the election generated a burst of heat in the winter air. Lamp poles sprouted signs broadcasting the parties’ respective sound bites. From the opposition parties: “Jobs not corruption.” “Jobs in every home.” “Fight back!” From the ruling ANC: “Let’s grow South Africa together.” Depending on the area, such signs would appear in one or more of the country’s eleven official languages. Pundits on talk radio, television, and social media and in the newspapers opined over the issues and prospects for political realignment. After increasingly disappointing results in elections over the previous decade, opinion polls revealed even more apprehension about the ANC. Just a week before the election, a widely publicized poll generated a lot of excitement and attention. It appeared that the ANC’s majority support had stunningly vanished, down to 49.5 percent, a drop of more than 5 points since a February poll; the EFF was up to almost 15 percent, and the DA was holding steady at about 21 percent.17 Other surveys gave the ANC an edge, and of course, there is always sampling error. But the specter of 49.5 percent was powerful. And the influential progressive weekly newspaper the Mail & Guardian published these results with the headline, “IRR Poll Shows National Loss for the ANC.”18 The media loves a good story. And the results showing that the ANC might not get a majority generated page clicks. Their numbers held out the possibility that the ANC would lose not just the Western Cape Province, which had long been in DA hands, but other provinces as well: KwaZulu-Natal, the country’s second-most populous province that was also former president Zuma’s home; and Gauteng, the industrial heartland, which encompasses Mogale City, Johannesburg, and several other municipalities and contains more than a quarter of the country’s population and more than a third of its economic output. And maybe, just maybe, the ANC would even lose the national election. It had the makings of a serious contest. Under different electoral rules, or with a clear ANC majority in sight, small parties like the FF+ and the IFP might not matter very much. But if the election was actually going to be this close, a party with even 1 or 2 percentage points of the vote, translating into a few seats in Parliament, could become the linchpin in forming a coalition after the election. They would use their last days to appeal to their more narrowly defined constituencies. Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi was serving out his final months as head of the IFP at the advanced age of ninety. He had founded the organization in 1975 and had both worked with and opposed the Apartheid government. And he closed out the party’s 2019 campaign with a speech at a rally on May 5 in Ulundi, once the capital of the Zulu Kingdom and still populated almost entirely by Zulus. He took similar swipes at the ruling ANC as the other opposition parties did and urged his constituents to heed the words of Nelson Mandela: “If the ANC does to you what the Apartheid government did to you, then you must do to the ANC what you did to the Apartheid government.” Not once did he explicitly talk about Zulu autonomy, but he made reference to KwaZulu-Natal ten times, making a plea to vote in order to reclaim provincial leadership. He recalled his own more “pragmatic” approach to the struggle against Apartheid, including opposition to economic sanctions and destructive political campaigns in order to “protect the economy.”19 In speeches and official documents, the FF+ was more explicit in its calls for cultural autonomy. “As far as self-determination is concerned, the FF Plus strives for autonomy … in education, care for the elderly, sports, heritage conservation and other similar matters.” And as far as the economy, “The FF Plus is convinced that only the free market can fully unlock economic value.”20 And now, the voters would need to assess what they had heard and what they had seen. The elderly and the infirm would get to vote early and election officials would go to them. Most of the population would head to the polls on May 8. The voters would get to decide the future of the country, no doubt shaped by their views about democracy and Black rule in South Africa over the previous twenty-five years.",

      "content": "1 The Campaign COMMUNICATING FRUSTRATION I HAD JUST SAT down and taken out my notebook when I heard a loud thud. It was a few minutes after 9 a.m. on the last Friday of January 2019. I had come to meet a prospective research assistant at the Chicken Licken in downtown Krugersdorp, about an hour’s drive from Johannesburg. A modest-but-modern fast food restaurant, clean and sparsely furnished, it was one of the most popular spots in a neighborhood that was otherwise filled with unremarkable storefronts, including several tire stores, low-price clothing boutiques, and pawn shops. Signs for quick and easy abortions adorned many of the adjacent buildings. I noticed that the restaurant manager was hurrying around the exterior of the building, slamming shut each of the heavy exterior gates used for security after-hours. The pair of police officers who had been sitting and chatting at the table next to me had disappeared. Most of the other customers eating and drinking there that morning had also left their tables in order to gather close to the exit, huddling under the threshold as they looked out cautiously onto the street. I stood up and joined the small crowd. We all peered out toward the action to our left and could see a loud throng of people toyi-toying. The toyi-toyi is a protest march that became popular in Black townships beginning in the late 1970s in the wake of the growing campaign against White rule in South Africa.1 On that day in January, thousands of people were hopping, dancing, singing, and yelling all along the multiple lanes of Commissioner Street. They held hand-printed placards in their hands proclaiming, “No service, no vote” and “2019 no vote.” It was still morning, but it was already getting hot in the summer sun. Sweat streamed down the protesters’ faces. The manager was closing the metal gates because the previous week, a different protest had turned violent and rubber bullets had broken windows. She wanted to protect the new windows, the restaurant, and, presumably, any customers who remained. Krugersdorp has long been a site of confrontation and conflict. Within a few years of its founding in 1887, it developed rapidly into a hard-drinking, hard-gambling, transient mining town and was frequently likened to the American “Wild West.”2 It was established to serve the booming gold mining industry a year after rich deposits were found in nearby Johannesburg. The allure of quick profits attracted thousands of foreigners, mostly from Britain but also from Australia, Ireland, and America, other parts of Africa, and other corners of the world. Over many generations individual explorers, groups, and sometimes even warring parties came through this town to try to carve out a better life. For most of its history and up until the 1990s, Krugersdorp was designated for Whites only. Black people were permitted to work here only if they carried a special permit, and mostly they were relegated to the neighboring Black townships of Munsieville and Kagiso (pronounced Kah-hee-so). As early as the first few years of the twentieth century, the Krugersdorp Town Council deliberately regulated the movement of Black Africans into and out of well-demarcated areas on the outskirts of town.3 Indeed this distinction between “towns” and “townships” was fundamental to the racial ordering built up throughout South Africa during most of the twentieth century. Today, downtown Krugersdorp is filled with people from all race groups and a wide range of nationalities. By contrast, Kagiso (about seven miles south) and Munsieville (less than four miles north) remain almost all Black, though the latter also hosts Pango Camp, a small informal settlement of poor Whites. On this day in 2019, the approximately two thousand Munsieville residents were marching to see Patrick Lipudi, mayor of Mogale City Local Municipality, which now incorporates all of these areas under a single local government. Lipudi is himself Black. In the 1970s and 1980s, he had served as a union leader, political activist, and protester; and he danced the toyi-toyi during the struggle for Black liberation. Like so many others who once led protest movements and were now serving as government officials, he had become the target of anger and frustration. The protesters were making demands for better water and electricity. It was the last weekend of voter registration for the upcoming national elections, and when interviewed later that day, the protest’s organizer said the people of Munsieville were prepared to boycott further registrations.4 For Lipudi and other government leaders, such boycotts could cost the ruling party precious votes in a close election, and they would be forced to negotiate. FIGURE 1.1. Site of protest outside Chicken Licken, Krugersdorp. Democracy Up Close I had traveled to Krugersdorp, the seat of Mogale City government, to observe the campaign for this national election. I wanted to learn more about how multiracial democracy was faring after twenty-five years. The country’s first multiracial election, in 1994, had marked an important milestone in a highly improbable political transformation. It produced a shift in power away from an economically dominant White minority in favor of universal adult suffrage, resulting in a Black-led government. In terms of population and economic development, ending Apartheid and creating an integrated South Africa was like fusing together the relatively poor African country of Kenya and the much smaller and wealthier European country of Denmark into a single polity in just a few years’ time. Between 1989 and 1994, the size of the electorate increased by a factor of eight, from over 2.5 million to close to 20 million voters.5 During that period, the country transitioned away from civil war—a fact which itself did not bode well for democratic development if one considered the trajectories of other postconflict countries.6 And now it was time to ask: What can students of democracy and social justice the world over learn from this ambitious political endeavor? That a large protest swept right in front of me on my first day—in fact, in the first fifteen minutes of my time in Krugersdorp—was an important reminder of the mood of many of the country’s citizens: they were frustrated, angry, and losing patience. In this chapter and in the next, I share what I observed about contemporary South African politics from the perspective of the 2019 national election as it played out in Mogale City—first the campaign, and then election day itself. This will provide an introduction to the diverse actors and concerns driving the heated political competition in the country. I set my gaze on the midsized South African municipality of Mogale City because, at least from afar, it appeared to be a place that could serve as something of a microcosm for learning more about South Africa. It is racially diverse, prior elections tracked national trends toward greater competitiveness, and it straddles the country’s very different urban and rural areas. On the one hand, the municipality abuts South Africa’s megalopolis—the corridor between “Joburg” and Pretoria, home to over 8 million residents. Yet, even the most urbanized section of Mogale—Krugersdorp, with a population of about 140,000—is still just a town. Streets can get busy during trading hours, but there are no high-rise buildings. Just a few miles away, still very much within Mogale’s borders, lie thousands of acres of farmland. Black and White, rich and poor, urban and rural, and support for different political parties represent the most important sources of diversity in South Africa; and all are contained within Mogale. The municipality is located in Gauteng Province, specifically in an area known as the West Rand—a reference to the Witwatersrand, an approximately thirty-five-mile rock escarpment that elevates its residents over a mile above sea level. The Rand is also quite literally the source of continental divide, as runoff from the plateau feeds the Crocodile, Limpopo, Vaal, and Orange rivers, which in turn drain into the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Wanderers and explorers came here even before the transformative discovery of great mineral wealth in the ground below. No part of Southern Africa has drawn more people into such a concentrated area. And on my drive in from Johannesburg that January day in 2019, I noticed the immodest welcome sign, “Mogale City: Cradle of Humankind,” a reference to rich archaeological discoveries within the municipal boundaries. Mogale’s northern border is drawn by the Magaliesberg mountains, the site of millions of years of human occupation, and at least hundreds of years of known trading and conflict between groups of people moving into and out of the area. Although I never spent any significant amount of time in Krugersdorp or Mogale prior to 2019, I have been studying South African politics for my entire career and adult life. And I wanted to take stock of what had and had not been accomplished since the time of the democratic transition, especially as democracy seemed to be in peril around the world, including in my own country, the United States. Populist leaders and parties have been on the rise around the globe—in Hungary, the United States, Brazil, the Philippines, India, and elsewhere—and they have been characterized by increasingly authoritarian tendencies. South Africa was plausibly fertile ground for such appeals. Anti-immigrant and anti-elite sentiment was already strong in many pockets—and very strong in Mogale City. It would not take much imagination to organize highly racist campaigns; and any of a number of well-worn strategies to identify a culpable elite and/or additional scapegoats had the potential to win votes. FIGURE 1.2. Map of Mogale City Local Municipality in South Africa. Even beyond the seemingly fragile nature of liberal democracy around the globe, South Africa’s 2019 contest appeared pivotal in so many ways: the electoral choices were stark, as the competing parties offered very different candidates and visions; and more than any national election since 1994, this one appeared to be quite competitive. Democracy is about a lot more than just elections, but elections are both necessary and crucial, and I wanted to watch this one up close. I would start by simply observing the process, particularly as it unfolded in this one municipality, asking: What were the leading political parties offering as interpretations of the past and proposals for the future? How were citizens responding to those campaigns? And then I would consider the historical record, look comparatively at other countries, and try to make sense of what I observed with respect to the efforts to forge a new government and to deliver. Ultimately, my goal was to assess the strength and value of South Africa’s still young democracy. When I arrived in Mogale City, the municipality and the nation were just three months from marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s historic electoral victory in the first-ever truly multiracial election, one that was celebrated as a credible promise to redress the types of indignities that befell Black township dwellers like the people of Munsieville. It was also a quarter century, more or less, since the end of Apartheid—literally translated as apartness—a style of government launched in 1948 with the express goal of keeping people from different race groups apart from one another. Institutionalized White supremacy, including in the form of slavery, had been practiced to varying degrees throughout southern Africa almost immediately after the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652. When Krugersdorp was formed, it was contained within the South African Republic, a landmass representing approximately one-quarter of modern South Africa. Many of that government’s harsh rules and practices, including issuing passes to control the movement of Black people, would become the foundation for sustained racial oppression. Of course, southern Africa was not alone in its institutionalization of racial hierarchies. Most of the African continent was at some point colonized by White Europeans; and the African slave trade was built on ideas of racial supremacy. The United States and Brazil both imported massive numbers of slaves, and the lasting results of race-based inequalities are starkly evident in these countries even today. What made South Africa both truly unique and infamous was the degree to which its White government doubled down on segregation and a panoply of racially exclusionary policies during the second half of the twentieth century. When the National Party gained power in a surprising electoral victory just three years after the end of World War II, Apartheid-style government came to define South Africa as a White minority persisted in developing a vision of government and citizenship for Whites only. Apartheid planners tried to market their project to the world as one promoting national self-determination, a language that was more acceptable to postwar sensibilities as the age of empire had come to an end. And yet, there was no mistaking the fact that the Apartheid project sought to forcibly segregate and separate people of color into the least desirable territories in the region and to control them as sources of cheap labor. All of the Apartheid laws and practices were felled in the early 1990s. And yet, the end of Apartheid was not the end of South Africa’s difficult history. Deep Apartheid and pre-Apartheid legacies remained, and while various negotiating parties agreed to adopt a multiracial democracy, its success was hardly preordained. Moreover, a quarter of a century is clearly not sufficient to redress three and a half centuries of racial hierarchy. Nonetheless, the silver anniversary of the first multiracial election presented a fitting opportunity to take stock of what had been accomplished relative to expectations, to the past, and to other countries. In the pages that follow, I show that South Africa’s first twenty-five years of democratic government were extremely successful. Many problems remain and citizens are understandably frustrated that more was not accomplished during this period. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that democratic practice has moderated the tensions inherent in governing South Africa’s diverse society. Successive democratic administrations have helped to improve the lives of millions across the country, in terms of housing, basic services, social security, access to education, and more, and they have done so without resorting to political extremism. Notwithstanding these accomplishments, South Africa’s democracy remains fragile. Democracy itself is an imperfect form of government even under the best of circumstances. Hopes and expectations can quickly outpace concrete change. The machinations of democratic politics are inherently self-critical, and progress is routinely made through shining a bright light on problems, which itself feeds a sense of frustration. While often effective, these processes can contribute to an underappreciation of the enterprise. The Issues and the Parties The very proposition of democratic rule in South Africa has long seemed daunting because of the profound diversity of its citizenry. Even in relatively small and homogeneous societies, attempts to forge binding agreements through democratic processes—those that allow for input from and some form of veto power to ordinary citizens and their representatives—frequently prove to be challenging. Especially with four major race groups, eleven official languages, a relatively even split between those living in rural and urban areas, and the highest level of income inequality in the world, the notion of “common interest” can seem elusive. And yet, one of the great promises of democratic competition is that in the quest for votes, electoral candidates will make appeals to large swaths of the population, forging coalitions among people with otherwise divergent backgrounds. And for the most part, the parties competing in the 2019 electoral contest advanced credible and distinct ideas concerning how to govern South Africa’s highly diverse and unequal society. They provided answers to two central questions that had been asked for over a century, including during the very 1948 election that set the stage for Apartheid. First, there was the race question, or really, a set of race questions: How did the party propose to address the legacies of race-based inequality and conflict? Would it seek to promote integration, autonomy, or something else? And what should be the racial identity of the party’s leaders and of its core supporters? Second, and certainly relatedly, there was the economic question. On the one hand, just about everybody wants a better life in material terms, to have more comfortable shelter, basic services, and opportunities for leisure, and to take advantage of new products and new technologies. But how would the parties address the profound economic inequalities that called into question any sense of a shared humanity? All across the country, and certainly in Mogale City, you could find neighborhoods of people living in modern homes with all the amenities available in the United States or in Europe just a few miles from those living in informal structures of corrugated metal without basic services, such as electricity, clean water, or a flush toilet, let alone access to a decent job. What role should the state play in providing economic opportunities and security? What role for the “market” and competition? Should those who were previously disadvantaged get a leg up? Both issues spoke to a larger question of human worth or dignity. How should people across the color bar be treated by one another and by the state? If politics is about who gets what, and how,7 the South African parties epitomized a good political contest because if nothing else, in 2019, each of the five leading political parties was offering very different answers to these questions. At the center of the election was the African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party for twenty-five years and before that a prominent challenger to White government for eight decades. In 1963, Nelson Mandela and a group of other ANC leaders were arrested for, among other things, sabotage and conspiracy in the wake of their efforts to topple Apartheid. They served harsh prison sentences on Robben Island, but their heroic efforts at liberation were rewarded handily in the first multiracial elections in 1994. Although its support base was overwhelmingly Black African, the party had historically appointed people from various race groups to its leadership posts. It espoused racial inclusion and compromise even if its detractors sometimes argue that it does the opposite. On the economy, the ANC’s approach has been center-left and quite moderate in many ways. The ANC had always had a highly educated middle-class elite in its leadership ranks; but through its links with unions it extended its reach to workers and was even able to appeal to rural peasants through traditional leaders. It promoted economic preference policies (aka affirmative action), but not radical redistribution; and certainly in post-Apartheid South Africa, and in the context of the global economy in the late twentieth century, the organization had bet on the power of competitive markets. For years, Mandela had been celebrated as a saintlike figure. But by 2019, the ANC was treading lightly in its tributes to him and its focus on the organization’s role in ending Apartheid. Months before the election, new critics joined a growing chorus that challenged Mandela’s grand bargain with the very White government that had oppressed Black people. They complained that during the transition of the early 1990s, he had given away too much to Whites. Others, even Black leaders within the ANC, believed that during the first election campaign, he promised too much to Blacks. Either way, the charismatic icon who had passed away five years earlier, at the age of ninety-five, was being quietly blamed for some of the mess the country was in. As the incumbent party, the ANC had to stand on its record. Commentators in the media and the academy shared a steady flow of criticism and sometimes described the country as being “at a precipice” or “on the brink.” Citizens were frustrated by all sorts of issues, not the least of which was the load-shedding or rolling blackouts to ration electricity that was insufficient to meet total demand. Stories of ANC corruption, violence, high rates of unemployment, and newly emboldened as well as newly formed political parties calling for change all dominated the news. In fact, one of the country’s major scandals was centered in Mogale City. It involved Bosasa, a private South African company with headquarters in Krugersdorp that, among other things, provided prison services to the government. In January 2019, the owner—a White businessman with long-standing ANC ties—was caught paying out bribes to ANC officials, all the way up to President Jacob Zuma, in exchange for comfortable government contracts and leniency with respect to affirmative action rules.8 For fifteen years, the country had confronted an almost endless battery of protests like the one that passed by Krugersdorp’s Chicken Licken. While those protests had many messages, they were mostly a rebuke to ANC rule or at least to particular ANC leaders or factions. The main opposition going into the election was the Democratic Alliance (DA). Like the ANC, they were also a big-tent party and by 2019 had a much more racially diverse support base than the ANC. While their leader at the time of the election was a Black man—Mmusi Maimane—most of their leadership was White, and the party was born of White liberals, many of whom challenged, but also lived quite comfortably within the Apartheid system. Unlike the ANC, the DA is more explicitly pro-market, and more critical of Black preference policies, while stopping short of being rabidly laissez-faire. For years the DA had campaigned on good government, arguing that the one province it controlled (the Western Cape) and the several municipalities it governed performed better than in those provinces and municipalities where the ANC was in power. Many of the DA’s White leaders could often be attacked for flat-footed comments that failed to appreciate the challenges still faced by Black South Africans in the post-Apartheid context. When its then-leader Helen Zille tweeted in 2017 about some of the positive legacies of colonial rule, she was eviscerated on social media and faced widespread charges of racism from ANC and other party leaders and commentators. If the DA and the ANC were fighting over a big center and a wide and diverse polity, the other major contenders in the election had much more focused constituencies and distinct answers to the questions of the day. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was a relatively new party, but they were taking up ideas that had been around for generations, espousing a more exclusionary Black nationalism and a very central role for the state in the economy. Although its ideology was strong, the party was very much embodied in the thirty-seven-year-old firebrand, Julius “Juju” Malema, who had been expelled from the ANC, where he had been the leader of their influential Youth League. Malema had been convicted of hate speech and was a divisive figure in an ANC led by an older generation of liberation activists. He epitomized rebellion and nonconformity. He and his EFF had creatively captured the imagination of Black, disaffected urban dwellers, particularly the young, by reminding them of the persistent inequalities and indignities of everyday life in the country and by laying virtually all the blame on the ANC for such outcomes. Malema was clearly a populist candidate in the sense of being someone who tried to appeal to ordinary citizens through anti-elite messages. But unlike many populist contemporaries elsewhere in the world, he did not seek to scapegoat foreigners. In fact, he was outspoken in his rejection of xenophobic violence, promoting instead a pan-Africanist vision. He and his party spotlighted the reality that the country remained deeply, devastatingly unequal and that there had been very little redistribution of land from the White minority to the Black majority even under ANC government.9 Malema was demanding a radical redistribution of income, wealth, and power in one of the most unequal societies on the planet. Malema scared the ANC and he really scared South Africa’s White population, who saw him as the greatest threat since the advent of this multiracial democracy. Whites would certainly be losers in any serious redistributive scheme. To date, they had not paid dearly for the sins of the past, and in the grand scheme, their comfortable lifestyles had remained as such. And Malema would continue to remind them and the Black majority of such basic facts. Beyond these three parties, with their respective ideas, a fourth idea was still very much on the South African political menu. Ethnocultural autonomy was advocated in different ways by two different parties—both with much smaller support bases as compared with the first three, while representing groups that are central to the South African story. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+)10 is largely, but not entirely, the party of extreme-right Afrikaners. While numerically small today—White South Africans who speak Afrikaans at home comprise less than 5 percent of the population11—this group has always managed to carry outsize political influence through military might and tight political organization. As early as the eighteenth century, Dutch descendants, along with French Huguenots and a few other Europeans, increasingly spoke a variant of the Dutch language and came to think of themselves as a people attached to this land. Many began to self-identify as Afrikaners—or, simply, Africans. (They would also self-identify as Boers, or farmers.) The Afrikaners developed a strong identity and political strength by mobilizing around narratives of persecution and the quest for self-rule. Indeed, Krugersdorp’s namesake, and one of the country’s most famous Afrikaners, Paul Johannes Kruger, rose to be president of one of the two Afrikaner republics that predated the formation of modern South Africa. Born in 1825, Kruger was a boy living on the Cape when his parents decided that they could no longer remain under recently imposed British rule, which included banning the use of the Dutch language. They abandoned their home and took Paul, at around the age of nine, to participate in the storied “Great Trek,” the Afrikaner migration from the Cape to the eastern and northeastern parts of southern Africa, including around modern-day Mogale City. Ultimately, the rise of the National Party, which designed and implemented Apartheid, was the product of an Afrikaner effort to wrest control from English-speaking South Africans and those with more capitalist and internationalist orientations. Arguably, one of the most far-reaching affirmative action programs ever implemented—and successful in terms of promoting economic redistribution—was that in favor of Afrikaners during the Apartheid era.12 And now in 2019, a collection of Afrikaners mobilized by the FF+ were playing a similar card decrying cultural oppression by a Black majority and Black-led government. Going into this election, the Afrikaner quest for autonomy was not expressed explicitly in terms of the inherent supremacy of one group over another, but their core political proposition was that different people, marked by language and history, share distinct values and prefer to be among themselves, and to do as they please, at least within their own community. Although they were White and generally economically privileged relative to the majority, they were using the same language of claims-making—calling for recognition and autonomy—in the manner frequently articulated by marginalized indigenous groups in countries around the world. One might say it was a bit of chutzpah. The FF+ had not earned many seats in the national Parliament or in the Mogale City council. But in a tight election in South Africa’s particular electoral system, it could potentially play a decisive role and get at least some of what it wanted. And it continued to broadcast a foundational idea that remained strong in South Africa: address the country’s diversity by staying apart. Like the DA, they rejected affirmative action, arguing that twenty-five years was long enough for Black preference policies. The party’s leaders routinely argued that White people were “scapegoated” for the problems of the ANC government. Also clamoring for ethnocultural autonomy was the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the party most closely tied to the Zulu Kingdom, with Zulus constituting the largest language-based ethnic group in the country. Zulus could boast a long history of military might and recorded numerous strong stands against the incursions of European settlement and eastward expansion. On the one hand, the IFP drew its support from a largely poor, rural, and Black base and was less overtly at odds with the ANC government, which might make it appear quite distant from the FF+. But on the other hand, ironically, like the FF+, the IFP embraced many Apartheid-created institutions, including structures for incorporating traditional leadership and an appeal to a distinctly Zulu electorate. While the IFP certainly advocated for more social spending on the poor, particularly with regard to health care and the elderly, the party’s views on ethnic autonomy were much more aligned with those of the FF+ than with those of the other leading parties. At the dawn of the democratic era, the IFP had been a significant political force, but by 2019, its influence had clearly waned. A Last Push for Votes Despite my long-standing fascination with South African politics, and having traveled to the country regularly over almost thirty years, I had never been present for an election, and I was excited to observe this historic one up close and unfiltered. After my initial visit to Mogale in January and February during the South African summer, I returned in early May to cooler temperatures as winter approached. I arrived at Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport—so named for the celebrated, former ANC leader, Oliver Tambo—on the Friday morning before the election and efficiently made it through passport control and customs and into a rental car. Having driven from the airport so many times, I could almost take for granted the glimmering infrastructure that lines the sides of the wide and modern highway connecting the airport to various corners of the country. I dutifully obeyed the driving instructions broadcasting from my phone, took a couple of turns off the highway, and then became suddenly much more conscious of the goings-on outside my car. My driver’s-seat view of sleek, glassy exteriors had given way to plumes of black smoke on the side of the road. The street-side stores were unevenly finished with hand-painted signs; people were burning open fires and walking across the multiple lanes of the wide street. Several stores advertised that they would either buy or sell metal scraps. The division between road, commerce, and residential life had blurred, and I slowed down as the rules of the road had clearly changed. I was now in Alex—“Alexandra” township—which in the weeks before had been home to multiple election-related protests akin to what I had observed in Krugersdorp a few months earlier. I continued on to ascend a small hill, and when I arrived at the top, I could see out in the not-so-far distance a set of tall office buildings. If you wanted a single image to capture the contrast between the haves and the have-nots, this was the place to take that picture. As I exited Alex, I proceeded into Sandton, one of the wealthiest areas of the country. It is where some of the leading companies—including the large mining concerns and various multinationals at the core of the country’s industrial economy—maintain their corporate offices. Just a few days earlier, on May 1, Julius Malema stood before a packed crowd at a Workers’ Day Rally—held in Alex—in which he communicated the EFF’s aspirations, warning of the revolutionary potential born of such stark inequalities, and had this particular contrast in mind: “How do White people in Sandton sleep when they see their neighbors here in Alex living like this?” he asked. “We keep blaming government‚ yes let us do that, but what are Sandton people doing to help their neighbors? They are not doing anything, but they are staying behind high walls because they are scared of us. They are eating alone and when you are eating alone your subconscious tells you to build high walls before these people come.”13 The message was a powerful one. More than anything else, profound inequality—mostly, but not entirely, race-based—remains the source of political tension in this country. For the have-nots, the question is, who is to blame, and what is to be done about this sorry state of affairs? The parties would need to offer compelling answers to address the frustrations associated with such questions. During the final weekend before the election, each of the three largest parties—the ANC, the DA, and the EFF—would wrap up their campaigns with rallies in Soweto, a name born as an acronym for South Western Townships. It was arguably the country’s most important Black township because of its size, its political history, and its attachment to Johannesburg, the economic heartland of the country. It abuts Mogale City’s largest Black township, Kagiso. ANC Rally The ANC held its rally at Ellis Park soccer stadium. It followed a well-worn approach: warm-up remarks from lower-ranking party dignitaries to build momentum, followed by a clean-up speech by the face on the ballot. Despite the party’s claim to be “of the people,” the stadium floor was filled with VIPs separated from the masses in the bleachers. From the podium, the speaker frequently shouted, “Amandla” (“Power”), extending the middle “a” out over several seconds. The crowd’s dutiful response: “Awaaaaaaay-too” (“Awethu” or “to the people”). When the state president and the ANC lead candidate in the election, Cyril Ramaphosa, finally appeared onstage, he was wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap instead of his usual business suit. At the time, Ramaphosa was sixty-six, and he had lived many lives. He was born in Soweto, attended university, and, like so many liberation leaders, both studied law and faced multiple bouts of incarceration for breaking unjust Apartheid laws. He helped launch a major mine-working union in the 1980s, and the chairman of Anglo American described him as the “toughest, ablest, and shrewdest negotiator he’d had to deal with during his tenure.”14 And though Ramaphosa played a central role in political and constitutional negotiations, his early post-Apartheid career was in business, not politics. In just the first few years of the new democracy, he was widely courted to run various businesses and to sit on multiple corporate boards. He went on to become a leading mining executive, a veritable business titan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He always remained closely tied to the ANC, however, and was generally well regarded by a range of constituents from the different circles in which he traveled. He did have one glaring blemish on his record—one that was still relatively fresh. In 2012, in the wake of a wildcat strike at the Lonmin platinum mine in the town of Marikana—less than fifty kilometers north of the northern boundary of Mogale City—Lonmin’s management asked him to play the role of “fixer” during this moment of growing conflict. Ramaphosa, the former union leader, adopted the views of management and argued that the strikers were acting as criminals, and he called in the police. Approximately 400 members of the South African Police Service arrived with assault rifles and they opened fire, leaving 78 injured and 34 mine workers dead.15 What came to be known as the Marikana Massacre triggered additional strike waves across the mining sector and left many inside and outside of the ANC suspicious of who Ramaphosa really represented. The massacre also fueled anger at an ANC already under fire from its core constituents. Nonetheless, he worked to resuscitate his image; later that year he ran and won an internal ANC election for deputy president of the party. He would soon become deputy president of the state and, following the resignation of Jacob Zuma in 2018, president of the country. On this sunny day in 2019, and with this crowd, he presented himself more as labor organizer and man of the people than as boardroom mogul. He respectfully paid tribute to the local dignitaries present, as well as special guests from other African countries, including the former Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan. Ramaphosa acknowledged the swelling negative sentiment around the ANC. “We admit that we have made mistakes and we put ourselves before our people,” he said, adding: “but it is only those who are doing nothing who don’t make mistakes.” Those convicted for corruption would not be able to serve in leadership roles in the ANC, he promised—leaving aside the question of whether anyone would actually be investigated, let alone convicted. What he wasn’t saying explicitly, but what was well known, was that over the previous two decades, the ANC had become a house divided. Beyond Malema’s actual split from the party, there were major factions within the party, including those who still supported former president Zuma and a style of government that rested on patronage—the granting of favors and appointments for supporters. Ramaphosa was trying to clean up the ANC’s image, to recapture supporters who had left in disgust. Along these lines, he had expressed remorse about the recent direction of the ANC almost a year before, when he reached out to the Nobel prize-winning, octogenarian, and former anti-Apartheid activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu.16 Tutu had made no public statement about whether he accepted the apology, and the uncertainty about Tutu’s vote mirrored the possible uncertainty of many Black voters. On the other hand, Ramaphosa also would not want to fully alienate those card-carrying ANC members who had supported his rivals, certainly not a few days before the general election. Then he pivoted to the issue of voter turnout, smiled, and offered practical advice in a gentler tone. “If you sleep with someone in your bed, wake them up and say, ‘Sweetheart, let’s go and vote.’ ” DA Rally The DA hosted its final rally at the stadium in Dobsonville, Soweto, childhood neighborhood of the party’s leader, Mmusi Maimane, who was born in nearby Krugersdorp. In its early years, the DA attracted mostly White and Coloured supporters. On this Saturday before the election, the audience here looked to be at least 90 percent Black African. Everyone received a T-shirt, a goody bag with snacks, and a large water bottle. One cannot underestimate the importance of the giveaways to induce attendance and create goodwill in the days before the election. The planners smartly avoided booking one of the larger stadiums, as images of empty seats don’t play well anywhere. They seemed to just fill the 24,000-person arena. When Maimane arrived, the crowd predictably erupted. Handsome and slender, with a shaved head and trim beard, wearing a suit and open-collared shirt, he walked around the edge of the stadium. I had to give him credit—Maimane was surely comfortable in a stuffy boardroom, but when the music was blasting and he was on the spot to dance and move while greeting supporters, he appeared totally at ease. He took the stage and bellowed, “Vote us in. If we don’t do what we promise, vote us out!” He outlined lots of policies; not all received the same level of enthusiasm. “I want to reform our politics so that people of all races can work together towards one goal, instead of retreating back into separate corners.… I want every home to have at least one job. That way all South Africans will have the dignity of an income.” I was surprised by how loudly the audience applauded his call for “secure borders.” I had interviewed Maimane a few years earlier, and his precise and philosophical ruminations reflected his advanced degrees in theology and public administration. On this day, he adopted the voice and intonation of a traditional ANC politician, a low and guttural voice, interspersing English and Zulu, and led the crowd in a few call-and-responses of “Amandla” and “Awethu.” He surely delivered very different speeches when addressing audiences in the White suburbs. Trying to appeal to a multiracial, multiclass electorate was a tall order. Yet in a country where mixed-race marriages had long been forbidden and were still rare, the fact that he was married to a White woman suggested that maybe he could be a bridge-builder. Born to a Xhosa mother and a Tswana father, and still under forty, Maimane could be a youthful incarnation of the New South Africa. As the rally reached a climax, the question of “who is us?” returned to the fore. Maimane proclaimed, “They want us to … fear each other.” In response, the campaign slogan is a single word: “One.” EFF Rally Malema started his speech at the EFF rally at Soweto’s Orlando Stadium on a somber note. His beloved grandmother had passed away the day before. And he was clearly shaken. In acts of gracious civility—but ones that were widely expected as appropriate gestures—various party leaders, including Ramaphosa and Maimane, sent notes of condolence, and he acknowledged those with appreciation. “I am because of her.… She stood by me … she always believed in my innocence … I always knew my grandmother was there to support me.” But from there he quickly pivoted to an attack against the older generation of ANC leaders: “They are old … they must all go to old age or straight to prison. They are too old.… We are the future of South Africa.” His speech offered some concrete proposals. Focusing on his youthful core, he called on the government to shift resources from social grants to education. He argued, “That’s what we mean by economic Apartheid. Political freedom without economic freedom is meaningless.” Malema spoke forcefully to the crowd: “I am here to talk about you … ground force of the EFF, you are amazing … you have shaken the A … N … C.” On banks, “why do they hate Black people? … When we say economic freedom, we mean Black people will own productive farms.” He returned to the metaphor he had invoked the previous week in his Workers’ Day speech—referring to food and mealtime as symbolic of material wealth. “You have been watching them eat. Now it’s your time to eat.” He promised, “We are not fighting against White. We are fighting to sit at the dinner table. White people, you will no longer eat alone. We are coming to sit [at] the dinner table, and if you are refusing us … we are going to destroy that dinner table. No one is going to eat until all of us in South Africa eat from the same dinner table.” “Let the people of the West Rand own the mines,” he said, referring to the area including around Mogale City where the country’s wealth was generated through the extraction of gold and platinum upon which the racially unequal economy was built. I imagined that this line was playing well among some back in Mogale City but frightening others. The EFF did not have a record of engaging in serious violence, but in his speech, Malema dared the police to shoot ANC leaders. “If you want to shoot, go to Parliament and shoot the house which is full of criminals.” Was this really a call for murder? No. But the tone and the EFF brand more generally were certainly not focused on civil engagement, and he fired up the base as they smelled political blood. Poles and Polls The final days of the election generated a burst of heat in the winter air. Lamp poles sprouted signs broadcasting the parties’ respective sound bites. From the opposition parties: “Jobs not corruption.” “Jobs in every home.” “Fight back!” From the ruling ANC: “Let’s grow South Africa together.” Depending on the area, such signs would appear in one or more of the country’s eleven official languages. Pundits on talk radio, television, and social media and in the newspapers opined over the issues and prospects for political realignment. After increasingly disappointing results in elections over the previous decade, opinion polls revealed even more apprehension about the ANC. Just a week before the election, a widely publicized poll generated a lot of excitement and attention. It appeared that the ANC’s majority support had stunningly vanished, down to 49.5 percent, a drop of more than 5 points since a February poll; the EFF was up to almost 15 percent, and the DA was holding steady at about 21 percent.17 Other surveys gave the ANC an edge, and of course, there is always sampling error. But the specter of 49.5 percent was powerful. And the influential progressive weekly newspaper the Mail & Guardian published these results with the headline, “IRR Poll Shows National Loss for the ANC.”18 The media loves a good story. And the results showing that the ANC might not get a majority generated page clicks. Their numbers held out the possibility that the ANC would lose not just the Western Cape Province, which had long been in DA hands, but other provinces as well: KwaZulu-Natal, the country’s second-most populous province that was also former president Zuma’s home; and Gauteng, the industrial heartland, which encompasses Mogale City, Johannesburg, and several other municipalities and contains more than a quarter of the country’s population and more than a third of its economic output. And maybe, just maybe, the ANC would even lose the national election. It had the makings of a serious contest. Under different electoral rules, or with a clear ANC majority in sight, small parties like the FF+ and the IFP might not matter very much. But if the election was actually going to be this close, a party with even 1 or 2 percentage points of the vote, translating into a few seats in Parliament, could become the linchpin in forming a coalition after the election. They would use their last days to appeal to their more narrowly defined constituencies. Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi was serving out his final months as head of the IFP at the advanced age of ninety. He had founded the organization in 1975 and had both worked with and opposed the Apartheid government. And he closed out the party’s 2019 campaign with a speech at a rally on May 5 in Ulundi, once the capital of the Zulu Kingdom and still populated almost entirely by Zulus. He took similar swipes at the ruling ANC as the other opposition parties did and urged his constituents to heed the words of Nelson Mandela: “If the ANC does to you what the Apartheid government did to you, then you must do to the ANC what you did to the Apartheid government.” Not once did he explicitly talk about Zulu autonomy, but he made reference to KwaZulu-Natal ten times, making a plea to vote in order to reclaim provincial leadership. He recalled his own more “pragmatic” approach to the struggle against Apartheid, including opposition to economic sanctions and destructive political campaigns in order to “protect the economy.”19 In speeches and official documents, the FF+ was more explicit in its calls for cultural autonomy. “As far as self-determination is concerned, the FF Plus strives for autonomy … in education, care for the elderly, sports, heritage conservation and other similar matters.” And as far as the economy, “The FF Plus is convinced that only the free market can fully unlock economic value.”20 And now, the voters would need to assess what they had heard and what they had seen. The elderly and the infirm would get to vote early and election officials would go to them. Most of the population would head to the polls on May 8. The voters would get to decide the future of the country, no doubt shaped by their views about democracy and Black rule in South Africa over the previous twenty-five years.",

I wanted to see this for myself and to hear what was on the minds of the very diverse citizens at the precise time that they were finally being forced to make this important decision. Using the geo-coordinates of the polling stations posted online by the electoral commission (IEC), I planned a tour of Mogale City. I set out to trace the history of the development of the area, while trying to minimize driving distance between stops. In preparation, I charged two mobile phones, one with an American SIM card, one with a local SIM. These devices would guide me throughout the day, and I needed some redundancy in case one failed or got poor service, eventualities I had previously experienced. I also brought a notebook that fit in my back pocket and a few pens. A friend and colleague who is an expert on election observation advised me to wear neutral colors, to carry a clipboard, and to review an election observation handbook.1 During the previous few days, the weather had been absolutely stunning: warm, with clear skies—winter in Gauteng is nothing like its Boston counterpart. On this morning, however, it was distinctively chilly and overcast. Adding to my sense of apprehension, as I departed from my guesthouse at about 6:45 a.m., I saw that several birds had decided to mark this special day by crapping all over my white rental car. FIGURE 2.1. My election day route, Mogale City, May 8, 2019. MONUMENT PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:00 A.M. My first stop was Monument Primary School. Although I had hoped to get there a bit before the election station was set to open, I arrived at exactly 7 a.m. Monument refers to the Paardekraal Monument, just half a mile away, where almost 139 years earlier Paul Kruger and approximately 6,000 fellow Afrikaners built a cairn—a large statue of stones—to mark their unity and common cause in resisting British rule.2 Always a group to mix religion and politics, they declared it a symbol of their covenant with God, recalling unlikely past victories against their foes.3 Monument Primary School sits just a block away from Voortrekker Road—yet another nod to the Afrikaner legacy. In Ward 37, just shy of 50 percent of households speak Afrikaans at home. It had grown to be a solid DA constituency, and in the 2016 local election, that party raked in over 83 percent of the vote here. In this well-manicured neighborhood, large but hardly ostentatious homes are mostly visible from the street. Outside the gates of the school, the DA set up what looked like a small office, with a canopy and a table. I didn’t see any other parties. Either they were conceding this ward, or—more likely—they just had not gotten their acts together to arrive before voting began. Election day is a national holiday in South Africa—a simple tribute to its importance that some have advocated for in the United States.4 But that doesn’t mean everyone had the day off from work, and in any case, many people like to vote early. About sixty people were standing in line outside when I arrived. Apart from one woman, everyone I saw was White; there was a fairly good mix of young and old, and many people came with their kids. A few pulled up in high-end “bakkies,” white, tricked-out pickup trucks, with stainless steel crossbars in the front. One DA sign said, “Stop the ANC and EFF.” In other words, stop the two Black parties. There were no ANC signs around here. In the last election, the ruling party barely eked out 7 percent of the vote in this ward, even though almost 30 percent of the population was Black. On the one hand, because today’s elections were for the provincial and national legislatures, it was not as if a vote in one part of the municipality would have a greater impact than anywhere else in the province. On the other hand, local party officials would be held accountable for each polling station, and the returns in this election would serve as a benchmark for local contests scheduled for two years in the future. The respective parties would make decisions about which local officials could stand in those elections with this information in mind. I found a spot that was outside the IEC’s taped-off boundaries but close enough that I could greet exiting voters. At 7:15, just fifteen minutes after the school opened to voters, I approached a White woman, probably in her thirties, who spoke quickly with a strong Afrikaans accent. “Aagh, they weren’t quite ready for us,” she told me. “The left hand doesn’t know where is the right hand. But it was not too much of a holdup.” She was skeptical that the vote would be totally free: “I think they will try to put in votes,” she said, which I took to mean that the ANC would stuff ballot boxes with fraudulent ballots. Of her friends and family she said, “Most will vote. Some will say it’s not worth it. But we need to try.” When I asked about possible problems so far, she said she was not aware of any vote buying or intimidation. Just before 7:20, I saw that a few ANC party representatives had arrived to set up shop near where the DA decamped. The major parties set up these small booths outside the election stations to provide a last bit of party marketing, to stand by to monitor for any funny business, and to allow party supporters to come by to check in. The actual vote is secret, but this system allows the parties to keep track of who actually shows up on election day. Next, I spoke with a forty-something White man who described the process as very efficient and recounted that he had voted in every previous election. “I think you need a strong opposition … and I think the fear factor of the EFF is what’s causing a lot of people to vote.” A young woman, probably in her early twenties, came out with her father, and when I asked her about her decision to come to vote, she said, “It’s the right thing to do.” As I drove away I saw well-ordered rubbish bins set out at the end of driveways, in greater order than I was accustomed to in my Brookline, Massachusetts, neighborhood on collection day. Basic service delivery was just about 100 percent in Ward 37. But I did notice a few guys picking through the trash bins. The very poor would try to survive on the salable, salvageable items from the detritus of the well-to-do. WEST RAND PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:40 A.M. My next stop was a voting station on the other side of Coronation Park. It was established in 1902 to commemorate Edward VII’s coronation as British king in 1901 and just following the British defeat of the Boers in the 1899–1902 war, also known as the Boer War. The park may have been built over a concentration camp run by the British, largely to contain their Afrikaner enemies, and remains as yet one more remembrance of the bitter tensions that once stood between these two White groups.5 While bloody and costly, the peace for that war paved the way for the formation of the Union of South Africa, which integrated two Boer-run republics and two British colonies. The IEC station here was the second of three in Ward 37 and was set up at the West Rand School, which had a long driveway and well-manicured grounds. As I entered, I cynically assumed it was a place filled with White, square-chinned rugby players. I later learned that it is a multiracial primary school for physically disabled children, many of whom have cerebral palsy, and it was heartening to recognize that the most vulnerable were enjoying access to what appeared to be a beautiful facility. The voters were again mostly White, a mix of old and young. Some likely worked desk jobs; others wore the fluorescent vests and pants that help to protect those working on the street as cleaners, parking attendants, and road pavers. “They already say that the voting papers [ballots] were not stamped,” a White woman, perhaps in her early sixties, said in response to my question about the integrity of the voting process. “They say we must write in a pen.” Apparently, some votes cast somewhere in the country were in pencil and had been changed. The stamps are used on election day by election workers to mark the validity of the ballots. Reports of any malfeasance circulate instantaneously on social media. I asked, why vote? “Actually, it’s a privilege to be part of the process. I have a nineteen-year-old son who did not register but he regrets it. I hope they [young people] have a say. It’s exciting for me to see people get involved. To do something about it.” I saw just one Black African woman, wearing a faded pink cotton apron that peered out underneath her jacket. She was originally from Soweto but had lived in this area for a long time. I made it a point not to ask anyone about their vote choices, but she quickly informed me, proudly, “I am ANC … I have voted in all of the elections.” I saw it was 8 a.m. on my watch, the sun was coming out, and I headed to my car. On my drive, I passed a tall statue of Paul Kruger, the last Afrikaner president of the Afrikaner Republic that predated the Union of South Africa. RAND EN DAL KLINIESKOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:05 A.M. At about 8:05 a.m., I arrived at the first of my two stops in Ward 17, the Rand en Dal Klinieskool. This is in Dan Pienaarville, the site of significant political tension in the 1980s when its White residents clamored for Black residents of nearby Munsieville to be moved because they were, simply, too close for comfort. Dan Pienaarville remains a largely White area, but compared with my first stops, the neighborhood homes were smaller, the grass was less tightly manicured, and there were more vacant, scruffy lots. Nonetheless, most voters arrived in their own cars, reflecting a certain level of wealth or employment status that most South Africans do not enjoy. For the first time that day, I saw a large ANC Mogale City tent. The DA was also there, as was the FF+. The skies turned gray again. “One hundred percent. Nice and smooth,” a forty-something White man with a goatee explained to me as he stood next to his wife. “This was a bit better, because last time they started late. We need to vote for the opposition to try to end the corruption. It’s a beautiful country, but we must set the politics right.” A Black man in his thirties also described the process as smooth. He had moved to the area only six months earlier. “I think it was free and fair, but I would prefer a system like in the United States, where you have the opportunity to vote directly for the president.” I didn’t ask his party, but I did ask what influenced his vote choice. “It’s not easy. You look at the past and, well, job creation is critical. Our economy is moving at a slow pace. We need to get that right.” Any irregularities? “I just saw on TV and social media an issue with some ballot papers,” he said, referring to the same incident that the woman had referenced earlier in the day. “But besides that, nothing.” As I looked around, I was struck by the fact that many people brought their youngish children. I was reminded of the idiosyncrasies of election day: people with children are likely to vote at different times than those without. On a day like today, with changing and unseasonably cold and wet weather, some may not bother at all. At 8:30 a.m., I also felt how chilly it had become, and the South Africans will tell you how much they don’t like the cold. People were still streaming in. Many couples walked to the voting station holding hands. An older White man told me, “No problems. I’ve voted and lived here all my life.” Then he corrected himself: “I came from Namibia in 1978.” At that time, Namibia was controlled by South Africa, essentially governed under Apartheid policies as an additional province and called Southwest Africa. He then uttered a mantra that I would hear throughout the rest of the day: “If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” I supposed that there is a great desire to complain, and if you feel that you will be denied this opportunity if you don’t vote, it’s a small price to pay. He described the system as free and fair. “Yah, I think so. But there are too many parties involved.” Indeed, forty-eight parties had registered for the national election. I asked about people not voting. “In my family, everyone wants to vote. My children, my wife. First, we must try to get rid of the ANC. The next stronger party must be given a chance.” He saw no intimidation or vote buying. He told me that his wife, who is in her sixties and frailer, was able to vote earlier as they let older people vote first. I approached the DA tent and asked the attending representative how the day was going. “It’s cold. That will affect the vote.” Any irregularities? “I haven’t seen anything. But it’s still early.” I went to the ANC tent, where just one man was holding down the fort. I asked if they had many supporters in the area. He didn’t directly respond to my question, but the answer was clear: “Well, it’s mostly White people who live around here.” At 8:48 a.m., I got back into my now thoroughly bird-crap-stained rental car to visit one more voting station in the informally constituted border area between Dan Pienaarville and Munsieville. To do so, I crossed the road that was built in the 1980s expressly to keep these White and Black communities apart.6 It was still working. TOWN VIEW HIGH SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:50 A.M. At Town View High School, I met a thirty-something Black woman who told me, “I want a better life. I need a house. I need work.” Perhaps wishfully, she predicted a coalition would unseat the ANC: “I think the DA and the EFF will win.” At 9:18 a.m., according to my rough plan of allocating thirty minutes per stop, I was right on time, and I headed off to Munsieville Ward 24. If I had been in Cape Town, traveling to the Black township of Khayelitsha or Langa, I would have been preparing for a solid twenty-minute ride, or more with traffic. The Apartheid government kept those townships truly apart from the city center. But key to the whole conflict in Dan Pienaarville of the 1980s was that Munsieville … is right there. And within five minutes, I found myself on Mangope Drive, Mmamogale Drive, and Matlaba Street, arriving at Phatudi Primary School. I was no longer in White South Africa. PHATUDI PRIMARY SCHOOL, MUNSIEVILLE WARD 24, 9:23 A.M. On my way to the voting station, I passed right by the Desmond Tutu Library and a police station that had been burned down by protesters a year earlier. A frustrated group had demanded action on a list of items, including crime, drugs, and human trafficking. One of the bitter ironies of many South African protests held in the name of poor public services is that they frequently involve the destruction of existing ones, contributing to the misery of ordinary citizens. The area had a long history of protest, including in the mid-1950s when Desmond Tutu himself was a teacher at Munsieville High School.7 In 1955, in his early twenties, he decided he could no longer participate in the White government’s administration of inferior “Bantu Education” designed to equip Blacks for a life of servitude and he resigned. (Technically, “Bantu” refers to a group of languages spoken by Black Africans in southern Africa, but that term and “Native” were frequently used by the White government as administrative categories and, in turn, generally rejected as pejorative by Black Africans.) Tutu left teaching for the priesthood, initially as a sub-deacon in Krugersdorp,8 and went on to pursue additional education and opportunities in church councils overseas. Within a few decades, he emerged as one of the world’s most storied liberation activists in his tireless campaigns, not simply against Apartheid but also against sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination. So it was fitting that a library should be built here in his name. Standing in the center of Munsieville, I was now less than two and a half miles from the polling station where I started the morning in Ward 37. However, these were very, very different places. The median household income in Ward 37, where 67 percent of residents were White, was 115,000 rand, and over 20 percent of the households had an annual income of at least 300,000 rand (nationally, just about 8 percent of households were in this bracket). Here in Ward 24, where 99 percent of residents are Black African, median household income was a mere 30,000 rand (about $2,100 US at the time), and just 1 percent of households took in 300,000 or more. Back in Ward 37, about 99 percent of households were built as formal structures and basic service provision (water, toilet, refuse) was over 97 percent. Moreover, 49 percent had a computer, 68 percent had a car, and 71 percent had a washing machine. The situation was very different here: a full 38 percent of households were informal dwellings—shacks or shanties, usually made in large part with corrugated metal. Over 95 percent also enjoyed basic services, albeit of lesser quality. Only 11 percent had a computer, 14 percent a car, and 27 percent a washing machine.9 As I traveled up the hill, I saw a massive taxi depot filled with dozens of the white vans (known as taxis in South Africa) with yellow stripes that bring residents to Krugersdorp, Joburg, and elsewhere. The largely unregulated taxi industry is central to life in South Africa, serving a mostly Black clientele and accounting for approximately 75 percent of all daily transport,10 as neither the Apartheid nor post-Apartheid governments developed successful or integrated mass public transportation systems. On this holiday, the taxis were mostly idle. A few men sat on the passenger floor of a taxi with its door open, their feet hanging over the side. In Munsieville, people live outside. Unlike the subdued atmosphere around Monument and Dan Pienaarville, it was loud with music, and people were laughing. The first person I chatted with was a young woman, maybe in her twenties. When I asked her about her voting experience, she said, “It went well. Took about an hour.” We were now in ANC territory, and 75 percent of the voters here had stayed with the liberation party in the 2016 local elections. It’s also fairly ripe EFF ground, and they managed over 15 percent in those elections, making it unclear what would happen this go-round. “I want to make a change. I don’t want to complain for nothing. I did something about it.” She highlighted the catchall phrase of “services” and called out housing and unemployment as the issues she cared about most. A tall, older but quite sturdy-looking man came through the gates. “I didn’t wait five minutes. Pensioners [senior citizens] get to cut the line,” he explained. “I was born in Munsieville.… Most of us will vote ANC.” I walked over to the ANC tent. “Good turnout?” I asked. “Not yet. But we don’t expect a problem. Some went to work and many will come after 3 p.m.” I was a little surprised to see representatives from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), whose electoral fortunes had waned over the previous quarter century. The organization itself was born out of differences with the ANC regarding how to address the race question. In 1959, ANC leaders had been planning a defiance campaign against the country’s pass laws, but Robert Sobukwe, who rejected many key tenets of ANC philosophy, including “non-racialism,”11 broke away to form this rival organization. In turn, the PAC was behind one of the most important defiance campaigns of all time—the 1960 Sharpeville Protest—during which the peaceful burning of passes was met with a lethal police response. That day, a massacre made martyrs out of those victims and began to turn global opinion against White South Africa. The organization was prominent in Munsieville back in the 1980s and gained some seats in the national Parliament in 1994, but they had not had any representation in Mogale City in recent history, and I had been wondering what had happened to them. One of the three men at the booth said, “We are struggling because of the finances. We have many supporters. We are not buying people to vote. We haven’t changed. We stand for land to Africans today.… At the top of the elections, land is important for survival. For hospitals to build. Land is everything! In the elections of 1994, we focused on land. The other parties did not follow that route. The EFF has been making a big push for land redistribution in recent years, and the ANC has made timid murmurings along these lines.” I asked if the PAC and EFF have similar views on land. “There is a huge difference between the EFF and the PAC,” he said. “On the land issue, the EFF [says] we are only entitled to land taken in the past hundred years. We say, look at the land from 1652 that must be taken.… We believe in Africanism. The ruling party fears us, so we are infiltrated by them.” Land inequality is one of the many remaining sources of wealth inequality, one that remains emotive from decades of forced removals and centuries of land grabs. While a land claims court has settled a handful of cases, the White minority continues to retain the majority of the best land, and the EFF has campaigned hard on this injustice. I had been through this neighborhood several times on past trips, but I was struck again by how different the vibe was on election day compared with White Mogale City. First, the density: the streets are narrower, so many people in so few square meters. The school was noticeably smaller, starker. There was no grass or lawn. I looked at the line into the voting booths, and I noticed that people stood very close to one another, often touching, certainly as compared with the much wider zone of personal space maintained in the White areas. A decent-sized group congregated under the DA tent. Ten years ago, I would never have imagined that this largely White party could have such a presence in a place like Munsieville. But it was clearly building a support base. The sun broke through again and, realizing that I had stayed in this Munsieville ward for longer than my planned half hour, it was time to move on. PRO-PRACTICUM SKOOL, KRUGERSDORP WEST WARD 26, 10:12 A.M. Ward 26 is one of Mogale’s more racially diverse neighborhoods, about 35 percent White and 62 percent Black, according to the 2011 census. I approached the ANC tent outside the Pro-Practicum school, and I introduced myself. The agents quickly referred me to a woman in a different caliber of ANC regalia: a zip-up dress with the party’s green, gold, and black, rather than a T-shirt. She is Peace Mabe, a Member of Parliament. I asked if there were any challenges being made so far, and she could point only to a voter in Magaliesburg, who was turned away on a technicality that might have been an honest misunderstanding of the rules. “We are hoping for the best. We want to win Gauteng.” This was not the “ANC will rule South Africa until the sun doesn’t shine” that I remembered from previous elections. This was a party knowing it might—unlikely though it may be—actually fail to get 50 percent of the votes, particularly in Gauteng. Peace said they were working hard. “Everyone has been out campaigning. We stopped campaigning today to get people out. In other areas, the queues are long.” The line to check in here was certainly longer than at the DA tent. Meanwhile, an EFF car was just now showing up with guys in red plastic hard hats. I spoke with a Black couple in their thirties. The man held a car key in his hand. “We would like to see a few changes in the country and let other parties get a chance. Whoever wins, we need to close the borders. To come, you must have your own money. If that can be processed, it would end crime. People jump over and come to do crime.” As he said this, I could see that his wife cringed a bit, knowing that such talk was not polite. But she did not say anything. The group of young EFF supporters were struggling to get their stand set up, and they were situating themselves pretty far from the entrance. At the Sunday rally, Julius Malema had talked about their disciplined ground game, but it was not evident here. I approached a Black woman who had moved to the area from Soweto in 2002, and I asked how the different race groups got along in this diverse neighborhood. “We only see each other for meetings at school. It goes well. We have different views. You see, we integrated into their space,” she explained with a tone that wavered between empathy and resentment. “For them, integrating us is very difficult. They have to adjust. Since 1994, I think people are beginning to adjust but it’s still very difficult. The majority of the Blacks have voted ANC. Some are loyal to the party. Some would say you can’t be loyal if the leaders are not loyal. Some say the DA is White. Others say they like Mmusi Maimane. We must integrate. We are afraid of one another. We don’t trust one another.” I asked if that lack of trust is also within race groups. “Definitely! Blacks don’t trust one another where our leaders promise but don’t deliver.” Surveys bear out what she said: in one conducted in Mogale City in 2017, only 26 percent said “Most people can be trusted,” while 70 percent said “You need to be very careful.”12 “We focus on faults and downfalls. We build parties on one another’s negativity,” she explained. At 10:55 I got into my car and keyed in the coordinates. Waze, my virtual driving assistant, told me I would have a fifteen-minute trip to my next stop. I had developed a fairly good sense of the geography of Mogale City, traveling around quite a bit and studying maps. But I was not prepared for the fact that within about a minute, I would pass by the entrance to Mintails gold mining. Because the industry had been in such decline in recent decades, apart from the large heaps of mining dumps visible from many vantage points around Mogale City, it can be easy to lose sight of how important mining was to the development of this town and region, and to South Africa more generally. Mintails is now better known as a major culprit of local environmental damage than as a productive contributor to the economy. And as I passed by, I saw a set of old hostels—the often squalid residence halls established for mine workers—in front of which today were rows of men and beer bottles. The hostels looked out onto metal shacks, outdoor plastic toilets, and burning fires. The mostly toxic mining excavations were everywhere, and certainly not where people ought to be living. Many stayed here nonetheless. I took the R28—Main Reef Road—to Paardekraal Drive, and then made a right, away from Krugersdorp, toward Azaadville. It began to rain, lightly, and my heart sank a bit as people are less likely to vote in inclement weather. Rainy election days are bad for democracy. AZAADVILLE COMMUNITY HALL, AZAADVILLE WARD 3, 11:15 A.M. I entered the gate of Azaadville Ward 3, on Taj Mahal Street, one of the few communities that actually maintains an active security gate. It was still drizzling, I needed a caffeine jolt, and my gas tank was getting low, so I pulled up to the Engen petrol station on my right and asked for 200 rand worth of 93. Another guy came up to me asking if I wanted him to check the oil and to wash the car, and I said, no, it’s a rental. Then he pointed to the bird shit all over my car, and he looked at me and explained in so many words that I really can’t have that. I am not known for keeping my own car clean, let alone a rental, but people really take good care of their cars here, and I was apparently an embarrassment. As I went in to get a Diet Coke, he washed the windshield but left the rest of the cleaning for me. Fair enough. I paid for the fuel, tipped him, and drove across the street to the Azaadville community hall. Once again, the cultural terrain changed. Of course, cities the world over have lots of ethnic enclaves. Chinatowns, Little Italys, and Brazilian districts in the United States always provide that sense of arriving somewhere else. The modern remnant of the Apartheid legacy is far more extreme, the result of deliberate machinations to keep groups apart, and Azaadville is not-so-little India. Hanging around the front of the center were several older men, who looked to be of South Asian descent. Families—mostly women with children—entered and exited the center. Almost all were wearing Muslim head coverings. Although South Africa’s Indian community has always been concentrated around Durban, on the east coast of the country, Indians came to represent a small but prominent minority in greater Krugersdorp and remain largely in Azaadville. They came to the town as it was forming in the 1880s and settled geographically between Whites and Blacks.13 This position was forced upon them in a manner that was broadly reflective of the British Empire’s perspective on racial hierarchy and subsequently inherited by South Africa’s White governments. South Africa’s other important “intermediate” racial group—the Coloureds—never comprised a large share of the local population around Krugersdorp or anywhere on the West Rand. Though commonly described as Mogale’s “Indian township,” Azaadville itself is not homogeneous, and certainly not in economic terms. A few months earlier I had visited a much wealthier neighborhood, in which some single-family houses even had small pools. This voting station was surrounded by nondescript blocks of flats or apartments, low-end stores, and a petrol station. For every eight South Asians there were about two Black Africans and no Whites. People hung out around the parking lot of the community center, others coming in and out to vote. ANC, DA, and EFF representatives positioned themselves outside as their counterparts had done elsewhere. The ANC and DA groups were not too receptive to my questions. I spoke some Xhosa with the ANC folks and that lightened the mood, especially when they corrected my broken salutation. I had forgotten that “Thanks very much” is “Enkosi kakhulu” (pronounced “loo” at the end) not “kakhuhle” (with a “lay” at the end). The two EFF reps here were happy to talk. “It’s hard to knock on doors in this area,” they explained. “People live either in closed buildings or behind gated houses,” so the ground game is well-nigh impossible. In front of the community center, a reigning elder seemed to be holding court—a tall man with a curly gray beard and no mustache, sporting sunglasses and a Liverpool soccer club scarf. He arrived here nineteen years ago from Johannesburg near Emirates stadium, still known by its original name, Ellis Park. I introduced myself and asked my standard opening line: “How did the voting go?” “Veeery smooth,” he seemed delighted to report. “Only thing … the IEC guy, I had to teach him a thing or two. He didn’t know the alphabet.” He took out a small slip of paper that was generated as part of the process, and he showed me how it was necessary to match the slip against the individual’s identity card to gain admission. Apparently, the IEC official seemed to be struggling with this. “Now he’s on it.” “I have voted in all the past elections from 1994. Every four years14 it’s something different. What we’ve come through. State capture and corruption. We must make an informed decision about our future. I am a grandfather and we need a better future for all the races. Education, homes, pensions. Everyone should have equal opportunity to prosper.” I didn’t see lines to get into the community center to vote, and I asked him about turnout. “From what I can see, over 90 percent vote. Azaadville is a small community, most people come in the morning. Then afternoon prayer. Oh look, over there, these are the pioneers of Azaadville.” He pointed to some much older men who were slowly descending the steps into the community center. “On our WhatsApp group, one message that came through is that during special voting, some people came with pencils and the ballots weren’t stamped.” I found it amazing that this one story had clearly reached so many South African voters so quickly. “So I came with my own pen. So people are sharing information to make sure to use a pen and verify that the ballot is stamped on the back. We’ve come now twenty-five years, a quarter century. Compared with the first time, the queues were longer then.” A shorter man, also Indian but without a head covering, introduced himself as Farouk. He is an ANC “PR councillor,” which meant he was placed on a party list, not directly elected in a ward constituency, the two options in South Africa’s mixed system of local government. Without mentioning Jacob Zuma’s name, he addressed the cross that ANC ground forces must bear: “The problem is that when an individual does wrong, they associate it with the party. We cling onto the wrong. But there is a lot of good to be appreciated. There is a lot of potential in this country. I am happy we’ve come a long way in 107 years. The current president has a massive job. The ANC has large support, but some swung from the ANC.” I asked about the campaign, and he echoed some of the EFF concerns: “In Azaadville, we don’t go door-to-door—we knock and drop pamphlets.” The man with the Liverpool scarf, Cllr Farouk, and I chatted more about the local concerns, and the standard mantra of “service delivery” came up—a broad label frequently used to decry frustrations with what is not provided usually in the form of basic services but sometimes can mean almost anything at all. I was surprised that Cllr Farouk didn’t take the easy path of pandering to the primacy of his own neighborhood’s concerns: “In Azaadville, some people want speed bumps. In Magaliesburg, some people are suffering without water. What’s more important? In Azaadville, people complain, complain and they have everything.” He looked to the others to nod, but none were forthcoming. “Township people have nothing and they smile.” Of course, many people in the townships are not smiling, but I didn’t disagree with his sentiments and much of my own research supports what he said. Those who have done best under post-Apartheid government have in recent years been the least likely to vote for the ANC.15 Once again, I recognized that in couples, the men were more likely to speak. Several women did come to vote alone or in pairs, and I looked to approach a few of them, but they averted my gaze. I was again very conscious of the male bias in my unsystematic sample. When social scientists conduct systematic surveys, we try to match up the race and gender of interviewers, but I was traveling alone on this day and was reminded of this effect. RIETVALLEI EXTENSION 2 COMMUNITY HALL, RIETVALLEI WARD 3, 12:25 P.M. I got back into my car at 12:05 p.m., and a few raindrops again dotted my windshield. The radio announcers reminded listeners of the duty to vote. “Remember: If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” Maybe that’s why everyone’s saying it, I thought to myself. I headed back out on Taj Mahal Street. I didn’t have time to stop at another voting station in Ward 3, which was mostly Azaadville, but I had noticed on the map that an area just south of Azaadville, Rietvallei, was also in the ward, and decided I would check it out. After pulling over to write down some of my thoughts for about twenty minutes, hoping the pouring rain would stop—which it did—I drove in for a look. It was bleak: an extremely depressing, barren area filled with cinder-block structures and shacks, some gutted and burned out. In the rain, the tall lampposts that tower way above the neighborhood looked like they were spitting fire. There’s very little commerce, except for a few small spaza (informal, home-based convenience) shops. People walked in the middle of the streets, and I drove slowly. The ANC tent there seemed well staffed, as did the EFF tent. It was easy to imagine that this was where the EFF would fare well: if one wanted a narrative of deprivation and failure to deliver a better life, this little pocket would provide just that. THEMBILE PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 10, 1:30 P.M. My next stop was Kagiso, the much larger of Mogale’s two Black townships, which spans several wards. I headed to Ward 10, in the middle. Seventy percent of voters went for the ANC in 2016, but the EFF was also strong with more than 17 percent of the vote. I plotted a course to Thembile Primary School, which is located right next to the Kagiso Methodist Church, where I had visited a couple of times. I had met the pastor there and interviewed a few congregants. I had been struck then, as I was on this day, by the quality of the housing stock, the nice streets, the friendly vibe of the neighborhood. As it had been in Munsieville, election day was a party. The political tents were filled with people, the music was again on full volume, and some people were literally dancing in the street in front of the entrance to the school. I chatted briefly with a man who told me that all the voting had been fine. A man who helped a lady into a van subsequently approached me and asked if I was a reporter. It was a reasonable assumption considering the fact that I was the only White guy for miles and carrying a clipboard. I explained my intentions and he introduced me to the local ward councillor who was on site that day: Councillor Maxwell Kuswayo, a member of the mayoral committee and, according to him, a ward councillor for nineteen years. I knew from my research that there is very high turnover among councillors, so this was indeed an impressive political feat. FIGURE 2.2. ANC party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. I could see that Kuswayo was going to stand here, perfectly legally, but definitely in the path of pretty much anyone who wanted to vote at this station. I asked if he minded if I talked to people coming out of the voting booth, and he thought for a bit and said ok, but as I approached someone to talk, he stayed close by. After this first brief interview, I chatted with him some more. I asked about the low registration among young voters. He boasted that about 80 percent of young people had been registered in the area. “We listen to them all. These kids, their complaint is unemployment. Here it is very high.” Of the EFF, he says, “You can’t promise everything here. How will you pay for it? South Africa is the only country where you can get a free house. We are becoming a welfare state. There are too many social grants. We have seventeen million pensioners.” Kuswayo was born here in 1960. He argued that if you look at this township and consider what it was like back then, you couldn’t imagine the changes. He was an MMC (Member of the Mayoral Committee) for electricity, water, and sanitation. He was the service delivery guy—the very issues so many people are complaining about—and I put it to him that his portfolio is the source of complaint. In response, he highlighted that basic shares of water and electricity were free to the poor. He seemed not ready to discuss some of the more serious concerns—not here, not on election day with this American guy asking questions. Soon enough, it was time for me to go, and I did. TSHOLOTSEGA PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 15, 2:45 P.M. I stopped at several other voting stations in Kagiso, including in Ward 15, at the Tsholotsega Primary School. Ward 15 is a politically interesting area because it houses a strong base of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters, enough to have made it possible to attain a single seat on the Mogale City council in 2016. As I mentioned, the IFP is largely a Zulu-based party, run out of KwaZulu-Natal Province. It is the one major Black party strongly associated with a particular ethnic group; and it was badly hurt when Jacob Zuma, a Zulu himself, headed up the ANC, drawing away the votes of other Zulus from the IFP. A few Zulu speakers are interspersed throughout the municipality, but only in Ward 15 do they constitute a sizable minority (of 32 percent), delivering 15 percent of the total vote share in that ward in the prior local election. The EFF has also been strong here with 17 percent. And the ANC’s position is most precarious for an all-Black area, with less than 59 percent of the vote in the last election. FIGURE 2.3. DA party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The fancy schools of central Krugersdorp were distant memories from the morning; this school had the charm of a passport office, and there was no music or partying outside. This voting station was at the crossroads of a few different communities, also on the edge of a more industrial area. I parked along the sidewalk and walked down to the first booth, the bright red one. “The EFF is very strong in this area because people are tired of the ANC. The ANC doesn’t know how to do groundwork. Even old people want to be members. We’ve got five signups,” the EFF desk rep said proudly showing me the forms. “We have been going door-to-door, every day. Even today. I was very active in the ANC, but I switched at the time they put Zuma in as president.” FIGURE 2.4. EFF party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. As we were talking, a woman with a DA T-shirt came to chat. I smiled and asked, “So you guys get along ok?” “Yah, the DA and EFF are friendly. We don’t want to be near the green and yellow,” she said, referring to the ANC colors. I asked if that extends into her personal life. She nodded. “We don’t have friends who are ANC.” I popped over to the DA tent, where two women and one man were presiding. “We hope all is going well. Seems like it’s a free and fair election. The process is going smooth,” one of the women explained. The man, about my age, wanted to talk and pulled me aside to share his story. “I used to be ANC, three years ago. But I am not happy with how the government was run. There is no system of accountability. Incompetency. Dysfunctional. I studied the manifestoes and thought the DA was for me.” He was the first person I met who complained that there should not be a paper ballot; he feared that some votes would be stolen and believed they should switch to electronic voting. The ANC folks were confident that they would do well in Ward 15. “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a woman, possibly in her fifties, smiled as she repeated the tagline under which Cyril’s name is plastered all over the country. I asked her what she thought were the biggest issues in the ward. “The hostel dwellers. They break our windows, stone our cars.” She pointed down the way to the hostels. “They are vicious people. Some are IFP. Involved in mining. But our resources are almost depleted. So just dumps.” I saw no visible manifestation of the IFP in the area, but they may have been at another polling station within the ward. It was time to leave Kagiso and head north. NOORDHEUWEL COUNTRY CLUB, NOORDHEUWEL WARD 22, 3:30 P.M. The sun came out again around 3:30 p.m., when I arrived at Noordheuwel Country Club, the site of a polling station near where I had started the morning. Looking around, it was clear that I was back in White South Africa. At the entrance, I saw Tjaart Steenkamp, one of Mogale City’s two FF+ councillors. I had interviewed him several months earlier and now he was standing in front of his party’s flag, posted to the side of a walkway. Ward 22 had been solidly DA, close to 90 percent in the last election, but this kind of White, high-income, largely Afrikaans-speaking (over 60 percent) area was fertile ground for the FF+, as many of the typical, White DA supporters were not so sure about a party run by Mmusi Maimane. As I headed down to the voting booth, I could see tennis courts off to the right and a lawn bowling pitch, perfectly manicured, off to my left. I introduced myself to a tall young man with a flop of brown hair, glasses, and a white button-down shirt. He said he didn’t know whom he was going to vote for until he got into the voting booth. The issues? “It’s work … jobs … quotas in sports.” That last one felt out of the blue, and I guessed there must be a back story. There was: he was a cricketer—a sport long dominated by Whites—and frustrated that he had not been initially admitted to university because, according to him, of his color. He shared that he would soon start at the University of South Africa, UNISA. “The biggest thing is my sport. I love it. I just wish we could look past race, gender, identity.” A White man’s pushback against gender- and race-based affirmative action would be familiar in many circles of the United States. I chatted with Tjaart and when I asked how it was going, he smiled. “We’re doing very well. We’ll be strongest in the West Rand.” A key platform for the FF+ is opposition to affirmative action, and the appeal of that message goes beyond Afrikaners to many English-speaking Whites, and even Coloureds and Indians, who say they are overlooked for jobs, promotions, and other opportunities in favor of less-qualified Black Africans. LAST STOPS: RIETFONTEIN SUPERMARKET, RIETFONTEIN, MULDERSDRIFT WARD 23, 4:01 P.M. IMAGES OF AFRICA, CRADLE OF HUMANKIND, WARD 39, 4:40 P.M. After 4 p.m., I made two more stops. The first one was the Rietfontein supermarket in Ward 23 up in Muldersdrift, a rural part of the municipality where I first went on voter registration day; the second stop was at the polling station in Ward 39 located next to a taxidermist, where it is dead quiet. Most of the voters who would cast a ballot in this election had already come and gone. And as the light was getting low, with winter setting in, I decided that it was time to call it a day. As I drove back to my guesthouse on the largely empty road, I continued a conversation in my head that had started as I decided to write this book and persists with me now: Had South Africa’s democratic project been a success? So many of the problems I had learned about for decades were still unresolved, and so many people had grown cynical. But others were proud of what had been accomplished. Quite clearly, my answer could not be a simple “yes” or “no.” But I would aspire to sum up what I could learn with something more useful than “it’s complicated.”",

I wanted to see this for myself and to hear what was on the minds of the very diverse citizens at the precise time that they were finally being forced to make this important decision. Using the geo-coordinates of the polling stations posted online by the electoral commission (IEC), I planned a tour of Mogale City. I set out to trace the history of the development of the area, while trying to minimize driving distance between stops. In preparation, I charged two mobile phones, one with an American SIM card, one with a local SIM. These devices would guide me throughout the day, and I needed some redundancy in case one failed or got poor service, eventualities I had previously experienced. I also brought a notebook that fit in my back pocket and a few pens. A friend and colleague who is an expert on election observation advised me to wear neutral colors, to carry a clipboard, and to review an election observation handbook.1 During the previous few days, the weather had been absolutely stunning: warm, with clear skies—winter in Gauteng is nothing like its Boston counterpart. On this morning, however, it was distinctively chilly and overcast. Adding to my sense of apprehension, as I departed from my guesthouse at about 6:45 a.m., I saw that several birds had decided to mark this special day by crapping all over my white rental car. FIGURE 2.1. My election day route, Mogale City, May 8, 2019. MONUMENT PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:00 A.M. My first stop was Monument Primary School. Although I had hoped to get there a bit before the election station was set to open, I arrived at exactly 7 a.m. Monument refers to the Paardekraal Monument, just half a mile away, where almost 139 years earlier Paul Kruger and approximately 6,000 fellow Afrikaners built a cairn—a large statue of stones—to mark their unity and common cause in resisting British rule.2 Always a group to mix religion and politics, they declared it a symbol of their covenant with God, recalling unlikely past victories against their foes.3 Monument Primary School sits just a block away from Voortrekker Road—yet another nod to the Afrikaner legacy. In Ward 37, just shy of 50 percent of households speak Afrikaans at home. It had grown to be a solid DA constituency, and in the 2016 local election, that party raked in over 83 percent of the vote here. In this well-manicured neighborhood, large but hardly ostentatious homes are mostly visible from the street. Outside the gates of the school, the DA set up what looked like a small office, with a canopy and a table. I didn’t see any other parties. Either they were conceding this ward, or—more likely—they just had not gotten their acts together to arrive before voting began. Election day is a national holiday in South Africa—a simple tribute to its importance that some have advocated for in the United States.4 But that doesn’t mean everyone had the day off from work, and in any case, many people like to vote early. About sixty people were standing in line outside when I arrived. Apart from one woman, everyone I saw was White; there was a fairly good mix of young and old, and many people came with their kids. A few pulled up in high-end “bakkies,” white, tricked-out pickup trucks, with stainless steel crossbars in the front. One DA sign said, “Stop the ANC and EFF.” In other words, stop the two Black parties. There were no ANC signs around here. In the last election, the ruling party barely eked out 7 percent of the vote in this ward, even though almost 30 percent of the population was Black. On the one hand, because today’s elections were for the provincial and national legislatures, it was not as if a vote in one part of the municipality would have a greater impact than anywhere else in the province. On the other hand, local party officials would be held accountable for each polling station, and the returns in this election would serve as a benchmark for local contests scheduled for two years in the future. The respective parties would make decisions about which local officials could stand in those elections with this information in mind. I found a spot that was outside the IEC’s taped-off boundaries but close enough that I could greet exiting voters. At 7:15, just fifteen minutes after the school opened to voters, I approached a White woman, probably in her thirties, who spoke quickly with a strong Afrikaans accent. “Aagh, they weren’t quite ready for us,” she told me. “The left hand doesn’t know where is the right hand. But it was not too much of a holdup.” She was skeptical that the vote would be totally free: “I think they will try to put in votes,” she said, which I took to mean that the ANC would stuff ballot boxes with fraudulent ballots. Of her friends and family she said, “Most will vote. Some will say it’s not worth it. But we need to try.” When I asked about possible problems so far, she said she was not aware of any vote buying or intimidation. Just before 7:20, I saw that a few ANC party representatives had arrived to set up shop near where the DA decamped. The major parties set up these small booths outside the election stations to provide a last bit of party marketing, to stand by to monitor for any funny business, and to allow party supporters to come by to check in. The actual vote is secret, but this system allows the parties to keep track of who actually shows up on election day. Next, I spoke with a forty-something White man who described the process as very efficient and recounted that he had voted in every previous election. “I think you need a strong opposition … and I think the fear factor of the EFF is what’s causing a lot of people to vote.” A young woman, probably in her early twenties, came out with her father, and when I asked her about her decision to come to vote, she said, “It’s the right thing to do.” As I drove away I saw well-ordered rubbish bins set out at the end of driveways, in greater order than I was accustomed to in my Brookline, Massachusetts, neighborhood on collection day. Basic service delivery was just about 100 percent in Ward 37. But I did notice a few guys picking through the trash bins. The very poor would try to survive on the salable, salvageable items from the detritus of the well-to-do. WEST RAND PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:40 A.M. My next stop was a voting station on the other side of Coronation Park. It was established in 1902 to commemorate Edward VII’s coronation as British king in 1901 and just following the British defeat of the Boers in the 1899–1902 war, also known as the Boer War. The park may have been built over a concentration camp run by the British, largely to contain their Afrikaner enemies, and remains as yet one more remembrance of the bitter tensions that once stood between these two White groups.5 While bloody and costly, the peace for that war paved the way for the formation of the Union of South Africa, which integrated two Boer-run republics and two British colonies. The IEC station here was the second of three in Ward 37 and was set up at the West Rand School, which had a long driveway and well-manicured grounds. As I entered, I cynically assumed it was a place filled with White, square-chinned rugby players. I later learned that it is a multiracial primary school for physically disabled children, many of whom have cerebral palsy, and it was heartening to recognize that the most vulnerable were enjoying access to what appeared to be a beautiful facility. The voters were again mostly White, a mix of old and young. Some likely worked desk jobs; others wore the fluorescent vests and pants that help to protect those working on the street as cleaners, parking attendants, and road pavers. “They already say that the voting papers [ballots] were not stamped,” a White woman, perhaps in her early sixties, said in response to my question about the integrity of the voting process. “They say we must write in a pen.” Apparently, some votes cast somewhere in the country were in pencil and had been changed. The stamps are used on election day by election workers to mark the validity of the ballots. Reports of any malfeasance circulate instantaneously on social media. I asked, why vote? “Actually, it’s a privilege to be part of the process. I have a nineteen-year-old son who did not register but he regrets it. I hope they [young people] have a say. It’s exciting for me to see people get involved. To do something about it.” I saw just one Black African woman, wearing a faded pink cotton apron that peered out underneath her jacket. She was originally from Soweto but had lived in this area for a long time. I made it a point not to ask anyone about their vote choices, but she quickly informed me, proudly, “I am ANC … I have voted in all of the elections.” I saw it was 8 a.m. on my watch, the sun was coming out, and I headed to my car. On my drive, I passed a tall statue of Paul Kruger, the last Afrikaner president of the Afrikaner Republic that predated the Union of South Africa. RAND EN DAL KLINIESKOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:05 A.M. At about 8:05 a.m., I arrived at the first of my two stops in Ward 17, the Rand en Dal Klinieskool. This is in Dan Pienaarville, the site of significant political tension in the 1980s when its White residents clamored for Black residents of nearby Munsieville to be moved because they were, simply, too close for comfort. Dan Pienaarville remains a largely White area, but compared with my first stops, the neighborhood homes were smaller, the grass was less tightly manicured, and there were more vacant, scruffy lots. Nonetheless, most voters arrived in their own cars, reflecting a certain level of wealth or employment status that most South Africans do not enjoy. For the first time that day, I saw a large ANC Mogale City tent. The DA was also there, as was the FF+. The skies turned gray again. “One hundred percent. Nice and smooth,” a forty-something White man with a goatee explained to me as he stood next to his wife. “This was a bit better, because last time they started late. We need to vote for the opposition to try to end the corruption. It’s a beautiful country, but we must set the politics right.” A Black man in his thirties also described the process as smooth. He had moved to the area only six months earlier. “I think it was free and fair, but I would prefer a system like in the United States, where you have the opportunity to vote directly for the president.” I didn’t ask his party, but I did ask what influenced his vote choice. “It’s not easy. You look at the past and, well, job creation is critical. Our economy is moving at a slow pace. We need to get that right.” Any irregularities? “I just saw on TV and social media an issue with some ballot papers,” he said, referring to the same incident that the woman had referenced earlier in the day. “But besides that, nothing.” As I looked around, I was struck by the fact that many people brought their youngish children. I was reminded of the idiosyncrasies of election day: people with children are likely to vote at different times than those without. On a day like today, with changing and unseasonably cold and wet weather, some may not bother at all. At 8:30 a.m., I also felt how chilly it had become, and the South Africans will tell you how much they don’t like the cold. People were still streaming in. Many couples walked to the voting station holding hands. An older White man told me, “No problems. I’ve voted and lived here all my life.” Then he corrected himself: “I came from Namibia in 1978.” At that time, Namibia was controlled by South Africa, essentially governed under Apartheid policies as an additional province and called Southwest Africa. He then uttered a mantra that I would hear throughout the rest of the day: “If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” I supposed that there is a great desire to complain, and if you feel that you will be denied this opportunity if you don’t vote, it’s a small price to pay. He described the system as free and fair. “Yah, I think so. But there are too many parties involved.” Indeed, forty-eight parties had registered for the national election. I asked about people not voting. “In my family, everyone wants to vote. My children, my wife. First, we must try to get rid of the ANC. The next stronger party must be given a chance.” He saw no intimidation or vote buying. He told me that his wife, who is in her sixties and frailer, was able to vote earlier as they let older people vote first. I approached the DA tent and asked the attending representative how the day was going. “It’s cold. That will affect the vote.” Any irregularities? “I haven’t seen anything. But it’s still early.” I went to the ANC tent, where just one man was holding down the fort. I asked if they had many supporters in the area. He didn’t directly respond to my question, but the answer was clear: “Well, it’s mostly White people who live around here.” At 8:48 a.m., I got back into my now thoroughly bird-crap-stained rental car to visit one more voting station in the informally constituted border area between Dan Pienaarville and Munsieville. To do so, I crossed the road that was built in the 1980s expressly to keep these White and Black communities apart.6 It was still working. TOWN VIEW HIGH SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:50 A.M. At Town View High School, I met a thirty-something Black woman who told me, “I want a better life. I need a house. I need work.” Perhaps wishfully, she predicted a coalition would unseat the ANC: “I think the DA and the EFF will win.” At 9:18 a.m., according to my rough plan of allocating thirty minutes per stop, I was right on time, and I headed off to Munsieville Ward 24. If I had been in Cape Town, traveling to the Black township of Khayelitsha or Langa, I would have been preparing for a solid twenty-minute ride, or more with traffic. The Apartheid government kept those townships truly apart from the city center. But key to the whole conflict in Dan Pienaarville of the 1980s was that Munsieville … is right there. And within five minutes, I found myself on Mangope Drive, Mmamogale Drive, and Matlaba Street, arriving at Phatudi Primary School. I was no longer in White South Africa. PHATUDI PRIMARY SCHOOL, MUNSIEVILLE WARD 24, 9:23 A.M. On my way to the voting station, I passed right by the Desmond Tutu Library and a police station that had been burned down by protesters a year earlier. A frustrated group had demanded action on a list of items, including crime, drugs, and human trafficking. One of the bitter ironies of many South African protests held in the name of poor public services is that they frequently involve the destruction of existing ones, contributing to the misery of ordinary citizens. The area had a long history of protest, including in the mid-1950s when Desmond Tutu himself was a teacher at Munsieville High School.7 In 1955, in his early twenties, he decided he could no longer participate in the White government’s administration of inferior “Bantu Education” designed to equip Blacks for a life of servitude and he resigned. (Technically, “Bantu” refers to a group of languages spoken by Black Africans in southern Africa, but that term and “Native” were frequently used by the White government as administrative categories and, in turn, generally rejected as pejorative by Black Africans.) Tutu left teaching for the priesthood, initially as a sub-deacon in Krugersdorp,8 and went on to pursue additional education and opportunities in church councils overseas. Within a few decades, he emerged as one of the world’s most storied liberation activists in his tireless campaigns, not simply against Apartheid but also against sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination. So it was fitting that a library should be built here in his name. Standing in the center of Munsieville, I was now less than two and a half miles from the polling station where I started the morning in Ward 37. However, these were very, very different places. The median household income in Ward 37, where 67 percent of residents were White, was 115,000 rand, and over 20 percent of the households had an annual income of at least 300,000 rand (nationally, just about 8 percent of households were in this bracket). Here in Ward 24, where 99 percent of residents are Black African, median household income was a mere 30,000 rand (about $2,100 US at the time), and just 1 percent of households took in 300,000 or more. Back in Ward 37, about 99 percent of households were built as formal structures and basic service provision (water, toilet, refuse) was over 97 percent. Moreover, 49 percent had a computer, 68 percent had a car, and 71 percent had a washing machine. The situation was very different here: a full 38 percent of households were informal dwellings—shacks or shanties, usually made in large part with corrugated metal. Over 95 percent also enjoyed basic services, albeit of lesser quality. Only 11 percent had a computer, 14 percent a car, and 27 percent a washing machine.9 As I traveled up the hill, I saw a massive taxi depot filled with dozens of the white vans (known as taxis in South Africa) with yellow stripes that bring residents to Krugersdorp, Joburg, and elsewhere. The largely unregulated taxi industry is central to life in South Africa, serving a mostly Black clientele and accounting for approximately 75 percent of all daily transport,10 as neither the Apartheid nor post-Apartheid governments developed successful or integrated mass public transportation systems. On this holiday, the taxis were mostly idle. A few men sat on the passenger floor of a taxi with its door open, their feet hanging over the side. In Munsieville, people live outside. Unlike the subdued atmosphere around Monument and Dan Pienaarville, it was loud with music, and people were laughing. The first person I chatted with was a young woman, maybe in her twenties. When I asked her about her voting experience, she said, “It went well. Took about an hour.” We were now in ANC territory, and 75 percent of the voters here had stayed with the liberation party in the 2016 local elections. It’s also fairly ripe EFF ground, and they managed over 15 percent in those elections, making it unclear what would happen this go-round. “I want to make a change. I don’t want to complain for nothing. I did something about it.” She highlighted the catchall phrase of “services” and called out housing and unemployment as the issues she cared about most. A tall, older but quite sturdy-looking man came through the gates. “I didn’t wait five minutes. Pensioners [senior citizens] get to cut the line,” he explained. “I was born in Munsieville.… Most of us will vote ANC.” I walked over to the ANC tent. “Good turnout?” I asked. “Not yet. But we don’t expect a problem. Some went to work and many will come after 3 p.m.” I was a little surprised to see representatives from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), whose electoral fortunes had waned over the previous quarter century. The organization itself was born out of differences with the ANC regarding how to address the race question. In 1959, ANC leaders had been planning a defiance campaign against the country’s pass laws, but Robert Sobukwe, who rejected many key tenets of ANC philosophy, including “non-racialism,”11 broke away to form this rival organization. In turn, the PAC was behind one of the most important defiance campaigns of all time—the 1960 Sharpeville Protest—during which the peaceful burning of passes was met with a lethal police response. That day, a massacre made martyrs out of those victims and began to turn global opinion against White South Africa. The organization was prominent in Munsieville back in the 1980s and gained some seats in the national Parliament in 1994, but they had not had any representation in Mogale City in recent history, and I had been wondering what had happened to them. One of the three men at the booth said, “We are struggling because of the finances. We have many supporters. We are not buying people to vote. We haven’t changed. We stand for land to Africans today.… At the top of the elections, land is important for survival. For hospitals to build. Land is everything! In the elections of 1994, we focused on land. The other parties did not follow that route. The EFF has been making a big push for land redistribution in recent years, and the ANC has made timid murmurings along these lines.” I asked if the PAC and EFF have similar views on land. “There is a huge difference between the EFF and the PAC,” he said. “On the land issue, the EFF [says] we are only entitled to land taken in the past hundred years. We say, look at the land from 1652 that must be taken.… We believe in Africanism. The ruling party fears us, so we are infiltrated by them.” Land inequality is one of the many remaining sources of wealth inequality, one that remains emotive from decades of forced removals and centuries of land grabs. While a land claims court has settled a handful of cases, the White minority continues to retain the majority of the best land, and the EFF has campaigned hard on this injustice. I had been through this neighborhood several times on past trips, but I was struck again by how different the vibe was on election day compared with White Mogale City. First, the density: the streets are narrower, so many people in so few square meters. The school was noticeably smaller, starker. There was no grass or lawn. I looked at the line into the voting booths, and I noticed that people stood very close to one another, often touching, certainly as compared with the much wider zone of personal space maintained in the White areas. A decent-sized group congregated under the DA tent. Ten years ago, I would never have imagined that this largely White party could have such a presence in a place like Munsieville. But it was clearly building a support base. The sun broke through again and, realizing that I had stayed in this Munsieville ward for longer than my planned half hour, it was time to move on. PRO-PRACTICUM SKOOL, KRUGERSDORP WEST WARD 26, 10:12 A.M. Ward 26 is one of Mogale’s more racially diverse neighborhoods, about 35 percent White and 62 percent Black, according to the 2011 census. I approached the ANC tent outside the Pro-Practicum school, and I introduced myself. The agents quickly referred me to a woman in a different caliber of ANC regalia: a zip-up dress with the party’s green, gold, and black, rather than a T-shirt. She is Peace Mabe, a Member of Parliament. I asked if there were any challenges being made so far, and she could point only to a voter in Magaliesburg, who was turned away on a technicality that might have been an honest misunderstanding of the rules. “We are hoping for the best. We want to win Gauteng.” This was not the “ANC will rule South Africa until the sun doesn’t shine” that I remembered from previous elections. This was a party knowing it might—unlikely though it may be—actually fail to get 50 percent of the votes, particularly in Gauteng. Peace said they were working hard. “Everyone has been out campaigning. We stopped campaigning today to get people out. In other areas, the queues are long.” The line to check in here was certainly longer than at the DA tent. Meanwhile, an EFF car was just now showing up with guys in red plastic hard hats. I spoke with a Black couple in their thirties. The man held a car key in his hand. “We would like to see a few changes in the country and let other parties get a chance. Whoever wins, we need to close the borders. To come, you must have your own money. If that can be processed, it would end crime. People jump over and come to do crime.” As he said this, I could see that his wife cringed a bit, knowing that such talk was not polite. But she did not say anything. The group of young EFF supporters were struggling to get their stand set up, and they were situating themselves pretty far from the entrance. At the Sunday rally, Julius Malema had talked about their disciplined ground game, but it was not evident here. I approached a Black woman who had moved to the area from Soweto in 2002, and I asked how the different race groups got along in this diverse neighborhood. “We only see each other for meetings at school. It goes well. We have different views. You see, we integrated into their space,” she explained with a tone that wavered between empathy and resentment. “For them, integrating us is very difficult. They have to adjust. Since 1994, I think people are beginning to adjust but it’s still very difficult. The majority of the Blacks have voted ANC. Some are loyal to the party. Some would say you can’t be loyal if the leaders are not loyal. Some say the DA is White. Others say they like Mmusi Maimane. We must integrate. We are afraid of one another. We don’t trust one another.” I asked if that lack of trust is also within race groups. “Definitely! Blacks don’t trust one another where our leaders promise but don’t deliver.” Surveys bear out what she said: in one conducted in Mogale City in 2017, only 26 percent said “Most people can be trusted,” while 70 percent said “You need to be very careful.”12 “We focus on faults and downfalls. We build parties on one another’s negativity,” she explained. At 10:55 I got into my car and keyed in the coordinates. Waze, my virtual driving assistant, told me I would have a fifteen-minute trip to my next stop. I had developed a fairly good sense of the geography of Mogale City, traveling around quite a bit and studying maps. But I was not prepared for the fact that within about a minute, I would pass by the entrance to Mintails gold mining. Because the industry had been in such decline in recent decades, apart from the large heaps of mining dumps visible from many vantage points around Mogale City, it can be easy to lose sight of how important mining was to the development of this town and region, and to South Africa more generally. Mintails is now better known as a major culprit of local environmental damage than as a productive contributor to the economy. And as I passed by, I saw a set of old hostels—the often squalid residence halls established for mine workers—in front of which today were rows of men and beer bottles. The hostels looked out onto metal shacks, outdoor plastic toilets, and burning fires. The mostly toxic mining excavations were everywhere, and certainly not where people ought to be living. Many stayed here nonetheless. I took the R28—Main Reef Road—to Paardekraal Drive, and then made a right, away from Krugersdorp, toward Azaadville. It began to rain, lightly, and my heart sank a bit as people are less likely to vote in inclement weather. Rainy election days are bad for democracy. AZAADVILLE COMMUNITY HALL, AZAADVILLE WARD 3, 11:15 A.M. I entered the gate of Azaadville Ward 3, on Taj Mahal Street, one of the few communities that actually maintains an active security gate. It was still drizzling, I needed a caffeine jolt, and my gas tank was getting low, so I pulled up to the Engen petrol station on my right and asked for 200 rand worth of 93. Another guy came up to me asking if I wanted him to check the oil and to wash the car, and I said, no, it’s a rental. Then he pointed to the bird shit all over my car, and he looked at me and explained in so many words that I really can’t have that. I am not known for keeping my own car clean, let alone a rental, but people really take good care of their cars here, and I was apparently an embarrassment. As I went in to get a Diet Coke, he washed the windshield but left the rest of the cleaning for me. Fair enough. I paid for the fuel, tipped him, and drove across the street to the Azaadville community hall. Once again, the cultural terrain changed. Of course, cities the world over have lots of ethnic enclaves. Chinatowns, Little Italys, and Brazilian districts in the United States always provide that sense of arriving somewhere else. The modern remnant of the Apartheid legacy is far more extreme, the result of deliberate machinations to keep groups apart, and Azaadville is not-so-little India. Hanging around the front of the center were several older men, who looked to be of South Asian descent. Families—mostly women with children—entered and exited the center. Almost all were wearing Muslim head coverings. Although South Africa’s Indian community has always been concentrated around Durban, on the east coast of the country, Indians came to represent a small but prominent minority in greater Krugersdorp and remain largely in Azaadville. They came to the town as it was forming in the 1880s and settled geographically between Whites and Blacks.13 This position was forced upon them in a manner that was broadly reflective of the British Empire’s perspective on racial hierarchy and subsequently inherited by South Africa’s White governments. South Africa’s other important “intermediate” racial group—the Coloureds—never comprised a large share of the local population around Krugersdorp or anywhere on the West Rand. Though commonly described as Mogale’s “Indian township,” Azaadville itself is not homogeneous, and certainly not in economic terms. A few months earlier I had visited a much wealthier neighborhood, in which some single-family houses even had small pools. This voting station was surrounded by nondescript blocks of flats or apartments, low-end stores, and a petrol station. For every eight South Asians there were about two Black Africans and no Whites. People hung out around the parking lot of the community center, others coming in and out to vote. ANC, DA, and EFF representatives positioned themselves outside as their counterparts had done elsewhere. The ANC and DA groups were not too receptive to my questions. I spoke some Xhosa with the ANC folks and that lightened the mood, especially when they corrected my broken salutation. I had forgotten that “Thanks very much” is “Enkosi kakhulu” (pronounced “loo” at the end) not “kakhuhle” (with a “lay” at the end). The two EFF reps here were happy to talk. “It’s hard to knock on doors in this area,” they explained. “People live either in closed buildings or behind gated houses,” so the ground game is well-nigh impossible. In front of the community center, a reigning elder seemed to be holding court—a tall man with a curly gray beard and no mustache, sporting sunglasses and a Liverpool soccer club scarf. He arrived here nineteen years ago from Johannesburg near Emirates stadium, still known by its original name, Ellis Park. I introduced myself and asked my standard opening line: “How did the voting go?” “Veeery smooth,” he seemed delighted to report. “Only thing … the IEC guy, I had to teach him a thing or two. He didn’t know the alphabet.” He took out a small slip of paper that was generated as part of the process, and he showed me how it was necessary to match the slip against the individual’s identity card to gain admission. Apparently, the IEC official seemed to be struggling with this. “Now he’s on it.” “I have voted in all the past elections from 1994. Every four years14 it’s something different. What we’ve come through. State capture and corruption. We must make an informed decision about our future. I am a grandfather and we need a better future for all the races. Education, homes, pensions. Everyone should have equal opportunity to prosper.” I didn’t see lines to get into the community center to vote, and I asked him about turnout. “From what I can see, over 90 percent vote. Azaadville is a small community, most people come in the morning. Then afternoon prayer. Oh look, over there, these are the pioneers of Azaadville.” He pointed to some much older men who were slowly descending the steps into the community center. “On our WhatsApp group, one message that came through is that during special voting, some people came with pencils and the ballots weren’t stamped.” I found it amazing that this one story had clearly reached so many South African voters so quickly. “So I came with my own pen. So people are sharing information to make sure to use a pen and verify that the ballot is stamped on the back. We’ve come now twenty-five years, a quarter century. Compared with the first time, the queues were longer then.” A shorter man, also Indian but without a head covering, introduced himself as Farouk. He is an ANC “PR councillor,” which meant he was placed on a party list, not directly elected in a ward constituency, the two options in South Africa’s mixed system of local government. Without mentioning Jacob Zuma’s name, he addressed the cross that ANC ground forces must bear: “The problem is that when an individual does wrong, they associate it with the party. We cling onto the wrong. But there is a lot of good to be appreciated. There is a lot of potential in this country. I am happy we’ve come a long way in 107 years. The current president has a massive job. The ANC has large support, but some swung from the ANC.” I asked about the campaign, and he echoed some of the EFF concerns: “In Azaadville, we don’t go door-to-door—we knock and drop pamphlets.” The man with the Liverpool scarf, Cllr Farouk, and I chatted more about the local concerns, and the standard mantra of “service delivery” came up—a broad label frequently used to decry frustrations with what is not provided usually in the form of basic services but sometimes can mean almost anything at all. I was surprised that Cllr Farouk didn’t take the easy path of pandering to the primacy of his own neighborhood’s concerns: “In Azaadville, some people want speed bumps. In Magaliesburg, some people are suffering without water. What’s more important? In Azaadville, people complain, complain and they have everything.” He looked to the others to nod, but none were forthcoming. “Township people have nothing and they smile.” Of course, many people in the townships are not smiling, but I didn’t disagree with his sentiments and much of my own research supports what he said. Those who have done best under post-Apartheid government have in recent years been the least likely to vote for the ANC.15 Once again, I recognized that in couples, the men were more likely to speak. Several women did come to vote alone or in pairs, and I looked to approach a few of them, but they averted my gaze. I was again very conscious of the male bias in my unsystematic sample. When social scientists conduct systematic surveys, we try to match up the race and gender of interviewers, but I was traveling alone on this day and was reminded of this effect. RIETVALLEI EXTENSION 2 COMMUNITY HALL, RIETVALLEI WARD 3, 12:25 P.M. I got back into my car at 12:05 p.m., and a few raindrops again dotted my windshield. The radio announcers reminded listeners of the duty to vote. “Remember: If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” Maybe that’s why everyone’s saying it, I thought to myself. I headed back out on Taj Mahal Street. I didn’t have time to stop at another voting station in Ward 3, which was mostly Azaadville, but I had noticed on the map that an area just south of Azaadville, Rietvallei, was also in the ward, and decided I would check it out. After pulling over to write down some of my thoughts for about twenty minutes, hoping the pouring rain would stop—which it did—I drove in for a look. It was bleak: an extremely depressing, barren area filled with cinder-block structures and shacks, some gutted and burned out. In the rain, the tall lampposts that tower way above the neighborhood looked like they were spitting fire. There’s very little commerce, except for a few small spaza (informal, home-based convenience) shops. People walked in the middle of the streets, and I drove slowly. The ANC tent there seemed well staffed, as did the EFF tent. It was easy to imagine that this was where the EFF would fare well: if one wanted a narrative of deprivation and failure to deliver a better life, this little pocket would provide just that. THEMBILE PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 10, 1:30 P.M. My next stop was Kagiso, the much larger of Mogale’s two Black townships, which spans several wards. I headed to Ward 10, in the middle. Seventy percent of voters went for the ANC in 2016, but the EFF was also strong with more than 17 percent of the vote. I plotted a course to Thembile Primary School, which is located right next to the Kagiso Methodist Church, where I had visited a couple of times. I had met the pastor there and interviewed a few congregants. I had been struck then, as I was on this day, by the quality of the housing stock, the nice streets, the friendly vibe of the neighborhood. As it had been in Munsieville, election day was a party. The political tents were filled with people, the music was again on full volume, and some people were literally dancing in the street in front of the entrance to the school. I chatted briefly with a man who told me that all the voting had been fine. A man who helped a lady into a van subsequently approached me and asked if I was a reporter. It was a reasonable assumption considering the fact that I was the only White guy for miles and carrying a clipboard. I explained my intentions and he introduced me to the local ward councillor who was on site that day: Councillor Maxwell Kuswayo, a member of the mayoral committee and, according to him, a ward councillor for nineteen years. I knew from my research that there is very high turnover among councillors, so this was indeed an impressive political feat. FIGURE 2.2. ANC party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. I could see that Kuswayo was going to stand here, perfectly legally, but definitely in the path of pretty much anyone who wanted to vote at this station. I asked if he minded if I talked to people coming out of the voting booth, and he thought for a bit and said ok, but as I approached someone to talk, he stayed close by. After this first brief interview, I chatted with him some more. I asked about the low registration among young voters. He boasted that about 80 percent of young people had been registered in the area. “We listen to them all. These kids, their complaint is unemployment. Here it is very high.” Of the EFF, he says, “You can’t promise everything here. How will you pay for it? South Africa is the only country where you can get a free house. We are becoming a welfare state. There are too many social grants. We have seventeen million pensioners.” Kuswayo was born here in 1960. He argued that if you look at this township and consider what it was like back then, you couldn’t imagine the changes. He was an MMC (Member of the Mayoral Committee) for electricity, water, and sanitation. He was the service delivery guy—the very issues so many people are complaining about—and I put it to him that his portfolio is the source of complaint. In response, he highlighted that basic shares of water and electricity were free to the poor. He seemed not ready to discuss some of the more serious concerns—not here, not on election day with this American guy asking questions. Soon enough, it was time for me to go, and I did. TSHOLOTSEGA PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 15, 2:45 P.M. I stopped at several other voting stations in Kagiso, including in Ward 15, at the Tsholotsega Primary School. Ward 15 is a politically interesting area because it houses a strong base of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters, enough to have made it possible to attain a single seat on the Mogale City council in 2016. As I mentioned, the IFP is largely a Zulu-based party, run out of KwaZulu-Natal Province. It is the one major Black party strongly associated with a particular ethnic group; and it was badly hurt when Jacob Zuma, a Zulu himself, headed up the ANC, drawing away the votes of other Zulus from the IFP. A few Zulu speakers are interspersed throughout the municipality, but only in Ward 15 do they constitute a sizable minority (of 32 percent), delivering 15 percent of the total vote share in that ward in the prior local election. The EFF has also been strong here with 17 percent. And the ANC’s position is most precarious for an all-Black area, with less than 59 percent of the vote in the last election. FIGURE 2.3. DA party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The fancy schools of central Krugersdorp were distant memories from the morning; this school had the charm of a passport office, and there was no music or partying outside. This voting station was at the crossroads of a few different communities, also on the edge of a more industrial area. I parked along the sidewalk and walked down to the first booth, the bright red one. “The EFF is very strong in this area because people are tired of the ANC. The ANC doesn’t know how to do groundwork. Even old people want to be members. We’ve got five signups,” the EFF desk rep said proudly showing me the forms. “We have been going door-to-door, every day. Even today. I was very active in the ANC, but I switched at the time they put Zuma in as president.” FIGURE 2.4. EFF party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. As we were talking, a woman with a DA T-shirt came to chat. I smiled and asked, “So you guys get along ok?” “Yah, the DA and EFF are friendly. We don’t want to be near the green and yellow,” she said, referring to the ANC colors. I asked if that extends into her personal life. She nodded. “We don’t have friends who are ANC.” I popped over to the DA tent, where two women and one man were presiding. “We hope all is going well. Seems like it’s a free and fair election. The process is going smooth,” one of the women explained. The man, about my age, wanted to talk and pulled me aside to share his story. “I used to be ANC, three years ago. But I am not happy with how the government was run. There is no system of accountability. Incompetency. Dysfunctional. I studied the manifestoes and thought the DA was for me.” He was the first person I met who complained that there should not be a paper ballot; he feared that some votes would be stolen and believed they should switch to electronic voting. The ANC folks were confident that they would do well in Ward 15. “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a woman, possibly in her fifties, smiled as she repeated the tagline under which Cyril’s name is plastered all over the country. I asked her what she thought were the biggest issues in the ward. “The hostel dwellers. They break our windows, stone our cars.” She pointed down the way to the hostels. “They are vicious people. Some are IFP. Involved in mining. But our resources are almost depleted. So just dumps.” I saw no visible manifestation of the IFP in the area, but they may have been at another polling station within the ward. It was time to leave Kagiso and head north. NOORDHEUWEL COUNTRY CLUB, NOORDHEUWEL WARD 22, 3:30 P.M. The sun came out again around 3:30 p.m., when I arrived at Noordheuwel Country Club, the site of a polling station near where I had started the morning. Looking around, it was clear that I was back in White South Africa. At the entrance, I saw Tjaart Steenkamp, one of Mogale City’s two FF+ councillors. I had interviewed him several months earlier and now he was standing in front of his party’s flag, posted to the side of a walkway. Ward 22 had been solidly DA, close to 90 percent in the last election, but this kind of White, high-income, largely Afrikaans-speaking (over 60 percent) area was fertile ground for the FF+, as many of the typical, White DA supporters were not so sure about a party run by Mmusi Maimane. As I headed down to the voting booth, I could see tennis courts off to the right and a lawn bowling pitch, perfectly manicured, off to my left. I introduced myself to a tall young man with a flop of brown hair, glasses, and a white button-down shirt. He said he didn’t know whom he was going to vote for until he got into the voting booth. The issues? “It’s work … jobs … quotas in sports.” That last one felt out of the blue, and I guessed there must be a back story. There was: he was a cricketer—a sport long dominated by Whites—and frustrated that he had not been initially admitted to university because, according to him, of his color. He shared that he would soon start at the University of South Africa, UNISA. “The biggest thing is my sport. I love it. I just wish we could look past race, gender, identity.” A White man’s pushback against gender- and race-based affirmative action would be familiar in many circles of the United States. I chatted with Tjaart and when I asked how it was going, he smiled. “We’re doing very well. We’ll be strongest in the West Rand.” A key platform for the FF+ is opposition to affirmative action, and the appeal of that message goes beyond Afrikaners to many English-speaking Whites, and even Coloureds and Indians, who say they are overlooked for jobs, promotions, and other opportunities in favor of less-qualified Black Africans. LAST STOPS: RIETFONTEIN SUPERMARKET, RIETFONTEIN, MULDERSDRIFT WARD 23, 4:01 P.M. IMAGES OF AFRICA, CRADLE OF HUMANKIND, WARD 39, 4:40 P.M. After 4 p.m., I made two more stops. The first one was the Rietfontein supermarket in Ward 23 up in Muldersdrift, a rural part of the municipality where I first went on voter registration day; the second stop was at the polling station in Ward 39 located next to a taxidermist, where it is dead quiet. Most of the voters who would cast a ballot in this election had already come and gone. And as the light was getting low, with winter setting in, I decided that it was time to call it a day. As I drove back to my guesthouse on the largely empty road, I continued a conversation in my head that had started as I decided to write this book and persists with me now: Had South Africa’s democratic project been a success? So many of the problems I had learned about for decades were still unresolved, and so many people had grown cynical. But others were proud of what had been accomplished. Quite clearly, my answer could not be a simple “yes” or “no.” But I would aspire to sum up what I could learn with something more useful than “it’s complicated.”",

I wanted to see this for myself and to hear what was on the minds of the very diverse citizens at the precise time that they were finally being forced to make this important decision. Using the geo-coordinates of the polling stations posted online by the electoral commission (IEC), I planned a tour of Mogale City. I set out to trace the history of the development of the area, while trying to minimize driving distance between stops. In preparation, I charged two mobile phones, one with an American SIM card, one with a local SIM. These devices would guide me throughout the day, and I needed some redundancy in case one failed or got poor service, eventualities I had previously experienced. I also brought a notebook that fit in my back pocket and a few pens. A friend and colleague who is an expert on election observation advised me to wear neutral colors, to carry a clipboard, and to review an election observation handbook.1 During the previous few days, the weather had been absolutely stunning: warm, with clear skies—winter in Gauteng is nothing like its Boston counterpart. On this morning, however, it was distinctively chilly and overcast. Adding to my sense of apprehension, as I departed from my guesthouse at about 6:45 a.m., I saw that several birds had decided to mark this special day by crapping all over my white rental car. FIGURE 2.1. My election day route, Mogale City, May 8, 2019. MONUMENT PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:00 A.M. My first stop was Monument Primary School. Although I had hoped to get there a bit before the election station was set to open, I arrived at exactly 7 a.m. Monument refers to the Paardekraal Monument, just half a mile away, where almost 139 years earlier Paul Kruger and approximately 6,000 fellow Afrikaners built a cairn—a large statue of stones—to mark their unity and common cause in resisting British rule.2 Always a group to mix religion and politics, they declared it a symbol of their covenant with God, recalling unlikely past victories against their foes.3 Monument Primary School sits just a block away from Voortrekker Road—yet another nod to the Afrikaner legacy. In Ward 37, just shy of 50 percent of households speak Afrikaans at home. It had grown to be a solid DA constituency, and in the 2016 local election, that party raked in over 83 percent of the vote here. In this well-manicured neighborhood, large but hardly ostentatious homes are mostly visible from the street. Outside the gates of the school, the DA set up what looked like a small office, with a canopy and a table. I didn’t see any other parties. Either they were conceding this ward, or—more likely—they just had not gotten their acts together to arrive before voting began. Election day is a national holiday in South Africa—a simple tribute to its importance that some have advocated for in the United States.4 But that doesn’t mean everyone had the day off from work, and in any case, many people like to vote early. About sixty people were standing in line outside when I arrived. Apart from one woman, everyone I saw was White; there was a fairly good mix of young and old, and many people came with their kids. A few pulled up in high-end “bakkies,” white, tricked-out pickup trucks, with stainless steel crossbars in the front. One DA sign said, “Stop the ANC and EFF.” In other words, stop the two Black parties. There were no ANC signs around here. In the last election, the ruling party barely eked out 7 percent of the vote in this ward, even though almost 30 percent of the population was Black. On the one hand, because today’s elections were for the provincial and national legislatures, it was not as if a vote in one part of the municipality would have a greater impact than anywhere else in the province. On the other hand, local party officials would be held accountable for each polling station, and the returns in this election would serve as a benchmark for local contests scheduled for two years in the future. The respective parties would make decisions about which local officials could stand in those elections with this information in mind. I found a spot that was outside the IEC’s taped-off boundaries but close enough that I could greet exiting voters. At 7:15, just fifteen minutes after the school opened to voters, I approached a White woman, probably in her thirties, who spoke quickly with a strong Afrikaans accent. “Aagh, they weren’t quite ready for us,” she told me. “The left hand doesn’t know where is the right hand. But it was not too much of a holdup.” She was skeptical that the vote would be totally free: “I think they will try to put in votes,” she said, which I took to mean that the ANC would stuff ballot boxes with fraudulent ballots. Of her friends and family she said, “Most will vote. Some will say it’s not worth it. But we need to try.” When I asked about possible problems so far, she said she was not aware of any vote buying or intimidation. Just before 7:20, I saw that a few ANC party representatives had arrived to set up shop near where the DA decamped. The major parties set up these small booths outside the election stations to provide a last bit of party marketing, to stand by to monitor for any funny business, and to allow party supporters to come by to check in. The actual vote is secret, but this system allows the parties to keep track of who actually shows up on election day. Next, I spoke with a forty-something White man who described the process as very efficient and recounted that he had voted in every previous election. “I think you need a strong opposition … and I think the fear factor of the EFF is what’s causing a lot of people to vote.” A young woman, probably in her early twenties, came out with her father, and when I asked her about her decision to come to vote, she said, “It’s the right thing to do.” As I drove away I saw well-ordered rubbish bins set out at the end of driveways, in greater order than I was accustomed to in my Brookline, Massachusetts, neighborhood on collection day. Basic service delivery was just about 100 percent in Ward 37. But I did notice a few guys picking through the trash bins. The very poor would try to survive on the salable, salvageable items from the detritus of the well-to-do. WEST RAND PRIMARY SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP WARD 37, 7:40 A.M. My next stop was a voting station on the other side of Coronation Park. It was established in 1902 to commemorate Edward VII’s coronation as British king in 1901 and just following the British defeat of the Boers in the 1899–1902 war, also known as the Boer War. The park may have been built over a concentration camp run by the British, largely to contain their Afrikaner enemies, and remains as yet one more remembrance of the bitter tensions that once stood between these two White groups.5 While bloody and costly, the peace for that war paved the way for the formation of the Union of South Africa, which integrated two Boer-run republics and two British colonies. The IEC station here was the second of three in Ward 37 and was set up at the West Rand School, which had a long driveway and well-manicured grounds. As I entered, I cynically assumed it was a place filled with White, square-chinned rugby players. I later learned that it is a multiracial primary school for physically disabled children, many of whom have cerebral palsy, and it was heartening to recognize that the most vulnerable were enjoying access to what appeared to be a beautiful facility. The voters were again mostly White, a mix of old and young. Some likely worked desk jobs; others wore the fluorescent vests and pants that help to protect those working on the street as cleaners, parking attendants, and road pavers. “They already say that the voting papers [ballots] were not stamped,” a White woman, perhaps in her early sixties, said in response to my question about the integrity of the voting process. “They say we must write in a pen.” Apparently, some votes cast somewhere in the country were in pencil and had been changed. The stamps are used on election day by election workers to mark the validity of the ballots. Reports of any malfeasance circulate instantaneously on social media. I asked, why vote? “Actually, it’s a privilege to be part of the process. I have a nineteen-year-old son who did not register but he regrets it. I hope they [young people] have a say. It’s exciting for me to see people get involved. To do something about it.” I saw just one Black African woman, wearing a faded pink cotton apron that peered out underneath her jacket. She was originally from Soweto but had lived in this area for a long time. I made it a point not to ask anyone about their vote choices, but she quickly informed me, proudly, “I am ANC … I have voted in all of the elections.” I saw it was 8 a.m. on my watch, the sun was coming out, and I headed to my car. On my drive, I passed a tall statue of Paul Kruger, the last Afrikaner president of the Afrikaner Republic that predated the Union of South Africa. RAND EN DAL KLINIESKOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:05 A.M. At about 8:05 a.m., I arrived at the first of my two stops in Ward 17, the Rand en Dal Klinieskool. This is in Dan Pienaarville, the site of significant political tension in the 1980s when its White residents clamored for Black residents of nearby Munsieville to be moved because they were, simply, too close for comfort. Dan Pienaarville remains a largely White area, but compared with my first stops, the neighborhood homes were smaller, the grass was less tightly manicured, and there were more vacant, scruffy lots. Nonetheless, most voters arrived in their own cars, reflecting a certain level of wealth or employment status that most South Africans do not enjoy. For the first time that day, I saw a large ANC Mogale City tent. The DA was also there, as was the FF+. The skies turned gray again. “One hundred percent. Nice and smooth,” a forty-something White man with a goatee explained to me as he stood next to his wife. “This was a bit better, because last time they started late. We need to vote for the opposition to try to end the corruption. It’s a beautiful country, but we must set the politics right.” A Black man in his thirties also described the process as smooth. He had moved to the area only six months earlier. “I think it was free and fair, but I would prefer a system like in the United States, where you have the opportunity to vote directly for the president.” I didn’t ask his party, but I did ask what influenced his vote choice. “It’s not easy. You look at the past and, well, job creation is critical. Our economy is moving at a slow pace. We need to get that right.” Any irregularities? “I just saw on TV and social media an issue with some ballot papers,” he said, referring to the same incident that the woman had referenced earlier in the day. “But besides that, nothing.” As I looked around, I was struck by the fact that many people brought their youngish children. I was reminded of the idiosyncrasies of election day: people with children are likely to vote at different times than those without. On a day like today, with changing and unseasonably cold and wet weather, some may not bother at all. At 8:30 a.m., I also felt how chilly it had become, and the South Africans will tell you how much they don’t like the cold. People were still streaming in. Many couples walked to the voting station holding hands. An older White man told me, “No problems. I’ve voted and lived here all my life.” Then he corrected himself: “I came from Namibia in 1978.” At that time, Namibia was controlled by South Africa, essentially governed under Apartheid policies as an additional province and called Southwest Africa. He then uttered a mantra that I would hear throughout the rest of the day: “If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” I supposed that there is a great desire to complain, and if you feel that you will be denied this opportunity if you don’t vote, it’s a small price to pay. He described the system as free and fair. “Yah, I think so. But there are too many parties involved.” Indeed, forty-eight parties had registered for the national election. I asked about people not voting. “In my family, everyone wants to vote. My children, my wife. First, we must try to get rid of the ANC. The next stronger party must be given a chance.” He saw no intimidation or vote buying. He told me that his wife, who is in her sixties and frailer, was able to vote earlier as they let older people vote first. I approached the DA tent and asked the attending representative how the day was going. “It’s cold. That will affect the vote.” Any irregularities? “I haven’t seen anything. But it’s still early.” I went to the ANC tent, where just one man was holding down the fort. I asked if they had many supporters in the area. He didn’t directly respond to my question, but the answer was clear: “Well, it’s mostly White people who live around here.” At 8:48 a.m., I got back into my now thoroughly bird-crap-stained rental car to visit one more voting station in the informally constituted border area between Dan Pienaarville and Munsieville. To do so, I crossed the road that was built in the 1980s expressly to keep these White and Black communities apart.6 It was still working. TOWN VIEW HIGH SCHOOL, KRUGERSDORP/DAN PIENAARVILLE WARD 17, 8:50 A.M. At Town View High School, I met a thirty-something Black woman who told me, “I want a better life. I need a house. I need work.” Perhaps wishfully, she predicted a coalition would unseat the ANC: “I think the DA and the EFF will win.” At 9:18 a.m., according to my rough plan of allocating thirty minutes per stop, I was right on time, and I headed off to Munsieville Ward 24. If I had been in Cape Town, traveling to the Black township of Khayelitsha or Langa, I would have been preparing for a solid twenty-minute ride, or more with traffic. The Apartheid government kept those townships truly apart from the city center. But key to the whole conflict in Dan Pienaarville of the 1980s was that Munsieville … is right there. And within five minutes, I found myself on Mangope Drive, Mmamogale Drive, and Matlaba Street, arriving at Phatudi Primary School. I was no longer in White South Africa. PHATUDI PRIMARY SCHOOL, MUNSIEVILLE WARD 24, 9:23 A.M. On my way to the voting station, I passed right by the Desmond Tutu Library and a police station that had been burned down by protesters a year earlier. A frustrated group had demanded action on a list of items, including crime, drugs, and human trafficking. One of the bitter ironies of many South African protests held in the name of poor public services is that they frequently involve the destruction of existing ones, contributing to the misery of ordinary citizens. The area had a long history of protest, including in the mid-1950s when Desmond Tutu himself was a teacher at Munsieville High School.7 In 1955, in his early twenties, he decided he could no longer participate in the White government’s administration of inferior “Bantu Education” designed to equip Blacks for a life of servitude and he resigned. (Technically, “Bantu” refers to a group of languages spoken by Black Africans in southern Africa, but that term and “Native” were frequently used by the White government as administrative categories and, in turn, generally rejected as pejorative by Black Africans.) Tutu left teaching for the priesthood, initially as a sub-deacon in Krugersdorp,8 and went on to pursue additional education and opportunities in church councils overseas. Within a few decades, he emerged as one of the world’s most storied liberation activists in his tireless campaigns, not simply against Apartheid but also against sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination. So it was fitting that a library should be built here in his name. Standing in the center of Munsieville, I was now less than two and a half miles from the polling station where I started the morning in Ward 37. However, these were very, very different places. The median household income in Ward 37, where 67 percent of residents were White, was 115,000 rand, and over 20 percent of the households had an annual income of at least 300,000 rand (nationally, just about 8 percent of households were in this bracket). Here in Ward 24, where 99 percent of residents are Black African, median household income was a mere 30,000 rand (about $2,100 US at the time), and just 1 percent of households took in 300,000 or more. Back in Ward 37, about 99 percent of households were built as formal structures and basic service provision (water, toilet, refuse) was over 97 percent. Moreover, 49 percent had a computer, 68 percent had a car, and 71 percent had a washing machine. The situation was very different here: a full 38 percent of households were informal dwellings—shacks or shanties, usually made in large part with corrugated metal. Over 95 percent also enjoyed basic services, albeit of lesser quality. Only 11 percent had a computer, 14 percent a car, and 27 percent a washing machine.9 As I traveled up the hill, I saw a massive taxi depot filled with dozens of the white vans (known as taxis in South Africa) with yellow stripes that bring residents to Krugersdorp, Joburg, and elsewhere. The largely unregulated taxi industry is central to life in South Africa, serving a mostly Black clientele and accounting for approximately 75 percent of all daily transport,10 as neither the Apartheid nor post-Apartheid governments developed successful or integrated mass public transportation systems. On this holiday, the taxis were mostly idle. A few men sat on the passenger floor of a taxi with its door open, their feet hanging over the side. In Munsieville, people live outside. Unlike the subdued atmosphere around Monument and Dan Pienaarville, it was loud with music, and people were laughing. The first person I chatted with was a young woman, maybe in her twenties. When I asked her about her voting experience, she said, “It went well. Took about an hour.” We were now in ANC territory, and 75 percent of the voters here had stayed with the liberation party in the 2016 local elections. It’s also fairly ripe EFF ground, and they managed over 15 percent in those elections, making it unclear what would happen this go-round. “I want to make a change. I don’t want to complain for nothing. I did something about it.” She highlighted the catchall phrase of “services” and called out housing and unemployment as the issues she cared about most. A tall, older but quite sturdy-looking man came through the gates. “I didn’t wait five minutes. Pensioners [senior citizens] get to cut the line,” he explained. “I was born in Munsieville.… Most of us will vote ANC.” I walked over to the ANC tent. “Good turnout?” I asked. “Not yet. But we don’t expect a problem. Some went to work and many will come after 3 p.m.” I was a little surprised to see representatives from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), whose electoral fortunes had waned over the previous quarter century. The organization itself was born out of differences with the ANC regarding how to address the race question. In 1959, ANC leaders had been planning a defiance campaign against the country’s pass laws, but Robert Sobukwe, who rejected many key tenets of ANC philosophy, including “non-racialism,”11 broke away to form this rival organization. In turn, the PAC was behind one of the most important defiance campaigns of all time—the 1960 Sharpeville Protest—during which the peaceful burning of passes was met with a lethal police response. That day, a massacre made martyrs out of those victims and began to turn global opinion against White South Africa. The organization was prominent in Munsieville back in the 1980s and gained some seats in the national Parliament in 1994, but they had not had any representation in Mogale City in recent history, and I had been wondering what had happened to them. One of the three men at the booth said, “We are struggling because of the finances. We have many supporters. We are not buying people to vote. We haven’t changed. We stand for land to Africans today.… At the top of the elections, land is important for survival. For hospitals to build. Land is everything! In the elections of 1994, we focused on land. The other parties did not follow that route. The EFF has been making a big push for land redistribution in recent years, and the ANC has made timid murmurings along these lines.” I asked if the PAC and EFF have similar views on land. “There is a huge difference between the EFF and the PAC,” he said. “On the land issue, the EFF [says] we are only entitled to land taken in the past hundred years. We say, look at the land from 1652 that must be taken.… We believe in Africanism. The ruling party fears us, so we are infiltrated by them.” Land inequality is one of the many remaining sources of wealth inequality, one that remains emotive from decades of forced removals and centuries of land grabs. While a land claims court has settled a handful of cases, the White minority continues to retain the majority of the best land, and the EFF has campaigned hard on this injustice. I had been through this neighborhood several times on past trips, but I was struck again by how different the vibe was on election day compared with White Mogale City. First, the density: the streets are narrower, so many people in so few square meters. The school was noticeably smaller, starker. There was no grass or lawn. I looked at the line into the voting booths, and I noticed that people stood very close to one another, often touching, certainly as compared with the much wider zone of personal space maintained in the White areas. A decent-sized group congregated under the DA tent. Ten years ago, I would never have imagined that this largely White party could have such a presence in a place like Munsieville. But it was clearly building a support base. The sun broke through again and, realizing that I had stayed in this Munsieville ward for longer than my planned half hour, it was time to move on. PRO-PRACTICUM SKOOL, KRUGERSDORP WEST WARD 26, 10:12 A.M. Ward 26 is one of Mogale’s more racially diverse neighborhoods, about 35 percent White and 62 percent Black, according to the 2011 census. I approached the ANC tent outside the Pro-Practicum school, and I introduced myself. The agents quickly referred me to a woman in a different caliber of ANC regalia: a zip-up dress with the party’s green, gold, and black, rather than a T-shirt. She is Peace Mabe, a Member of Parliament. I asked if there were any challenges being made so far, and she could point only to a voter in Magaliesburg, who was turned away on a technicality that might have been an honest misunderstanding of the rules. “We are hoping for the best. We want to win Gauteng.” This was not the “ANC will rule South Africa until the sun doesn’t shine” that I remembered from previous elections. This was a party knowing it might—unlikely though it may be—actually fail to get 50 percent of the votes, particularly in Gauteng. Peace said they were working hard. “Everyone has been out campaigning. We stopped campaigning today to get people out. In other areas, the queues are long.” The line to check in here was certainly longer than at the DA tent. Meanwhile, an EFF car was just now showing up with guys in red plastic hard hats. I spoke with a Black couple in their thirties. The man held a car key in his hand. “We would like to see a few changes in the country and let other parties get a chance. Whoever wins, we need to close the borders. To come, you must have your own money. If that can be processed, it would end crime. People jump over and come to do crime.” As he said this, I could see that his wife cringed a bit, knowing that such talk was not polite. But she did not say anything. The group of young EFF supporters were struggling to get their stand set up, and they were situating themselves pretty far from the entrance. At the Sunday rally, Julius Malema had talked about their disciplined ground game, but it was not evident here. I approached a Black woman who had moved to the area from Soweto in 2002, and I asked how the different race groups got along in this diverse neighborhood. “We only see each other for meetings at school. It goes well. We have different views. You see, we integrated into their space,” she explained with a tone that wavered between empathy and resentment. “For them, integrating us is very difficult. They have to adjust. Since 1994, I think people are beginning to adjust but it’s still very difficult. The majority of the Blacks have voted ANC. Some are loyal to the party. Some would say you can’t be loyal if the leaders are not loyal. Some say the DA is White. Others say they like Mmusi Maimane. We must integrate. We are afraid of one another. We don’t trust one another.” I asked if that lack of trust is also within race groups. “Definitely! Blacks don’t trust one another where our leaders promise but don’t deliver.” Surveys bear out what she said: in one conducted in Mogale City in 2017, only 26 percent said “Most people can be trusted,” while 70 percent said “You need to be very careful.”12 “We focus on faults and downfalls. We build parties on one another’s negativity,” she explained. At 10:55 I got into my car and keyed in the coordinates. Waze, my virtual driving assistant, told me I would have a fifteen-minute trip to my next stop. I had developed a fairly good sense of the geography of Mogale City, traveling around quite a bit and studying maps. But I was not prepared for the fact that within about a minute, I would pass by the entrance to Mintails gold mining. Because the industry had been in such decline in recent decades, apart from the large heaps of mining dumps visible from many vantage points around Mogale City, it can be easy to lose sight of how important mining was to the development of this town and region, and to South Africa more generally. Mintails is now better known as a major culprit of local environmental damage than as a productive contributor to the economy. And as I passed by, I saw a set of old hostels—the often squalid residence halls established for mine workers—in front of which today were rows of men and beer bottles. The hostels looked out onto metal shacks, outdoor plastic toilets, and burning fires. The mostly toxic mining excavations were everywhere, and certainly not where people ought to be living. Many stayed here nonetheless. I took the R28—Main Reef Road—to Paardekraal Drive, and then made a right, away from Krugersdorp, toward Azaadville. It began to rain, lightly, and my heart sank a bit as people are less likely to vote in inclement weather. Rainy election days are bad for democracy. AZAADVILLE COMMUNITY HALL, AZAADVILLE WARD 3, 11:15 A.M. I entered the gate of Azaadville Ward 3, on Taj Mahal Street, one of the few communities that actually maintains an active security gate. It was still drizzling, I needed a caffeine jolt, and my gas tank was getting low, so I pulled up to the Engen petrol station on my right and asked for 200 rand worth of 93. Another guy came up to me asking if I wanted him to check the oil and to wash the car, and I said, no, it’s a rental. Then he pointed to the bird shit all over my car, and he looked at me and explained in so many words that I really can’t have that. I am not known for keeping my own car clean, let alone a rental, but people really take good care of their cars here, and I was apparently an embarrassment. As I went in to get a Diet Coke, he washed the windshield but left the rest of the cleaning for me. Fair enough. I paid for the fuel, tipped him, and drove across the street to the Azaadville community hall. Once again, the cultural terrain changed. Of course, cities the world over have lots of ethnic enclaves. Chinatowns, Little Italys, and Brazilian districts in the United States always provide that sense of arriving somewhere else. The modern remnant of the Apartheid legacy is far more extreme, the result of deliberate machinations to keep groups apart, and Azaadville is not-so-little India. Hanging around the front of the center were several older men, who looked to be of South Asian descent. Families—mostly women with children—entered and exited the center. Almost all were wearing Muslim head coverings. Although South Africa’s Indian community has always been concentrated around Durban, on the east coast of the country, Indians came to represent a small but prominent minority in greater Krugersdorp and remain largely in Azaadville. They came to the town as it was forming in the 1880s and settled geographically between Whites and Blacks.13 This position was forced upon them in a manner that was broadly reflective of the British Empire’s perspective on racial hierarchy and subsequently inherited by South Africa’s White governments. South Africa’s other important “intermediate” racial group—the Coloureds—never comprised a large share of the local population around Krugersdorp or anywhere on the West Rand. Though commonly described as Mogale’s “Indian township,” Azaadville itself is not homogeneous, and certainly not in economic terms. A few months earlier I had visited a much wealthier neighborhood, in which some single-family houses even had small pools. This voting station was surrounded by nondescript blocks of flats or apartments, low-end stores, and a petrol station. For every eight South Asians there were about two Black Africans and no Whites. People hung out around the parking lot of the community center, others coming in and out to vote. ANC, DA, and EFF representatives positioned themselves outside as their counterparts had done elsewhere. The ANC and DA groups were not too receptive to my questions. I spoke some Xhosa with the ANC folks and that lightened the mood, especially when they corrected my broken salutation. I had forgotten that “Thanks very much” is “Enkosi kakhulu” (pronounced “loo” at the end) not “kakhuhle” (with a “lay” at the end). The two EFF reps here were happy to talk. “It’s hard to knock on doors in this area,” they explained. “People live either in closed buildings or behind gated houses,” so the ground game is well-nigh impossible. In front of the community center, a reigning elder seemed to be holding court—a tall man with a curly gray beard and no mustache, sporting sunglasses and a Liverpool soccer club scarf. He arrived here nineteen years ago from Johannesburg near Emirates stadium, still known by its original name, Ellis Park. I introduced myself and asked my standard opening line: “How did the voting go?” “Veeery smooth,” he seemed delighted to report. “Only thing … the IEC guy, I had to teach him a thing or two. He didn’t know the alphabet.” He took out a small slip of paper that was generated as part of the process, and he showed me how it was necessary to match the slip against the individual’s identity card to gain admission. Apparently, the IEC official seemed to be struggling with this. “Now he’s on it.” “I have voted in all the past elections from 1994. Every four years14 it’s something different. What we’ve come through. State capture and corruption. We must make an informed decision about our future. I am a grandfather and we need a better future for all the races. Education, homes, pensions. Everyone should have equal opportunity to prosper.” I didn’t see lines to get into the community center to vote, and I asked him about turnout. “From what I can see, over 90 percent vote. Azaadville is a small community, most people come in the morning. Then afternoon prayer. Oh look, over there, these are the pioneers of Azaadville.” He pointed to some much older men who were slowly descending the steps into the community center. “On our WhatsApp group, one message that came through is that during special voting, some people came with pencils and the ballots weren’t stamped.” I found it amazing that this one story had clearly reached so many South African voters so quickly. “So I came with my own pen. So people are sharing information to make sure to use a pen and verify that the ballot is stamped on the back. We’ve come now twenty-five years, a quarter century. Compared with the first time, the queues were longer then.” A shorter man, also Indian but without a head covering, introduced himself as Farouk. He is an ANC “PR councillor,” which meant he was placed on a party list, not directly elected in a ward constituency, the two options in South Africa’s mixed system of local government. Without mentioning Jacob Zuma’s name, he addressed the cross that ANC ground forces must bear: “The problem is that when an individual does wrong, they associate it with the party. We cling onto the wrong. But there is a lot of good to be appreciated. There is a lot of potential in this country. I am happy we’ve come a long way in 107 years. The current president has a massive job. The ANC has large support, but some swung from the ANC.” I asked about the campaign, and he echoed some of the EFF concerns: “In Azaadville, we don’t go door-to-door—we knock and drop pamphlets.” The man with the Liverpool scarf, Cllr Farouk, and I chatted more about the local concerns, and the standard mantra of “service delivery” came up—a broad label frequently used to decry frustrations with what is not provided usually in the form of basic services but sometimes can mean almost anything at all. I was surprised that Cllr Farouk didn’t take the easy path of pandering to the primacy of his own neighborhood’s concerns: “In Azaadville, some people want speed bumps. In Magaliesburg, some people are suffering without water. What’s more important? In Azaadville, people complain, complain and they have everything.” He looked to the others to nod, but none were forthcoming. “Township people have nothing and they smile.” Of course, many people in the townships are not smiling, but I didn’t disagree with his sentiments and much of my own research supports what he said. Those who have done best under post-Apartheid government have in recent years been the least likely to vote for the ANC.15 Once again, I recognized that in couples, the men were more likely to speak. Several women did come to vote alone or in pairs, and I looked to approach a few of them, but they averted my gaze. I was again very conscious of the male bias in my unsystematic sample. When social scientists conduct systematic surveys, we try to match up the race and gender of interviewers, but I was traveling alone on this day and was reminded of this effect. RIETVALLEI EXTENSION 2 COMMUNITY HALL, RIETVALLEI WARD 3, 12:25 P.M. I got back into my car at 12:05 p.m., and a few raindrops again dotted my windshield. The radio announcers reminded listeners of the duty to vote. “Remember: If you don’t vote, you can’t complain!” Maybe that’s why everyone’s saying it, I thought to myself. I headed back out on Taj Mahal Street. I didn’t have time to stop at another voting station in Ward 3, which was mostly Azaadville, but I had noticed on the map that an area just south of Azaadville, Rietvallei, was also in the ward, and decided I would check it out. After pulling over to write down some of my thoughts for about twenty minutes, hoping the pouring rain would stop—which it did—I drove in for a look. It was bleak: an extremely depressing, barren area filled with cinder-block structures and shacks, some gutted and burned out. In the rain, the tall lampposts that tower way above the neighborhood looked like they were spitting fire. There’s very little commerce, except for a few small spaza (informal, home-based convenience) shops. People walked in the middle of the streets, and I drove slowly. The ANC tent there seemed well staffed, as did the EFF tent. It was easy to imagine that this was where the EFF would fare well: if one wanted a narrative of deprivation and failure to deliver a better life, this little pocket would provide just that. THEMBILE PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 10, 1:30 P.M. My next stop was Kagiso, the much larger of Mogale’s two Black townships, which spans several wards. I headed to Ward 10, in the middle. Seventy percent of voters went for the ANC in 2016, but the EFF was also strong with more than 17 percent of the vote. I plotted a course to Thembile Primary School, which is located right next to the Kagiso Methodist Church, where I had visited a couple of times. I had met the pastor there and interviewed a few congregants. I had been struck then, as I was on this day, by the quality of the housing stock, the nice streets, the friendly vibe of the neighborhood. As it had been in Munsieville, election day was a party. The political tents were filled with people, the music was again on full volume, and some people were literally dancing in the street in front of the entrance to the school. I chatted briefly with a man who told me that all the voting had been fine. A man who helped a lady into a van subsequently approached me and asked if I was a reporter. It was a reasonable assumption considering the fact that I was the only White guy for miles and carrying a clipboard. I explained my intentions and he introduced me to the local ward councillor who was on site that day: Councillor Maxwell Kuswayo, a member of the mayoral committee and, according to him, a ward councillor for nineteen years. I knew from my research that there is very high turnover among councillors, so this was indeed an impressive political feat. FIGURE 2.2. ANC party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. I could see that Kuswayo was going to stand here, perfectly legally, but definitely in the path of pretty much anyone who wanted to vote at this station. I asked if he minded if I talked to people coming out of the voting booth, and he thought for a bit and said ok, but as I approached someone to talk, he stayed close by. After this first brief interview, I chatted with him some more. I asked about the low registration among young voters. He boasted that about 80 percent of young people had been registered in the area. “We listen to them all. These kids, their complaint is unemployment. Here it is very high.” Of the EFF, he says, “You can’t promise everything here. How will you pay for it? South Africa is the only country where you can get a free house. We are becoming a welfare state. There are too many social grants. We have seventeen million pensioners.” Kuswayo was born here in 1960. He argued that if you look at this township and consider what it was like back then, you couldn’t imagine the changes. He was an MMC (Member of the Mayoral Committee) for electricity, water, and sanitation. He was the service delivery guy—the very issues so many people are complaining about—and I put it to him that his portfolio is the source of complaint. In response, he highlighted that basic shares of water and electricity were free to the poor. He seemed not ready to discuss some of the more serious concerns—not here, not on election day with this American guy asking questions. Soon enough, it was time for me to go, and I did. TSHOLOTSEGA PRIMARY SCHOOL, KAGISO WARD 15, 2:45 P.M. I stopped at several other voting stations in Kagiso, including in Ward 15, at the Tsholotsega Primary School. Ward 15 is a politically interesting area because it houses a strong base of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters, enough to have made it possible to attain a single seat on the Mogale City council in 2016. As I mentioned, the IFP is largely a Zulu-based party, run out of KwaZulu-Natal Province. It is the one major Black party strongly associated with a particular ethnic group; and it was badly hurt when Jacob Zuma, a Zulu himself, headed up the ANC, drawing away the votes of other Zulus from the IFP. A few Zulu speakers are interspersed throughout the municipality, but only in Ward 15 do they constitute a sizable minority (of 32 percent), delivering 15 percent of the total vote share in that ward in the prior local election. The EFF has also been strong here with 17 percent. And the ANC’s position is most precarious for an all-Black area, with less than 59 percent of the vote in the last election. FIGURE 2.3. DA party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The fancy schools of central Krugersdorp were distant memories from the morning; this school had the charm of a passport office, and there was no music or partying outside. This voting station was at the crossroads of a few different communities, also on the edge of a more industrial area. I parked along the sidewalk and walked down to the first booth, the bright red one. “The EFF is very strong in this area because people are tired of the ANC. The ANC doesn’t know how to do groundwork. Even old people want to be members. We’ve got five signups,” the EFF desk rep said proudly showing me the forms. “We have been going door-to-door, every day. Even today. I was very active in the ANC, but I switched at the time they put Zuma in as president.” FIGURE 2.4. EFF party representatives in Kagiso on election day, May 8, 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. As we were talking, a woman with a DA T-shirt came to chat. I smiled and asked, “So you guys get along ok?” “Yah, the DA and EFF are friendly. We don’t want to be near the green and yellow,” she said, referring to the ANC colors. I asked if that extends into her personal life. She nodded. “We don’t have friends who are ANC.” I popped over to the DA tent, where two women and one man were presiding. “We hope all is going well. Seems like it’s a free and fair election. The process is going smooth,” one of the women explained. The man, about my age, wanted to talk and pulled me aside to share his story. “I used to be ANC, three years ago. But I am not happy with how the government was run. There is no system of accountability. Incompetency. Dysfunctional. I studied the manifestoes and thought the DA was for me.” He was the first person I met who complained that there should not be a paper ballot; he feared that some votes would be stolen and believed they should switch to electronic voting. The ANC folks were confident that they would do well in Ward 15. “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a woman, possibly in her fifties, smiled as she repeated the tagline under which Cyril’s name is plastered all over the country. I asked her what she thought were the biggest issues in the ward. “The hostel dwellers. They break our windows, stone our cars.” She pointed down the way to the hostels. “They are vicious people. Some are IFP. Involved in mining. But our resources are almost depleted. So just dumps.” I saw no visible manifestation of the IFP in the area, but they may have been at another polling station within the ward. It was time to leave Kagiso and head north. NOORDHEUWEL COUNTRY CLUB, NOORDHEUWEL WARD 22, 3:30 P.M. The sun came out again around 3:30 p.m., when I arrived at Noordheuwel Country Club, the site of a polling station near where I had started the morning. Looking around, it was clear that I was back in White South Africa. At the entrance, I saw Tjaart Steenkamp, one of Mogale City’s two FF+ councillors. I had interviewed him several months earlier and now he was standing in front of his party’s flag, posted to the side of a walkway. Ward 22 had been solidly DA, close to 90 percent in the last election, but this kind of White, high-income, largely Afrikaans-speaking (over 60 percent) area was fertile ground for the FF+, as many of the typical, White DA supporters were not so sure about a party run by Mmusi Maimane. As I headed down to the voting booth, I could see tennis courts off to the right and a lawn bowling pitch, perfectly manicured, off to my left. I introduced myself to a tall young man with a flop of brown hair, glasses, and a white button-down shirt. He said he didn’t know whom he was going to vote for until he got into the voting booth. The issues? “It’s work … jobs … quotas in sports.” That last one felt out of the blue, and I guessed there must be a back story. There was: he was a cricketer—a sport long dominated by Whites—and frustrated that he had not been initially admitted to university because, according to him, of his color. He shared that he would soon start at the University of South Africa, UNISA. “The biggest thing is my sport. I love it. I just wish we could look past race, gender, identity.” A White man’s pushback against gender- and race-based affirmative action would be familiar in many circles of the United States. I chatted with Tjaart and when I asked how it was going, he smiled. “We’re doing very well. We’ll be strongest in the West Rand.” A key platform for the FF+ is opposition to affirmative action, and the appeal of that message goes beyond Afrikaners to many English-speaking Whites, and even Coloureds and Indians, who say they are overlooked for jobs, promotions, and other opportunities in favor of less-qualified Black Africans. LAST STOPS: RIETFONTEIN SUPERMARKET, RIETFONTEIN, MULDERSDRIFT WARD 23, 4:01 P.M. IMAGES OF AFRICA, CRADLE OF HUMANKIND, WARD 39, 4:40 P.M. After 4 p.m., I made two more stops. The first one was the Rietfontein supermarket in Ward 23 up in Muldersdrift, a rural part of the municipality where I first went on voter registration day; the second stop was at the polling station in Ward 39 located next to a taxidermist, where it is dead quiet. Most of the voters who would cast a ballot in this election had already come and gone. And as the light was getting low, with winter setting in, I decided that it was time to call it a day. As I drove back to my guesthouse on the largely empty road, I continued a conversation in my head that had started as I decided to write this book and persists with me now: Had South Africa’s democratic project been a success? So many of the problems I had learned about for decades were still unresolved, and so many people had grown cynical. But others were proud of what had been accomplished. Quite clearly, my answer could not be a simple “yes” or “no.” But I would aspire to sum up what I could learn with something more useful than “it’s complicated.”",

      "content": "3 The Value of Democracy THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS I raise in this book concern the value of democracy. Specifically, how did political competition and the structure of government change once South Africa adopted truly democratic institutions that incorporated a previously excluded racial majority? Did the quality of people’s lives improve or deteriorate, and in what ways, during this period? And can we plausibly link such changes to democracy itself, to extract more general lessons about the prospects for democratic government in diverse and divided societies? The portrait of the election campaign I painted in the prior two chapters revealed a wide range of perspectives on such questions. Of course, as South African voters went to the polls in May 2019, they were making a choice about what they wanted for the future. Yet, the moment also marked an important opportunity for them to look back and consider whether the prior quarter century of multiracial democracy had been a success. The long struggle against Apartheid government had been a quest for liberty, for freedom from domination by a minority, and to build a more just society. Did those who worked so hard to bring about change get what they wanted? Or were they experiencing a form of buyer’s remorse? Was this really the best solution to institutionalized White supremacy? The ruling ANC party could not simply take a victory lap. The party’s leaders had long been confronting a string of protests of the kind I witnessed in Krugersdorp, frequently organized by their own members. The opposition parties, ranging from a Black nationalist left to White autonomists on the right, were relentless in their critiques. With a few exceptions, citizens seemed more inclined to discuss what had gone wrong than what had gone right. And as the campaign wound down, I considered the fact that in recent years, South African colleagues and acquaintances from a range of backgrounds had begun to express a surprising sentiment, one that occasionally appears in print in serious media outlets: “What this country needs … is a benevolent dictator!”1 Ordinary South Africans had become increasingly disillusioned with democracy.2 In one survey conducted at the end of 2016, 54 percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the way democracy was working.3 And by 2018, the share of “dissatisfieds” had grown to a full 57 percent of the population. In a summary report from Afrobarometer, whose survey data I analyze throughout this book, they cautioned, “Afrobarometer survey findings from mid-2018 show support for democracy weakening and acceptance of authoritarian alternatives growing.”4 It left me wondering: Was South African democracy actually at risk? Listening to the rallies, the campaign speeches, and the incessant commentary on talk radio in and around Mogale City during the first half of 2019, one could not help but be struck by the distinct scent of frustration. Not just with the present but with the whole post-Apartheid project. Even the ANC’s own representatives seemed more apologetic than proud. The expressed antipathies of White South Africans were already very familiar to me. As a White man, I have always had the easiest access to White South Africans. Many unabashedly told me that they longed for the past. “They made this country into a ball of shit,” explained one man, about my age, whom I met while dining at a restaurant in Muldersdrift one evening on my first trip to Mogale. He and his girlfriend were sitting at the table next to mine and they must have heard my American accent while I was placing an order, and like so many in the area, they were friendly and happy to share their political views and reflections with me. The culprit for the country’s decline, in this man’s view, was the Black ANC government. I would hear the same from most of the other White residents I met while touring the area and had heard the same for years in other parts of the country. What I did find more surprising, perhaps even offensive, was the man’s suggestion to me to “ask the Black people around here. They’ll tell you the same thing, that life was better in the old days.” It would be like suggesting that African Americans preferred life under segregation. On the other hand, only with solid data could I debunk such a claim. As part of my research, I conducted a Historical Memories Survey among adults in Mogale City—the results of which I detail in subsequent chapters—and asked citizens to compare their current overall quality of life (theirs and that of their family) to life in the Apartheid days. Is it better today? Worse today? Or about the same? The White responses were fairly predictable: 55 percent said life was worse today. Many Whites truly yearned for the time of White rule. If a politician had appealed to them with the slogan “Make South Africa Great Again,” they would have embraced the message with open arms. To my great disbelief, perhaps shock, it turned out that the White man I had met in Muldersdrift had correctly predicted Black public sentiment and I had been way off the mark in my skeptical reaction to his claims. In fact, a full 50 percent of Black residents surveyed said that life was better then, as compared with 40 percent who said things were better now.5 After months of talking to citizens and leaders around town, I had heard plenty of negative perspectives, complaints about government, crime, lack of jobs, and so forth.6 However, I had not expected that this would be the conclusion of so many in a random sample of forty-and-over adults from a municipality where Apartheid had been harshly enforced. If even Black South Africans were unhappy with the democracy that they had struggled to produce over so many generations, might they consider something else? Only a few years ago, the notion of citizens voluntarily forgoing democracy for authoritarian rule might have seemed radical and unimaginable, but these concerns have become particularly salient because for several years we have been witnessing a global retreat in democratic government.7 Seemingly stable democracies have given way to more authoritarian styles of rule. When my political science colleagues Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, and further developed their argument in a 2018 book, How Democracies Die,8 they provided a powerful wake-up call by connecting the dots to illustrate an emerging pattern: in the United States and in many other countries, the key foundations of democracy were being undone not through military coups or armed insurrections but at the ballot box. Citizens were increasingly choosing leaders who, in their populist bravado, were saying, “I alone can fix everything,” as Donald Trump said on the campaign trail in 2016. Given real and perceived problems in those societies, such calls were warmly received by many voters, and once in power, these leaders have worked to change the rules of the game to help entrench their power, undermining democratic institutions. And perhaps as both a cause and a consequence of such changes, even surprising numbers of Americans no longer take for granted democracy as the “only game in town,”9 imagining other types of political systems as preferable. Many reasons have been offered for the more recent rise of populist authoritarianism that has caused something of a reverse wave away from democracy, but among the most compelling explanations is that large shares of citizens in democratic countries are increasingly dissatisfied with their lot, in large part due to persistent and growing economic insecurity alongside perceived threats to status owing to immigration and other demographic trends.10 Ethnic and racial diversity can provide fodder for frustration and scapegoating. Under such conditions, populists promise swift and assured gains, with little tolerance for “special interests” in the form of ethnic minorities. I argue that the case of South Africa between 1994 and 2019 offers a compelling alternative to populist authoritarianism—a positive model of what democracy can offer truly divided societies: peace, the ability to influence leaders, increased material prosperity especially for the poor, and, ultimately, greater respect for human dignity. These were remarkable achievements in light of the country’s history, and the findings on dignity in particular help paint a fuller view of the value of democracy itself. While the rhetoric of everyday politics can be dismissive of the South African record, a more sober and considered evaluation reveals a democracy that has worked better than is often appreciated—by both pundits and citizens alike. In the remainder of this chapter, I describe why the question of valuing South Africa’s democratic project is a critical one; I outline the approach I took to answer this question; and I summarize the central findings detailed in the subsequent chapters. I highlight the profound value and remarkable achievements of South Africa’s first quarter century of multiracial, democratic government in terms of what I call dignified development, while recognizing the enormity of the problems that remain and that new challenges have emerged. Why Ask? Throughout modern history, historians, philosophers, and social scientists have all reflected on the value of democracy for the human condition. In so doing, they have considered whether democracy is intrinsically valuable, simply as an expression of freedom. And they have asked whether it leads to better outcomes for society. For example, does democracy promote economic development better than other systems of government?11 Is democracy good for the poor?12 Such questions are routinely asked and answered in more general terms, with respect to large numbers of polities. However, I focus on the value of democracy for the single country of South Africa. In this “case study” approach,13 I draw on many relevant comparisons, but I believe the narrowed attention is warranted. To begin with, South Africa is an intrinsically important case. Although only about the twenty-fifth most populous country in the world, the country’s plight has long been central to global political movements and ideas about justice and democracy. In the late twentieth century, perhaps no single political issue galvanized people around the world more than the idea that Apartheid government must come to an end. Apartheid, or apartness, was a full-blown system of social engineering relentlessly implemented on the southern tip of the African continent. It effectively relegated a Black majority to third-class citizenship. In turn, songs, plays, movies, and books captured the injustices of this system, and the very term “Apartheid” came to symbolize the essence of injustice, a retrograde form of internal colonial rule. Over the course of three decades, students at American and other foreign universities followed the lead of their South African counterparts, protesting and staging massive “sit-ins” inside and outside administrative offices to demand divestment from companies doing business in South Africa. Even a youthful Barack Obama cut his teeth in public speaking by railing against the Apartheid regime as a student at Occidental College in 1981, an opportunity he used to also shed light on racial issues in the United States.14 The organizers of major sporting events, including the International Olympic Committee, barred South Africans from competition. The South African government and its privileged White citizenry became global pariahs, while its Black citizens, and especially their famed political leaders—who sat in jail or lived in exile—earned the empathy and support of allies around the world. Sometimes for good and other times for bad, outsiders have always played an important role in the South African story. Citizens and political leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Cuba, and the Soviet Union, and particularly from countries across the African continent, were all intimately involved and/or interested in the long-standing conflict over Apartheid-style government. Depending on their political orientation and their own views on America’s racial order, American political leaders took different sides in support of or against White government. Moreover, while South Africa may be somewhat extreme in the extent to which it combines enormous ethnic and racial diversity along with high levels of income and wealth inequality and a history of conflict, it is not alone in these regards. American history echoes many strands of South Africa’s, an idea expertly documented by George Fredrickson in his classic text, White Supremacy.15 Not just the United States but also Israel, Australia, Brazil, India, Kenya, and many other countries face similar conditions for building cohesion and prosperity given the overlap of diversity and inequality. The degree to which South Africa underwent an extremely deliberate political transition offers possibilities for thinking about how to address such challenges in other contexts. For those interested in the making and breaking of racial boundaries, ultimately one must confront the South African example. As we know now, the formal Apartheid system was dissolved through the removal of discriminatory laws and institutions in the early 1990s. Nelson Mandela went from prisoner to president. South Africa was welcomed back into the global community with open arms, and external scrutiny turned toward other hot spots around the globe. Like dozens of other countries at approximately the same time, South Africa adopted a set of democratic institutions to select its leaders and make its policies. Against this important backdrop, a wide range of interested observers deserve to know what happened. Was it simply “case closed” in the sense that there was a problem, it was fixed, and now it’s time to move on? Given widespread interest, it is important that we get this case right with respect to the success or failure of democracy writ large. Whether South Africa is a case of success or failure has enormous implications for how we think about the promise of democracy more generally. A key concern that motivated me to write this book was my own appraisal that the more recent political history has been mischaracterized. In fact, a dominant narrative argues that the post-Apartheid period has been one of great expectations followed by profound disappointment. In summary form: thankfully, Apartheid finally came to an end; the greatest anti-Apartheid leader, Nelson Mandela, was elected president and ushered in a momentary period of calm and forbearance. But after his one term in office, the country descended into a sea of corruption and incompetence, leaving South Africa, as it is today, at a dangerous precipice. South Africa’s leading scholars and analysts have painted an increasingly grim picture of a still young democratic order, which cannot help but contribute to a sense of dismay about the possibilities for democratic development. For example, Xolela Mangcu, a South African sociologist and journalist, penned his condemnation of the new order in a 2014 book titled The Arrogance of Power: South Africa’s Leadership Meltdown.16 This was a sequel to his 2008 book, To the Brink.17 Alex Boraine, a White politician who helped negotiate the terms of the country’s historic democratic transition behind the scenes and worked closely with Archbishop Desmond Tutu to manage a national reconciliation process in the aftermath of Apartheid, was initially bullish on what could be accomplished. Nonetheless, in his 2014 book What’s Gone Wrong? South Africa on the Brink of Failed Statehood, he shared the notion that things are simply falling apart. Both Mangcu and Boraine recount examples of venal politicians acting in narrow self-interest to the detriment of the greater public good. For example, according to Boraine, “If corruption were an event in the Olympic Games, the ANC government would be festooned with silver and bronze—and perhaps a few gold medals as well.”18 Anton Harber, former editor of the leading South African newsweekly, the Mail & Guardian, documented his riveting and powerful investigation of the politically, economically, and socially dysfunctional township of Diepsloot, which lies on the edge of Johannesburg, not very far from Mogale City. In it, he makes the case: “You want to see South Africa … come to Diepsloot.”19 Foreign scholars have frequently amplified this “glass mostly empty” view of South African democracy. For example, the British university professor Nic Cheeseman analyzed the range of African experiments with democratic rule since the 1990s in his important book, Democracy in Africa (2015). With respect to South Africa, he describes only what has gone wrong since 1994—pointing out real disappointments in terms of government AIDS policy, xenophobia, and other foibles (as I also recount in the chapters that follow). One would not be able to read that book and fathom that almost anything had been accomplished during the period of ANC government.20 From the Zambian economist and best-selling author Dambisa Moyo21 to the British journalist and political analyst R. W. Johnson22 to the foreign correspondents covering South Africa at the New York Times and other leading international news publications, close observers inside and outside the country have identified a range of problems that contribute to a shared understanding of collective failure. And White South Africans—those who left the country, as well as those who stayed—are frequent interlocutors to American and European audiences. Many of them have promoted what I call the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to anyone who will listen. That is, they point to the country to the north, once known as Southern Rhodesia, which was also ruled as a White settler society with an Apartheid-style government. It is a country that similarly experienced a war for liberation and a transition to Black rule a little more than a decade earlier than South Africa did. Under President Mugabe, the country, now called Zimbabwe, went from being a robust exporter of agricultural products to one characterized by hyperinflation, food shortages, corruption, and wide pockets of state failure. And according to this formulation, South Africa is going down the same path. In this final analysis, it is hard not to detect a racist logic—that Black rule inevitably leads to failure. The subtext is often, “You may not have liked Apartheid, but it was better than this” and sometimes more explicitly, “This is what happens when they take over.” And on the day of the 2019 election, when I interviewed dozens of voters around Mogale City, many angrily raised concerns about jobs, lack of basic services, and crime. They were particularly incensed about the persistence of reports of government corruption. Viewed together, very different commentators—ranging from unapologetic Apartheid beneficiaries to former anti-Apartheid activists, from all racial backgrounds—have painted an alarmingly negative portrait of the state of South Africa. In turn, my point is that such a picture can be dangerously misleading if it is presented on its own with the implicit or explicit caption, “This is what democracy delivered.”23 To be clear, I do not dispute the veracity of reports of bureaucratic failure, malfeasance, violence, or abject poverty. I have sat through load-shedding power outages myself; on many trips and tours of South Africa, I have observed the persistent inequality and squalor of many parts of the country firsthand and have analyzed the data confirming broader problems. On various trips, I have worried about my own personal safety, cognizant of the prevalence of violence. I know and trust many of the journalists, scholars, and civil society organizations that focus on these problems. Rather, my concern is that if we take a larger macro-historical perspective—trying to summarize what happened after one of the world’s most anticipated political transitions—we need to present such facts in context regarding what happened in the past and what has been feasible given local and international constraints and challenges—and, most importantly, with respect to what has gone right. In this sense, I follow more in the footsteps of the late Hans Rosling, who urged us to consider the big picture of global human health and development in order to recognize that even when things sometimes seem to be getting worse, they are actually getting better.24 Ultimately, the final judgment about whether the evidence illustrates a case of a glass half full or half empty is in the eye of the beholder. However, I believe that the influential group of interlocutors I just described has overwhelmingly focused on the problems and largely ignored the accomplishments evident in post-Apartheid South Africa. Perhaps this is not surprising given the tendency of human judgment to be characterized by “negativity bias.” That is, the devaluing power of bad things tends to be greater than the redeeming power of good ones.25 Relatedly, we do not expect news outlets to report on the millions of airplanes that land safely—only on the ones that do not, even though those extraordinary stories of statistically outlying events can contribute to a false sense of insecurity. Moreover, democratic practice frequently incentivizes negative over positive appraisal because by design, democratic government opens up channels for dissent and for challenging the exercise of power. Even when they are not governing, opposition parties and social groups, abetted by an open media, can cajole and pressure the government to rethink or revise its policies. Critical dialogue can help citizens to imagine what to even wish for. These are virtues. However, in so doing, democratic practice feeds a degree of discontent. It puts a spotlight on problems, particularly on malfeasance, and it gives special attention to those who are suffering and/or articulating their frustrations. And with the advent of social media, such tendencies are broadcast and shared with greater speed than ever thought imaginable. While such sharing of information plays an important and positive role in driving accountability and social justice, it can lead observers to focus on shortcomings over progress. In turn, social and political commentators must, at least on occasion, take stock of a fuller substantive and historical record in a more holistic manner. In fact, one of the inherent challenges of democracy is that because it is rooted in competition and transparency, citizens and actors are privy to more information about the failings of government performance and leadership, contributing to depressed perceptions relative to what they might experience if facing otherwise similar problems in systems where information and critical voices were absent. One is freer to complain louder in a democracy. Political competition, the media, protests, activists, courts, calls for redress, and dissenting voices are not the problem in South Africa. They are the essence of democracy. Fiery words from political actors—including those that tell the ruling party or president, “Democracy is broken”—may reflect just the opposite. Critical political discourse in democratic practice needs to be separated from evaluation of the quality of democracy itself. This is a subtle but important point. Throughout my research on democratic South Africa, I have found people shouting, more or less, that “everything is awful here,” which would not be possible in strictly authoritarian countries from North Korea to China where everyone must say, on fear of prosecution, “It’s great here.” With respect to the latter, one scholar has aptly observed that the sudden collapse of the East European communist regimes caught many observers by surprise because under this form of authoritarian rule, citizens did not publicly express their views—rather, they engaged in preference falsification.26 For democracy to survive, citizens must ultimately be convinced of its value. And it is certainly conceivable that democracy might not work best. Many organizations—households, firms, universities—operate successfully without truly democratic rules for leadership selection or everyday operation. We should not promote democracy simply as a matter of blind faith. Even the most ardent defenders of democracy point us to certain key limitations, which often prove frustrating to citizens. Two of the most important modern theorists of democratic development offered warnings at the onset of the “Third Wave” of democratization, of which South Africa was a part, concerning what might go wrong and what citizens might prefer instead. Describing several paradoxes of democracy, Larry Diamond observed that in trying to represent diverse interests, democratic governments often move slowly; and compromise can undermine the prospects for effective solutions.27 And Robert Dahl pointed out that citizens may frequently wonder whether they would do better with informed “guardians,” who are experts at governing because of their superior knowledge or virtue, rather than those who convince the citizenry of their credentials.28 Despite real and perceived problems, we must remind ourselves of democracy’s value, and that value may differ somewhat according to the arc of a country’s political development. Democratic retreat will surely continue unless the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of the democratic project can be credibly established and communicated. Yes, we need to recognize what has gone wrong. Nonetheless, South Africa has the potential to demonstrate to democracy skeptics the world over what is possible in a highly unequal, diverse, post–civil war polity. To focus solely on the disappointments is to miss the bigger picture. How to Know? If we are not going to rely simply on the subjective judgments of citizens and local observers and commentators, how does one evaluate the success of a democracy? Indeed, the motivating query for this book—has the post-Apartheid democratic project been successful?—is imprecise and unanswerable without more direction. The first response to that question must be, “Compared to what?” If you were asked whether twenty-three minutes is a good time for a particular road race, it would not be possible to answer that until you knew how long the race was, under what conditions it was taking place, and who else was running. Importantly, one would also want to know what was expected of that runner before the race began. In the same way, my own conclusions about successful democratic development are based on attempts to establish reasonable benchmarks across time and space. Because the outcomes are complex and not easily measured, I use a wide variety of data sources, ranging from my own personal interviews and observations across several decades, a wealth of secondary sources, newspaper archives, more than a dozen individual-level large-sample surveys, including a few I conducted myself, and administrative data from the South African government, research organizations, and various international organizations. Where possible I try to highlight convergences and divergences between these different sources of data and the relationship between subjective perceptions and outcomes that can be measured more objectively. To assess democratic performance using such data, I deploy a few key strategies. First, we need fair comparisons. I try to understand what has been achieved relative to the past (especially as detailed in chapter 4) and compared with other countries that share important similarities (chapters 6–8), especially, but not only, other African and other Upper-middle-income countries. Given South Africa’s political history and using the experiences of many other countries as the basis for expectations, I show that a lot more failure is what we ought to have expected. As a highly unequal society with a harsh history of oppression by a White minority and a long tradition of violence across groups throughout its history, the hard reality is that violence and bloodshed could easily have been the defining features of post-Apartheid South Africa. Indeed, we need to think about the proverbial dogs that didn’t bark to appreciate the history that in fact transpired: genocide akin to Rwanda’s or Yugoslavia’s, economic collapse akin to Venezuela’s, or actual state failure akin to Zimbabwe’s—the latter two countries faced inflation, currency collapse, and food shortages. Second, it is useful to fix some goalposts, lest we create a framework of shifting expectations in which success is not theoretically possible. We can be guided by prior declarations of hopes for a successful democracy, particularly as made by those who enjoyed popular support during periods of political resistance. For example, liberation leaders set forth demands and expectations in the Freedom Charter of 1955 and in the final negotiation for a new democracy, as detailed in the preamble to the 1996 constitution (discussed in chapter 5). Across more than forty years, a key set of hopes remained remarkably consistent, including to develop a democratic and open government, to improve the material quality of life for citizens, and to build unity while redressing past indignities. During these periods, and even earlier in the twentieth century, liberation leaders placed a heavy focus on the protection of basic human rights. Finally, with respect to these various perspectives, we need to consider a diverse range of actors and stakeholders in their lived realities to assess how they have participated in and have been affected by the new political dispensation. In this respect, while I do consider the national picture, I also decided to focus my attention on a single municipality, about which I had no preconceptions of its successes or failures, and which I selected as a plausible reflection of the larger South African story. There is a saying that “all politics is local,” but in South Africa, it might be more apt to argue that “all politics is national,” in the sense that national issues are constantly played out in local arenas, both through centralized political parties that control local government positions and, perhaps more importantly, because the everyday concerns of South Africans frequently relate quite directly to the country’s national history. And this is certainly true in the place I studied, Mogale City Local Municipality. Of course, Mogale’s story, like South Africa’s story, like that of any place, is unique in certain ways. But a focus on this one area—a case within a case—allowed me to dig more deeply into the lives of South Africans, to learn how they relate to one another and why they express the views and take the actions they do. I wanted to hear how people discuss issues, form their attitudes, participate in politics, and simply coexist and to examine the extent to which old patterns have changed or stayed the same, within the confines of a relatively well-bounded geography. Because I was largely unfamiliar with this municipality prior to conducting the research for this book, it allowed me to test ideas that I had generated from observations of other locales in South Africa. And while Mogale City Local Municipality is neither the economic nor the political capital of South Africa, and not even one of the country’s major metropolitan municipalities, its story is both representative of and in some cases surprisingly central to the larger national picture, including in the ways various forms of racial and ethnic conflict played out here, the building of Apartheid, and its eventual fall. Like much of the rest of Africa, South Africa is rapidly urbanizing, and approximately two-thirds of South Africans now live in urban areas. About half of all South Africans reside in midsized local municipalities, ranging from 100,000 to 700,000 people, and Mogale City sits right in the middle of that range. And in recent years, South African politics has become more competitive, particularly in urban areas, a pattern also reflected in Mogale City where in the 2016 local election the ANC lost its competitive edge, slipping below 50 percent of votes cast.29 TABLE 3.1. Racial Demographics 2016, Mogale City and South Africa, Compared Population Group Mogale City Local Municipality Gauteng Province South Africa Black African 76% 80% 81% White 21% 14% 8% Indian or Asian 2% 3% 2% Coloured < 1% 3% 9% Total Population 383,864 13,399,724 55,653,654 Source: SA_CommSurv_2016. My hope was to find a place that might be a plausible microcosm of the larger South African story. And in Mogale City, I found just that: Mogale is ethnically and racially diverse. However, its demographics do not quite reflect the overall national picture. As shown in table 3.1, although the White population is still a minority in Mogale, its population share there is substantially larger, while the Coloured population is substantially smaller (virtually nonexistent), relative to the country as a whole. Much of this disparity owes to the fact that Coloureds live disproportionately in the western part of the country, and Whites are more concentrated in urban areas, especially in Gauteng Province—which contains a quarter of the country’s population and where the racial demographics are much more similar to Mogale’s. What They Got: Dignified Development In the remaining chapters, I will show that the heroic, multigenerational effort to build democracy in South Africa has been extremely successful and delivered important returns to that society. In just twenty-five years, elected, Black-led governments have made remarkable gains in terms of dignified development. That is, citizens have been made more visible and have been increasingly recognized for their equal value as humans through the various institutions of democratic practice, which in modern times have included constitutional commitments to material benefits and respectful treatment for all individuals. Moreover, the logic of political competition has created incentives for elected officials to provide related policies and practices, and this has vastly extended the share of the population living in a manner that could be recognized as a dignified existence. Previously, a majority of the population faced humiliation at the hands of a government controlled by a racial minority.30 Let me be clear that what I mean by democracy is a political system in which all adult citizens can participate in the selection of leaders through elections and enjoy the opportunity to influence how government works by means of representation and civil expressions of their wants and needs. In this sense, democracy is about process. While my central claim is that democracy has favored dignified development in South Africa, I cannot conclude that the routinization of democratic practice is sufficient for this outcome as a general rule. The world is filled with many democratic polities, replete with competitive elections, in which large numbers of citizens feel neither respected nor autonomous. However, a degree of democracy is almost certainly necessary: the sublimation of any real popular choice concerning political leadership or government implies a fundamental lack of respect for citizens’ views and judgments. Relatedly, economic growth is generally neither necessary nor sufficient to experience bouts of dignified development. As we’ve seen in recent years all around the world, the components of economic growth may be unequally distributed in society, offering little for those who face undignified or humiliating treatment; and in fact, if growth exacerbates inequalities, it may have a deleterious effect on dignified treatment. Moreover, redistributive policies and practices in the form of transfers within and across countries may effectively improve the quality of life for many, even in the absence of growth. To be clear, equitable growth can be an engine of dignified development, particularly as people crave jobs, material goods, and the rewards associated with investment. However, if we prioritize a concern for human dignity, the notion that all humans are inherently valuable and deserve respectful treatment, we should not assume that economic growth ought to be the key outcome of interest and that it will naturally benefit the least well-off. While I share the generally optimistic portrait of the value of democracy documented by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their influential work, Why Nations Fail, I soften their focus on material outcomes such as prosperity in order to bring respectful treatment into our field of vision.31 Finally, dignified development is clearly related to broader notions of human development, including health, material well-being, and education. Among others, the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, the acclaimed philosopher Martha Nussbaum, and the United Nations Development Program32 have all described human development in terms of human capabilities, which in turn are critical sources of independence and autonomy. Although these are key components of a dignified life, most research on human development continues to portray citizens as independent and almost atomized individuals. To understand whether people are treated with respect by other citizens and by government, and protected from humiliation, we must also focus on social relations, including patterns of inclusion and exclusion in everyday life. My goal here is not to develop a complete theory of the conditions under which democracy affects dignified development—nor to test such propositions on a global scale—but to focus on this relationship in the particular case of South Africa. In the chapters that follow, I describe the evidence to support this particular claim and conclude by reflecting on whether the pattern might hold in other contexts. I start, in chapter 4, by describing the shaky historical foundations for both democracy and dignified development on the eve of the South African transition in the early 1990s. Subsequent gains should be seen against the remarkable indignities leveled in the prior three centuries of this diverse and divided society. Because it is a human tendency to adjust to current conditions and to recalibrate expectations, it is important to properly set the stage for the democratic era from the perspective of what came before. Next, in chapter 5, I turn to a description of the particular democratic institutions adopted in South Africa in the mid-1990s. Although laws and formal documents do not fully describe democratic practice, they are critical and necessary components and, in many ways, the most transportable aspects of democratic government that can be recommended when needed. By contrast, one cannot will another polity to have a particular set of leaders or mix of civil society organizations, even if those play central roles in democratic success. I am less concerned with the effects of the specific actors at the center of political life than with the processes that have constrained their behaviors. Then, I describe the emergence of dignified development during the post-Apartheid period, and I attempt to show that the very nature of democratic representation—especially South African institutions that are structured on the principle of proportionality—has provided opportunities for people to be heard, to be recognized, and to be valued. Political parties have been forced to seek out the previously marginalized to earn their votes. A protected judiciary has allowed those who have not been treated fairly to seek justice. And the logic of democratic politics has helped to reinforce the notion that citizens are not subjects. In no case is the record in Mogale City or in South Africa writ large an unqualified success. Yet, there is much to celebrate. In chapter 6, I detail the challenges and trends in democratic practice itself. A key goal of generations of political activists and liberation leaders was simply a democratic polity open to all, irrespective of race, gender, or any other category. From this perspective, democracy is not simply a means to an end but an outcome that is intrinsically valued.33 Against tremendous odds, South Africans developed a robust democratic system that in many ways is a model for modern, liberal democratic orders. And despite warnings that the ANC would overtake the country with a one-party state, the system became more competitive. The attempt to build democracy out of division clearly succeeded. Citizens have been able to choose their leaders, to influence policy, and to hold elected officials accountable for poor performance. Although politicians and bureaucrats have inevitably attempted to engage in various corrupt practices, democratic institutions have shined a light on such practices and, at least to a degree, constrained the behaviors of political leaders. In that chapter, I reflect on the contradictions of democratic process and the realities of everyday violence. While democratically elected governments may use violence or threat of violence to maintain order, ultimately, the promise of democracy is that differences of opinion can be resolved through elections, deliberations, court judgments, and other nonviolent means. As I discuss, several scholars studying South Africa and other countries in the Global South have introduced the notion of “violent democracy” to draw our attention to the co-occurrence of the phenomena. While agreeing with the need to keep a careful eye on violent behavior, I view the proposed terminology as a case of modifying the definition of democracy to a point that it sheds its core meaning.34 Instead, I opt to evaluate how the extent and patterns of violence have changed since the advent of multiracial democracy. And if politics gets to the point where citizens are no longer able to make choices or to provide input free from the direct influence of violent pressures, we will have to declare that the country should not be described as a democracy. In chapter 7, I focus on material outcomes. The poorest and most vulnerable have benefited from the provision of basic services and infrastructure, including access to water, electricity, sanitation, and housing, to social support grants, and to improved health care and education. To be certain, expectations have quickly ratcheted up, and citizens have good reason to decry waning quality and to demand universal access, but these cannot minimize the fact that in many areas of social and welfare support, South Africa is a global leader, and democratic practice has underpinned and reinforced these policies. Democratic pressures in the form of elections, the media, and courts have all weighed on elected government officials to deliver, even as they frequently have been tempted to divert material resources toward themselves. In chapter 8, I look more directly at the nature of human interactions. To what extent have citizens and government officials treated one another, especially the most vulnerable, with respect? And how do people perceive such treatment? Apartheid and the centuries of institutionalized White supremacy that came before were examples of harsh indignities, and while related to the other points made in prior chapters, the increased scope of respect extended to people who were so deprived has been a remarkable transformation. As I discuss, one way of creating a sense of shared worth is through the idea of shared belonging, for example, through some degree of unification, such as nation-building. I conclude by returning to the 2019 election—where I left off at the end of chapter 2—assessing the results in light of the findings highlighted in earlier chapters and other cases, including the American record in the aftermath of segregation. Although I am a social scientist, and I marshal various forms of largely descriptive social scientific evidence, the questions posed in this book cannot be answered definitively in the manner that social scientists generally prefer. First, I can only describe plausible links between democratic practice and the key outcomes I describe, but I cannot definitively show that such outcomes would have been different under an alternative political arrangement. Moreover, the question of whether democratic practice, with all its warts and wrinkles, does deliver real value in a divided society is a subjective one, and my goal here is to present what I think is a fair picture for arriving at an answer. In no way can I conclude that democracy will always have salutary effects in South Africa, let alone the same effect in other societies. Others may read the record on dignified development in a different way, and arrive at a different final tally, one that puts more weight on current deficits, especially with respect to unemployment, inequality, and violence. Notwithstanding these important caveats, my own conclusion is that the first quarter century of South African democracy serves as a positive model of what is possible in the future and for other divided societies.",

      "content": "3 The Value of Democracy THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS I raise in this book concern the value of democracy. Specifically, how did political competition and the structure of government change once South Africa adopted truly democratic institutions that incorporated a previously excluded racial majority? Did the quality of people’s lives improve or deteriorate, and in what ways, during this period? And can we plausibly link such changes to democracy itself, to extract more general lessons about the prospects for democratic government in diverse and divided societies? The portrait of the election campaign I painted in the prior two chapters revealed a wide range of perspectives on such questions. Of course, as South African voters went to the polls in May 2019, they were making a choice about what they wanted for the future. Yet, the moment also marked an important opportunity for them to look back and consider whether the prior quarter century of multiracial democracy had been a success. The long struggle against Apartheid government had been a quest for liberty, for freedom from domination by a minority, and to build a more just society. Did those who worked so hard to bring about change get what they wanted? Or were they experiencing a form of buyer’s remorse? Was this really the best solution to institutionalized White supremacy? The ruling ANC party could not simply take a victory lap. The party’s leaders had long been confronting a string of protests of the kind I witnessed in Krugersdorp, frequently organized by their own members. The opposition parties, ranging from a Black nationalist left to White autonomists on the right, were relentless in their critiques. With a few exceptions, citizens seemed more inclined to discuss what had gone wrong than what had gone right. And as the campaign wound down, I considered the fact that in recent years, South African colleagues and acquaintances from a range of backgrounds had begun to express a surprising sentiment, one that occasionally appears in print in serious media outlets: “What this country needs … is a benevolent dictator!”1 Ordinary South Africans had become increasingly disillusioned with democracy.2 In one survey conducted at the end of 2016, 54 percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the way democracy was working.3 And by 2018, the share of “dissatisfieds” had grown to a full 57 percent of the population. In a summary report from Afrobarometer, whose survey data I analyze throughout this book, they cautioned, “Afrobarometer survey findings from mid-2018 show support for democracy weakening and acceptance of authoritarian alternatives growing.”4 It left me wondering: Was South African democracy actually at risk? Listening to the rallies, the campaign speeches, and the incessant commentary on talk radio in and around Mogale City during the first half of 2019, one could not help but be struck by the distinct scent of frustration. Not just with the present but with the whole post-Apartheid project. Even the ANC’s own representatives seemed more apologetic than proud. The expressed antipathies of White South Africans were already very familiar to me. As a White man, I have always had the easiest access to White South Africans. Many unabashedly told me that they longed for the past. “They made this country into a ball of shit,” explained one man, about my age, whom I met while dining at a restaurant in Muldersdrift one evening on my first trip to Mogale. He and his girlfriend were sitting at the table next to mine and they must have heard my American accent while I was placing an order, and like so many in the area, they were friendly and happy to share their political views and reflections with me. The culprit for the country’s decline, in this man’s view, was the Black ANC government. I would hear the same from most of the other White residents I met while touring the area and had heard the same for years in other parts of the country. What I did find more surprising, perhaps even offensive, was the man’s suggestion to me to “ask the Black people around here. They’ll tell you the same thing, that life was better in the old days.” It would be like suggesting that African Americans preferred life under segregation. On the other hand, only with solid data could I debunk such a claim. As part of my research, I conducted a Historical Memories Survey among adults in Mogale City—the results of which I detail in subsequent chapters—and asked citizens to compare their current overall quality of life (theirs and that of their family) to life in the Apartheid days. Is it better today? Worse today? Or about the same? The White responses were fairly predictable: 55 percent said life was worse today. Many Whites truly yearned for the time of White rule. If a politician had appealed to them with the slogan “Make South Africa Great Again,” they would have embraced the message with open arms. To my great disbelief, perhaps shock, it turned out that the White man I had met in Muldersdrift had correctly predicted Black public sentiment and I had been way off the mark in my skeptical reaction to his claims. In fact, a full 50 percent of Black residents surveyed said that life was better then, as compared with 40 percent who said things were better now.5 After months of talking to citizens and leaders around town, I had heard plenty of negative perspectives, complaints about government, crime, lack of jobs, and so forth.6 However, I had not expected that this would be the conclusion of so many in a random sample of forty-and-over adults from a municipality where Apartheid had been harshly enforced. If even Black South Africans were unhappy with the democracy that they had struggled to produce over so many generations, might they consider something else? Only a few years ago, the notion of citizens voluntarily forgoing democracy for authoritarian rule might have seemed radical and unimaginable, but these concerns have become particularly salient because for several years we have been witnessing a global retreat in democratic government.7 Seemingly stable democracies have given way to more authoritarian styles of rule. When my political science colleagues Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, and further developed their argument in a 2018 book, How Democracies Die,8 they provided a powerful wake-up call by connecting the dots to illustrate an emerging pattern: in the United States and in many other countries, the key foundations of democracy were being undone not through military coups or armed insurrections but at the ballot box. Citizens were increasingly choosing leaders who, in their populist bravado, were saying, “I alone can fix everything,” as Donald Trump said on the campaign trail in 2016. Given real and perceived problems in those societies, such calls were warmly received by many voters, and once in power, these leaders have worked to change the rules of the game to help entrench their power, undermining democratic institutions. And perhaps as both a cause and a consequence of such changes, even surprising numbers of Americans no longer take for granted democracy as the “only game in town,”9 imagining other types of political systems as preferable. Many reasons have been offered for the more recent rise of populist authoritarianism that has caused something of a reverse wave away from democracy, but among the most compelling explanations is that large shares of citizens in democratic countries are increasingly dissatisfied with their lot, in large part due to persistent and growing economic insecurity alongside perceived threats to status owing to immigration and other demographic trends.10 Ethnic and racial diversity can provide fodder for frustration and scapegoating. Under such conditions, populists promise swift and assured gains, with little tolerance for “special interests” in the form of ethnic minorities. I argue that the case of South Africa between 1994 and 2019 offers a compelling alternative to populist authoritarianism—a positive model of what democracy can offer truly divided societies: peace, the ability to influence leaders, increased material prosperity especially for the poor, and, ultimately, greater respect for human dignity. These were remarkable achievements in light of the country’s history, and the findings on dignity in particular help paint a fuller view of the value of democracy itself. While the rhetoric of everyday politics can be dismissive of the South African record, a more sober and considered evaluation reveals a democracy that has worked better than is often appreciated—by both pundits and citizens alike. In the remainder of this chapter, I describe why the question of valuing South Africa’s democratic project is a critical one; I outline the approach I took to answer this question; and I summarize the central findings detailed in the subsequent chapters. I highlight the profound value and remarkable achievements of South Africa’s first quarter century of multiracial, democratic government in terms of what I call dignified development, while recognizing the enormity of the problems that remain and that new challenges have emerged. Why Ask? Throughout modern history, historians, philosophers, and social scientists have all reflected on the value of democracy for the human condition. In so doing, they have considered whether democracy is intrinsically valuable, simply as an expression of freedom. And they have asked whether it leads to better outcomes for society. For example, does democracy promote economic development better than other systems of government?11 Is democracy good for the poor?12 Such questions are routinely asked and answered in more general terms, with respect to large numbers of polities. However, I focus on the value of democracy for the single country of South Africa. In this “case study” approach,13 I draw on many relevant comparisons, but I believe the narrowed attention is warranted. To begin with, South Africa is an intrinsically important case. Although only about the twenty-fifth most populous country in the world, the country’s plight has long been central to global political movements and ideas about justice and democracy. In the late twentieth century, perhaps no single political issue galvanized people around the world more than the idea that Apartheid government must come to an end. Apartheid, or apartness, was a full-blown system of social engineering relentlessly implemented on the southern tip of the African continent. It effectively relegated a Black majority to third-class citizenship. In turn, songs, plays, movies, and books captured the injustices of this system, and the very term “Apartheid” came to symbolize the essence of injustice, a retrograde form of internal colonial rule. Over the course of three decades, students at American and other foreign universities followed the lead of their South African counterparts, protesting and staging massive “sit-ins” inside and outside administrative offices to demand divestment from companies doing business in South Africa. Even a youthful Barack Obama cut his teeth in public speaking by railing against the Apartheid regime as a student at Occidental College in 1981, an opportunity he used to also shed light on racial issues in the United States.14 The organizers of major sporting events, including the International Olympic Committee, barred South Africans from competition. The South African government and its privileged White citizenry became global pariahs, while its Black citizens, and especially their famed political leaders—who sat in jail or lived in exile—earned the empathy and support of allies around the world. Sometimes for good and other times for bad, outsiders have always played an important role in the South African story. Citizens and political leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Cuba, and the Soviet Union, and particularly from countries across the African continent, were all intimately involved and/or interested in the long-standing conflict over Apartheid-style government. Depending on their political orientation and their own views on America’s racial order, American political leaders took different sides in support of or against White government. Moreover, while South Africa may be somewhat extreme in the extent to which it combines enormous ethnic and racial diversity along with high levels of income and wealth inequality and a history of conflict, it is not alone in these regards. American history echoes many strands of South Africa’s, an idea expertly documented by George Fredrickson in his classic text, White Supremacy.15 Not just the United States but also Israel, Australia, Brazil, India, Kenya, and many other countries face similar conditions for building cohesion and prosperity given the overlap of diversity and inequality. The degree to which South Africa underwent an extremely deliberate political transition offers possibilities for thinking about how to address such challenges in other contexts. For those interested in the making and breaking of racial boundaries, ultimately one must confront the South African example. As we know now, the formal Apartheid system was dissolved through the removal of discriminatory laws and institutions in the early 1990s. Nelson Mandela went from prisoner to president. South Africa was welcomed back into the global community with open arms, and external scrutiny turned toward other hot spots around the globe. Like dozens of other countries at approximately the same time, South Africa adopted a set of democratic institutions to select its leaders and make its policies. Against this important backdrop, a wide range of interested observers deserve to know what happened. Was it simply “case closed” in the sense that there was a problem, it was fixed, and now it’s time to move on? Given widespread interest, it is important that we get this case right with respect to the success or failure of democracy writ large. Whether South Africa is a case of success or failure has enormous implications for how we think about the promise of democracy more generally. A key concern that motivated me to write this book was my own appraisal that the more recent political history has been mischaracterized. In fact, a dominant narrative argues that the post-Apartheid period has been one of great expectations followed by profound disappointment. In summary form: thankfully, Apartheid finally came to an end; the greatest anti-Apartheid leader, Nelson Mandela, was elected president and ushered in a momentary period of calm and forbearance. But after his one term in office, the country descended into a sea of corruption and incompetence, leaving South Africa, as it is today, at a dangerous precipice. South Africa’s leading scholars and analysts have painted an increasingly grim picture of a still young democratic order, which cannot help but contribute to a sense of dismay about the possibilities for democratic development. For example, Xolela Mangcu, a South African sociologist and journalist, penned his condemnation of the new order in a 2014 book titled The Arrogance of Power: South Africa’s Leadership Meltdown.16 This was a sequel to his 2008 book, To the Brink.17 Alex Boraine, a White politician who helped negotiate the terms of the country’s historic democratic transition behind the scenes and worked closely with Archbishop Desmond Tutu to manage a national reconciliation process in the aftermath of Apartheid, was initially bullish on what could be accomplished. Nonetheless, in his 2014 book What’s Gone Wrong? South Africa on the Brink of Failed Statehood, he shared the notion that things are simply falling apart. Both Mangcu and Boraine recount examples of venal politicians acting in narrow self-interest to the detriment of the greater public good. For example, according to Boraine, “If corruption were an event in the Olympic Games, the ANC government would be festooned with silver and bronze—and perhaps a few gold medals as well.”18 Anton Harber, former editor of the leading South African newsweekly, the Mail & Guardian, documented his riveting and powerful investigation of the politically, economically, and socially dysfunctional township of Diepsloot, which lies on the edge of Johannesburg, not very far from Mogale City. In it, he makes the case: “You want to see South Africa … come to Diepsloot.”19 Foreign scholars have frequently amplified this “glass mostly empty” view of South African democracy. For example, the British university professor Nic Cheeseman analyzed the range of African experiments with democratic rule since the 1990s in his important book, Democracy in Africa (2015). With respect to South Africa, he describes only what has gone wrong since 1994—pointing out real disappointments in terms of government AIDS policy, xenophobia, and other foibles (as I also recount in the chapters that follow). One would not be able to read that book and fathom that almost anything had been accomplished during the period of ANC government.20 From the Zambian economist and best-selling author Dambisa Moyo21 to the British journalist and political analyst R. W. Johnson22 to the foreign correspondents covering South Africa at the New York Times and other leading international news publications, close observers inside and outside the country have identified a range of problems that contribute to a shared understanding of collective failure. And White South Africans—those who left the country, as well as those who stayed—are frequent interlocutors to American and European audiences. Many of them have promoted what I call the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to anyone who will listen. That is, they point to the country to the north, once known as Southern Rhodesia, which was also ruled as a White settler society with an Apartheid-style government. It is a country that similarly experienced a war for liberation and a transition to Black rule a little more than a decade earlier than South Africa did. Under President Mugabe, the country, now called Zimbabwe, went from being a robust exporter of agricultural products to one characterized by hyperinflation, food shortages, corruption, and wide pockets of state failure. And according to this formulation, South Africa is going down the same path. In this final analysis, it is hard not to detect a racist logic—that Black rule inevitably leads to failure. The subtext is often, “You may not have liked Apartheid, but it was better than this” and sometimes more explicitly, “This is what happens when they take over.” And on the day of the 2019 election, when I interviewed dozens of voters around Mogale City, many angrily raised concerns about jobs, lack of basic services, and crime. They were particularly incensed about the persistence of reports of government corruption. Viewed together, very different commentators—ranging from unapologetic Apartheid beneficiaries to former anti-Apartheid activists, from all racial backgrounds—have painted an alarmingly negative portrait of the state of South Africa. In turn, my point is that such a picture can be dangerously misleading if it is presented on its own with the implicit or explicit caption, “This is what democracy delivered.”23 To be clear, I do not dispute the veracity of reports of bureaucratic failure, malfeasance, violence, or abject poverty. I have sat through load-shedding power outages myself; on many trips and tours of South Africa, I have observed the persistent inequality and squalor of many parts of the country firsthand and have analyzed the data confirming broader problems. On various trips, I have worried about my own personal safety, cognizant of the prevalence of violence. I know and trust many of the journalists, scholars, and civil society organizations that focus on these problems. Rather, my concern is that if we take a larger macro-historical perspective—trying to summarize what happened after one of the world’s most anticipated political transitions—we need to present such facts in context regarding what happened in the past and what has been feasible given local and international constraints and challenges—and, most importantly, with respect to what has gone right. In this sense, I follow more in the footsteps of the late Hans Rosling, who urged us to consider the big picture of global human health and development in order to recognize that even when things sometimes seem to be getting worse, they are actually getting better.24 Ultimately, the final judgment about whether the evidence illustrates a case of a glass half full or half empty is in the eye of the beholder. However, I believe that the influential group of interlocutors I just described has overwhelmingly focused on the problems and largely ignored the accomplishments evident in post-Apartheid South Africa. Perhaps this is not surprising given the tendency of human judgment to be characterized by “negativity bias.” That is, the devaluing power of bad things tends to be greater than the redeeming power of good ones.25 Relatedly, we do not expect news outlets to report on the millions of airplanes that land safely—only on the ones that do not, even though those extraordinary stories of statistically outlying events can contribute to a false sense of insecurity. Moreover, democratic practice frequently incentivizes negative over positive appraisal because by design, democratic government opens up channels for dissent and for challenging the exercise of power. Even when they are not governing, opposition parties and social groups, abetted by an open media, can cajole and pressure the government to rethink or revise its policies. Critical dialogue can help citizens to imagine what to even wish for. These are virtues. However, in so doing, democratic practice feeds a degree of discontent. It puts a spotlight on problems, particularly on malfeasance, and it gives special attention to those who are suffering and/or articulating their frustrations. And with the advent of social media, such tendencies are broadcast and shared with greater speed than ever thought imaginable. While such sharing of information plays an important and positive role in driving accountability and social justice, it can lead observers to focus on shortcomings over progress. In turn, social and political commentators must, at least on occasion, take stock of a fuller substantive and historical record in a more holistic manner. In fact, one of the inherent challenges of democracy is that because it is rooted in competition and transparency, citizens and actors are privy to more information about the failings of government performance and leadership, contributing to depressed perceptions relative to what they might experience if facing otherwise similar problems in systems where information and critical voices were absent. One is freer to complain louder in a democracy. Political competition, the media, protests, activists, courts, calls for redress, and dissenting voices are not the problem in South Africa. They are the essence of democracy. Fiery words from political actors—including those that tell the ruling party or president, “Democracy is broken”—may reflect just the opposite. Critical political discourse in democratic practice needs to be separated from evaluation of the quality of democracy itself. This is a subtle but important point. Throughout my research on democratic South Africa, I have found people shouting, more or less, that “everything is awful here,” which would not be possible in strictly authoritarian countries from North Korea to China where everyone must say, on fear of prosecution, “It’s great here.” With respect to the latter, one scholar has aptly observed that the sudden collapse of the East European communist regimes caught many observers by surprise because under this form of authoritarian rule, citizens did not publicly express their views—rather, they engaged in preference falsification.26 For democracy to survive, citizens must ultimately be convinced of its value. And it is certainly conceivable that democracy might not work best. Many organizations—households, firms, universities—operate successfully without truly democratic rules for leadership selection or everyday operation. We should not promote democracy simply as a matter of blind faith. Even the most ardent defenders of democracy point us to certain key limitations, which often prove frustrating to citizens. Two of the most important modern theorists of democratic development offered warnings at the onset of the “Third Wave” of democratization, of which South Africa was a part, concerning what might go wrong and what citizens might prefer instead. Describing several paradoxes of democracy, Larry Diamond observed that in trying to represent diverse interests, democratic governments often move slowly; and compromise can undermine the prospects for effective solutions.27 And Robert Dahl pointed out that citizens may frequently wonder whether they would do better with informed “guardians,” who are experts at governing because of their superior knowledge or virtue, rather than those who convince the citizenry of their credentials.28 Despite real and perceived problems, we must remind ourselves of democracy’s value, and that value may differ somewhat according to the arc of a country’s political development. Democratic retreat will surely continue unless the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of the democratic project can be credibly established and communicated. Yes, we need to recognize what has gone wrong. Nonetheless, South Africa has the potential to demonstrate to democracy skeptics the world over what is possible in a highly unequal, diverse, post–civil war polity. To focus solely on the disappointments is to miss the bigger picture. How to Know? If we are not going to rely simply on the subjective judgments of citizens and local observers and commentators, how does one evaluate the success of a democracy? Indeed, the motivating query for this book—has the post-Apartheid democratic project been successful?—is imprecise and unanswerable without more direction. The first response to that question must be, “Compared to what?” If you were asked whether twenty-three minutes is a good time for a particular road race, it would not be possible to answer that until you knew how long the race was, under what conditions it was taking place, and who else was running. Importantly, one would also want to know what was expected of that runner before the race began. In the same way, my own conclusions about successful democratic development are based on attempts to establish reasonable benchmarks across time and space. Because the outcomes are complex and not easily measured, I use a wide variety of data sources, ranging from my own personal interviews and observations across several decades, a wealth of secondary sources, newspaper archives, more than a dozen individual-level large-sample surveys, including a few I conducted myself, and administrative data from the South African government, research organizations, and various international organizations. Where possible I try to highlight convergences and divergences between these different sources of data and the relationship between subjective perceptions and outcomes that can be measured more objectively. To assess democratic performance using such data, I deploy a few key strategies. First, we need fair comparisons. I try to understand what has been achieved relative to the past (especially as detailed in chapter 4) and compared with other countries that share important similarities (chapters 6–8), especially, but not only, other African and other Upper-middle-income countries. Given South Africa’s political history and using the experiences of many other countries as the basis for expectations, I show that a lot more failure is what we ought to have expected. As a highly unequal society with a harsh history of oppression by a White minority and a long tradition of violence across groups throughout its history, the hard reality is that violence and bloodshed could easily have been the defining features of post-Apartheid South Africa. Indeed, we need to think about the proverbial dogs that didn’t bark to appreciate the history that in fact transpired: genocide akin to Rwanda’s or Yugoslavia’s, economic collapse akin to Venezuela’s, or actual state failure akin to Zimbabwe’s—the latter two countries faced inflation, currency collapse, and food shortages. Second, it is useful to fix some goalposts, lest we create a framework of shifting expectations in which success is not theoretically possible. We can be guided by prior declarations of hopes for a successful democracy, particularly as made by those who enjoyed popular support during periods of political resistance. For example, liberation leaders set forth demands and expectations in the Freedom Charter of 1955 and in the final negotiation for a new democracy, as detailed in the preamble to the 1996 constitution (discussed in chapter 5). Across more than forty years, a key set of hopes remained remarkably consistent, including to develop a democratic and open government, to improve the material quality of life for citizens, and to build unity while redressing past indignities. During these periods, and even earlier in the twentieth century, liberation leaders placed a heavy focus on the protection of basic human rights. Finally, with respect to these various perspectives, we need to consider a diverse range of actors and stakeholders in their lived realities to assess how they have participated in and have been affected by the new political dispensation. In this respect, while I do consider the national picture, I also decided to focus my attention on a single municipality, about which I had no preconceptions of its successes or failures, and which I selected as a plausible reflection of the larger South African story. There is a saying that “all politics is local,” but in South Africa, it might be more apt to argue that “all politics is national,” in the sense that national issues are constantly played out in local arenas, both through centralized political parties that control local government positions and, perhaps more importantly, because the everyday concerns of South Africans frequently relate quite directly to the country’s national history. And this is certainly true in the place I studied, Mogale City Local Municipality. Of course, Mogale’s story, like South Africa’s story, like that of any place, is unique in certain ways. But a focus on this one area—a case within a case—allowed me to dig more deeply into the lives of South Africans, to learn how they relate to one another and why they express the views and take the actions they do. I wanted to hear how people discuss issues, form their attitudes, participate in politics, and simply coexist and to examine the extent to which old patterns have changed or stayed the same, within the confines of a relatively well-bounded geography. Because I was largely unfamiliar with this municipality prior to conducting the research for this book, it allowed me to test ideas that I had generated from observations of other locales in South Africa. And while Mogale City Local Municipality is neither the economic nor the political capital of South Africa, and not even one of the country’s major metropolitan municipalities, its story is both representative of and in some cases surprisingly central to the larger national picture, including in the ways various forms of racial and ethnic conflict played out here, the building of Apartheid, and its eventual fall. Like much of the rest of Africa, South Africa is rapidly urbanizing, and approximately two-thirds of South Africans now live in urban areas. About half of all South Africans reside in midsized local municipalities, ranging from 100,000 to 700,000 people, and Mogale City sits right in the middle of that range. And in recent years, South African politics has become more competitive, particularly in urban areas, a pattern also reflected in Mogale City where in the 2016 local election the ANC lost its competitive edge, slipping below 50 percent of votes cast.29 TABLE 3.1. Racial Demographics 2016, Mogale City and South Africa, Compared Population Group Mogale City Local Municipality Gauteng Province South Africa Black African 76% 80% 81% White 21% 14% 8% Indian or Asian 2% 3% 2% Coloured < 1% 3% 9% Total Population 383,864 13,399,724 55,653,654 Source: SA_CommSurv_2016. My hope was to find a place that might be a plausible microcosm of the larger South African story. And in Mogale City, I found just that: Mogale is ethnically and racially diverse. However, its demographics do not quite reflect the overall national picture. As shown in table 3.1, although the White population is still a minority in Mogale, its population share there is substantially larger, while the Coloured population is substantially smaller (virtually nonexistent), relative to the country as a whole. Much of this disparity owes to the fact that Coloureds live disproportionately in the western part of the country, and Whites are more concentrated in urban areas, especially in Gauteng Province—which contains a quarter of the country’s population and where the racial demographics are much more similar to Mogale’s. What They Got: Dignified Development In the remaining chapters, I will show that the heroic, multigenerational effort to build democracy in South Africa has been extremely successful and delivered important returns to that society. In just twenty-five years, elected, Black-led governments have made remarkable gains in terms of dignified development. That is, citizens have been made more visible and have been increasingly recognized for their equal value as humans through the various institutions of democratic practice, which in modern times have included constitutional commitments to material benefits and respectful treatment for all individuals. Moreover, the logic of political competition has created incentives for elected officials to provide related policies and practices, and this has vastly extended the share of the population living in a manner that could be recognized as a dignified existence. Previously, a majority of the population faced humiliation at the hands of a government controlled by a racial minority.30 Let me be clear that what I mean by democracy is a political system in which all adult citizens can participate in the selection of leaders through elections and enjoy the opportunity to influence how government works by means of representation and civil expressions of their wants and needs. In this sense, democracy is about process. While my central claim is that democracy has favored dignified development in South Africa, I cannot conclude that the routinization of democratic practice is sufficient for this outcome as a general rule. The world is filled with many democratic polities, replete with competitive elections, in which large numbers of citizens feel neither respected nor autonomous. However, a degree of democracy is almost certainly necessary: the sublimation of any real popular choice concerning political leadership or government implies a fundamental lack of respect for citizens’ views and judgments. Relatedly, economic growth is generally neither necessary nor sufficient to experience bouts of dignified development. As we’ve seen in recent years all around the world, the components of economic growth may be unequally distributed in society, offering little for those who face undignified or humiliating treatment; and in fact, if growth exacerbates inequalities, it may have a deleterious effect on dignified treatment. Moreover, redistributive policies and practices in the form of transfers within and across countries may effectively improve the quality of life for many, even in the absence of growth. To be clear, equitable growth can be an engine of dignified development, particularly as people crave jobs, material goods, and the rewards associated with investment. However, if we prioritize a concern for human dignity, the notion that all humans are inherently valuable and deserve respectful treatment, we should not assume that economic growth ought to be the key outcome of interest and that it will naturally benefit the least well-off. While I share the generally optimistic portrait of the value of democracy documented by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their influential work, Why Nations Fail, I soften their focus on material outcomes such as prosperity in order to bring respectful treatment into our field of vision.31 Finally, dignified development is clearly related to broader notions of human development, including health, material well-being, and education. Among others, the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, the acclaimed philosopher Martha Nussbaum, and the United Nations Development Program32 have all described human development in terms of human capabilities, which in turn are critical sources of independence and autonomy. Although these are key components of a dignified life, most research on human development continues to portray citizens as independent and almost atomized individuals. To understand whether people are treated with respect by other citizens and by government, and protected from humiliation, we must also focus on social relations, including patterns of inclusion and exclusion in everyday life. My goal here is not to develop a complete theory of the conditions under which democracy affects dignified development—nor to test such propositions on a global scale—but to focus on this relationship in the particular case of South Africa. In the chapters that follow, I describe the evidence to support this particular claim and conclude by reflecting on whether the pattern might hold in other contexts. I start, in chapter 4, by describing the shaky historical foundations for both democracy and dignified development on the eve of the South African transition in the early 1990s. Subsequent gains should be seen against the remarkable indignities leveled in the prior three centuries of this diverse and divided society. Because it is a human tendency to adjust to current conditions and to recalibrate expectations, it is important to properly set the stage for the democratic era from the perspective of what came before. Next, in chapter 5, I turn to a description of the particular democratic institutions adopted in South Africa in the mid-1990s. Although laws and formal documents do not fully describe democratic practice, they are critical and necessary components and, in many ways, the most transportable aspects of democratic government that can be recommended when needed. By contrast, one cannot will another polity to have a particular set of leaders or mix of civil society organizations, even if those play central roles in democratic success. I am less concerned with the effects of the specific actors at the center of political life than with the processes that have constrained their behaviors. Then, I describe the emergence of dignified development during the post-Apartheid period, and I attempt to show that the very nature of democratic representation—especially South African institutions that are structured on the principle of proportionality—has provided opportunities for people to be heard, to be recognized, and to be valued. Political parties have been forced to seek out the previously marginalized to earn their votes. A protected judiciary has allowed those who have not been treated fairly to seek justice. And the logic of democratic politics has helped to reinforce the notion that citizens are not subjects. In no case is the record in Mogale City or in South Africa writ large an unqualified success. Yet, there is much to celebrate. In chapter 6, I detail the challenges and trends in democratic practice itself. A key goal of generations of political activists and liberation leaders was simply a democratic polity open to all, irrespective of race, gender, or any other category. From this perspective, democracy is not simply a means to an end but an outcome that is intrinsically valued.33 Against tremendous odds, South Africans developed a robust democratic system that in many ways is a model for modern, liberal democratic orders. And despite warnings that the ANC would overtake the country with a one-party state, the system became more competitive. The attempt to build democracy out of division clearly succeeded. Citizens have been able to choose their leaders, to influence policy, and to hold elected officials accountable for poor performance. Although politicians and bureaucrats have inevitably attempted to engage in various corrupt practices, democratic institutions have shined a light on such practices and, at least to a degree, constrained the behaviors of political leaders. In that chapter, I reflect on the contradictions of democratic process and the realities of everyday violence. While democratically elected governments may use violence or threat of violence to maintain order, ultimately, the promise of democracy is that differences of opinion can be resolved through elections, deliberations, court judgments, and other nonviolent means. As I discuss, several scholars studying South Africa and other countries in the Global South have introduced the notion of “violent democracy” to draw our attention to the co-occurrence of the phenomena. While agreeing with the need to keep a careful eye on violent behavior, I view the proposed terminology as a case of modifying the definition of democracy to a point that it sheds its core meaning.34 Instead, I opt to evaluate how the extent and patterns of violence have changed since the advent of multiracial democracy. And if politics gets to the point where citizens are no longer able to make choices or to provide input free from the direct influence of violent pressures, we will have to declare that the country should not be described as a democracy. In chapter 7, I focus on material outcomes. The poorest and most vulnerable have benefited from the provision of basic services and infrastructure, including access to water, electricity, sanitation, and housing, to social support grants, and to improved health care and education. To be certain, expectations have quickly ratcheted up, and citizens have good reason to decry waning quality and to demand universal access, but these cannot minimize the fact that in many areas of social and welfare support, South Africa is a global leader, and democratic practice has underpinned and reinforced these policies. Democratic pressures in the form of elections, the media, and courts have all weighed on elected government officials to deliver, even as they frequently have been tempted to divert material resources toward themselves. In chapter 8, I look more directly at the nature of human interactions. To what extent have citizens and government officials treated one another, especially the most vulnerable, with respect? And how do people perceive such treatment? Apartheid and the centuries of institutionalized White supremacy that came before were examples of harsh indignities, and while related to the other points made in prior chapters, the increased scope of respect extended to people who were so deprived has been a remarkable transformation. As I discuss, one way of creating a sense of shared worth is through the idea of shared belonging, for example, through some degree of unification, such as nation-building. I conclude by returning to the 2019 election—where I left off at the end of chapter 2—assessing the results in light of the findings highlighted in earlier chapters and other cases, including the American record in the aftermath of segregation. Although I am a social scientist, and I marshal various forms of largely descriptive social scientific evidence, the questions posed in this book cannot be answered definitively in the manner that social scientists generally prefer. First, I can only describe plausible links between democratic practice and the key outcomes I describe, but I cannot definitively show that such outcomes would have been different under an alternative political arrangement. Moreover, the question of whether democratic practice, with all its warts and wrinkles, does deliver real value in a divided society is a subjective one, and my goal here is to present what I think is a fair picture for arriving at an answer. In no way can I conclude that democracy will always have salutary effects in South Africa, let alone the same effect in other societies. Others may read the record on dignified development in a different way, and arrive at a different final tally, one that puts more weight on current deficits, especially with respect to unemployment, inequality, and violence. Notwithstanding these important caveats, my own conclusion is that the first quarter century of South African democracy serves as a positive model of what is possible in the future and for other divided societies.",

      "content": "3 The Value of Democracy THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS I raise in this book concern the value of democracy. Specifically, how did political competition and the structure of government change once South Africa adopted truly democratic institutions that incorporated a previously excluded racial majority? Did the quality of people’s lives improve or deteriorate, and in what ways, during this period? And can we plausibly link such changes to democracy itself, to extract more general lessons about the prospects for democratic government in diverse and divided societies? The portrait of the election campaign I painted in the prior two chapters revealed a wide range of perspectives on such questions. Of course, as South African voters went to the polls in May 2019, they were making a choice about what they wanted for the future. Yet, the moment also marked an important opportunity for them to look back and consider whether the prior quarter century of multiracial democracy had been a success. The long struggle against Apartheid government had been a quest for liberty, for freedom from domination by a minority, and to build a more just society. Did those who worked so hard to bring about change get what they wanted? Or were they experiencing a form of buyer’s remorse? Was this really the best solution to institutionalized White supremacy? The ruling ANC party could not simply take a victory lap. The party’s leaders had long been confronting a string of protests of the kind I witnessed in Krugersdorp, frequently organized by their own members. The opposition parties, ranging from a Black nationalist left to White autonomists on the right, were relentless in their critiques. With a few exceptions, citizens seemed more inclined to discuss what had gone wrong than what had gone right. And as the campaign wound down, I considered the fact that in recent years, South African colleagues and acquaintances from a range of backgrounds had begun to express a surprising sentiment, one that occasionally appears in print in serious media outlets: “What this country needs … is a benevolent dictator!”1 Ordinary South Africans had become increasingly disillusioned with democracy.2 In one survey conducted at the end of 2016, 54 percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the way democracy was working.3 And by 2018, the share of “dissatisfieds” had grown to a full 57 percent of the population. In a summary report from Afrobarometer, whose survey data I analyze throughout this book, they cautioned, “Afrobarometer survey findings from mid-2018 show support for democracy weakening and acceptance of authoritarian alternatives growing.”4 It left me wondering: Was South African democracy actually at risk? Listening to the rallies, the campaign speeches, and the incessant commentary on talk radio in and around Mogale City during the first half of 2019, one could not help but be struck by the distinct scent of frustration. Not just with the present but with the whole post-Apartheid project. Even the ANC’s own representatives seemed more apologetic than proud. The expressed antipathies of White South Africans were already very familiar to me. As a White man, I have always had the easiest access to White South Africans. Many unabashedly told me that they longed for the past. “They made this country into a ball of shit,” explained one man, about my age, whom I met while dining at a restaurant in Muldersdrift one evening on my first trip to Mogale. He and his girlfriend were sitting at the table next to mine and they must have heard my American accent while I was placing an order, and like so many in the area, they were friendly and happy to share their political views and reflections with me. The culprit for the country’s decline, in this man’s view, was the Black ANC government. I would hear the same from most of the other White residents I met while touring the area and had heard the same for years in other parts of the country. What I did find more surprising, perhaps even offensive, was the man’s suggestion to me to “ask the Black people around here. They’ll tell you the same thing, that life was better in the old days.” It would be like suggesting that African Americans preferred life under segregation. On the other hand, only with solid data could I debunk such a claim. As part of my research, I conducted a Historical Memories Survey among adults in Mogale City—the results of which I detail in subsequent chapters—and asked citizens to compare their current overall quality of life (theirs and that of their family) to life in the Apartheid days. Is it better today? Worse today? Or about the same? The White responses were fairly predictable: 55 percent said life was worse today. Many Whites truly yearned for the time of White rule. If a politician had appealed to them with the slogan “Make South Africa Great Again,” they would have embraced the message with open arms. To my great disbelief, perhaps shock, it turned out that the White man I had met in Muldersdrift had correctly predicted Black public sentiment and I had been way off the mark in my skeptical reaction to his claims. In fact, a full 50 percent of Black residents surveyed said that life was better then, as compared with 40 percent who said things were better now.5 After months of talking to citizens and leaders around town, I had heard plenty of negative perspectives, complaints about government, crime, lack of jobs, and so forth.6 However, I had not expected that this would be the conclusion of so many in a random sample of forty-and-over adults from a municipality where Apartheid had been harshly enforced. If even Black South Africans were unhappy with the democracy that they had struggled to produce over so many generations, might they consider something else? Only a few years ago, the notion of citizens voluntarily forgoing democracy for authoritarian rule might have seemed radical and unimaginable, but these concerns have become particularly salient because for several years we have been witnessing a global retreat in democratic government.7 Seemingly stable democracies have given way to more authoritarian styles of rule. When my political science colleagues Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, and further developed their argument in a 2018 book, How Democracies Die,8 they provided a powerful wake-up call by connecting the dots to illustrate an emerging pattern: in the United States and in many other countries, the key foundations of democracy were being undone not through military coups or armed insurrections but at the ballot box. Citizens were increasingly choosing leaders who, in their populist bravado, were saying, “I alone can fix everything,” as Donald Trump said on the campaign trail in 2016. Given real and perceived problems in those societies, such calls were warmly received by many voters, and once in power, these leaders have worked to change the rules of the game to help entrench their power, undermining democratic institutions. And perhaps as both a cause and a consequence of such changes, even surprising numbers of Americans no longer take for granted democracy as the “only game in town,”9 imagining other types of political systems as preferable. Many reasons have been offered for the more recent rise of populist authoritarianism that has caused something of a reverse wave away from democracy, but among the most compelling explanations is that large shares of citizens in democratic countries are increasingly dissatisfied with their lot, in large part due to persistent and growing economic insecurity alongside perceived threats to status owing to immigration and other demographic trends.10 Ethnic and racial diversity can provide fodder for frustration and scapegoating. Under such conditions, populists promise swift and assured gains, with little tolerance for “special interests” in the form of ethnic minorities. I argue that the case of South Africa between 1994 and 2019 offers a compelling alternative to populist authoritarianism—a positive model of what democracy can offer truly divided societies: peace, the ability to influence leaders, increased material prosperity especially for the poor, and, ultimately, greater respect for human dignity. These were remarkable achievements in light of the country’s history, and the findings on dignity in particular help paint a fuller view of the value of democracy itself. While the rhetoric of everyday politics can be dismissive of the South African record, a more sober and considered evaluation reveals a democracy that has worked better than is often appreciated—by both pundits and citizens alike. In the remainder of this chapter, I describe why the question of valuing South Africa’s democratic project is a critical one; I outline the approach I took to answer this question; and I summarize the central findings detailed in the subsequent chapters. I highlight the profound value and remarkable achievements of South Africa’s first quarter century of multiracial, democratic government in terms of what I call dignified development, while recognizing the enormity of the problems that remain and that new challenges have emerged. Why Ask? Throughout modern history, historians, philosophers, and social scientists have all reflected on the value of democracy for the human condition. In so doing, they have considered whether democracy is intrinsically valuable, simply as an expression of freedom. And they have asked whether it leads to better outcomes for society. For example, does democracy promote economic development better than other systems of government?11 Is democracy good for the poor?12 Such questions are routinely asked and answered in more general terms, with respect to large numbers of polities. However, I focus on the value of democracy for the single country of South Africa. In this “case study” approach,13 I draw on many relevant comparisons, but I believe the narrowed attention is warranted. To begin with, South Africa is an intrinsically important case. Although only about the twenty-fifth most populous country in the world, the country’s plight has long been central to global political movements and ideas about justice and democracy. In the late twentieth century, perhaps no single political issue galvanized people around the world more than the idea that Apartheid government must come to an end. Apartheid, or apartness, was a full-blown system of social engineering relentlessly implemented on the southern tip of the African continent. It effectively relegated a Black majority to third-class citizenship. In turn, songs, plays, movies, and books captured the injustices of this system, and the very term “Apartheid” came to symbolize the essence of injustice, a retrograde form of internal colonial rule. Over the course of three decades, students at American and other foreign universities followed the lead of their South African counterparts, protesting and staging massive “sit-ins” inside and outside administrative offices to demand divestment from companies doing business in South Africa. Even a youthful Barack Obama cut his teeth in public speaking by railing against the Apartheid regime as a student at Occidental College in 1981, an opportunity he used to also shed light on racial issues in the United States.14 The organizers of major sporting events, including the International Olympic Committee, barred South Africans from competition. The South African government and its privileged White citizenry became global pariahs, while its Black citizens, and especially their famed political leaders—who sat in jail or lived in exile—earned the empathy and support of allies around the world. Sometimes for good and other times for bad, outsiders have always played an important role in the South African story. Citizens and political leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Cuba, and the Soviet Union, and particularly from countries across the African continent, were all intimately involved and/or interested in the long-standing conflict over Apartheid-style government. Depending on their political orientation and their own views on America’s racial order, American political leaders took different sides in support of or against White government. Moreover, while South Africa may be somewhat extreme in the extent to which it combines enormous ethnic and racial diversity along with high levels of income and wealth inequality and a history of conflict, it is not alone in these regards. American history echoes many strands of South Africa’s, an idea expertly documented by George Fredrickson in his classic text, White Supremacy.15 Not just the United States but also Israel, Australia, Brazil, India, Kenya, and many other countries face similar conditions for building cohesion and prosperity given the overlap of diversity and inequality. The degree to which South Africa underwent an extremely deliberate political transition offers possibilities for thinking about how to address such challenges in other contexts. For those interested in the making and breaking of racial boundaries, ultimately one must confront the South African example. As we know now, the formal Apartheid system was dissolved through the removal of discriminatory laws and institutions in the early 1990s. Nelson Mandela went from prisoner to president. South Africa was welcomed back into the global community with open arms, and external scrutiny turned toward other hot spots around the globe. Like dozens of other countries at approximately the same time, South Africa adopted a set of democratic institutions to select its leaders and make its policies. Against this important backdrop, a wide range of interested observers deserve to know what happened. Was it simply “case closed” in the sense that there was a problem, it was fixed, and now it’s time to move on? Given widespread interest, it is important that we get this case right with respect to the success or failure of democracy writ large. Whether South Africa is a case of success or failure has enormous implications for how we think about the promise of democracy more generally. A key concern that motivated me to write this book was my own appraisal that the more recent political history has been mischaracterized. In fact, a dominant narrative argues that the post-Apartheid period has been one of great expectations followed by profound disappointment. In summary form: thankfully, Apartheid finally came to an end; the greatest anti-Apartheid leader, Nelson Mandela, was elected president and ushered in a momentary period of calm and forbearance. But after his one term in office, the country descended into a sea of corruption and incompetence, leaving South Africa, as it is today, at a dangerous precipice. South Africa’s leading scholars and analysts have painted an increasingly grim picture of a still young democratic order, which cannot help but contribute to a sense of dismay about the possibilities for democratic development. For example, Xolela Mangcu, a South African sociologist and journalist, penned his condemnation of the new order in a 2014 book titled The Arrogance of Power: South Africa’s Leadership Meltdown.16 This was a sequel to his 2008 book, To the Brink.17 Alex Boraine, a White politician who helped negotiate the terms of the country’s historic democratic transition behind the scenes and worked closely with Archbishop Desmond Tutu to manage a national reconciliation process in the aftermath of Apartheid, was initially bullish on what could be accomplished. Nonetheless, in his 2014 book What’s Gone Wrong? South Africa on the Brink of Failed Statehood, he shared the notion that things are simply falling apart. Both Mangcu and Boraine recount examples of venal politicians acting in narrow self-interest to the detriment of the greater public good. For example, according to Boraine, “If corruption were an event in the Olympic Games, the ANC government would be festooned with silver and bronze—and perhaps a few gold medals as well.”18 Anton Harber, former editor of the leading South African newsweekly, the Mail & Guardian, documented his riveting and powerful investigation of the politically, economically, and socially dysfunctional township of Diepsloot, which lies on the edge of Johannesburg, not very far from Mogale City. In it, he makes the case: “You want to see South Africa … come to Diepsloot.”19 Foreign scholars have frequently amplified this “glass mostly empty” view of South African democracy. For example, the British university professor Nic Cheeseman analyzed the range of African experiments with democratic rule since the 1990s in his important book, Democracy in Africa (2015). With respect to South Africa, he describes only what has gone wrong since 1994—pointing out real disappointments in terms of government AIDS policy, xenophobia, and other foibles (as I also recount in the chapters that follow). One would not be able to read that book and fathom that almost anything had been accomplished during the period of ANC government.20 From the Zambian economist and best-selling author Dambisa Moyo21 to the British journalist and political analyst R. W. Johnson22 to the foreign correspondents covering South Africa at the New York Times and other leading international news publications, close observers inside and outside the country have identified a range of problems that contribute to a shared understanding of collective failure. And White South Africans—those who left the country, as well as those who stayed—are frequent interlocutors to American and European audiences. Many of them have promoted what I call the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to anyone who will listen. That is, they point to the country to the north, once known as Southern Rhodesia, which was also ruled as a White settler society with an Apartheid-style government. It is a country that similarly experienced a war for liberation and a transition to Black rule a little more than a decade earlier than South Africa did. Under President Mugabe, the country, now called Zimbabwe, went from being a robust exporter of agricultural products to one characterized by hyperinflation, food shortages, corruption, and wide pockets of state failure. And according to this formulation, South Africa is going down the same path. In this final analysis, it is hard not to detect a racist logic—that Black rule inevitably leads to failure. The subtext is often, “You may not have liked Apartheid, but it was better than this” and sometimes more explicitly, “This is what happens when they take over.” And on the day of the 2019 election, when I interviewed dozens of voters around Mogale City, many angrily raised concerns about jobs, lack of basic services, and crime. They were particularly incensed about the persistence of reports of government corruption. Viewed together, very different commentators—ranging from unapologetic Apartheid beneficiaries to former anti-Apartheid activists, from all racial backgrounds—have painted an alarmingly negative portrait of the state of South Africa. In turn, my point is that such a picture can be dangerously misleading if it is presented on its own with the implicit or explicit caption, “This is what democracy delivered.”23 To be clear, I do not dispute the veracity of reports of bureaucratic failure, malfeasance, violence, or abject poverty. I have sat through load-shedding power outages myself; on many trips and tours of South Africa, I have observed the persistent inequality and squalor of many parts of the country firsthand and have analyzed the data confirming broader problems. On various trips, I have worried about my own personal safety, cognizant of the prevalence of violence. I know and trust many of the journalists, scholars, and civil society organizations that focus on these problems. Rather, my concern is that if we take a larger macro-historical perspective—trying to summarize what happened after one of the world’s most anticipated political transitions—we need to present such facts in context regarding what happened in the past and what has been feasible given local and international constraints and challenges—and, most importantly, with respect to what has gone right. In this sense, I follow more in the footsteps of the late Hans Rosling, who urged us to consider the big picture of global human health and development in order to recognize that even when things sometimes seem to be getting worse, they are actually getting better.24 Ultimately, the final judgment about whether the evidence illustrates a case of a glass half full or half empty is in the eye of the beholder. However, I believe that the influential group of interlocutors I just described has overwhelmingly focused on the problems and largely ignored the accomplishments evident in post-Apartheid South Africa. Perhaps this is not surprising given the tendency of human judgment to be characterized by “negativity bias.” That is, the devaluing power of bad things tends to be greater than the redeeming power of good ones.25 Relatedly, we do not expect news outlets to report on the millions of airplanes that land safely—only on the ones that do not, even though those extraordinary stories of statistically outlying events can contribute to a false sense of insecurity. Moreover, democratic practice frequently incentivizes negative over positive appraisal because by design, democratic government opens up channels for dissent and for challenging the exercise of power. Even when they are not governing, opposition parties and social groups, abetted by an open media, can cajole and pressure the government to rethink or revise its policies. Critical dialogue can help citizens to imagine what to even wish for. These are virtues. However, in so doing, democratic practice feeds a degree of discontent. It puts a spotlight on problems, particularly on malfeasance, and it gives special attention to those who are suffering and/or articulating their frustrations. And with the advent of social media, such tendencies are broadcast and shared with greater speed than ever thought imaginable. While such sharing of information plays an important and positive role in driving accountability and social justice, it can lead observers to focus on shortcomings over progress. In turn, social and political commentators must, at least on occasion, take stock of a fuller substantive and historical record in a more holistic manner. In fact, one of the inherent challenges of democracy is that because it is rooted in competition and transparency, citizens and actors are privy to more information about the failings of government performance and leadership, contributing to depressed perceptions relative to what they might experience if facing otherwise similar problems in systems where information and critical voices were absent. One is freer to complain louder in a democracy. Political competition, the media, protests, activists, courts, calls for redress, and dissenting voices are not the problem in South Africa. They are the essence of democracy. Fiery words from political actors—including those that tell the ruling party or president, “Democracy is broken”—may reflect just the opposite. Critical political discourse in democratic practice needs to be separated from evaluation of the quality of democracy itself. This is a subtle but important point. Throughout my research on democratic South Africa, I have found people shouting, more or less, that “everything is awful here,” which would not be possible in strictly authoritarian countries from North Korea to China where everyone must say, on fear of prosecution, “It’s great here.” With respect to the latter, one scholar has aptly observed that the sudden collapse of the East European communist regimes caught many observers by surprise because under this form of authoritarian rule, citizens did not publicly express their views—rather, they engaged in preference falsification.26 For democracy to survive, citizens must ultimately be convinced of its value. And it is certainly conceivable that democracy might not work best. Many organizations—households, firms, universities—operate successfully without truly democratic rules for leadership selection or everyday operation. We should not promote democracy simply as a matter of blind faith. Even the most ardent defenders of democracy point us to certain key limitations, which often prove frustrating to citizens. Two of the most important modern theorists of democratic development offered warnings at the onset of the “Third Wave” of democratization, of which South Africa was a part, concerning what might go wrong and what citizens might prefer instead. Describing several paradoxes of democracy, Larry Diamond observed that in trying to represent diverse interests, democratic governments often move slowly; and compromise can undermine the prospects for effective solutions.27 And Robert Dahl pointed out that citizens may frequently wonder whether they would do better with informed “guardians,” who are experts at governing because of their superior knowledge or virtue, rather than those who convince the citizenry of their credentials.28 Despite real and perceived problems, we must remind ourselves of democracy’s value, and that value may differ somewhat according to the arc of a country’s political development. Democratic retreat will surely continue unless the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of the democratic project can be credibly established and communicated. Yes, we need to recognize what has gone wrong. Nonetheless, South Africa has the potential to demonstrate to democracy skeptics the world over what is possible in a highly unequal, diverse, post–civil war polity. To focus solely on the disappointments is to miss the bigger picture. How to Know? If we are not going to rely simply on the subjective judgments of citizens and local observers and commentators, how does one evaluate the success of a democracy? Indeed, the motivating query for this book—has the post-Apartheid democratic project been successful?—is imprecise and unanswerable without more direction. The first response to that question must be, “Compared to what?” If you were asked whether twenty-three minutes is a good time for a particular road race, it would not be possible to answer that until you knew how long the race was, under what conditions it was taking place, and who else was running. Importantly, one would also want to know what was expected of that runner before the race began. In the same way, my own conclusions about successful democratic development are based on attempts to establish reasonable benchmarks across time and space. Because the outcomes are complex and not easily measured, I use a wide variety of data sources, ranging from my own personal interviews and observations across several decades, a wealth of secondary sources, newspaper archives, more than a dozen individual-level large-sample surveys, including a few I conducted myself, and administrative data from the South African government, research organizations, and various international organizations. Where possible I try to highlight convergences and divergences between these different sources of data and the relationship between subjective perceptions and outcomes that can be measured more objectively. To assess democratic performance using such data, I deploy a few key strategies. First, we need fair comparisons. I try to understand what has been achieved relative to the past (especially as detailed in chapter 4) and compared with other countries that share important similarities (chapters 6–8), especially, but not only, other African and other Upper-middle-income countries. Given South Africa’s political history and using the experiences of many other countries as the basis for expectations, I show that a lot more failure is what we ought to have expected. As a highly unequal society with a harsh history of oppression by a White minority and a long tradition of violence across groups throughout its history, the hard reality is that violence and bloodshed could easily have been the defining features of post-Apartheid South Africa. Indeed, we need to think about the proverbial dogs that didn’t bark to appreciate the history that in fact transpired: genocide akin to Rwanda’s or Yugoslavia’s, economic collapse akin to Venezuela’s, or actual state failure akin to Zimbabwe’s—the latter two countries faced inflation, currency collapse, and food shortages. Second, it is useful to fix some goalposts, lest we create a framework of shifting expectations in which success is not theoretically possible. We can be guided by prior declarations of hopes for a successful democracy, particularly as made by those who enjoyed popular support during periods of political resistance. For example, liberation leaders set forth demands and expectations in the Freedom Charter of 1955 and in the final negotiation for a new democracy, as detailed in the preamble to the 1996 constitution (discussed in chapter 5). Across more than forty years, a key set of hopes remained remarkably consistent, including to develop a democratic and open government, to improve the material quality of life for citizens, and to build unity while redressing past indignities. During these periods, and even earlier in the twentieth century, liberation leaders placed a heavy focus on the protection of basic human rights. Finally, with respect to these various perspectives, we need to consider a diverse range of actors and stakeholders in their lived realities to assess how they have participated in and have been affected by the new political dispensation. In this respect, while I do consider the national picture, I also decided to focus my attention on a single municipality, about which I had no preconceptions of its successes or failures, and which I selected as a plausible reflection of the larger South African story. There is a saying that “all politics is local,” but in South Africa, it might be more apt to argue that “all politics is national,” in the sense that national issues are constantly played out in local arenas, both through centralized political parties that control local government positions and, perhaps more importantly, because the everyday concerns of South Africans frequently relate quite directly to the country’s national history. And this is certainly true in the place I studied, Mogale City Local Municipality. Of course, Mogale’s story, like South Africa’s story, like that of any place, is unique in certain ways. But a focus on this one area—a case within a case—allowed me to dig more deeply into the lives of South Africans, to learn how they relate to one another and why they express the views and take the actions they do. I wanted to hear how people discuss issues, form their attitudes, participate in politics, and simply coexist and to examine the extent to which old patterns have changed or stayed the same, within the confines of a relatively well-bounded geography. Because I was largely unfamiliar with this municipality prior to conducting the research for this book, it allowed me to test ideas that I had generated from observations of other locales in South Africa. And while Mogale City Local Municipality is neither the economic nor the political capital of South Africa, and not even one of the country’s major metropolitan municipalities, its story is both representative of and in some cases surprisingly central to the larger national picture, including in the ways various forms of racial and ethnic conflict played out here, the building of Apartheid, and its eventual fall. Like much of the rest of Africa, South Africa is rapidly urbanizing, and approximately two-thirds of South Africans now live in urban areas. About half of all South Africans reside in midsized local municipalities, ranging from 100,000 to 700,000 people, and Mogale City sits right in the middle of that range. And in recent years, South African politics has become more competitive, particularly in urban areas, a pattern also reflected in Mogale City where in the 2016 local election the ANC lost its competitive edge, slipping below 50 percent of votes cast.29 TABLE 3.1. Racial Demographics 2016, Mogale City and South Africa, Compared Population Group Mogale City Local Municipality Gauteng Province South Africa Black African 76% 80% 81% White 21% 14% 8% Indian or Asian 2% 3% 2% Coloured < 1% 3% 9% Total Population 383,864 13,399,724 55,653,654 Source: SA_CommSurv_2016. My hope was to find a place that might be a plausible microcosm of the larger South African story. And in Mogale City, I found just that: Mogale is ethnically and racially diverse. However, its demographics do not quite reflect the overall national picture. As shown in table 3.1, although the White population is still a minority in Mogale, its population share there is substantially larger, while the Coloured population is substantially smaller (virtually nonexistent), relative to the country as a whole. Much of this disparity owes to the fact that Coloureds live disproportionately in the western part of the country, and Whites are more concentrated in urban areas, especially in Gauteng Province—which contains a quarter of the country’s population and where the racial demographics are much more similar to Mogale’s. What They Got: Dignified Development In the remaining chapters, I will show that the heroic, multigenerational effort to build democracy in South Africa has been extremely successful and delivered important returns to that society. In just twenty-five years, elected, Black-led governments have made remarkable gains in terms of dignified development. That is, citizens have been made more visible and have been increasingly recognized for their equal value as humans through the various institutions of democratic practice, which in modern times have included constitutional commitments to material benefits and respectful treatment for all individuals. Moreover, the logic of political competition has created incentives for elected officials to provide related policies and practices, and this has vastly extended the share of the population living in a manner that could be recognized as a dignified existence. Previously, a majority of the population faced humiliation at the hands of a government controlled by a racial minority.30 Let me be clear that what I mean by democracy is a political system in which all adult citizens can participate in the selection of leaders through elections and enjoy the opportunity to influence how government works by means of representation and civil expressions of their wants and needs. In this sense, democracy is about process. While my central claim is that democracy has favored dignified development in South Africa, I cannot conclude that the routinization of democratic practice is sufficient for this outcome as a general rule. The world is filled with many democratic polities, replete with competitive elections, in which large numbers of citizens feel neither respected nor autonomous. However, a degree of democracy is almost certainly necessary: the sublimation of any real popular choice concerning political leadership or government implies a fundamental lack of respect for citizens’ views and judgments. Relatedly, economic growth is generally neither necessary nor sufficient to experience bouts of dignified development. As we’ve seen in recent years all around the world, the components of economic growth may be unequally distributed in society, offering little for those who face undignified or humiliating treatment; and in fact, if growth exacerbates inequalities, it may have a deleterious effect on dignified treatment. Moreover, redistributive policies and practices in the form of transfers within and across countries may effectively improve the quality of life for many, even in the absence of growth. To be clear, equitable growth can be an engine of dignified development, particularly as people crave jobs, material goods, and the rewards associated with investment. However, if we prioritize a concern for human dignity, the notion that all humans are inherently valuable and deserve respectful treatment, we should not assume that economic growth ought to be the key outcome of interest and that it will naturally benefit the least well-off. While I share the generally optimistic portrait of the value of democracy documented by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their influential work, Why Nations Fail, I soften their focus on material outcomes such as prosperity in order to bring respectful treatment into our field of vision.31 Finally, dignified development is clearly related to broader notions of human development, including health, material well-being, and education. Among others, the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, the acclaimed philosopher Martha Nussbaum, and the United Nations Development Program32 have all described human development in terms of human capabilities, which in turn are critical sources of independence and autonomy. Although these are key components of a dignified life, most research on human development continues to portray citizens as independent and almost atomized individuals. To understand whether people are treated with respect by other citizens and by government, and protected from humiliation, we must also focus on social relations, including patterns of inclusion and exclusion in everyday life. My goal here is not to develop a complete theory of the conditions under which democracy affects dignified development—nor to test such propositions on a global scale—but to focus on this relationship in the particular case of South Africa. In the chapters that follow, I describe the evidence to support this particular claim and conclude by reflecting on whether the pattern might hold in other contexts. I start, in chapter 4, by describing the shaky historical foundations for both democracy and dignified development on the eve of the South African transition in the early 1990s. Subsequent gains should be seen against the remarkable indignities leveled in the prior three centuries of this diverse and divided society. Because it is a human tendency to adjust to current conditions and to recalibrate expectations, it is important to properly set the stage for the democratic era from the perspective of what came before. Next, in chapter 5, I turn to a description of the particular democratic institutions adopted in South Africa in the mid-1990s. Although laws and formal documents do not fully describe democratic practice, they are critical and necessary components and, in many ways, the most transportable aspects of democratic government that can be recommended when needed. By contrast, one cannot will another polity to have a particular set of leaders or mix of civil society organizations, even if those play central roles in democratic success. I am less concerned with the effects of the specific actors at the center of political life than with the processes that have constrained their behaviors. Then, I describe the emergence of dignified development during the post-Apartheid period, and I attempt to show that the very nature of democratic representation—especially South African institutions that are structured on the principle of proportionality—has provided opportunities for people to be heard, to be recognized, and to be valued. Political parties have been forced to seek out the previously marginalized to earn their votes. A protected judiciary has allowed those who have not been treated fairly to seek justice. And the logic of democratic politics has helped to reinforce the notion that citizens are not subjects. In no case is the record in Mogale City or in South Africa writ large an unqualified success. Yet, there is much to celebrate. In chapter 6, I detail the challenges and trends in democratic practice itself. A key goal of generations of political activists and liberation leaders was simply a democratic polity open to all, irrespective of race, gender, or any other category. From this perspective, democracy is not simply a means to an end but an outcome that is intrinsically valued.33 Against tremendous odds, South Africans developed a robust democratic system that in many ways is a model for modern, liberal democratic orders. And despite warnings that the ANC would overtake the country with a one-party state, the system became more competitive. The attempt to build democracy out of division clearly succeeded. Citizens have been able to choose their leaders, to influence policy, and to hold elected officials accountable for poor performance. Although politicians and bureaucrats have inevitably attempted to engage in various corrupt practices, democratic institutions have shined a light on such practices and, at least to a degree, constrained the behaviors of political leaders. In that chapter, I reflect on the contradictions of democratic process and the realities of everyday violence. While democratically elected governments may use violence or threat of violence to maintain order, ultimately, the promise of democracy is that differences of opinion can be resolved through elections, deliberations, court judgments, and other nonviolent means. As I discuss, several scholars studying South Africa and other countries in the Global South have introduced the notion of “violent democracy” to draw our attention to the co-occurrence of the phenomena. While agreeing with the need to keep a careful eye on violent behavior, I view the proposed terminology as a case of modifying the definition of democracy to a point that it sheds its core meaning.34 Instead, I opt to evaluate how the extent and patterns of violence have changed since the advent of multiracial democracy. And if politics gets to the point where citizens are no longer able to make choices or to provide input free from the direct influence of violent pressures, we will have to declare that the country should not be described as a democracy. In chapter 7, I focus on material outcomes. The poorest and most vulnerable have benefited from the provision of basic services and infrastructure, including access to water, electricity, sanitation, and housing, to social support grants, and to improved health care and education. To be certain, expectations have quickly ratcheted up, and citizens have good reason to decry waning quality and to demand universal access, but these cannot minimize the fact that in many areas of social and welfare support, South Africa is a global leader, and democratic practice has underpinned and reinforced these policies. Democratic pressures in the form of elections, the media, and courts have all weighed on elected government officials to deliver, even as they frequently have been tempted to divert material resources toward themselves. In chapter 8, I look more directly at the nature of human interactions. To what extent have citizens and government officials treated one another, especially the most vulnerable, with respect? And how do people perceive such treatment? Apartheid and the centuries of institutionalized White supremacy that came before were examples of harsh indignities, and while related to the other points made in prior chapters, the increased scope of respect extended to people who were so deprived has been a remarkable transformation. As I discuss, one way of creating a sense of shared worth is through the idea of shared belonging, for example, through some degree of unification, such as nation-building. I conclude by returning to the 2019 election—where I left off at the end of chapter 2—assessing the results in light of the findings highlighted in earlier chapters and other cases, including the American record in the aftermath of segregation. Although I am a social scientist, and I marshal various forms of largely descriptive social scientific evidence, the questions posed in this book cannot be answered definitively in the manner that social scientists generally prefer. First, I can only describe plausible links between democratic practice and the key outcomes I describe, but I cannot definitively show that such outcomes would have been different under an alternative political arrangement. Moreover, the question of whether democratic practice, with all its warts and wrinkles, does deliver real value in a divided society is a subjective one, and my goal here is to present what I think is a fair picture for arriving at an answer. In no way can I conclude that democracy will always have salutary effects in South Africa, let alone the same effect in other societies. Others may read the record on dignified development in a different way, and arrive at a different final tally, one that puts more weight on current deficits, especially with respect to unemployment, inequality, and violence. Notwithstanding these important caveats, my own conclusion is that the first quarter century of South African democracy serves as a positive model of what is possible in the future and for other divided societies.",

      "content": "4 Before Democracy SHAKY FOUNDATIONS MILLIONS OF SOUTH AFRICANS could hardly believe what they were hearing on February 2, 1990, when State President F. W. De Klerk announced to a sitting White Parliament in Cape Town, “The time for reconstruction and reconciliation has arrived.” In his epoch-shifting speech, De Klerk spoke of a “new South Africa” and imminent planning for a “realistic and democratic dispensation.” Although he didn’t utter the word Apartheid even once, it was clear that he was delivering the nails in the coffin for this infamous project—the one his own party unleashed on the country more than four decades earlier. De Klerk concluded by promising that Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners would be set free. Just over a week later, on February 11, Mandela appeared in public for the first time in twenty-seven years and addressed the country and the wider world from outside Cape Town City Hall. A full battalion of police, no longer charged with keeping Mandela captive, was now tasked with protecting the still sturdy former boxer, lawyer, and revolutionary icon from the crowds and any would-be attackers. A few weeks of photo opportunities and celebrations followed, many depicting him holding the hand of his wife—a fiery political leader in her own right—Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. A global audience cheered that one of the most unjust systems of rule in modern history was coming to an end. What was less clear was what would come next. I was an undergraduate student at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy at the time. Incidentally, but quite relatedly, I was wholly ignorant of Wilson’s own racist past, a legacy that would lead the university to remove his name from the school more than two decades later. In the winter of 1991, my junior year, I enrolled in a class taught by the former undersecretary of state for Africa, Donald Easum, to study the unfolding political transition in South Africa. We were presented with the incredible opportunity of traveling to the country at the end of the academic year and committed to a two-week study tour. We interviewed stakeholders and leaders from across the political spectrum and eventually published a report based on that research.1 I arranged to stay in the country on my own for an additional month, which proved to be the inspiration for my future career choice. Flying from New York, we transferred in London—American carriers were still not traveling to the country—and had few fellow tourists on the overnight flight to South Africa. It persisted as a pariah state in many ways and the ANC, still a liberation organization and not yet a political party, continued to advocate for economic sanctions against the country. We landed early on a June morning in 1991 at the Johannesburg airport. It was then named for Jan Smuts—a complicated character who was an Afrikaner general, served as prime minister during multiple stints during the first half of the twentieth century, and was instrumental in consolidating White rule,2 while also contributing to the drafting of the International Declaration of Human Rights.3 The energy in the country was exhilarating. Each morning’s newspaper offered the possibility of a shift in momentum. In Johannesburg, I frequently planted myself in the lobby of the Carlton Hotel, which for years had been designated as an “international hotel”—an Apartheid loophole that allowed in guests from different races, making it a cosmopolitan hub. I would secure the right to a lobby table by ordering a Rooibos tea with milk, which I would sip slowly. From that perch, I watched national and international dignitaries, government leaders, executives, and civic luminaries, Black and White, moving swiftly through the corridors from one backroom negotiation to another. Leaders of various organized interests were all jockeying for a seat at the table and for their wants and needs to be met in the new order. On June 16, our group drove up to the First National Bank soccer stadium in Soweto for a commemorative rally. Easum flashed his still valid diplomatic passport, and the guards waved us onto the floor through the VIP entrance. We joined the tens of thousands of screaming and cheering Black ANC supporters in the stands; they had packed the bleachers on this fifteenth anniversary of a famous student-led rebellion to get a glimpse of the legendary freedom fighter himself. When he arrived, again with Winnie at his side, I managed to snap a photo—no selfies back then—from about ten feet away; it was as close to a living legend as I had ever experienced. The stadium was shaking with joy and adulation. This was their messiah and he had finally come to lift them out of the misery of Apartheid. It would be hard to overstate the crowd’s optimism. Millions of South Africans and observers around the world, including me, initially shared that sense of hopefulness for the country’s future. And yet, that sentiment was quickly clouded with anxiety as escalating conflict and violence threatened the prospects for a peaceful regime change. The political transition unfolded in fits and starts, and at times, it seemed that failure—civil war, economic collapse, the rise of a dictator, or even genocide—was as likely as peace and prosperity. Particularly in Johannesburg, I confronted a sense of insecurity that I would not experience in my own country until the September 11 attacks a decade later: We couldn’t enter a major building without going through a metal detector, and the daily news reports recounted bomb blasts and bloody episodes across the country. Even in the speech in which De Klerk promised transformational political reform, he also declared that the government would maintain a state of emergency owing to persistent violence. I was struck by the razor-wire and electric fences that wealthy and not-so-wealthy Whites had built around their homes. More than a year after Mandela’s release, this was not a country at peace. And in localities like Krugersdorp, still very much segregated in practice, the local newspaper was filled with advertisements for handguns and security systems, as well as reports of new consumer boycotts initiated to maintain steady pressure for ongoing political reform. FIGURE 4.1. Michael Goldberg (left) and Evan Lieberman (center) pose with Nelson Mandela (right) in the Johannesburg airport when our flight to Cape Town was delayed on June 20, 1991.

Nonetheless, in order to fully appreciate what transpired during the first quarter century after Apartheid—the subject of all subsequent chapters—it is critical to put into context what was realistically possible and plausible from the vantage point of the BD period. That is, before democracy. And specifically, what were the social, political, and economic conditions leading up to the first multiracial elections? I will not provide a remotely complete account of South Africa’s complex history, including the rise of and resistance to the Apartheid state, in this single chapter. Rather, I describe two sets of critical and related legacies that weighed heavily on South Africa’s future, including in the area that would become Mogale City. The first is the construction of White government—a contested and several-centuries-long process of consolidating political power. There is no doubt that by the second half of the twentieth century, White South Africans had built a relatively strong and effective state, one that for many years promoted rapid economic development. And to a degree, this proved to be a fortuitous inheritance for the democratic era. Yet, it was an undignified development that excluded the Black majority and left indelible memories of poor treatment that would always be fodder for resentment. In creating vast inequalities between groups, it raised the stakes for subsequent political conflict. Moreover, the government deliberately fragmented the society, and political authority itself, leaving little obvious basis for future unification. Second was the resistance movement, which of course was also quite successful in achieving its main goals, culminating in the dismantling of Apartheid. Moreover, many of the organizations and individuals central to the liberation movement led with a human rights orientation that provided a strong moral basis for the democratic order. However, the movement also became violent. Frustrated by the failures of diplomacy, many turned to a strategy that deliberately sought to undermine political order, and did so in ways that would reverberate even once the resistance campaign came to an end. White Government Perhaps it is trite to say this, but it is critical to spotlight a simple reality: the reason most White South Africans did not want to give up White rule is largely because this style of government delivered vast and secure material prosperity to them. When combined with a moral doctrine that justified racial hierarchy, White people could enjoy the good life, and feel good about it. And yet, the development of White South Africa came at the expense of respect for the dignity of Black people, who constituted the overwhelming majority of the population in the region. While the origins of this system can be traced to European theories of racial superiority and the time before Dutch settlers arrived in the mid-seventeenth century, I focus on the development of the area that would eventually become Mogale City. As I mentioned in chapter 1, Afrikaners began to settle in and around the region as part of a mid-nineteenth-century migration from the southwest—the Great Trek. They encountered Black Africans in the area, including some who had been living there for centuries, and others who had arrived more recently, including through violent conquests of their own.4 Possessing greater military might, the Afrikaners quickly became politically dominant. Particularly after the discovery of gold, successive governments created institutions aimed at degrading and dehumanizing those who were not White or “European.” In 1883, Paul Kruger, an avowed Afrikaner nationalist, became president of the Transvaal Republic,5 one of the four White-led governments that would eventually comprise the provinces of the Union of South Africa. Kruger had long professed a deep-seated racism, frequently referring to Black Africans as “savages” who ought to be ruled over with “justice and morality.”6 And this orientation proved highly compatible with the nascent mining economy of the late nineteenth century as companies demanded a steady stream of cheap labor. Kruger did not hesitate to impose new taxes or to facilitate aggressive labor recruiting practices to induce Africans to work the mines.7 The mining companies themselves offered Whites excellent opportunities for advancement, including to supervisory roles, while maintaining poor pay, harsh conditions, and professional stagnation for Blacks. And in 1895, acting on the behest of the mining industry, Kruger’s government introduced a set of laws that required Africans to hold special passes for work authorization or for any form of movement into the Witwatersrand, limiting the influx of Africans from rural areas and granting employers enormous control over their workforces.8 Such pass laws became a cornerstone of institutionalized White supremacy in twentieth-century South Africa. From the start, life in and around Krugersdorp was racially segregated. Blacks recruited to work in the mines lived in compounds or dormitories, or in some cases squatted on White settlements,9 and all were required to shop at “native stores.” While many also participated in the often wild and lawless behavior characteristic of the mining town, they received a different brand of justice for their misdeeds: Black men were routinely apprehended, tried, imprisoned, and hanged for violent behavior, and they faced all-White juries, prosecutors, and judges. White men who committed violence against Blacks tended to be fined rather than imprisoned, and they frequently justified their actions as assaults on “laziness” and “insubordination” among local Africans, which in that context was accepted as a reasonable defense.10 In 1894, a Krugersdorp regulation prohibited Africans from walking on the sidewalks, a response to White complaints of being “jostled” on the pathways; and Whites began to demand separate queues in various public spaces. As early as 1895, White local leaders sought to keep Africans from the town center, especially from the sacred Paardekraal Monument.11 FIGURE 4.2. Map of two Boer republics and two British colonies (c. 1900). FIGURE 4.3.

Today both are protected by electric fencing. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Even amid shared anti-Black racism among European-descended people in southern Africa, there had never been White unity in the region. In fact, during the late nineteenth century, the pressing “race question” was the enduring conflict between the British and Afrikaners. Conflicts erupted over how to govern the highly profitable mining economy, and in 1899, the British Crown went to war with Kruger and the Afrikaner republics. In what initially appeared to be a profound mismatch between a global military power and a small, decentralized guerilla resistance, the Boer War turned out to be a bloody three-year conflagration and severely tested the prowess of the mighty British Empire. Ultimately, the Afrikaners surrendered, but the epic battle ended with Black Africans—not even direct parties to the conflict—losing the most in the peace process. The British had previously appealed to potential Black soldiers that they should serve on their side because a decisive British victory would lead to much better treatment in the future.12 However, hopes for improved conditions were dashed as the 1902 treaty ending the war stated that “the granting of the franchise to the natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.” For a place like Krugersdorp, this meant sustained exclusion, as Blacks had never had the right to vote there and would not get it now. Moreover, the new government enacted a new set of pass laws restricting African movement, and the mines cut African wages.13 Blacks were forbidden from residing in the White town except with special permission and the local government imposed a curfew prohibiting any movement during certain hours.14 It reflected just one of the many ways in which Black adults were treated in a childlike manner. The 1909 South Africa Act establishing the new Union of South Africa largely sealed the fate of Black Africans and other people of color throughout the territory. First, only Whites—constituting less than 22 percent of the population at the time15—would be able to sit in Parliament. Second, in the new provinces constituted by the former Orange Free State, Transvaal, and Natal, only Whites would vote. And third, only in the Cape Province, at least temporarily, Blacks who met stringent qualifications would retain access to the vote, but this right would be short-lived and was removed with the 1936 Native Representation Act.16 Meanwhile, irrespective of race, no women would be allowed the vote, and I am not aware of any evidence that this was raised as a significant political issue. Despite the economic costs of job reservations and residential segregation, the government soon committed itself to the approach. All the local White governments were authorized to do what was already being practiced in Krugersdorp under local laws: control the entry and exit of Black migrants into their towns and require Blacks to live in segregated areas.17 Other legislation codified protections for White labor with reservations for more skilled and better-paying jobs, so they would not face serious threats from an abundant Black African workforce.18 On the gold mines in and near Krugersdorp, where over 42,000 Europeans and over 319,000 people of color were employed in 1945, the wage gap was enormous: Africans working on the Witwatersrand earned approximately 42 pounds per year, while the average annual wage for Europeans was seven to ten times greater.19 During those early years, the government further legislated the “morality” of White supremacy with the 1927 Immorality Act, prohibiting sexual relations between Whites and non-Whites. And yet it was only following the 1948 election of the National Party that the dystopian plan for Apartheid government was realized and the ideology of White supremacy was institutionalized in its most elaborate form. A month before the general election, the party’s leader, Daniel Francois Malan, criticized the ruling United Party government for failing to sufficiently regulate Black movement in the country, especially to the cities; for its neglect of the economy; and for liberal immigration policies—too many Black Africans coming in across the northern border. The “Nats” campaigned on White fears of a “Black peril” and concern for the welfare of poor Whites, a problem that was disproportionately prevalent among Afrikaners.20 Promoting such fear as justification, Malan’s party offered a “solution,” in the form of Apartheid: a series of far-reaching policies and practices that would more definitively realize the goal of a White South Africa. The notorious Apartheid regime has reached such metaphoric status that it remains, even today, a label used beyond South Africa to describe unjust segregation, particularly in a manner that reinforces profound socioeconomic inequality. Within a few years, work, education, housing, landownership, and virtually every sector of society were regulated along racial lines in order to maintain benefits for Whites. The 1950 Population Registration Act required that all adults hold an identity card attesting to their racial classification, which itself would become a virtual internal passport for access to citizenship. In the rare circumstances when people did the same work, Africans earned substantially lower wages compared with Whites.21 Although education had never been truly integrated or equal, the Apartheid architect Hendrik Verwoerd endeavored a more thoroughgoing approach to institutionalize White supremacy. In a speech to Parliament, he targeted not just African students but also their teachers: “The Bantu [African] teacher … must learn not to feel above his community, with a consequent desire to become integrated into the life of the European community.”22 By one estimate, in 1953, the government spent 68 pounds per year to educate White students, 20 pounds for Coloured and Asian students, and just 8 pounds on African students.23 In just about every facet of life, Blacks faced higher costs and tougher constraints, and few earning and other opportunities. They paid higher food prices. They paid sales taxes in White Krugersdorp, which only contributed to the White tax base. They had little access to credit and were highly regulated in their economic activities by the White government.24 And yet, in order to begin to understand how any Black South Africans—particularly in modern Mogale City—could have recalled life under Apartheid government as even minimally acceptable in comparative terms (as discussed in the prior chapter), it is also important to recognize that the White government did provide some basic services. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, like in several urban areas, the government built rows of very small houses, albeit initially without electricity or running water. Eventually, many Kagiso and Munsieville residents would gain access to running water, sewerage and refuse removal, postal services, education, and limited recreational facilities. The government developed an industrial zone on the edge of Kagiso, Chamdor, intended to keep Blacks out of Krugersdorp in line with a strategy of “separate development,” but it also employed thousands of workers.25 Whatever Black development might have occurred during the twentieth century in Munsieville and Kagiso, it was vastly overshadowed by the rapid increases in the quality of life enjoyed by Whites. Successive White governments throughout the twentieth century managed to build a highly effective state, one that helped the private sector prosper, particularly in the extraction of precious metals and minerals. The South African government developed one of the world’s most progressive and efficient tax systems, which in turn contributed to the government’s ability to maintain order, project power, and largely wipe out White poverty—which had been significant in the 1930s.26 GDP growth between 1960 and 1970 ranged from 4 percent to 8 percent,27 faster than that in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, and if the goal was prosperity for Whites, Apartheid was extremely successful. While the British Empire—epitomized by the politician and mining magnate John Cecil Rhodes—had technically won the war to control South Africa’s future, the soul of South African government became fully embodied in the fallen Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger. In 1967, the government treasury minted its first Krugerrand in an effort to market gold—and the country—to the wider world. This one-ounce coin, made almost entirely of pure gold, was a source of value, strength, and history. The front depicted Kruger’s full face and his long, lion-mane of a beard, shaven around the mouth, with no trace of a moustache. And the “rand” refers to the South African currency, which itself was named after the Witwatersrand, where South Africa’s world-class mining industry developed. It is hard to avoid the irony that this man—who sought to insulate himself and his people from the internationalist capitalist project of Rhodes and the British Empire—would adorn this coin, minted in the one true international store of value. The Krugerrand achieved iconic status, at one point accounting for 90 percent of the gold coins in circulation around the world.28 South Africa developed world-class infrastructure, a sophisticated financial sector, and a diversified economy. Throughout the twentieth century, White Krugersdorpers would increasingly enjoy paved streets, lovely houses, and an elected town council. It was not a place for the fabulously wealthy; it wasn’t filled with the famed “Randlord” mansions of Johannesburg’s leafy suburbs. Still, for the sizable White minority, it was comfortable living, largely unlike anything elsewhere on the continent north of the Limpopo River. In its quest to reserve this bounty for Whites, the Apartheid government was wildly ambitious in its social and political engineering. The National Party developed and began to implement what came to be known as “grand Apartheid,” the creation of separate and independent homelands or Bantustans (literally, a home for Bantu people) for distinct Black African groups that, according to the White government, constituted distinct nations. The basic premise was that once a particular language or ethnic group had a corresponding government, individuals from that group would officially become citizens of that new country and be forced to forsake claims on the South African state. The plan did not take into consideration the fact that in many cases, no such “groups” existed in the sense that language was not tantamount to nationhood. Black African social and political organization in no way fit neatly into the categories that the Apartheid government wanted the world to believe existed, let alone was there a match between these language categories and the tracts of land designated as ancestral homes. For the area around Krugersdorp, such a strategy implied that Tswana speakers, who had dominated the area long before Kruger’s arrival, would be assigned to a new country, carved from within South Africa’s borders, called Bophuthatswana. “Bop” was an absurd creation, and its arbitrary boundaries had no historical basis. In fact, because the South African government did not want to upset White property owners, it drew those national boundaries in such a way as to keep those Whites within South Africa. As a result, Bop consisted of nineteen noncontiguous fragments, some separated by hundreds of miles of South African land.29 By decree of the Status of Bophuthatswana Act of 1977, Tswana speakers in the area were overnight made into citizens of a strange new country that would not be recognized by any other state apart from South Africa.30 The South African government did not manage to move most of the tens of thousands of Tswana speakers living around Krugersdorp into this new country, but that was the plan. And it was certainly implemented at least in part, at great financial cost both to the government and to those who were moved: between 1960 and 1980, a total of 3.5 million people were resettled to Bophuthatswana, the Transkei, Ciskei, Venda, and other nascent homelands.31 Although foreign governments did not recognize the homelands as legitimate, these creations still proved consequential for the future in a number of ways. First, the homeland system fragmented the authority of government administration and gave rise to the development of a cadre of government leaders and bureaucrats who would become invested in their new jobs and, in some cases, develop an attachment to their proto-states. In fact, Bop’s president, Lucas Mangope, fiercely resisted the larger political transition and collaborated with White right-wing extremists to try to hang on to power in the early 1990s.32 And perhaps it is only fair to point out that during interviews, a few Mogale residents recalled Bophuthatswana with some fondness, as a place that was reasonably orderly and where education was valued. Of all the former homelands, Bop had the reputation of being the most efficiently administered. FIGURE 4.4. Map of Bophuthatswana “homeland” in South Africa (c. 1980). By creating separate homelands for particular ethnolinguistic groups, the government sowed the seeds of potential Black interethnic division. The noted legal and political scholar Donald Horowitz argued in his forward-looking 1991 book, A Democratic South Africa?, that the homelands reflected one important aspect of a multiply divided society. He concluded that “for the moment, it is obvious that, if attitudes are any guide, a nonracial society is not around the corner. Neither is a nonethnic society.” In turn, with respect to a democratic future, he warned of the “perils of wishful thinking” and the various ethnic and subethnic conflicts that might come to the fore in a post-Apartheid future.33 Resistance: Demands for Dignity and Ungovernability The thoroughgoing and explicitly exclusionary nature of White rule gave rise to one of the most storied resistance movements in modern history. With clear hindsight, we can say that the movement was ultimately successful in bringing decisive change and bestowing an ideologically committed political leadership on the country. The liberation struggle articulated a set of values and demands that would shape many contours of the democratic era and can be used as a benchmark for success even today. Yet, it is also important to recognize that the path to such change was itself divisive and, eventually, deliberately destabilizing. Any examination of life in South Africa in the post-1994 period must appreciate the quality and extent of the dangerous, frequently violent conditions and disruption of political order precipitated by the resistance campaign, all of which were like veritable land mines for future development. Diplomatic and Intellectual Origins Opposition to White rule began peacefully and diplomatically, frequently led by Black intellectuals arguing their case on the basis of appeals to the idea of universal human rights. The first, most concerted challenge to the Union government was ignited in 1912 by the proposal for a Native Lands Act. This policy promised to restrict Black African landownership to about 13 percent of the territory. A group of distraught, Black, mission-educated attorneys and tribal chiefs came together to strategize about how to block this draft bill; and they gave birth to the forerunner to the modern ANC in the form of the South African Native National Congress. The now legendary Black intellectual, journalist, and eventual political mobilizer Solomon (“Sol”) Plaatje wrote of dashed hopes and humiliations in the face of the new Union’s approach to Black Africans. Born in 1876 to Tswana Christians who worked for White missionaries, for many years he had placed his faith in British promises of a more liberal order. Plaatje pleaded, “We have as much right as they to be governed on the same basis of humanity.”34 Plaatje became the first secretary-general of the organization and, as he did in earlier years, took the opportunity to travel to London and to appeal directly to the British, remaining ever hopeful that reason would prevail. He argued his case in the newspaper he edited, Tsala ea Bechuana, and his columns were reprinted in various White newspapers.35 And yet, the writing was soon on the wall that the new South African government would sacrifice prewar promises of racial inclusion for Blacks in favor of White unity.36 Plaatje recalled the “indescribable” disappointment following the passage of the Native Lands Act, which he politely depicted as “full of rude shocks.” He wrote, “Awaking on Friday morning, June 20, 1913 the South African Native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.”37 Notwithstanding such assaults, one of the steadfast contradictions of White rule in South Africa—which Plaatje himself embodied—was the persistence of a few key institutions and opportunities for Black advance that opened space for formulating coherent demands for political freedom. One institution in particular—the University of Fort Hare38—produced an unprecedented legion of visionary Black graduates. Missionaries established the university in 1916 on the site of a former British military stronghold in the eastern part of the Cape Province (today, the Eastern Cape) with just twenty students.39 One of the first African professors to join the faculty from Fort Hare’s earliest days was Davidson Jabavu, the son of a prominent political activist and journalist from Sol Plaatje’s era.40 Jabavu himself studied in London and the United States, including at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, the first institution of African American higher education. His wife, Florence Tandiswa Jabavu (née Makiwane), was a graduate of another noted missionary school, Lovedale College, where she briefly taught, and considered to be an educational equal to her husband, which their community viewed as an important attribute in matches.41 At Fort Hare, Davidson Jabavu wrote about the problems of racial segregation. He and the initially largely White faculty educated a remarkable abundance of South African liberation leaders, albeit with a range of perspectives about how to achieve liberation. These included Sol Plaatje’s cousin Zachariah Keodirelang “ZK” Matthews (an ANC leader and leading academic), Nelson Mandela,42 Robert Sobukwe (who would form the PAC, a breakaway organization from the ANC, one that emphasized “Africanism” over the ANC’s “non-racialism”), and Mangosuthu Buthelezi (who also began his political career with the ANC before founding and leading the IFP). According to Mandela, it was at Fort Hare that he began his lifelong struggle with unjust authority. Despite having initially narrower ambitions of becoming a civil servant and reclaiming his family’s wealth and prestige, political engagement attracted him. For example, as a freshman he organized his fellow “freshers” to challenge a tradition that excluded their participation in community governance. He would only stay for two years, because in refusing to accede to an arranged marriage, he fled to Johannesburg. Nonetheless, at this missionary school he was first introduced to the ANC, the struggle against White supremacy, and his long-time friend and comrade Oliver Tambo.43 The small university’s reach into African liberation politics was astounding. For example, Desmond Tutu served as the school’s Anglican chaplain for a period in the 1960s. And although only approximately 10 percent of the 324 graduates in 1946 were women,44 some, including Vuyiswa “Tiny” Nokwe and Sally Maunye, emerged as dedicated freedom fighters during the decades of political struggle.45 And even far beyond South Africa, Fort Hare educated many of the continent’s liberation leaders. Seretse Khama (first president of Botswana), Julius Nyerere (first president of Tanzania), Kenneth Kaunda (first president of Zambia), Robert Mugabe (long-time president of Zimbabwe), and other prominent future dignitaries were all students there.46 Protest While the ideational foundations for resistance—including calls for greater attention to human dignity—were established during the first half of the twentieth century, the opposition movement gained substantial momentum from the implementation of the Apartheid system. Three key protest events—all of which took place in relative proximity to greater Krugersdorp—proved critical: the launch of the Freedom Charter document at Kliptown, the Sharpeville protest and massacre, and the Soweto uprising. The launch of the Freedom Charter was a peaceful and solidaristic declaration of goals and aspirations for liberation. Z. K. Matthews had proposed in his 1953 presidential address to the ANC’s Cape Province conference that there ought to be a democratic gathering to incorporate ideas about the type of change that was needed in the country.47 Two years later, the call for a “Congress of the People” materialized on June 26, 1955, in Soweto’s Kliptown, about twenty miles south of Krugersdorp. Approximately three thousand Black, White, Coloured, and Indian leaders and delegates from various liberation organizations gathered into a fenced-in open area, marking the most racially representative gathering in the history of the country. They took turns reading aloud the product of those solicitations, which crystallized a shared vision for the future, a demand for dignified treatment, and a fundamental reordering of an increasingly rigid racial hierarchy. The document was written by a small committee, including Matthews and others of various racial identities.48 The charter proposed, as a solution to the problem of racial oppression, a democracy rooted in non-racialism—that is, a universal humanism, rejecting the false biological notion of race.49 This idea, which also appeared in several speeches delivered by ANC leader Albert Luthuli, guided the ANC for decades. And yet, it also proved somewhat controversial because on the one hand, radicals deplored the explicit recognition of “all national groups and races” as being too close to Apartheid thinking,50 while other Black leaders rejected the inclusion of Whites in their resistance, arguing instead for a purely Africanist movement. Nonetheless, the idea of “non-racialism” captured the imagination of millions, remained central to ANC strategy, and won the sympathies of Black and White liberals inside and outside the country. FIGURE 4.5. Proximity of politically relevant sites on the Witwatersrand. The Freedom Charter made several explicit demands: to end segregation and discrimination; for equal rights to the productive resources of the economy and to land; to equal treatment before the law; and to rights to shelter, education, housing, jobs, and health care. These shaped the resistance agenda for decades to come. This impulse to more publicly and forcefully advocate for radical change began to permeate the lives of citizens who resented the system but did not yet fundamentally resist it. It concluded: THESE FREEDOMS WE WILL FIGHT FOR, SIDE BY SIDE, THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES, UNTIL WE HAVE WON OUR LIBERTY As the years dragged on without fundamental change, others who were active in the resistance movement called for more aggressive confrontation, resulting, quite notably, in the pass-burning protest in Sharpeville in 1960. In prior years, the South African government arrested millions of Black people based on invalid or unstamped passes or the failure to carry a pass—what had come to be known among Africans as dompas or “dumb passes.” On March 21, thousands of protesters—organized by Sobukwe’s PAC51—arrived at the Sharpeville police station without their passes, and some brought them simply to overtly destroy or burn them on the police premises. A scuffle prompted a violent police response against an unarmed crowd. Without warning to disperse, police fired hundreds of rounds aimed directly at the people who had gathered to protest. It was an unexpected massacre. Approximately 69 people died and 180 were seriously wounded.52 The massacre marked an entirely new chapter in the resistance movement. The Turn to Violence Even prior to Sharpeville, Nelson Mandela’s political star had been rising, and he increasingly promoted active defiance of the Apartheid regime. Frustrated by the lack of progress, he and others considered the possible need for a violent response. And finally in 1961, in the aftermath of Sharpeville, he joined other key ANC leaders in launching Umkhonto we Sizwe, “Spear of the Nation,” also known as MK, the militant wing of the ANC.53 On December 16, a day notable in various years of Afrikaner nationalist history including the 1838 victory at the battle of Blood River, the 1880 start of the First Boer War, and the opening of the Paardekraal Monument by Paul Kruger in 1891, MK introduced itself to the country with a series of bomb explosions in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and Durban.54 Using homemade bombs, MK soldiers targeted what the famed resistance leader Joe Slovo called “symbols of the economy” like power stations and “symbols of oppression,”55 such as “Bantu Administration” offices. These locations were intentionally targeted while empty, as MK was at this time committed to only sabotage, as opposed to guerilla warfare, terrorism, or revolution, and the only known death that resulted was that of an MK soldier. The MK framed the turn to violence as a response to a “government policy of force, repression and violence,” citing the imposition of martial law and the violence of the Sharpeville Massacre.56 MK followed up with approximately two hundred similar attacks, intended—according to Mandela—to “bring the Government and its supporters to their senses.”57 Sobukwe’s PAC developed its own formidable underground military organization, Poqo, which was particularly strong around Krugersdorp in the Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville. In 1963, four Poqo members were arrested for killing a Black police officer, a charge they denied.58 The “Munsieville Four,” as they were called, were tried and convicted of a politically motivated crime and sentenced to death. They appealed, arguing that they had killed no one and were fighting for land, but the appeal failed.59 The next year, on June 16, they were hanged by the White government, making them martyrs in their community.60 The White government spared no expense to capture MK members. This included increased spending on the police and military as well as expanding tools of control such as bannings and house arrests.61 It extended new powers to its security forces, including the right to detain and hold subjects for “one or more” twelve-day periods, without bringing them before the court.62 In 1963, the Apartheid government’s security forces tracked down and arrested sixteen MK leaders about twenty-five miles east of Krugersdorp who were hiding out in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia. Ten of its leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were tried on a variety of charges, including sabotage and conspiracy, in the Pretoria High Court. From jail, Mandela became a global icon. At times the South African state government managed to convince a few Western leaders that he and the ANC were “terrorists.” But most of the world would recognize them as “freedom fighters,” and their incarceration and banning became lightning rods for opposition to Apartheid. Following Mandela’s arrest, his wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, stepped up her own political activity and leadership, sometimes through violent insurgency.63 With the top ANC leaders all under arrest, the seeds of further Black resistance were more quietly sown in the development of a Black Consciousness movement, one that focused on Black self-reliance and the mental effects of racial domination. Its intellectual founder, Steve Biko—a man frequently likened to and surely influenced by Malcolm X—challenged the multiracial approach of the ANC. And these ideas and the organizations they engendered helped give rise to the ultimately critical political uprisings of the 1970s, including massive labor strikes and the Soweto revolt of 1976.64 Indeed, 1976 was a watershed year in South African political history, one that today connotes a single event: on June 16, thousands of students from Soweto-area high schools participated in what was planned to be a peaceful march and boycott against the indignities of a government decree that Black students learn in Afrikaans. Inculcated in the ideas of Black Consciousness, the student leaders hoped that their defiance would be recognized, and it was, perhaps beyond both their dreams and their nightmares. One Mogale City resident living in Kagiso at the time recalled rising early in the morning to pick up students from various schools, organizing to march with placards in their hands. “We prepared ourselves for tear gas,” which was indeed used against the students. “But then the police started shooting. I remember when the police started shooting. We used the steel lids of the dustbins to protect ourselves.” The students resisted, many by throwing rocks, and the police escalated with live ammunition. The extent of state repression put the country irrevocably on the global map of pariah states. One police station commander, Colonel Johannes Augustinus Kleingeld, later admitted to ordering the use of dog and baton attacks and to personally throwing three canisters of tear gas into the crowd and shooting a machine gun on the first day of the uprising.65 He was eventually absolved of responsibility for killing Hastings Ndlovu, the first casualty of that day, after shooting him at point-blank range. Furthermore, Malcolm Klein, a medical officer from the casualty unit at Baragwanath Hospital, testified that almost all the bullet wounds he attended to were above the belt.66 Police violence continued throughout much of the period of the Soweto uprising. In Alexandra, which experienced the second-highest levels, the local police killed 29 people on June 18 alone.67 Even a government investigation of the events between June 16, 1976, and February 28, 1977, indicated an official death count of 575 across various urban areas throughout the country.68 Of these deaths, at least 23 occurred on the first day and 176 in June 1976. The government’s report noted the police’s widespread use of “dangerous means” to counter protests and riots, including dogs, baton charges, and firearms.69 News of the event spread widely, and the horrific scenes of the confrontation were captured in still and video photography. One image in particular—the limp body of twelve-year-old Hector Pieterson being carried by an older activist—emerged as the iconic symbol of the entire standoff. No Apartheid apologist could deny the obvious: an innocent Black child had been shot dead by the Apartheid police. And although South Africans had just gained access to television earlier that year, broadcasts of government brutality aired overseas. It shook the world and reverberated back in South Africa as White business leaders and diplomats found themselves increasingly condemned and isolated by countries around the world. In the years that followed, protests continued at Black schools. While Black education was already of poor quality, the loss of education for a large share of a generation of students following the 1976 uprising remains a powerful and painful legacy of that time. The government aggressively cracked down on suspected political agitators. Within six months, many Kagiso community leaders disappeared. Six months after that, Rev. Frank Chikane, trying to investigate their whereabouts, found himself under arrest. Chikane had begun a new post ministering in Kagiso just one week before the Soweto uprising started. In the manner of Tutu before him, he became increasingly active in politics. After his arrest, he faced six weeks of interrogation and physical torture, including being forced to stand in one spot for fifty hours, sleep deprivation, and repeated assaults. He noticed that the man supervising his torture was a deacon in the White branch of his Apostolic Faith Church.70 Such cruelty became hallmark Apartheid policy. Famously, in 1977, Steve Biko died from injuries sustained from police brutality under state custody. Chikane managed to survive, despite being instructed by the police that he ought to take his own life. In January 1978, in Krugersdorp court, he was freed when an Afrikaans-speaking judge announced there was no case against him.71 By the 1980s, several strands of the liberation movement committed themselves to making the country ungovernable. Politicized youth, emboldened by the impact of the uprising, continued to mobilize, sometimes in quite destructive ways. For example, in 1984, Tshepo Nzwane—a local councillor I met in Mogale City in 2019—led the Kagiso branch of the Congress of South African Students and, in the tradition of the 1976 youth, repeatedly questioned authority at every turn. His teenage irreverence led him to take an action that he recalled to me with regret. He explained that he was desperate to meet his heroes, including Nelson Mandela, who were serving their prison sentences on Robben Island. He could think of only one way to reach them. I was still at school. But I made a wrong decision. That wrong decision was I bombed a school. I did a petrol bomb. Kagiso high school. The reason I did that, I wanted to be arrested so I could go and see them. To me, it was a big thing, so that I should know what has inspired them. I was advised that it wasn’t charged as being political. It was a public crime … because there’s no political motivation. They beat me. I stayed for three weeks unconscious, and then in the high court I challenged the statement that I was made to sign. Nzwane was just sixteen when he was sent to prison. I was the youngest person in South Africa to stay in detention in solitary confinement for two years. They linked me with a lot of terrorists. They couldn’t trust me because they knew I could mobilize because I used to mobilize people in detention. In 1985, I won the case in July. I was outside the head court and then [subsequently] arrested by someone from the special branch in Krugersdorp … and I was put back … for fourteen days, and then [the] state of emergency was introduced in 1986. Then I was in detention without trial. I would stay up until the end of the state of emergency. I stayed there 85, 86, 87, 88. [In] 89 I was released. Even following De Klerk’s 1990 speech, conflict and violence persisted, including in the area around Krugersdorp. For example, national tensions between ANC and IFP supporters flared up in Kagiso, and deadly fights broke out.72 One of the worst such conflicts occurred in the Swaneville section of Kagiso in May 1991,73 when IFP supporters from one hostel attacked ANC members in their homes with knives, spears, and sticks. As many as fifty were killed in a massacre that was not widely reported at the time. Many others were left disabled, and houses, cars, and personal belongings were destroyed by fire.74 The PAC and ANC also remained mired in conflict. On the one hand, it was philosophical: the ANC “Charterists” subscribed to the non-racialist tenets of the Freedom Charter, while the PAC “Africanists” argued that Black leaders must champion the fight for dignity on their own. Conflicts could also devolve into parochial skirmishes at the local level. PAC leaders accused ANC members in Munsieville of systematically attacking them and driving out seventy of their members. In turn, the ANC accused the PAC of acting in bad faith and jeopardizing unity.75 Much of the anti-Apartheid movement was nonviolent, and I do not discuss here the diverse range of organizations and movements that played critical roles in the larger campaign. Such efforts were highly consequential, in fact sometimes far more central than the violent and exiled segments of the resistance movement, and they laid the foundation for potentially coherent governance during the post-Apartheid era. In particular, the umbrella organizations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), played key roles in mobilizing grassroots organizations and trade unions, respectively.76 Nonetheless, I have highlighted some of the internal divisions and the development of tactics that included promoting ungovernability and violence in order to make clear the extent to which these patterns were becoming ever more deeply rooted in the country, even as Apartheid was crumbling. Existential Crisis and Counterresistance By the late 1980s, South Africa was in a state of existential crisis. The government was under siege within and outside its borders, forced to defend a system decried almost universally as unjust. The South African Defense Force deployed increasing numbers of troops to fight in multiple conflicts in the southern African region, all related to the persistence of Apartheid. Meanwhile ordinary White citizens had grown accustomed to the lifestyles afforded by a century of White government buoyed by a thriving mining industry. South Africa had become the most unequal country on the planet,77 and as Whites sat atop this steep socioeconomic ladder, many desperately wanted to hang on as they began to fear losing it all. In Krugersdorp, the town council tried to placate its White residents by sustaining various segregationist policies that were in retreat in many of the larger cities. For example, in early 1986, the council voted to maintain the local movie theater for “Whites only.”78 And it turned down the library guild’s request to desegregate.79 The best the Krugersdorp public library would offer was a separate location that Indians could use should the need arise. Not all White Krugersdorpers resisted the pressures for change. Many were burdened by the fact that global sympathies were against them. Residents sent letters to the Krugersdorp News about the shame they felt regarding the segregationist policies as change was coming to South Africa. “Why can’t we watch movies together?” One resident highlighted that White and Black futures were intertwined and pleaded that if the policies didn’t change, the town would likely lose their one theater because American film companies were prohibiting the screening of films in segregated theaters.80 Some big businesses appealed to citizens to adapt. For example, Clem Sunter, a “scenario planner” for Anglo-American, one of South Africa’s largest mining houses, wrote a series of books and articles trying to map out the different courses that South Africa might take. In July 1988, he spoke to a packed Krugersdorp Town Hall, describing two possible outcomes, a “high road” and a “low road,” the latter being one of protracted conflict. Sunter asked whether South Africa might become a wasteland, whether the destruction of Beirut might be their future or something that resembled shared prosperity.81 The latter, he said, required compromise and for all actors to move to the “center.” Despite the best efforts of Sunter and others, the compromise-breeds-shared-prosperity thesis did not capture everyone’s imagination. The intransigent spirit of Krugersdorp’s namesake very much lived on among a large number of Whites in the area, particularly in a man by the name of Eugene Terre’blanche, who founded the neo-fascist, Afrikaner nationalist Afrikaner-weerstandsbeweging (AWB) resistance movement in the early 1970s. Terre’blanche was born about eighty miles west of Krugersdorp. His grandfather fought in the Anglo-Boer War, and he served in the South African police force. He was fiercely disillusioned by the partial reforms being undertaken by the National Party, which he took as signs of unnecessary weakness. Like Kruger, he sported a thick beard and cut an imposing figure. In February 1986, Terre’blanche called on AWB branches of the West Rand to form vigilante groups. In November of that year, he held a rally at the Jan Lotz stadium in downtown Krugersdorp. And where the National Party (NP) government had once been viewed as the champion of the Afrikaner, Terre’blanche now said that in its negotiations with the ANC, the NP had become traitorous. To this crowd he proclaimed that “the Government keeps giving to Blacks and the Blacks keep destroying.”82 Terre’blanche’s calls to action quickly translated into bouts of devastating violence: Whites bludgeoned a Kagiso man to death and bodies of Blacks were burned beyond recognition. Terre’blanche had previously been dismissed as a joke—a backward, harmless extremist—but he became very real, arriving with a cavalry and the banner of his AWB, eerily reminiscent of a swastika.83 Terre’blanche’s organization remained outside formal politics, but in 1982, the right wing of the National Party broke off, and its dissidents formed the Conservative Party (CP). As the prospect of the end of Apartheid as they knew it began to come into focus, Terre’blanche and his sympathizers in the Conservative Party began to discuss the idea of an inverted homeland system—one in which Afrikaners would wall themselves into their own Volkstaat.84 In essence, they wanted a return to the Boer republics of the type Paul Kruger had once governed. By 1992, a majority of Whites nationwide said they supported De Klerk’s efforts—a sentiment that the state president elicited by holding an all-White referendum in which two-thirds of voters ticked “yes” next to the question, “Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new Constitution through negotiation?” However, many did so begrudgingly, and a large minority was fully opposed, especially in Krugersdorp. In fact, a week after De Klerk’s speech releasing Mandela, the CP-dominated Krugersdorp council voted to persist with its segregation policies, despite being aware of the economic costs this might impose. It resolved, by a vote of 7–4,85 to keep the library and a health clinic reserved for Whites only.86 Krugersdorp’s local extremists began to use their stage to attract national attention. First, neo-Nazi Terre’blanche rode through Krugersdorp on horseback to remind potential followers and opponents of a powerful legacy of guerilla warfare against British and various Black African groups. Violence followed. In 1993, eight AWB members set up an unauthorized roadblock in Krugersdorp, murdered four Blacks and injured six others, and gruesomely cut off the ear of one of their victims as a trophy that they displayed to their commander.87 Some set their sights on much bigger targets. The most pivotal would be the assassination of fifty-year-old Chris Hani. On April 10, 1993, Janusz Waluś, a far-right Polish immigrant, shot and killed the beloved ANC and MK leader, also an alumnus of Fort Hare. Waluś and a man named Clive Derby-Lewis were imprisoned for his murder. Derby-Lewis was a CP politician from Krugersdorp who had previously expressed his desire to preserve Afrikaner supremacy by declaring support for the forced removal of Black Munsieville residents to make way for the expansion of the White Dan Pienaarville suburb.88 He had even announced he would stand for office in the next election to fill a vacant seat on the Krugersdorp council.89 However, the murder in which he conspired had exactly the opposite effect compared with what he had intended for the future of White South Africa. Nationally, Hani’s death put the country back on the edge of unraveling. Hani had been a revered leader of the liberation movement, particularly among the more radicalized youth, and prior to the unbanning of the ANC frequently trained outside the country as an MK operative. When he returned, he took over the leadership of the South African Communist Party (SACP) and, like Mandela, favored suspension of the armed struggle in order to negotiate peace. After his death, protests erupted and Mandela, still negotiating with the White government, pleaded for calm. But if there was a silver lining to Hani’s tragic death, it was that it hastened the agreement on the timing of the first multiparty election, quickly declared to be in April 1994. Many White Krugersdorpers still wouldn’t relent, and some claimed that Derby-Lewis was “framed” to ensure he didn’t get elected to the council.90 His wife, Gaye, argued against the “tyranny of the ANC” and called for a White resistance movement that would include cutting power and stopping trains.91 But such calls fell on increasingly deaf ears. Derby-Lewis and Waluś were both sentenced to death. (Because the death penalty was abolished in 1995 under ANC government, both sentences were later commuted to life in prison.)92 Predictions and Prognostications By the late 1980s and early 1990s, predictions, opinions, and prognostications for the future of South Africa were conflicted and divided. One thing was certain: no one shared the optimistic euphoria of the wave of African independence from the 1960s. In those days, the promising rise of inspiring nationalist leaders in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, and other countries across the continent along with first elections following the departure of colonizing Europeans were followed by decades of political and economic disarray and the collapse of democratic hopes. And indeed, it was those very failures that the White South African government had long and cynically trumpeted as a raison d’être for their sustained rule: those Black Africans can’t govern themselves, they argued. As balanced pundits noted in the early 1990s, the South Africans certainly had several things on their side. One, ironically, was the cautionary tale of these prior failures.93 They could now more carefully consider the rules of engagement and the possible pitfalls of particular concentrations of power. Few would take for granted that the end of one unjust system would necessarily herald something better. Moreover, South Africa boasted substantial economic resources as an Upper-middle-income country; many sectors of the government functioned well; a strong and vibrant civil society had emerged in the wake of the anti-Apartheid movement; and it had a deep class of liberation leaders, thoughtful and demonstrating strong commitment to broad principles developed over decades of struggle. Along with other speeches and documents, the Freedom Charter made clear a set of goals and aspirations for democracy, dignity, and development. On the other hand, the challenge of managing ethnic and racial diversity in various parts of the world offered discouraging precedents of what could go wrong. For example, the other major political liberalization of the 1990s, which itself contributed to change in South Africa, was the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And as part of that transition, multiethnic Yugoslavia came apart in bloody conflict. Between 1991 and 1995, over 300,000 people were killed in former Yugoslav republics through conventional warfare and deliberate ethnic cleansing.94 The country was eventually divided into ethnically distinct countries, ironically, the very aspiration of the original Apartheid project. In early April 1994, in the small central African country of Rwanda, a horrific tragedy unfolded. In a place that had once been lauded for its developmental prowess, the indignities of a minority having ruled over a majority were settled with ruthless violence. Hutu extremists murdered as many as 800,000 Tutsis in an intense three-month period, and the conflict, born out of decades of violence, displaced at least a million others, making them into refugees in nearby countries.95 Moreover, the United States remained mired in racial conflict. In most states, cities, and neighborhoods, Blacks and Whites lived very much apart, and huge disparities in quality of life persisted on just about every dimension. In 1992, twenty-eight years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, sections of Los Angeles erupted in violent protest after a jury acquitted four White police officers for yet another case of excessive force against an African American man—in this case, a man named Rodney King. Because the incident had been documented on videotape—at a time prior to the ubiquity of cellphone-based cameras—the gulf between crime and lack of punishment for officers was plain for all to see. Dozens were killed and over two thousand injured in the aftermath.96 What kind of shared future could there be in a place like Krugersdorp and its surroundings, where a White local politician had, just one year earlier, been an accomplice in the assassination of a key ANC leader? Where the White council, with popular support, had for so long rejected the idea of even sharing a movie theater, let alone the council chambers, with people of color? Where a very visible White minority lived in nice houses, many with cars and lifestyles familiar to a European town, while the Black majority lived mostly in a mix of very small homes, with few services, many in iron shanties? On just about every dimension, these groups were worlds apart. And the people of this town, let alone the country, were no strangers to violence. In the afterword of his book After Apartheid: The Future of South Africa, penned in the early 1990s, the Economist reporter Sebastian Mallaby captured the sentiment of many observers when he wrote, “It is easy to be glum about the future of South Africa.” Presciently, he pondered, Twenty years from now, today’s pessimism may seem vindicated: if rich America has failed to cure the poverty of the underclass, there seems little chance that South Africa will. And yet there is a danger in despondency, for it may obscure much of what is good. Measured against the high spirits of Nkrumah’s generation, South Africa will indeed fail. Measured against more reasonable yardsticks, there are grounds for hope.97 In the context of the turbulent and frequently violent politics grabbing the headlines, Whites and Blacks living in South Africa proper, and in its nominally independent homelands, began to prepare for the future, however uncertain it seemed. Whites were pessimistic: in 1993, in a national poll, 65 percent predicted they would be “discriminated against” by a non-White government, with less than 20 percent predicting they would be treated fairly. In fact, the majority of Whites surveyed predicted the economy would get worse, that they would become poorer, that there would be more violence, that they would be less secure, that they would be afraid to criticize, and that there would be higher unemployment. In a follow-up survey taken within a year (of a different random sample), the majority of Whites predicted chaos, autocracy, and violence. Unsurprisingly, the majority of Blacks surveyed about their own futures expressed exactly the opposite expectations. About 84 percent predicted that under the future government, they would be treated “fairly.” Moreover, most felt they would be more secure and more free to criticize and believed that the state would be strong. More than four times as many Blacks said they believed they would be richer (44 percent) in the future compared to those who predicted they would be poorer (11 percent). By contrast, 62 percent of Whites felt they would become poorer and just 4 percent imagined they would be richer.98 Black sentiment was almost surely too hopeful and White sentiment too pessimistic. But the future was coming, including to Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, and the farms of Muldersdrift, where Blacks had never known social, political, or economic equality. The formerly powerless were about to see whether power, attained through democratic means, might help them realize the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, of those who burned their passes at Sharpeville, and of the youth who rose up in Soweto, let alone the likes of Nelson Mandela, who continued to echo the sentiments he expressed at the trial that landed him a twenty-seven-year term in prison. The coming election would mark the most profound political watershed on southern African soil since the formation of the Union in 1909, and perhaps even since the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652.",

      "content": "4 Before Democracy SHAKY FOUNDATIONS MILLIONS OF SOUTH AFRICANS could hardly believe what they were hearing on February 2, 1990, when State President F. W. De Klerk announced to a sitting White Parliament in Cape Town, “The time for reconstruction and reconciliation has arrived.” In his epoch-shifting speech, De Klerk spoke of a “new South Africa” and imminent planning for a “realistic and democratic dispensation.” Although he didn’t utter the word Apartheid even once, it was clear that he was delivering the nails in the coffin for this infamous project—the one his own party unleashed on the country more than four decades earlier. De Klerk concluded by promising that Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners would be set free. Just over a week later, on February 11, Mandela appeared in public for the first time in twenty-seven years and addressed the country and the wider world from outside Cape Town City Hall. A full battalion of police, no longer charged with keeping Mandela captive, was now tasked with protecting the still sturdy former boxer, lawyer, and revolutionary icon from the crowds and any would-be attackers. A few weeks of photo opportunities and celebrations followed, many depicting him holding the hand of his wife—a fiery political leader in her own right—Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. A global audience cheered that one of the most unjust systems of rule in modern history was coming to an end. What was less clear was what would come next. I was an undergraduate student at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy at the time. Incidentally, but quite relatedly, I was wholly ignorant of Wilson’s own racist past, a legacy that would lead the university to remove his name from the school more than two decades later. In the winter of 1991, my junior year, I enrolled in a class taught by the former undersecretary of state for Africa, Donald Easum, to study the unfolding political transition in South Africa. We were presented with the incredible opportunity of traveling to the country at the end of the academic year and committed to a two-week study tour. We interviewed stakeholders and leaders from across the political spectrum and eventually published a report based on that research.1 I arranged to stay in the country on my own for an additional month, which proved to be the inspiration for my future career choice. Flying from New York, we transferred in London—American carriers were still not traveling to the country—and had few fellow tourists on the overnight flight to South Africa. It persisted as a pariah state in many ways and the ANC, still a liberation organization and not yet a political party, continued to advocate for economic sanctions against the country. We landed early on a June morning in 1991 at the Johannesburg airport. It was then named for Jan Smuts—a complicated character who was an Afrikaner general, served as prime minister during multiple stints during the first half of the twentieth century, and was instrumental in consolidating White rule,2 while also contributing to the drafting of the International Declaration of Human Rights.3 The energy in the country was exhilarating. Each morning’s newspaper offered the possibility of a shift in momentum. In Johannesburg, I frequently planted myself in the lobby of the Carlton Hotel, which for years had been designated as an “international hotel”—an Apartheid loophole that allowed in guests from different races, making it a cosmopolitan hub. I would secure the right to a lobby table by ordering a Rooibos tea with milk, which I would sip slowly. From that perch, I watched national and international dignitaries, government leaders, executives, and civic luminaries, Black and White, moving swiftly through the corridors from one backroom negotiation to another. Leaders of various organized interests were all jockeying for a seat at the table and for their wants and needs to be met in the new order. On June 16, our group drove up to the First National Bank soccer stadium in Soweto for a commemorative rally. Easum flashed his still valid diplomatic passport, and the guards waved us onto the floor through the VIP entrance. We joined the tens of thousands of screaming and cheering Black ANC supporters in the stands; they had packed the bleachers on this fifteenth anniversary of a famous student-led rebellion to get a glimpse of the legendary freedom fighter himself. When he arrived, again with Winnie at his side, I managed to snap a photo—no selfies back then—from about ten feet away; it was as close to a living legend as I had ever experienced. The stadium was shaking with joy and adulation. This was their messiah and he had finally come to lift them out of the misery of Apartheid. It would be hard to overstate the crowd’s optimism. Millions of South Africans and observers around the world, including me, initially shared that sense of hopefulness for the country’s future. And yet, that sentiment was quickly clouded with anxiety as escalating conflict and violence threatened the prospects for a peaceful regime change. The political transition unfolded in fits and starts, and at times, it seemed that failure—civil war, economic collapse, the rise of a dictator, or even genocide—was as likely as peace and prosperity. Particularly in Johannesburg, I confronted a sense of insecurity that I would not experience in my own country until the September 11 attacks a decade later: We couldn’t enter a major building without going through a metal detector, and the daily news reports recounted bomb blasts and bloody episodes across the country. Even in the speech in which De Klerk promised transformational political reform, he also declared that the government would maintain a state of emergency owing to persistent violence. I was struck by the razor-wire and electric fences that wealthy and not-so-wealthy Whites had built around their homes. More than a year after Mandela’s release, this was not a country at peace. And in localities like Krugersdorp, still very much segregated in practice, the local newspaper was filled with advertisements for handguns and security systems, as well as reports of new consumer boycotts initiated to maintain steady pressure for ongoing political reform. FIGURE 4.1. Michael Goldberg (left) and Evan Lieberman (center) pose with Nelson Mandela (right) in the Johannesburg airport when our flight to Cape Town was delayed on June 20, 1991.

Nonetheless, in order to fully appreciate what transpired during the first quarter century after Apartheid—the subject of all subsequent chapters—it is critical to put into context what was realistically possible and plausible from the vantage point of the BD period. That is, before democracy. And specifically, what were the social, political, and economic conditions leading up to the first multiracial elections? I will not provide a remotely complete account of South Africa’s complex history, including the rise of and resistance to the Apartheid state, in this single chapter. Rather, I describe two sets of critical and related legacies that weighed heavily on South Africa’s future, including in the area that would become Mogale City. The first is the construction of White government—a contested and several-centuries-long process of consolidating political power. There is no doubt that by the second half of the twentieth century, White South Africans had built a relatively strong and effective state, one that for many years promoted rapid economic development. And to a degree, this proved to be a fortuitous inheritance for the democratic era. Yet, it was an undignified development that excluded the Black majority and left indelible memories of poor treatment that would always be fodder for resentment. In creating vast inequalities between groups, it raised the stakes for subsequent political conflict. Moreover, the government deliberately fragmented the society, and political authority itself, leaving little obvious basis for future unification. Second was the resistance movement, which of course was also quite successful in achieving its main goals, culminating in the dismantling of Apartheid. Moreover, many of the organizations and individuals central to the liberation movement led with a human rights orientation that provided a strong moral basis for the democratic order. However, the movement also became violent. Frustrated by the failures of diplomacy, many turned to a strategy that deliberately sought to undermine political order, and did so in ways that would reverberate even once the resistance campaign came to an end. White Government Perhaps it is trite to say this, but it is critical to spotlight a simple reality: the reason most White South Africans did not want to give up White rule is largely because this style of government delivered vast and secure material prosperity to them. When combined with a moral doctrine that justified racial hierarchy, White people could enjoy the good life, and feel good about it. And yet, the development of White South Africa came at the expense of respect for the dignity of Black people, who constituted the overwhelming majority of the population in the region. While the origins of this system can be traced to European theories of racial superiority and the time before Dutch settlers arrived in the mid-seventeenth century, I focus on the development of the area that would eventually become Mogale City. As I mentioned in chapter 1, Afrikaners began to settle in and around the region as part of a mid-nineteenth-century migration from the southwest—the Great Trek. They encountered Black Africans in the area, including some who had been living there for centuries, and others who had arrived more recently, including through violent conquests of their own.4 Possessing greater military might, the Afrikaners quickly became politically dominant. Particularly after the discovery of gold, successive governments created institutions aimed at degrading and dehumanizing those who were not White or “European.” In 1883, Paul Kruger, an avowed Afrikaner nationalist, became president of the Transvaal Republic,5 one of the four White-led governments that would eventually comprise the provinces of the Union of South Africa. Kruger had long professed a deep-seated racism, frequently referring to Black Africans as “savages” who ought to be ruled over with “justice and morality.”6 And this orientation proved highly compatible with the nascent mining economy of the late nineteenth century as companies demanded a steady stream of cheap labor. Kruger did not hesitate to impose new taxes or to facilitate aggressive labor recruiting practices to induce Africans to work the mines.7 The mining companies themselves offered Whites excellent opportunities for advancement, including to supervisory roles, while maintaining poor pay, harsh conditions, and professional stagnation for Blacks. And in 1895, acting on the behest of the mining industry, Kruger’s government introduced a set of laws that required Africans to hold special passes for work authorization or for any form of movement into the Witwatersrand, limiting the influx of Africans from rural areas and granting employers enormous control over their workforces.8 Such pass laws became a cornerstone of institutionalized White supremacy in twentieth-century South Africa. From the start, life in and around Krugersdorp was racially segregated. Blacks recruited to work in the mines lived in compounds or dormitories, or in some cases squatted on White settlements,9 and all were required to shop at “native stores.” While many also participated in the often wild and lawless behavior characteristic of the mining town, they received a different brand of justice for their misdeeds: Black men were routinely apprehended, tried, imprisoned, and hanged for violent behavior, and they faced all-White juries, prosecutors, and judges. White men who committed violence against Blacks tended to be fined rather than imprisoned, and they frequently justified their actions as assaults on “laziness” and “insubordination” among local Africans, which in that context was accepted as a reasonable defense.10 In 1894, a Krugersdorp regulation prohibited Africans from walking on the sidewalks, a response to White complaints of being “jostled” on the pathways; and Whites began to demand separate queues in various public spaces. As early as 1895, White local leaders sought to keep Africans from the town center, especially from the sacred Paardekraal Monument.11 FIGURE 4.2.

Today both are protected by electric fencing. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Even amid shared anti-Black racism among European-descended people in southern Africa, there had never been White unity in the region. In fact, during the late nineteenth century, the pressing “race question” was the enduring conflict between the British and Afrikaners. Conflicts erupted over how to govern the highly profitable mining economy, and in 1899, the British Crown went to war with Kruger and the Afrikaner republics. In what initially appeared to be a profound mismatch between a global military power and a small, decentralized guerilla resistance, the Boer War turned out to be a bloody three-year conflagration and severely tested the prowess of the mighty British Empire. Ultimately, the Afrikaners surrendered, but the epic battle ended with Black Africans—not even direct parties to the conflict—losing the most in the peace process. The British had previously appealed to potential Black soldiers that they should serve on their side because a decisive British victory would lead to much better treatment in the future.12 However, hopes for improved conditions were dashed as the 1902 treaty ending the war stated that “the granting of the franchise to the natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.” For a place like Krugersdorp, this meant sustained exclusion, as Blacks had never had the right to vote there and would not get it now. Moreover, the new government enacted a new set of pass laws restricting African movement, and the mines cut African wages.13 Blacks were forbidden from residing in the White town except with special permission and the local government imposed a curfew prohibiting any movement during certain hours.14 It reflected just one of the many ways in which Black adults were treated in a childlike manner. The 1909 South Africa Act establishing the new Union of South Africa largely sealed the fate of Black Africans and other people of color throughout the territory. First, only Whites—constituting less than 22 percent of the population at the time15—would be able to sit in Parliament. Second, in the new provinces constituted by the former Orange Free State, Transvaal, and Natal, only Whites would vote. And third, only in the Cape Province, at least temporarily, Blacks who met stringent qualifications would retain access to the vote, but this right would be short-lived and was removed with the 1936 Native Representation Act.16 Meanwhile, irrespective of race, no women would be allowed the vote, and I am not aware of any evidence that this was raised as a significant political issue. Despite the economic costs of job reservations and residential segregation, the government soon committed itself to the approach. All the local White governments were authorized to do what was already being practiced in Krugersdorp under local laws: control the entry and exit of Black migrants into their towns and require Blacks to live in segregated areas.17 Other legislation codified protections for White labor with reservations for more skilled and better-paying jobs, so they would not face serious threats from an abundant Black African workforce.18 On the gold mines in and near Krugersdorp, where over 42,000 Europeans and over 319,000 people of color were employed in 1945, the wage gap was enormous: Africans working on the Witwatersrand earned approximately 42 pounds per year, while the average annual wage for Europeans was seven to ten times greater.19 During those early years, the government further legislated the “morality” of White supremacy with the 1927 Immorality Act, prohibiting sexual relations between Whites and non-Whites. And yet it was only following the 1948 election of the National Party that the dystopian plan for Apartheid government was realized and the ideology of White supremacy was institutionalized in its most elaborate form. A month before the general election, the party’s leader, Daniel Francois Malan, criticized the ruling United Party government for failing to sufficiently regulate Black movement in the country, especially to the cities; for its neglect of the economy; and for liberal immigration policies—too many Black Africans coming in across the northern border. The “Nats” campaigned on White fears of a “Black peril” and concern for the welfare of poor Whites, a problem that was disproportionately prevalent among Afrikaners.20 Promoting such fear as justification, Malan’s party offered a “solution,” in the form of Apartheid: a series of far-reaching policies and practices that would more definitively realize the goal of a White South Africa. The notorious Apartheid regime has reached such metaphoric status that it remains, even today, a label used beyond South Africa to describe unjust segregation, particularly in a manner that reinforces profound socioeconomic inequality. Within a few years, work, education, housing, landownership, and virtually every sector of society were regulated along racial lines in order to maintain benefits for Whites. The 1950 Population Registration Act required that all adults hold an identity card attesting to their racial classification, which itself would become a virtual internal passport for access to citizenship. In the rare circumstances when people did the same work, Africans earned substantially lower wages compared with Whites.21 Although education had never been truly integrated or equal, the Apartheid architect Hendrik Verwoerd endeavored a more thoroughgoing approach to institutionalize White supremacy. In a speech to Parliament, he targeted not just African students but also their teachers: “The Bantu [African] teacher … must learn not to feel above his community, with a consequent desire to become integrated into the life of the European community.”22 By one estimate, in 1953, the government spent 68 pounds per year to educate White students, 20 pounds for Coloured and Asian students, and just 8 pounds on African students.23 In just about every facet of life, Blacks faced higher costs and tougher constraints, and few earning and other opportunities. They paid higher food prices. They paid sales taxes in White Krugersdorp, which only contributed to the White tax base. They had little access to credit and were highly regulated in their economic activities by the White government.24 And yet, in order to begin to understand how any Black South Africans—particularly in modern Mogale City—could have recalled life under Apartheid government as even minimally acceptable in comparative terms (as discussed in the prior chapter), it is also important to recognize that the White government did provide some basic services. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, like in several urban areas, the government built rows of very small houses, albeit initially without electricity or running water. Eventually, many Kagiso and Munsieville residents would gain access to running water, sewerage and refuse removal, postal services, education, and limited recreational facilities. The government developed an industrial zone on the edge of Kagiso, Chamdor, intended to keep Blacks out of Krugersdorp in line with a strategy of “separate development,” but it also employed thousands of workers.25 Whatever Black development might have occurred during the twentieth century in Munsieville and Kagiso, it was vastly overshadowed by the rapid increases in the quality of life enjoyed by Whites. Successive White governments throughout the twentieth century managed to build a highly effective state, one that helped the private sector prosper, particularly in the extraction of precious metals and minerals. The South African government developed one of the world’s most progressive and efficient tax systems, which in turn contributed to the government’s ability to maintain order, project power, and largely wipe out White poverty—which had been significant in the 1930s.26 GDP growth between 1960 and 1970 ranged from 4 percent to 8 percent,27 faster than that in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, and if the goal was prosperity for Whites, Apartheid was extremely successful. While the British Empire—epitomized by the politician and mining magnate John Cecil Rhodes—had technically won the war to control South Africa’s future, the soul of South African government became fully embodied in the fallen Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger. In 1967, the government treasury minted its first Krugerrand in an effort to market gold—and the country—to the wider world. This one-ounce coin, made almost entirely of pure gold, was a source of value, strength, and history. The front depicted Kruger’s full face and his long, lion-mane of a beard, shaven around the mouth, with no trace of a moustache. And the “rand” refers to the South African currency, which itself was named after the Witwatersrand, where South Africa’s world-class mining industry developed. It is hard to avoid the irony that this man—who sought to insulate himself and his people from the internationalist capitalist project of Rhodes and the British Empire—would adorn this coin, minted in the one true international store of value. The Krugerrand achieved iconic status, at one point accounting for 90 percent of the gold coins in circulation around the world.28 South Africa developed world-class infrastructure, a sophisticated financial sector, and a diversified economy. Throughout the twentieth century, White Krugersdorpers would increasingly enjoy paved streets, lovely houses, and an elected town council. It was not a place for the fabulously wealthy; it wasn’t filled with the famed “Randlord” mansions of Johannesburg’s leafy suburbs. Still, for the sizable White minority, it was comfortable living, largely unlike anything elsewhere on the continent north of the Limpopo River. In its quest to reserve this bounty for Whites, the Apartheid government was wildly ambitious in its social and political engineering. The National Party developed and began to implement what came to be known as “grand Apartheid,” the creation of separate and independent homelands or Bantustans (literally, a home for Bantu people) for distinct Black African groups that, according to the White government, constituted distinct nations. The basic premise was that once a particular language or ethnic group had a corresponding government, individuals from that group would officially become citizens of that new country and be forced to forsake claims on the South African state. The plan did not take into consideration the fact that in many cases, no such “groups” existed in the sense that language was not tantamount to nationhood. Black African social and political organization in no way fit neatly into the categories that the Apartheid government wanted the world to believe existed, let alone was there a match between these language categories and the tracts of land designated as ancestral homes. For the area around Krugersdorp, such a strategy implied that Tswana speakers, who had dominated the area long before Kruger’s arrival, would be assigned to a new country, carved from within South Africa’s borders, called Bophuthatswana. “Bop” was an absurd creation, and its arbitrary boundaries had no historical basis. In fact, because the South African government did not want to upset White property owners, it drew those national boundaries in such a way as to keep those Whites within South Africa. As a result, Bop consisted of nineteen noncontiguous fragments, some separated by hundreds of miles of South African land.29 By decree of the Status of Bophuthatswana Act of 1977, Tswana speakers in the area were overnight made into citizens of a strange new country that would not be recognized by any other state apart from South Africa.30 The South African government did not manage to move most of the tens of thousands of Tswana speakers living around Krugersdorp into this new country, but that was the plan. And it was certainly implemented at least in part, at great financial cost both to the government and to those who were moved: between 1960 and 1980, a total of 3.5 million people were resettled to Bophuthatswana, the Transkei, Ciskei, Venda, and other nascent homelands.31 Although foreign governments did not recognize the homelands as legitimate, these creations still proved consequential for the future in a number of ways. First, the homeland system fragmented the authority of government administration and gave rise to the development of a cadre of government leaders and bureaucrats who would become invested in their new jobs and, in some cases, develop an attachment to their proto-states. In fact, Bop’s president, Lucas Mangope, fiercely resisted the larger political transition and collaborated with White right-wing extremists to try to hang on to power in the early 1990s.32 And perhaps it is only fair to point out that during interviews, a few Mogale residents recalled Bophuthatswana with some fondness, as a place that was reasonably orderly and where education was valued. Of all the former homelands, Bop had the reputation of being the most efficiently administered. FIGURE 4.4. Map of Bophuthatswana “homeland” in South Africa (c. 1980). By creating separate homelands for particular ethnolinguistic groups, the government sowed the seeds of potential Black interethnic division. The noted legal and political scholar Donald Horowitz argued in his forward-looking 1991 book, A Democratic South Africa?, that the homelands reflected one important aspect of a multiply divided society. He concluded that “for the moment, it is obvious that, if attitudes are any guide, a nonracial society is not around the corner. Neither is a nonethnic society.” In turn, with respect to a democratic future, he warned of the “perils of wishful thinking” and the various ethnic and subethnic conflicts that might come to the fore in a post-Apartheid future.33 Resistance: Demands for Dignity and Ungovernability The thoroughgoing and explicitly exclusionary nature of White rule gave rise to one of the most storied resistance movements in modern history. With clear hindsight, we can say that the movement was ultimately successful in bringing decisive change and bestowing an ideologically committed political leadership on the country. The liberation struggle articulated a set of values and demands that would shape many contours of the democratic era and can be used as a benchmark for success even today. Yet, it is also important to recognize that the path to such change was itself divisive and, eventually, deliberately destabilizing. Any examination of life in South Africa in the post-1994 period must appreciate the quality and extent of the dangerous, frequently violent conditions and disruption of political order precipitated by the resistance campaign, all of which were like veritable land mines for future development. Diplomatic and Intellectual Origins Opposition to White rule began peacefully and diplomatically, frequently led by Black intellectuals arguing their case on the basis of appeals to the idea of universal human rights. The first, most concerted challenge to the Union government was ignited in 1912 by the proposal for a Native Lands Act. This policy promised to restrict Black African landownership to about 13 percent of the territory. A group of distraught, Black, mission-educated attorneys and tribal chiefs came together to strategize about how to block this draft bill; and they gave birth to the forerunner to the modern ANC in the form of the South African Native National Congress. The now legendary Black intellectual, journalist, and eventual political mobilizer Solomon (“Sol”) Plaatje wrote of dashed hopes and humiliations in the face of the new Union’s approach to Black Africans. Born in 1876 to Tswana Christians who worked for White missionaries, for many years he had placed his faith in British promises of a more liberal order. Plaatje pleaded, “We have as much right as they to be governed on the same basis of humanity.”34 Plaatje became the first secretary-general of the organization and, as he did in earlier years, took the opportunity to travel to London and to appeal directly to the British, remaining ever hopeful that reason would prevail. He argued his case in the newspaper he edited, Tsala ea Bechuana, and his columns were reprinted in various White newspapers.35 And yet, the writing was soon on the wall that the new South African government would sacrifice prewar promises of racial inclusion for Blacks in favor of White unity.36 Plaatje recalled the “indescribable” disappointment following the passage of the Native Lands Act, which he politely depicted as “full of rude shocks.” He wrote, “Awaking on Friday morning, June 20, 1913 the South African Native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.”37 Notwithstanding such assaults, one of the steadfast contradictions of White rule in South Africa—which Plaatje himself embodied—was the persistence of a few key institutions and opportunities for Black advance that opened space for formulating coherent demands for political freedom. One institution in particular—the University of Fort Hare38—produced an unprecedented legion of visionary Black graduates. Missionaries established the university in 1916 on the site of a former British military stronghold in the eastern part of the Cape Province (today, the Eastern Cape) with just twenty students.39 One of the first African professors to join the faculty from Fort Hare’s earliest days was Davidson Jabavu, the son of a prominent political activist and journalist from Sol Plaatje’s era.40 Jabavu himself studied in London and the United States, including at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, the first institution of African American higher education. His wife, Florence Tandiswa Jabavu (née Makiwane), was a graduate of another noted missionary school, Lovedale College, where she briefly taught, and considered to be an educational equal to her husband, which their community viewed as an important attribute in matches.41 At Fort Hare, Davidson Jabavu wrote about the problems of racial segregation. He and the initially largely White faculty educated a remarkable abundance of South African liberation leaders, albeit with a range of perspectives about how to achieve liberation. These included Sol Plaatje’s cousin Zachariah Keodirelang “ZK” Matthews (an ANC leader and leading academic), Nelson Mandela,42 Robert Sobukwe (who would form the PAC, a breakaway organization from the ANC, one that emphasized “Africanism” over the ANC’s “non-racialism”), and Mangosuthu Buthelezi (who also began his political career with the ANC before founding and leading the IFP). According to Mandela, it was at Fort Hare that he began his lifelong struggle with unjust authority. Despite having initially narrower ambitions of becoming a civil servant and reclaiming his family’s wealth and prestige, political engagement attracted him. For example, as a freshman he organized his fellow “freshers” to challenge a tradition that excluded their participation in community governance. He would only stay for two years, because in refusing to accede to an arranged marriage, he fled to Johannesburg. Nonetheless, at this missionary school he was first introduced to the ANC, the struggle against White supremacy, and his long-time friend and comrade Oliver Tambo.43 The small university’s reach into African liberation politics was astounding. For example, Desmond Tutu served as the school’s Anglican chaplain for a period in the 1960s. And although only approximately 10 percent of the 324 graduates in 1946 were women,44 some, including Vuyiswa “Tiny” Nokwe and Sally Maunye, emerged as dedicated freedom fighters during the decades of political struggle.45 And even far beyond South Africa, Fort Hare educated many of the continent’s liberation leaders. Seretse Khama (first president of Botswana), Julius Nyerere (first president of Tanzania), Kenneth Kaunda (first president of Zambia), Robert Mugabe (long-time president of Zimbabwe), and other prominent future dignitaries were all students there.46 Protest While the ideational foundations for resistance—including calls for greater attention to human dignity—were established during the first half of the twentieth century, the opposition movement gained substantial momentum from the implementation of the Apartheid system. Three key protest events—all of which took place in relative proximity to greater Krugersdorp—proved critical: the launch of the Freedom Charter document at Kliptown, the Sharpeville protest and massacre, and the Soweto uprising. The launch of the Freedom Charter was a peaceful and solidaristic declaration of goals and aspirations for liberation. Z. K. Matthews had proposed in his 1953 presidential address to the ANC’s Cape Province conference that there ought to be a democratic gathering to incorporate ideas about the type of change that was needed in the country.47 Two years later, the call for a “Congress of the People” materialized on June 26, 1955, in Soweto’s Kliptown, about twenty miles south of Krugersdorp. Approximately three thousand Black, White, Coloured, and Indian leaders and delegates from various liberation organizations gathered into a fenced-in open area, marking the most racially representative gathering in the history of the country. They took turns reading aloud the product of those solicitations, which crystallized a shared vision for the future, a demand for dignified treatment, and a fundamental reordering of an increasingly rigid racial hierarchy. The document was written by a small committee, including Matthews and others of various racial identities.48 The charter proposed, as a solution to the problem of racial oppression, a democracy rooted in non-racialism—that is, a universal humanism, rejecting the false biological notion of race.49 This idea, which also appeared in several speeches delivered by ANC leader Albert Luthuli, guided the ANC for decades. And yet, it also proved somewhat controversial because on the one hand, radicals deplored the explicit recognition of “all national groups and races” as being too close to Apartheid thinking,50 while other Black leaders rejected the inclusion of Whites in their resistance, arguing instead for a purely Africanist movement. Nonetheless, the idea of “non-racialism” captured the imagination of millions, remained central to ANC strategy, and won the sympathies of Black and White liberals inside and outside the country. FIGURE 4.5. Proximity of politically relevant sites on the Witwatersrand. The Freedom Charter made several explicit demands: to end segregation and discrimination; for equal rights to the productive resources of the economy and to land; to equal treatment before the law; and to rights to shelter, education, housing, jobs, and health care. These shaped the resistance agenda for decades to come. This impulse to more publicly and forcefully advocate for radical change began to permeate the lives of citizens who resented the system but did not yet fundamentally resist it. It concluded: THESE FREEDOMS WE WILL FIGHT FOR, SIDE BY SIDE, THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES, UNTIL WE HAVE WON OUR LIBERTY As the years dragged on without fundamental change, others who were active in the resistance movement called for more aggressive confrontation, resulting, quite notably, in the pass-burning protest in Sharpeville in 1960. In prior years, the South African government arrested millions of Black people based on invalid or unstamped passes or the failure to carry a pass—what had come to be known among Africans as dompas or “dumb passes.” On March 21, thousands of protesters—organized by Sobukwe’s PAC51—arrived at the Sharpeville police station without their passes, and some brought them simply to overtly destroy or burn them on the police premises. A scuffle prompted a violent police response against an unarmed crowd. Without warning to disperse, police fired hundreds of rounds aimed directly at the people who had gathered to protest. It was an unexpected massacre. Approximately 69 people died and 180 were seriously wounded.52 The massacre marked an entirely new chapter in the resistance movement. The Turn to Violence Even prior to Sharpeville, Nelson Mandela’s political star had been rising, and he increasingly promoted active defiance of the Apartheid regime. Frustrated by the lack of progress, he and others considered the possible need for a violent response. And finally in 1961, in the aftermath of Sharpeville, he joined other key ANC leaders in launching Umkhonto we Sizwe, “Spear of the Nation,” also known as MK, the militant wing of the ANC.53 On December 16, a day notable in various years of Afrikaner nationalist history including the 1838 victory at the battle of Blood River, the 1880 start of the First Boer War, and the opening of the Paardekraal Monument by Paul Kruger in 1891, MK introduced itself to the country with a series of bomb explosions in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and Durban.54 Using homemade bombs, MK soldiers targeted what the famed resistance leader Joe Slovo called “symbols of the economy” like power stations and “symbols of oppression,”55 such as “Bantu Administration” offices. These locations were intentionally targeted while empty, as MK was at this time committed to only sabotage, as opposed to guerilla warfare, terrorism, or revolution, and the only known death that resulted was that of an MK soldier. The MK framed the turn to violence as a response to a “government policy of force, repression and violence,” citing the imposition of martial law and the violence of the Sharpeville Massacre.56 MK followed up with approximately two hundred similar attacks, intended—according to Mandela—to “bring the Government and its supporters to their senses.”57 Sobukwe’s PAC developed its own formidable underground military organization, Poqo, which was particularly strong around Krugersdorp in the Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville. In 1963, four Poqo members were arrested for killing a Black police officer, a charge they denied.58 The “Munsieville Four,” as they were called, were tried and convicted of a politically motivated crime and sentenced to death. They appealed, arguing that they had killed no one and were fighting for land, but the appeal failed.59 The next year, on June 16, they were hanged by the White government, making them martyrs in their community.60 The White government spared no expense to capture MK members. This included increased spending on the police and military as well as expanding tools of control such as bannings and house arrests.61 It extended new powers to its security forces, including the right to detain and hold subjects for “one or more” twelve-day periods, without bringing them before the court.62 In 1963, the Apartheid government’s security forces tracked down and arrested sixteen MK leaders about twenty-five miles east of Krugersdorp who were hiding out in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia. Ten of its leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were tried on a variety of charges, including sabotage and conspiracy, in the Pretoria High Court. From jail, Mandela became a global icon. At times the South African state government managed to convince a few Western leaders that he and the ANC were “terrorists.” But most of the world would recognize them as “freedom fighters,” and their incarceration and banning became lightning rods for opposition to Apartheid. Following Mandela’s arrest, his wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, stepped up her own political activity and leadership, sometimes through violent insurgency.63 With the top ANC leaders all under arrest, the seeds of further Black resistance were more quietly sown in the development of a Black Consciousness movement, one that focused on Black self-reliance and the mental effects of racial domination. Its intellectual founder, Steve Biko—a man frequently likened to and surely influenced by Malcolm X—challenged the multiracial approach of the ANC. And these ideas and the organizations they engendered helped give rise to the ultimately critical political uprisings of the 1970s, including massive labor strikes and the Soweto revolt of 1976.64 Indeed, 1976 was a watershed year in South African political history, one that today connotes a single event: on June 16, thousands of students from Soweto-area high schools participated in what was planned to be a peaceful march and boycott against the indignities of a government decree that Black students learn in Afrikaans. Inculcated in the ideas of Black Consciousness, the student leaders hoped that their defiance would be recognized, and it was, perhaps beyond both their dreams and their nightmares. One Mogale City resident living in Kagiso at the time recalled rising early in the morning to pick up students from various schools, organizing to march with placards in their hands. “We prepared ourselves for tear gas,” which was indeed used against the students. “But then the police started shooting. I remember when the police started shooting. We used the steel lids of the dustbins to protect ourselves.” The students resisted, many by throwing rocks, and the police escalated with live ammunition. The extent of state repression put the country irrevocably on the global map of pariah states. One police station commander, Colonel Johannes Augustinus Kleingeld, later admitted to ordering the use of dog and baton attacks and to personally throwing three canisters of tear gas into the crowd and shooting a machine gun on the first day of the uprising.65 He was eventually absolved of responsibility for killing Hastings Ndlovu, the first casualty of that day, after shooting him at point-blank range. Furthermore, Malcolm Klein, a medical officer from the casualty unit at Baragwanath Hospital, testified that almost all the bullet wounds he attended to were above the belt.66 Police violence continued throughout much of the period of the Soweto uprising. In Alexandra, which experienced the second-highest levels, the local police killed 29 people on June 18 alone.67 Even a government investigation of the events between June 16, 1976, and February 28, 1977, indicated an official death count of 575 across various urban areas throughout the country.68 Of these deaths, at least 23 occurred on the first day and 176 in June 1976. The government’s report noted the police’s widespread use of “dangerous means” to counter protests and riots, including dogs, baton charges, and firearms.69 News of the event spread widely, and the horrific scenes of the confrontation were captured in still and video photography. One image in particular—the limp body of twelve-year-old Hector Pieterson being carried by an older activist—emerged as the iconic symbol of the entire standoff. No Apartheid apologist could deny the obvious: an innocent Black child had been shot dead by the Apartheid police. And although South Africans had just gained access to television earlier that year, broadcasts of government brutality aired overseas. It shook the world and reverberated back in South Africa as White business leaders and diplomats found themselves increasingly condemned and isolated by countries around the world. In the years that followed, protests continued at Black schools. While Black education was already of poor quality, the loss of education for a large share of a generation of students following the 1976 uprising remains a powerful and painful legacy of that time. The government aggressively cracked down on suspected political agitators. Within six months, many Kagiso community leaders disappeared. Six months after that, Rev. Frank Chikane, trying to investigate their whereabouts, found himself under arrest. Chikane had begun a new post ministering in Kagiso just one week before the Soweto uprising started. In the manner of Tutu before him, he became increasingly active in politics. After his arrest, he faced six weeks of interrogation and physical torture, including being forced to stand in one spot for fifty hours, sleep deprivation, and repeated assaults. He noticed that the man supervising his torture was a deacon in the White branch of his Apostolic Faith Church.70 Such cruelty became hallmark Apartheid policy. Famously, in 1977, Steve Biko died from injuries sustained from police brutality under state custody. Chikane managed to survive, despite being instructed by the police that he ought to take his own life. In January 1978, in Krugersdorp court, he was freed when an Afrikaans-speaking judge announced there was no case against him.71 By the 1980s, several strands of the liberation movement committed themselves to making the country ungovernable. Politicized youth, emboldened by the impact of the uprising, continued to mobilize, sometimes in quite destructive ways. For example, in 1984, Tshepo Nzwane—a local councillor I met in Mogale City in 2019—led the Kagiso branch of the Congress of South African Students and, in the tradition of the 1976 youth, repeatedly questioned authority at every turn. His teenage irreverence led him to take an action that he recalled to me with regret. He explained that he was desperate to meet his heroes, including Nelson Mandela, who were serving their prison sentences on Robben Island. He could think of only one way to reach them. I was still at school. But I made a wrong decision. That wrong decision was I bombed a school. I did a petrol bomb. Kagiso high school. The reason I did that, I wanted to be arrested so I could go and see them. To me, it was a big thing, so that I should know what has inspired them. I was advised that it wasn’t charged as being political. It was a public crime … because there’s no political motivation. They beat me. I stayed for three weeks unconscious, and then in the high court I challenged the statement that I was made to sign. Nzwane was just sixteen when he was sent to prison. I was the youngest person in South Africa to stay in detention in solitary confinement for two years. They linked me with a lot of terrorists. They couldn’t trust me because they knew I could mobilize because I used to mobilize people in detention. In 1985, I won the case in July. I was outside the head court and then [subsequently] arrested by someone from the special branch in Krugersdorp … and I was put back … for fourteen days, and then [the] state of emergency was introduced in 1986. Then I was in detention without trial. I would stay up until the end of the state of emergency. I stayed there 85, 86, 87, 88. [In] 89 I was released. Even following De Klerk’s 1990 speech, conflict and violence persisted, including in the area around Krugersdorp. For example, national tensions between ANC and IFP supporters flared up in Kagiso, and deadly fights broke out.72 One of the worst such conflicts occurred in the Swaneville section of Kagiso in May 1991,73 when IFP supporters from one hostel attacked ANC members in their homes with knives, spears, and sticks. As many as fifty were killed in a massacre that was not widely reported at the time. Many others were left disabled, and houses, cars, and personal belongings were destroyed by fire.74 The PAC and ANC also remained mired in conflict. On the one hand, it was philosophical: the ANC “Charterists” subscribed to the non-racialist tenets of the Freedom Charter, while the PAC “Africanists” argued that Black leaders must champion the fight for dignity on their own. Conflicts could also devolve into parochial skirmishes at the local level. PAC leaders accused ANC members in Munsieville of systematically attacking them and driving out seventy of their members. In turn, the ANC accused the PAC of acting in bad faith and jeopardizing unity.75 Much of the anti-Apartheid movement was nonviolent, and I do not discuss here the diverse range of organizations and movements that played critical roles in the larger campaign. Such efforts were highly consequential, in fact sometimes far more central than the violent and exiled segments of the resistance movement, and they laid the foundation for potentially coherent governance during the post-Apartheid era. In particular, the umbrella organizations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), played key roles in mobilizing grassroots organizations and trade unions, respectively.76 Nonetheless, I have highlighted some of the internal divisions and the development of tactics that included promoting ungovernability and violence in order to make clear the extent to which these patterns were becoming ever more deeply rooted in the country, even as Apartheid was crumbling. Existential Crisis and Counterresistance By the late 1980s, South Africa was in a state of existential crisis. The government was under siege within and outside its borders, forced to defend a system decried almost universally as unjust. The South African Defense Force deployed increasing numbers of troops to fight in multiple conflicts in the southern African region, all related to the persistence of Apartheid. Meanwhile ordinary White citizens had grown accustomed to the lifestyles afforded by a century of White government buoyed by a thriving mining industry. South Africa had become the most unequal country on the planet,77 and as Whites sat atop this steep socioeconomic ladder, many desperately wanted to hang on as they began to fear losing it all. In Krugersdorp, the town council tried to placate its White residents by sustaining various segregationist policies that were in retreat in many of the larger cities. For example, in early 1986, the council voted to maintain the local movie theater for “Whites only.”78 And it turned down the library guild’s request to desegregate.79 The best the Krugersdorp public library would offer was a separate location that Indians could use should the need arise. Not all White Krugersdorpers resisted the pressures for change. Many were burdened by the fact that global sympathies were against them. Residents sent letters to the Krugersdorp News about the shame they felt regarding the segregationist policies as change was coming to South Africa. “Why can’t we watch movies together?” One resident highlighted that White and Black futures were intertwined and pleaded that if the policies didn’t change, the town would likely lose their one theater because American film companies were prohibiting the screening of films in segregated theaters.80 Some big businesses appealed to citizens to adapt. For example, Clem Sunter, a “scenario planner” for Anglo-American, one of South Africa’s largest mining houses, wrote a series of books and articles trying to map out the different courses that South Africa might take. In July 1988, he spoke to a packed Krugersdorp Town Hall, describing two possible outcomes, a “high road” and a “low road,” the latter being one of protracted conflict. Sunter asked whether South Africa might become a wasteland, whether the destruction of Beirut might be their future or something that resembled shared prosperity.81 The latter, he said, required compromise and for all actors to move to the “center.” Despite the best efforts of Sunter and others, the compromise-breeds-shared-prosperity thesis did not capture everyone’s imagination. The intransigent spirit of Krugersdorp’s namesake very much lived on among a large number of Whites in the area, particularly in a man by the name of Eugene Terre’blanche, who founded the neo-fascist, Afrikaner nationalist Afrikaner-weerstandsbeweging (AWB) resistance movement in the early 1970s. Terre’blanche was born about eighty miles west of Krugersdorp. His grandfather fought in the Anglo-Boer War, and he served in the South African police force. He was fiercely disillusioned by the partial reforms being undertaken by the National Party, which he took as signs of unnecessary weakness. Like Kruger, he sported a thick beard and cut an imposing figure. In February 1986, Terre’blanche called on AWB branches of the West Rand to form vigilante groups. In November of that year, he held a rally at the Jan Lotz stadium in downtown Krugersdorp. And where the National Party (NP) government had once been viewed as the champion of the Afrikaner, Terre’blanche now said that in its negotiations with the ANC, the NP had become traitorous. To this crowd he proclaimed that “the Government keeps giving to Blacks and the Blacks keep destroying.”82 Terre’blanche’s calls to action quickly translated into bouts of devastating violence: Whites bludgeoned a Kagiso man to death and bodies of Blacks were burned beyond recognition. Terre’blanche had previously been dismissed as a joke—a backward, harmless extremist—but he became very real, arriving with a cavalry and the banner of his AWB, eerily reminiscent of a swastika.83 Terre’blanche’s organization remained outside formal politics, but in 1982, the right wing of the National Party broke off, and its dissidents formed the Conservative Party (CP). As the prospect of the end of Apartheid as they knew it began to come into focus, Terre’blanche and his sympathizers in the Conservative Party began to discuss the idea of an inverted homeland system—one in which Afrikaners would wall themselves into their own Volkstaat.84 In essence, they wanted a return to the Boer republics of the type Paul Kruger had once governed. By 1992, a majority of Whites nationwide said they supported De Klerk’s efforts—a sentiment that the state president elicited by holding an all-White referendum in which two-thirds of voters ticked “yes” next to the question, “Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new Constitution through negotiation?” However, many did so begrudgingly, and a large minority was fully opposed, especially in Krugersdorp. In fact, a week after De Klerk’s speech releasing Mandela, the CP-dominated Krugersdorp council voted to persist with its segregation policies, despite being aware of the economic costs this might impose. It resolved, by a vote of 7–4,85 to keep the library and a health clinic reserved for Whites only.86 Krugersdorp’s local extremists began to use their stage to attract national attention. First, neo-Nazi Terre’blanche rode through Krugersdorp on horseback to remind potential followers and opponents of a powerful legacy of guerilla warfare against British and various Black African groups. Violence followed. In 1993, eight AWB members set up an unauthorized roadblock in Krugersdorp, murdered four Blacks and injured six others, and gruesomely cut off the ear of one of their victims as a trophy that they displayed to their commander.87 Some set their sights on much bigger targets. The most pivotal would be the assassination of fifty-year-old Chris Hani. On April 10, 1993, Janusz Waluś, a far-right Polish immigrant, shot and killed the beloved ANC and MK leader, also an alumnus of Fort Hare. Waluś and a man named Clive Derby-Lewis were imprisoned for his murder. Derby-Lewis was a CP politician from Krugersdorp who had previously expressed his desire to preserve Afrikaner supremacy by declaring support for the forced removal of Black Munsieville residents to make way for the expansion of the White Dan Pienaarville suburb.88 He had even announced he would stand for office in the next election to fill a vacant seat on the Krugersdorp council.89 However, the murder in which he conspired had exactly the opposite effect compared with what he had intended for the future of White South Africa. Nationally, Hani’s death put the country back on the edge of unraveling. Hani had been a revered leader of the liberation movement, particularly among the more radicalized youth, and prior to the unbanning of the ANC frequently trained outside the country as an MK operative. When he returned, he took over the leadership of the South African Communist Party (SACP) and, like Mandela, favored suspension of the armed struggle in order to negotiate peace. After his death, protests erupted and Mandela, still negotiating with the White government, pleaded for calm. But if there was a silver lining to Hani’s tragic death, it was that it hastened the agreement on the timing of the first multiparty election, quickly declared to be in April 1994. Many White Krugersdorpers still wouldn’t relent, and some claimed that Derby-Lewis was “framed” to ensure he didn’t get elected to the council.90 His wife, Gaye, argued against the “tyranny of the ANC” and called for a White resistance movement that would include cutting power and stopping trains.91 But such calls fell on increasingly deaf ears. Derby-Lewis and Waluś were both sentenced to death. (Because the death penalty was abolished in 1995 under ANC government, both sentences were later commuted to life in prison.)92 Predictions and Prognostications By the late 1980s and early 1990s, predictions, opinions, and prognostications for the future of South Africa were conflicted and divided. One thing was certain: no one shared the optimistic euphoria of the wave of African independence from the 1960s. In those days, the promising rise of inspiring nationalist leaders in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, and other countries across the continent along with first elections following the departure of colonizing Europeans were followed by decades of political and economic disarray and the collapse of democratic hopes. And indeed, it was those very failures that the White South African government had long and cynically trumpeted as a raison d’être for their sustained rule: those Black Africans can’t govern themselves, they argued. As balanced pundits noted in the early 1990s, the South Africans certainly had several things on their side. One, ironically, was the cautionary tale of these prior failures.93 They could now more carefully consider the rules of engagement and the possible pitfalls of particular concentrations of power. Few would take for granted that the end of one unjust system would necessarily herald something better. Moreover, South Africa boasted substantial economic resources as an Upper-middle-income country; many sectors of the government functioned well; a strong and vibrant civil society had emerged in the wake of the anti-Apartheid movement; and it had a deep class of liberation leaders, thoughtful and demonstrating strong commitment to broad principles developed over decades of struggle. Along with other speeches and documents, the Freedom Charter made clear a set of goals and aspirations for democracy, dignity, and development. On the other hand, the challenge of managing ethnic and racial diversity in various parts of the world offered discouraging precedents of what could go wrong. For example, the other major political liberalization of the 1990s, which itself contributed to change in South Africa, was the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And as part of that transition, multiethnic Yugoslavia came apart in bloody conflict. Between 1991 and 1995, over 300,000 people were killed in former Yugoslav republics through conventional warfare and deliberate ethnic cleansing.94 The country was eventually divided into ethnically distinct countries, ironically, the very aspiration of the original Apartheid project. In early April 1994, in the small central African country of Rwanda, a horrific tragedy unfolded. In a place that had once been lauded for its developmental prowess, the indignities of a minority having ruled over a majority were settled with ruthless violence. Hutu extremists murdered as many as 800,000 Tutsis in an intense three-month period, and the conflict, born out of decades of violence, displaced at least a million others, making them into refugees in nearby countries.95 Moreover, the United States remained mired in racial conflict. In most states, cities, and neighborhoods, Blacks and Whites lived very much apart, and huge disparities in quality of life persisted on just about every dimension. In 1992, twenty-eight years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, sections of Los Angeles erupted in violent protest after a jury acquitted four White police officers for yet another case of excessive force against an African American man—in this case, a man named Rodney King. Because the incident had been documented on videotape—at a time prior to the ubiquity of cellphone-based cameras—the gulf between crime and lack of punishment for officers was plain for all to see. Dozens were killed and over two thousand injured in the aftermath.96 What kind of shared future could there be in a place like Krugersdorp and its surroundings, where a White local politician had, just one year earlier, been an accomplice in the assassination of a key ANC leader? Where the White council, with popular support, had for so long rejected the idea of even sharing a movie theater, let alone the council chambers, with people of color? Where a very visible White minority lived in nice houses, many with cars and lifestyles familiar to a European town, while the Black majority lived mostly in a mix of very small homes, with few services, many in iron shanties? On just about every dimension, these groups were worlds apart. And the people of this town, let alone the country, were no strangers to violence. In the afterword of his book After Apartheid: The Future of South Africa, penned in the early 1990s, the Economist reporter Sebastian Mallaby captured the sentiment of many observers when he wrote, “It is easy to be glum about the future of South Africa.” Presciently, he pondered, Twenty years from now, today’s pessimism may seem vindicated: if rich America has failed to cure the poverty of the underclass, there seems little chance that South Africa will. And yet there is a danger in despondency, for it may obscure much of what is good. Measured against the high spirits of Nkrumah’s generation, South Africa will indeed fail. Measured against more reasonable yardsticks, there are grounds for hope.97 In the context of the turbulent and frequently violent politics grabbing the headlines, Whites and Blacks living in South Africa proper, and in its nominally independent homelands, began to prepare for the future, however uncertain it seemed. Whites were pessimistic: in 1993, in a national poll, 65 percent predicted they would be “discriminated against” by a non-White government, with less than 20 percent predicting they would be treated fairly. In fact, the majority of Whites surveyed predicted the economy would get worse, that they would become poorer, that there would be more violence, that they would be less secure, that they would be afraid to criticize, and that there would be higher unemployment. In a follow-up survey taken within a year (of a different random sample), the majority of Whites predicted chaos, autocracy, and violence. Unsurprisingly, the majority of Blacks surveyed about their own futures expressed exactly the opposite expectations. About 84 percent predicted that under the future government, they would be treated “fairly.” Moreover, most felt they would be more secure and more free to criticize and believed that the state would be strong. More than four times as many Blacks said they believed they would be richer (44 percent) in the future compared to those who predicted they would be poorer (11 percent). By contrast, 62 percent of Whites felt they would become poorer and just 4 percent imagined they would be richer.98 Black sentiment was almost surely too hopeful and White sentiment too pessimistic. But the future was coming, including to Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, and the farms of Muldersdrift, where Blacks had never known social, political, or economic equality. The formerly powerless were about to see whether power, attained through democratic means, might help them realize the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, of those who burned their passes at Sharpeville, and of the youth who rose up in Soweto, let alone the likes of Nelson Mandela, who continued to echo the sentiments he expressed at the trial that landed him a twenty-seven-year term in prison. The coming election would mark the most profound political watershed on southern African soil since the formation of the Union in 1909, and perhaps even since the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652.",

De Klerk announced to a sitting White Parliament in Cape Town, “The time for reconstruction and reconciliation has arrived.” In his epoch-shifting speech, De Klerk spoke of a “new South Africa” and imminent planning for a “realistic and democratic dispensation.” Although he didn’t utter the word Apartheid even once, it was clear that he was delivering the nails in the coffin for this infamous project—the one his own party unleashed on the country more than four decades earlier. De Klerk concluded by promising that Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners would be set free. Just over a week later, on February 11, Mandela appeared in public for the first time in twenty-seven years and addressed the country and the wider world from outside Cape Town City Hall. A full battalion of police, no longer charged with keeping Mandela captive, was now tasked with protecting the still sturdy former boxer, lawyer, and revolutionary icon from the crowds and any would-be attackers. A few weeks of photo opportunities and celebrations followed, many depicting him holding the hand of his wife—a fiery political leader in her own right—Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. A global audience cheered that one of the most unjust systems of rule in modern history was coming to an end. What was less clear was what would come next. I was an undergraduate student at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy at the time. Incidentally, but quite relatedly, I was wholly ignorant of Wilson’s own racist past, a legacy that would lead the university to remove his name from the school more than two decades later. In the winter of 1991, my junior year, I enrolled in a class taught by the former undersecretary of state for Africa, Donald Easum, to study the unfolding political transition in South Africa. We were presented with the incredible opportunity of traveling to the country at the end of the academic year and committed to a two-week study tour. We interviewed stakeholders and leaders from across the political spectrum and eventually published a report based on that research.1 I arranged to stay in the country on my own for an additional month, which proved to be the inspiration for my future career choice. Flying from New York, we transferred in London—American carriers were still not traveling to the country—and had few fellow tourists on the overnight flight to South Africa. It persisted as a pariah state in many ways and the ANC, still a liberation organization and not yet a political party, continued to advocate for economic sanctions against the country. We landed early on a June morning in 1991 at the Johannesburg airport. It was then named for Jan Smuts—a complicated character who was an Afrikaner general, served as prime minister during multiple stints during the first half of the twentieth century, and was instrumental in consolidating White rule,2 while also contributing to the drafting of the International Declaration of Human Rights.3 The energy in the country was exhilarating. Each morning’s newspaper offered the possibility of a shift in momentum. In Johannesburg, I frequently planted myself in the lobby of the Carlton Hotel, which for years had been designated as an “international hotel”—an Apartheid loophole that allowed in guests from different races, making it a cosmopolitan hub. I would secure the right to a lobby table by ordering a Rooibos tea with milk, which I would sip slowly. From that perch, I watched national and international dignitaries, government leaders, executives, and civic luminaries, Black and White, moving swiftly through the corridors from one backroom negotiation to another. Leaders of various organized interests were all jockeying for a seat at the table and for their wants and needs to be met in the new order. On June 16, our group drove up to the First National Bank soccer stadium in Soweto for a commemorative rally. Easum flashed his still valid diplomatic passport, and the guards waved us onto the floor through the VIP entrance. We joined the tens of thousands of screaming and cheering Black ANC supporters in the stands; they had packed the bleachers on this fifteenth anniversary of a famous student-led rebellion to get a glimpse of the legendary freedom fighter himself. When he arrived, again with Winnie at his side, I managed to snap a photo—no selfies back then—from about ten feet away; it was as close to a living legend as I had ever experienced. The stadium was shaking with joy and adulation. This was their messiah and he had finally come to lift them out of the misery of Apartheid. It would be hard to overstate the crowd’s optimism. Millions of South Africans and observers around the world, including me, initially shared that sense of hopefulness for the country’s future. And yet, that sentiment was quickly clouded with anxiety as escalating conflict and violence threatened the prospects for a peaceful regime change. The political transition unfolded in fits and starts, and at times, it seemed that failure—civil war, economic collapse, the rise of a dictator, or even genocide—was as likely as peace and prosperity. Particularly in Johannesburg, I confronted a sense of insecurity that I would not experience in my own country until the September 11 attacks a decade later: We couldn’t enter a major building without going through a metal detector, and the daily news reports recounted bomb blasts and bloody episodes across the country. Even in the speech in which De Klerk promised transformational political reform, he also declared that the government would maintain a state of emergency owing to persistent violence. I was struck by the razor-wire and electric fences that wealthy and not-so-wealthy Whites had built around their homes. More than a year after Mandela’s release, this was not a country at peace. And in localities like Krugersdorp, still very much segregated in practice, the local newspaper was filled with advertisements for handguns and security systems, as well as reports of new consumer boycotts initiated to maintain steady pressure for ongoing political reform.

Nonetheless, in order to fully appreciate what transpired during the first quarter century after Apartheid—the subject of all subsequent chapters—it is critical to put into context what was realistically possible and plausible from the vantage point of the BD period. That is, before democracy. And specifically, what were the social, political, and economic conditions leading up to the first multiracial elections? I will not provide a remotely complete account of South Africa’s complex history, including the rise of and resistance to the Apartheid state, in this single chapter. Rather, I describe two sets of critical and related legacies that weighed heavily on South Africa’s future, including in the area that would become Mogale City. The first is the construction of White government—a contested and several-centuries-long process of consolidating political power. There is no doubt that by the second half of the twentieth century, White South Africans had built a relatively strong and effective state, one that for many years promoted rapid economic development. And to a degree, this proved to be a fortuitous inheritance for the democratic era. Yet, it was an undignified development that excluded the Black majority and left indelible memories of poor treatment that would always be fodder for resentment. In creating vast inequalities between groups, it raised the stakes for subsequent political conflict. Moreover, the government deliberately fragmented the society, and political authority itself, leaving little obvious basis for future unification. Second was the resistance movement, which of course was also quite successful in achieving its main goals, culminating in the dismantling of Apartheid. Moreover, many of the organizations and individuals central to the liberation movement led with a human rights orientation that provided a strong moral basis for the democratic order. However, the movement also became violent. Frustrated by the failures of diplomacy, many turned to a strategy that deliberately sought to undermine political order, and did so in ways that would reverberate even once the resistance campaign came to an end. White Government Perhaps it is trite to say this, but it is critical to spotlight a simple reality: the reason most White South Africans did not want to give up White rule is largely because this style of government delivered vast and secure material prosperity to them. When combined with a moral doctrine that justified racial hierarchy, White people could enjoy the good life, and feel good about it. And yet, the development of White South Africa came at the expense of respect for the dignity of Black people, who constituted the overwhelming majority of the population in the region. While the origins of this system can be traced to European theories of racial superiority and the time before Dutch settlers arrived in the mid-seventeenth century, I focus on the development of the area that would eventually become Mogale City. As I mentioned in chapter 1, Afrikaners began to settle in and around the region as part of a mid-nineteenth-century migration from the southwest—the Great Trek. They encountered Black Africans in the area, including some who had been living there for centuries, and others who had arrived more recently, including through violent conquests of their own.4 Possessing greater military might, the Afrikaners quickly became politically dominant. Particularly after the discovery of gold, successive governments created institutions aimed at degrading and dehumanizing those who were not White or “European.” In 1883, Paul Kruger, an avowed Afrikaner nationalist, became president of the Transvaal Republic,5 one of the four White-led governments that would eventually comprise the provinces of the Union of South Africa. Kruger had long professed a deep-seated racism, frequently referring to Black Africans as “savages” who ought to be ruled over with “justice and morality.”6 And this orientation proved highly compatible with the nascent mining economy of the late nineteenth century as companies demanded a steady stream of cheap labor. Kruger did not hesitate to impose new taxes or to facilitate aggressive labor recruiting practices to induce Africans to work the mines.7 The mining companies themselves offered Whites excellent opportunities for advancement, including to supervisory roles, while maintaining poor pay, harsh conditions, and professional stagnation for Blacks. And in 1895, acting on the behest of the mining industry, Kruger’s government introduced a set of laws that required Africans to hold special passes for work authorization or for any form of movement into the Witwatersrand, limiting the influx of Africans from rural areas and granting employers enormous control over their workforces.8 Such pass laws became a cornerstone of institutionalized White supremacy in twentieth-century South Africa. From the start, life in and around Krugersdorp was racially segregated. Blacks recruited to work in the mines lived in compounds or dormitories, or in some cases squatted on White settlements,9 and all were required to shop at “native stores.” While many also participated in the often wild and lawless behavior characteristic of the mining town, they received a different brand of justice for their misdeeds: Black men were routinely apprehended, tried, imprisoned, and hanged for violent behavior, and they faced all-White juries, prosecutors, and judges. White men who committed violence against Blacks tended to be fined rather than imprisoned, and they frequently justified their actions as assaults on “laziness” and “insubordination” among local Africans, which in that context was accepted as a reasonable defense.10 In 1894, a Krugersdorp regulation prohibited Africans from walking on the sidewalks, a response to White complaints of being “jostled” on the pathways; and Whites began to demand separate queues in various public spaces. As early as 1895, White local leaders sought to keep Africans from the town center, especially from the sacred Paardekraal Monument.11 FIGURE 4.2.

Even amid shared anti-Black racism among European-descended people in southern Africa, there had never been White unity in the region. In fact, during the late nineteenth century, the pressing “race question” was the enduring conflict between the British and Afrikaners. Conflicts erupted over how to govern the highly profitable mining economy, and in 1899, the British Crown went to war with Kruger and the Afrikaner republics. In what initially appeared to be a profound mismatch between a global military power and a small, decentralized guerilla resistance, the Boer War turned out to be a bloody three-year conflagration and severely tested the prowess of the mighty British Empire. Ultimately, the Afrikaners surrendered, but the epic battle ended with Black Africans—not even direct parties to the conflict—losing the most in the peace process. The British had previously appealed to potential Black soldiers that they should serve on their side because a decisive British victory would lead to much better treatment in the future.12 However, hopes for improved conditions were dashed as the 1902 treaty ending the war stated that “the granting of the franchise to the natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.” For a place like Krugersdorp, this meant sustained exclusion, as Blacks had never had the right to vote there and would not get it now. Moreover, the new government enacted a new set of pass laws restricting African movement, and the mines cut African wages.13 Blacks were forbidden from residing in the White town except with special permission and the local government imposed a curfew prohibiting any movement during certain hours.14 It reflected just one of the many ways in which Black adults were treated in a childlike manner. The 1909 South Africa Act establishing the new Union of South Africa largely sealed the fate of Black Africans and other people of color throughout the territory. First, only Whites—constituting less than 22 percent of the population at the time15—would be able to sit in Parliament. Second, in the new provinces constituted by the former Orange Free State, Transvaal, and Natal, only Whites would vote. And third, only in the Cape Province, at least temporarily, Blacks who met stringent qualifications would retain access to the vote, but this right would be short-lived and was removed with the 1936 Native Representation Act.16 Meanwhile, irrespective of race, no women would be allowed the vote, and I am not aware of any evidence that this was raised as a significant political issue. Despite the economic costs of job reservations and residential segregation, the government soon committed itself to the approach. All the local White governments were authorized to do what was already being practiced in Krugersdorp under local laws: control the entry and exit of Black migrants into their towns and require Blacks to live in segregated areas.17 Other legislation codified protections for White labor with reservations for more skilled and better-paying jobs, so they would not face serious threats from an abundant Black African workforce.18 On the gold mines in and near Krugersdorp, where over 42,000 Europeans and over 319,000 people of color were employed in 1945, the wage gap was enormous: Africans working on the Witwatersrand earned approximately 42 pounds per year, while the average annual wage for Europeans was seven to ten times greater.19 During those early years, the government further legislated the “morality” of White supremacy with the 1927 Immorality Act, prohibiting sexual relations between Whites and non-Whites. And yet it was only following the 1948 election of the National Party that the dystopian plan for Apartheid government was realized and the ideology of White supremacy was institutionalized in its most elaborate form. A month before the general election, the party’s leader, Daniel Francois Malan, criticized the ruling United Party government for failing to sufficiently regulate Black movement in the country, especially to the cities; for its neglect of the economy; and for liberal immigration policies—too many Black Africans coming in across the northern border. The “Nats” campaigned on White fears of a “Black peril” and concern for the welfare of poor Whites, a problem that was disproportionately prevalent among Afrikaners.20 Promoting such fear as justification, Malan’s party offered a “solution,” in the form of Apartheid: a series of far-reaching policies and practices that would more definitively realize the goal of a White South Africa. The notorious Apartheid regime has reached such metaphoric status that it remains, even today, a label used beyond South Africa to describe unjust segregation, particularly in a manner that reinforces profound socioeconomic inequality. Within a few years, work, education, housing, landownership, and virtually every sector of society were regulated along racial lines in order to maintain benefits for Whites. The 1950 Population Registration Act required that all adults hold an identity card attesting to their racial classification, which itself would become a virtual internal passport for access to citizenship. In the rare circumstances when people did the same work, Africans earned substantially lower wages compared with Whites.21 Although education had never been truly integrated or equal, the Apartheid architect Hendrik Verwoerd endeavored a more thoroughgoing approach to institutionalize White supremacy. In a speech to Parliament, he targeted not just African students but also their teachers: “The Bantu [African] teacher … must learn not to feel above his community, with a consequent desire to become integrated into the life of the European community.”22 By one estimate, in 1953, the government spent 68 pounds per year to educate White students, 20 pounds for Coloured and Asian students, and just 8 pounds on African students.23 In just about every facet of life, Blacks faced higher costs and tougher constraints, and few earning and other opportunities. They paid higher food prices. They paid sales taxes in White Krugersdorp, which only contributed to the White tax base. They had little access to credit and were highly regulated in their economic activities by the White government.24 And yet, in order to begin to understand how any Black South Africans—particularly in modern Mogale City—could have recalled life under Apartheid government as even minimally acceptable in comparative terms (as discussed in the prior chapter), it is also important to recognize that the White government did provide some basic services. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, like in several urban areas, the government built rows of very small houses, albeit initially without electricity or running water. Eventually, many Kagiso and Munsieville residents would gain access to running water, sewerage and refuse removal, postal services, education, and limited recreational facilities. The government developed an industrial zone on the edge of Kagiso, Chamdor, intended to keep Blacks out of Krugersdorp in line with a strategy of “separate development,” but it also employed thousands of workers.25 Whatever Black development might have occurred during the twentieth century in Munsieville and Kagiso, it was vastly overshadowed by the rapid increases in the quality of life enjoyed by Whites. Successive White governments throughout the twentieth century managed to build a highly effective state, one that helped the private sector prosper, particularly in the extraction of precious metals and minerals. The South African government developed one of the world’s most progressive and efficient tax systems, which in turn contributed to the government’s ability to maintain order, project power, and largely wipe out White poverty—which had been significant in the 1930s.26 GDP growth between 1960 and 1970 ranged from 4 percent to 8 percent,27 faster than that in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, and if the goal was prosperity for Whites, Apartheid was extremely successful. While the British Empire—epitomized by the politician and mining magnate John Cecil Rhodes—had technically won the war to control South Africa’s future, the soul of South African government became fully embodied in the fallen Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger. In 1967, the government treasury minted its first Krugerrand in an effort to market gold—and the country—to the wider world. This one-ounce coin, made almost entirely of pure gold, was a source of value, strength, and history. The front depicted Kruger’s full face and his long, lion-mane of a beard, shaven around the mouth, with no trace of a moustache. And the “rand” refers to the South African currency, which itself was named after the Witwatersrand, where South Africa’s world-class mining industry developed. It is hard to avoid the irony that this man—who sought to insulate himself and his people from the internationalist capitalist project of Rhodes and the British Empire—would adorn this coin, minted in the one true international store of value. The Krugerrand achieved iconic status, at one point accounting for 90 percent of the gold coins in circulation around the world.28 South Africa developed world-class infrastructure, a sophisticated financial sector, and a diversified economy. Throughout the twentieth century, White Krugersdorpers would increasingly enjoy paved streets, lovely houses, and an elected town council. It was not a place for the fabulously wealthy; it wasn’t filled with the famed “Randlord” mansions of Johannesburg’s leafy suburbs. Still, for the sizable White minority, it was comfortable living, largely unlike anything elsewhere on the continent north of the Limpopo River. In its quest to reserve this bounty for Whites, the Apartheid government was wildly ambitious in its social and political engineering. The National Party developed and began to implement what came to be known as “grand Apartheid,” the creation of separate and independent homelands or Bantustans (literally, a home for Bantu people) for distinct Black African groups that, according to the White government, constituted distinct nations. The basic premise was that once a particular language or ethnic group had a corresponding government, individuals from that group would officially become citizens of that new country and be forced to forsake claims on the South African state. The plan did not take into consideration the fact that in many cases, no such “groups” existed in the sense that language was not tantamount to nationhood. Black African social and political organization in no way fit neatly into the categories that the Apartheid government wanted the world to believe existed, let alone was there a match between these language categories and the tracts of land designated as ancestral homes. For the area around Krugersdorp, such a strategy implied that Tswana speakers, who had dominated the area long before Kruger’s arrival, would be assigned to a new country, carved from within South Africa’s borders, called Bophuthatswana. “Bop” was an absurd creation, and its arbitrary boundaries had no historical basis. In fact, because the South African government did not want to upset White property owners, it drew those national boundaries in such a way as to keep those Whites within South Africa. As a result, Bop consisted of nineteen noncontiguous fragments, some separated by hundreds of miles of South African land.29 By decree of the Status of Bophuthatswana Act of 1977, Tswana speakers in the area were overnight made into citizens of a strange new country that would not be recognized by any other state apart from South Africa.30 The South African government did not manage to move most of the tens of thousands of Tswana speakers living around Krugersdorp into this new country, but that was the plan. And it was certainly implemented at least in part, at great financial cost both to the government and to those who were moved: between 1960 and 1980, a total of 3.5 million people were resettled to Bophuthatswana, the Transkei, Ciskei, Venda, and other nascent homelands.31 Although foreign governments did not recognize the homelands as legitimate, these creations still proved consequential for the future in a number of ways. First, the homeland system fragmented the authority of government administration and gave rise to the development of a cadre of government leaders and bureaucrats who would become invested in their new jobs and, in some cases, develop an attachment to their proto-states. In fact, Bop’s president, Lucas Mangope, fiercely resisted the larger political transition and collaborated with White right-wing extremists to try to hang on to power in the early 1990s.32 And perhaps it is only fair to point out that during interviews, a few Mogale residents recalled Bophuthatswana with some fondness, as a place that was reasonably orderly and where education was valued. Of all the former homelands, Bop had the reputation of being the most efficiently administered. FIGURE 4.4. Map of Bophuthatswana “homeland” in South Africa (c. 1980). By creating separate homelands for particular ethnolinguistic groups, the government sowed the seeds of potential Black interethnic division. The noted legal and political scholar Donald Horowitz argued in his forward-looking 1991 book, A Democratic South Africa?, that the homelands reflected one important aspect of a multiply divided society. He concluded that “for the moment, it is obvious that, if attitudes are any guide, a nonracial society is not around the corner. Neither is a nonethnic society.” In turn, with respect to a democratic future, he warned of the “perils of wishful thinking” and the various ethnic and subethnic conflicts that might come to the fore in a post-Apartheid future.33 Resistance: Demands for Dignity and Ungovernability The thoroughgoing and explicitly exclusionary nature of White rule gave rise to one of the most storied resistance movements in modern history. With clear hindsight, we can say that the movement was ultimately successful in bringing decisive change and bestowing an ideologically committed political leadership on the country. The liberation struggle articulated a set of values and demands that would shape many contours of the democratic era and can be used as a benchmark for success even today. Yet, it is also important to recognize that the path to such change was itself divisive and, eventually, deliberately destabilizing. Any examination of life in South Africa in the post-1994 period must appreciate the quality and extent of the dangerous, frequently violent conditions and disruption of political order precipitated by the resistance campaign, all of which were like veritable land mines for future development. Diplomatic and Intellectual Origins Opposition to White rule began peacefully and diplomatically, frequently led by Black intellectuals arguing their case on the basis of appeals to the idea of universal human rights. The first, most concerted challenge to the Union government was ignited in 1912 by the proposal for a Native Lands Act. This policy promised to restrict Black African landownership to about 13 percent of the territory. A group of distraught, Black, mission-educated attorneys and tribal chiefs came together to strategize about how to block this draft bill; and they gave birth to the forerunner to the modern ANC in the form of the South African Native National Congress. The now legendary Black intellectual, journalist, and eventual political mobilizer Solomon (“Sol”) Plaatje wrote of dashed hopes and humiliations in the face of the new Union’s approach to Black Africans. Born in 1876 to Tswana Christians who worked for White missionaries, for many years he had placed his faith in British promises of a more liberal order. Plaatje pleaded, “We have as much right as they to be governed on the same basis of humanity.”34 Plaatje became the first secretary-general of the organization and, as he did in earlier years, took the opportunity to travel to London and to appeal directly to the British, remaining ever hopeful that reason would prevail. He argued his case in the newspaper he edited, Tsala ea Bechuana, and his columns were reprinted in various White newspapers.35 And yet, the writing was soon on the wall that the new South African government would sacrifice prewar promises of racial inclusion for Blacks in favor of White unity.36 Plaatje recalled the “indescribable” disappointment following the passage of the Native Lands Act, which he politely depicted as “full of rude shocks.” He wrote, “Awaking on Friday morning, June 20, 1913 the South African Native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.”37 Notwithstanding such assaults, one of the steadfast contradictions of White rule in South Africa—which Plaatje himself embodied—was the persistence of a few key institutions and opportunities for Black advance that opened space for formulating coherent demands for political freedom. One institution in particular—the University of Fort Hare38—produced an unprecedented legion of visionary Black graduates. Missionaries established the university in 1916 on the site of a former British military stronghold in the eastern part of the Cape Province (today, the Eastern Cape) with just twenty students.39 One of the first African professors to join the faculty from Fort Hare’s earliest days was Davidson Jabavu, the son of a prominent political activist and journalist from Sol Plaatje’s era.40 Jabavu himself studied in London and the United States, including at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, the first institution of African American higher education. His wife, Florence Tandiswa Jabavu (née Makiwane), was a graduate of another noted missionary school, Lovedale College, where she briefly taught, and considered to be an educational equal to her husband, which their community viewed as an important attribute in matches.41 At Fort Hare, Davidson Jabavu wrote about the problems of racial segregation. He and the initially largely White faculty educated a remarkable abundance of South African liberation leaders, albeit with a range of perspectives about how to achieve liberation. These included Sol Plaatje’s cousin Zachariah Keodirelang “ZK” Matthews (an ANC leader and leading academic), Nelson Mandela,42 Robert Sobukwe (who would form the PAC, a breakaway organization from the ANC, one that emphasized “Africanism” over the ANC’s “non-racialism”), and Mangosuthu Buthelezi (who also began his political career with the ANC before founding and leading the IFP). According to Mandela, it was at Fort Hare that he began his lifelong struggle with unjust authority. Despite having initially narrower ambitions of becoming a civil servant and reclaiming his family’s wealth and prestige, political engagement attracted him. For example, as a freshman he organized his fellow “freshers” to challenge a tradition that excluded their participation in community governance. He would only stay for two years, because in refusing to accede to an arranged marriage, he fled to Johannesburg. Nonetheless, at this missionary school he was first introduced to the ANC, the struggle against White supremacy, and his long-time friend and comrade Oliver Tambo.43 The small university’s reach into African liberation politics was astounding. For example, Desmond Tutu served as the school’s Anglican chaplain for a period in the 1960s. And although only approximately 10 percent of the 324 graduates in 1946 were women,44 some, including Vuyiswa “Tiny” Nokwe and Sally Maunye, emerged as dedicated freedom fighters during the decades of political struggle.45 And even far beyond South Africa, Fort Hare educated many of the continent’s liberation leaders. Seretse Khama (first president of Botswana), Julius Nyerere (first president of Tanzania), Kenneth Kaunda (first president of Zambia), Robert Mugabe (long-time president of Zimbabwe), and other prominent future dignitaries were all students there.46 Protest While the ideational foundations for resistance—including calls for greater attention to human dignity—were established during the first half of the twentieth century, the opposition movement gained substantial momentum from the implementation of the Apartheid system. Three key protest events—all of which took place in relative proximity to greater Krugersdorp—proved critical: the launch of the Freedom Charter document at Kliptown, the Sharpeville protest and massacre, and the Soweto uprising. The launch of the Freedom Charter was a peaceful and solidaristic declaration of goals and aspirations for liberation. Z. K. Matthews had proposed in his 1953 presidential address to the ANC’s Cape Province conference that there ought to be a democratic gathering to incorporate ideas about the type of change that was needed in the country.47 Two years later, the call for a “Congress of the People” materialized on June 26, 1955, in Soweto’s Kliptown, about twenty miles south of Krugersdorp. Approximately three thousand Black, White, Coloured, and Indian leaders and delegates from various liberation organizations gathered into a fenced-in open area, marking the most racially representative gathering in the history of the country. They took turns reading aloud the product of those solicitations, which crystallized a shared vision for the future, a demand for dignified treatment, and a fundamental reordering of an increasingly rigid racial hierarchy. The document was written by a small committee, including Matthews and others of various racial identities.48 The charter proposed, as a solution to the problem of racial oppression, a democracy rooted in non-racialism—that is, a universal humanism, rejecting the false biological notion of race.49 This idea, which also appeared in several speeches delivered by ANC leader Albert Luthuli, guided the ANC for decades. And yet, it also proved somewhat controversial because on the one hand, radicals deplored the explicit recognition of “all national groups and races” as being too close to Apartheid thinking,50 while other Black leaders rejected the inclusion of Whites in their resistance, arguing instead for a purely Africanist movement. Nonetheless, the idea of “non-racialism” captured the imagination of millions, remained central to ANC strategy, and won the sympathies of Black and White liberals inside and outside the country. FIGURE 4.5. Proximity of politically relevant sites on the Witwatersrand. The Freedom Charter made several explicit demands: to end segregation and discrimination; for equal rights to the productive resources of the economy and to land; to equal treatment before the law; and to rights to shelter, education, housing, jobs, and health care. These shaped the resistance agenda for decades to come. This impulse to more publicly and forcefully advocate for radical change began to permeate the lives of citizens who resented the system but did not yet fundamentally resist it. It concluded: THESE FREEDOMS WE WILL FIGHT FOR, SIDE BY SIDE, THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES, UNTIL WE HAVE WON OUR LIBERTY As the years dragged on without fundamental change, others who were active in the resistance movement called for more aggressive confrontation, resulting, quite notably, in the pass-burning protest in Sharpeville in 1960. In prior years, the South African government arrested millions of Black people based on invalid or unstamped passes or the failure to carry a pass—what had come to be known among Africans as dompas or “dumb passes.” On March 21, thousands of protesters—organized by Sobukwe’s PAC51—arrived at the Sharpeville police station without their passes, and some brought them simply to overtly destroy or burn them on the police premises. A scuffle prompted a violent police response against an unarmed crowd. Without warning to disperse, police fired hundreds of rounds aimed directly at the people who had gathered to protest. It was an unexpected massacre. Approximately 69 people died and 180 were seriously wounded.52 The massacre marked an entirely new chapter in the resistance movement. The Turn to Violence Even prior to Sharpeville, Nelson Mandela’s political star had been rising, and he increasingly promoted active defiance of the Apartheid regime. Frustrated by the lack of progress, he and others considered the possible need for a violent response. And finally in 1961, in the aftermath of Sharpeville, he joined other key ANC leaders in launching Umkhonto we Sizwe, “Spear of the Nation,” also known as MK, the militant wing of the ANC.53 On December 16, a day notable in various years of Afrikaner nationalist history including the 1838 victory at the battle of Blood River, the 1880 start of the First Boer War, and the opening of the Paardekraal Monument by Paul Kruger in 1891, MK introduced itself to the country with a series of bomb explosions in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and Durban.54 Using homemade bombs, MK soldiers targeted what the famed resistance leader Joe Slovo called “symbols of the economy” like power stations and “symbols of oppression,”55 such as “Bantu Administration” offices. These locations were intentionally targeted while empty, as MK was at this time committed to only sabotage, as opposed to guerilla warfare, terrorism, or revolution, and the only known death that resulted was that of an MK soldier. The MK framed the turn to violence as a response to a “government policy of force, repression and violence,” citing the imposition of martial law and the violence of the Sharpeville Massacre.56 MK followed up with approximately two hundred similar attacks, intended—according to Mandela—to “bring the Government and its supporters to their senses.”57 Sobukwe’s PAC developed its own formidable underground military organization, Poqo, which was particularly strong around Krugersdorp in the Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville. In 1963, four Poqo members were arrested for killing a Black police officer, a charge they denied.58 The “Munsieville Four,” as they were called, were tried and convicted of a politically motivated crime and sentenced to death. They appealed, arguing that they had killed no one and were fighting for land, but the appeal failed.59 The next year, on June 16, they were hanged by the White government, making them martyrs in their community.60 The White government spared no expense to capture MK members. This included increased spending on the police and military as well as expanding tools of control such as bannings and house arrests.61 It extended new powers to its security forces, including the right to detain and hold subjects for “one or more” twelve-day periods, without bringing them before the court.62 In 1963, the Apartheid government’s security forces tracked down and arrested sixteen MK leaders about twenty-five miles east of Krugersdorp who were hiding out in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia. Ten of its leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were tried on a variety of charges, including sabotage and conspiracy, in the Pretoria High Court. From jail, Mandela became a global icon. At times the South African state government managed to convince a few Western leaders that he and the ANC were “terrorists.” But most of the world would recognize them as “freedom fighters,” and their incarceration and banning became lightning rods for opposition to Apartheid. Following Mandela’s arrest, his wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, stepped up her own political activity and leadership, sometimes through violent insurgency.63 With the top ANC leaders all under arrest, the seeds of further Black resistance were more quietly sown in the development of a Black Consciousness movement, one that focused on Black self-reliance and the mental effects of racial domination. Its intellectual founder, Steve Biko—a man frequently likened to and surely influenced by Malcolm X—challenged the multiracial approach of the ANC. And these ideas and the organizations they engendered helped give rise to the ultimately critical political uprisings of the 1970s, including massive labor strikes and the Soweto revolt of 1976.64 Indeed, 1976 was a watershed year in South African political history, one that today connotes a single event: on June 16, thousands of students from Soweto-area high schools participated in what was planned to be a peaceful march and boycott against the indignities of a government decree that Black students learn in Afrikaans. Inculcated in the ideas of Black Consciousness, the student leaders hoped that their defiance would be recognized, and it was, perhaps beyond both their dreams and their nightmares. One Mogale City resident living in Kagiso at the time recalled rising early in the morning to pick up students from various schools, organizing to march with placards in their hands. “We prepared ourselves for tear gas,” which was indeed used against the students. “But then the police started shooting. I remember when the police started shooting. We used the steel lids of the dustbins to protect ourselves.” The students resisted, many by throwing rocks, and the police escalated with live ammunition. The extent of state repression put the country irrevocably on the global map of pariah states. One police station commander, Colonel Johannes Augustinus Kleingeld, later admitted to ordering the use of dog and baton attacks and to personally throwing three canisters of tear gas into the crowd and shooting a machine gun on the first day of the uprising.65 He was eventually absolved of responsibility for killing Hastings Ndlovu, the first casualty of that day, after shooting him at point-blank range. Furthermore, Malcolm Klein, a medical officer from the casualty unit at Baragwanath Hospital, testified that almost all the bullet wounds he attended to were above the belt.66 Police violence continued throughout much of the period of the Soweto uprising. In Alexandra, which experienced the second-highest levels, the local police killed 29 people on June 18 alone.67 Even a government investigation of the events between June 16, 1976, and February 28, 1977, indicated an official death count of 575 across various urban areas throughout the country.68 Of these deaths, at least 23 occurred on the first day and 176 in June 1976. The government’s report noted the police’s widespread use of “dangerous means” to counter protests and riots, including dogs, baton charges, and firearms.69 News of the event spread widely, and the horrific scenes of the confrontation were captured in still and video photography. One image in particular—the limp body of twelve-year-old Hector Pieterson being carried by an older activist—emerged as the iconic symbol of the entire standoff. No Apartheid apologist could deny the obvious: an innocent Black child had been shot dead by the Apartheid police. And although South Africans had just gained access to television earlier that year, broadcasts of government brutality aired overseas. It shook the world and reverberated back in South Africa as White business leaders and diplomats found themselves increasingly condemned and isolated by countries around the world. In the years that followed, protests continued at Black schools. While Black education was already of poor quality, the loss of education for a large share of a generation of students following the 1976 uprising remains a powerful and painful legacy of that time. The government aggressively cracked down on suspected political agitators. Within six months, many Kagiso community leaders disappeared. Six months after that, Rev. Frank Chikane, trying to investigate their whereabouts, found himself under arrest. Chikane had begun a new post ministering in Kagiso just one week before the Soweto uprising started. In the manner of Tutu before him, he became increasingly active in politics. After his arrest, he faced six weeks of interrogation and physical torture, including being forced to stand in one spot for fifty hours, sleep deprivation, and repeated assaults. He noticed that the man supervising his torture was a deacon in the White branch of his Apostolic Faith Church.70 Such cruelty became hallmark Apartheid policy. Famously, in 1977, Steve Biko died from injuries sustained from police brutality under state custody. Chikane managed to survive, despite being instructed by the police that he ought to take his own life. In January 1978, in Krugersdorp court, he was freed when an Afrikaans-speaking judge announced there was no case against him.71 By the 1980s, several strands of the liberation movement committed themselves to making the country ungovernable. Politicized youth, emboldened by the impact of the uprising, continued to mobilize, sometimes in quite destructive ways. For example, in 1984, Tshepo Nzwane—a local councillor I met in Mogale City in 2019—led the Kagiso branch of the Congress of South African Students and, in the tradition of the 1976 youth, repeatedly questioned authority at every turn. His teenage irreverence led him to take an action that he recalled to me with regret. He explained that he was desperate to meet his heroes, including Nelson Mandela, who were serving their prison sentences on Robben Island. He could think of only one way to reach them. I was still at school. But I made a wrong decision. That wrong decision was I bombed a school. I did a petrol bomb. Kagiso high school. The reason I did that, I wanted to be arrested so I could go and see them. To me, it was a big thing, so that I should know what has inspired them. I was advised that it wasn’t charged as being political. It was a public crime … because there’s no political motivation. They beat me. I stayed for three weeks unconscious, and then in the high court I challenged the statement that I was made to sign. Nzwane was just sixteen when he was sent to prison. I was the youngest person in South Africa to stay in detention in solitary confinement for two years. They linked me with a lot of terrorists. They couldn’t trust me because they knew I could mobilize because I used to mobilize people in detention. In 1985, I won the case in July. I was outside the head court and then [subsequently] arrested by someone from the special branch in Krugersdorp … and I was put back … for fourteen days, and then [the] state of emergency was introduced in 1986. Then I was in detention without trial. I would stay up until the end of the state of emergency. I stayed there 85, 86, 87, 88. [In] 89 I was released. Even following De Klerk’s 1990 speech, conflict and violence persisted, including in the area around Krugersdorp. For example, national tensions between ANC and IFP supporters flared up in Kagiso, and deadly fights broke out.72 One of the worst such conflicts occurred in the Swaneville section of Kagiso in May 1991,73 when IFP supporters from one hostel attacked ANC members in their homes with knives, spears, and sticks. As many as fifty were killed in a massacre that was not widely reported at the time. Many others were left disabled, and houses, cars, and personal belongings were destroyed by fire.74 The PAC and ANC also remained mired in conflict. On the one hand, it was philosophical: the ANC “Charterists” subscribed to the non-racialist tenets of the Freedom Charter, while the PAC “Africanists” argued that Black leaders must champion the fight for dignity on their own. Conflicts could also devolve into parochial skirmishes at the local level. PAC leaders accused ANC members in Munsieville of systematically attacking them and driving out seventy of their members. In turn, the ANC accused the PAC of acting in bad faith and jeopardizing unity.75 Much of the anti-Apartheid movement was nonviolent, and I do not discuss here the diverse range of organizations and movements that played critical roles in the larger campaign. Such efforts were highly consequential, in fact sometimes far more central than the violent and exiled segments of the resistance movement, and they laid the foundation for potentially coherent governance during the post-Apartheid era. In particular, the umbrella organizations, the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), played key roles in mobilizing grassroots organizations and trade unions, respectively.76 Nonetheless, I have highlighted some of the internal divisions and the development of tactics that included promoting ungovernability and violence in order to make clear the extent to which these patterns were becoming ever more deeply rooted in the country, even as Apartheid was crumbling. Existential Crisis and Counterresistance By the late 1980s, South Africa was in a state of existential crisis. The government was under siege within and outside its borders, forced to defend a system decried almost universally as unjust. The South African Defense Force deployed increasing numbers of troops to fight in multiple conflicts in the southern African region, all related to the persistence of Apartheid. Meanwhile ordinary White citizens had grown accustomed to the lifestyles afforded by a century of White government buoyed by a thriving mining industry. South Africa had become the most unequal country on the planet,77 and as Whites sat atop this steep socioeconomic ladder, many desperately wanted to hang on as they began to fear losing it all. In Krugersdorp, the town council tried to placate its White residents by sustaining various segregationist policies that were in retreat in many of the larger cities. For example, in early 1986, the council voted to maintain the local movie theater for “Whites only.”78 And it turned down the library guild’s request to desegregate.79 The best the Krugersdorp public library would offer was a separate location that Indians could use should the need arise. Not all White Krugersdorpers resisted the pressures for change. Many were burdened by the fact that global sympathies were against them. Residents sent letters to the Krugersdorp News about the shame they felt regarding the segregationist policies as change was coming to South Africa. “Why can’t we watch movies together?” One resident highlighted that White and Black futures were intertwined and pleaded that if the policies didn’t change, the town would likely lose their one theater because American film companies were prohibiting the screening of films in segregated theaters.80 Some big businesses appealed to citizens to adapt. For example, Clem Sunter, a “scenario planner” for Anglo-American, one of South Africa’s largest mining houses, wrote a series of books and articles trying to map out the different courses that South Africa might take. In July 1988, he spoke to a packed Krugersdorp Town Hall, describing two possible outcomes, a “high road” and a “low road,” the latter being one of protracted conflict. Sunter asked whether South Africa might become a wasteland, whether the destruction of Beirut might be their future or something that resembled shared prosperity.81 The latter, he said, required compromise and for all actors to move to the “center.” Despite the best efforts of Sunter and others, the compromise-breeds-shared-prosperity thesis did not capture everyone’s imagination. The intransigent spirit of Krugersdorp’s namesake very much lived on among a large number of Whites in the area, particularly in a man by the name of Eugene Terre’blanche, who founded the neo-fascist, Afrikaner nationalist Afrikaner-weerstandsbeweging (AWB) resistance movement in the early 1970s. Terre’blanche was born about eighty miles west of Krugersdorp. His grandfather fought in the Anglo-Boer War, and he served in the South African police force. He was fiercely disillusioned by the partial reforms being undertaken by the National Party, which he took as signs of unnecessary weakness. Like Kruger, he sported a thick beard and cut an imposing figure. In February 1986, Terre’blanche called on AWB branches of the West Rand to form vigilante groups. In November of that year, he held a rally at the Jan Lotz stadium in downtown Krugersdorp. And where the National Party (NP) government had once been viewed as the champion of the Afrikaner, Terre’blanche now said that in its negotiations with the ANC, the NP had become traitorous. To this crowd he proclaimed that “the Government keeps giving to Blacks and the Blacks keep destroying.”82 Terre’blanche’s calls to action quickly translated into bouts of devastating violence: Whites bludgeoned a Kagiso man to death and bodies of Blacks were burned beyond recognition. Terre’blanche had previously been dismissed as a joke—a backward, harmless extremist—but he became very real, arriving with a cavalry and the banner of his AWB, eerily reminiscent of a swastika.83 Terre’blanche’s organization remained outside formal politics, but in 1982, the right wing of the National Party broke off, and its dissidents formed the Conservative Party (CP). As the prospect of the end of Apartheid as they knew it began to come into focus, Terre’blanche and his sympathizers in the Conservative Party began to discuss the idea of an inverted homeland system—one in which Afrikaners would wall themselves into their own Volkstaat.84 In essence, they wanted a return to the Boer republics of the type Paul Kruger had once governed. By 1992, a majority of Whites nationwide said they supported De Klerk’s efforts—a sentiment that the state president elicited by holding an all-White referendum in which two-thirds of voters ticked “yes” next to the question, “Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new Constitution through negotiation?” However, many did so begrudgingly, and a large minority was fully opposed, especially in Krugersdorp. In fact, a week after De Klerk’s speech releasing Mandela, the CP-dominated Krugersdorp council voted to persist with its segregation policies, despite being aware of the economic costs this might impose. It resolved, by a vote of 7–4,85 to keep the library and a health clinic reserved for Whites only.86 Krugersdorp’s local extremists began to use their stage to attract national attention. First, neo-Nazi Terre’blanche rode through Krugersdorp on horseback to remind potential followers and opponents of a powerful legacy of guerilla warfare against British and various Black African groups. Violence followed. In 1993, eight AWB members set up an unauthorized roadblock in Krugersdorp, murdered four Blacks and injured six others, and gruesomely cut off the ear of one of their victims as a trophy that they displayed to their commander.87 Some set their sights on much bigger targets. The most pivotal would be the assassination of fifty-year-old Chris Hani. On April 10, 1993, Janusz Waluś, a far-right Polish immigrant, shot and killed the beloved ANC and MK leader, also an alumnus of Fort Hare. Waluś and a man named Clive Derby-Lewis were imprisoned for his murder. Derby-Lewis was a CP politician from Krugersdorp who had previously expressed his desire to preserve Afrikaner supremacy by declaring support for the forced removal of Black Munsieville residents to make way for the expansion of the White Dan Pienaarville suburb.88 He had even announced he would stand for office in the next election to fill a vacant seat on the Krugersdorp council.89 However, the murder in which he conspired had exactly the opposite effect compared with what he had intended for the future of White South Africa. Nationally, Hani’s death put the country back on the edge of unraveling. Hani had been a revered leader of the liberation movement, particularly among the more radicalized youth, and prior to the unbanning of the ANC frequently trained outside the country as an MK operative. When he returned, he took over the leadership of the South African Communist Party (SACP) and, like Mandela, favored suspension of the armed struggle in order to negotiate peace. After his death, protests erupted and Mandela, still negotiating with the White government, pleaded for calm. But if there was a silver lining to Hani’s tragic death, it was that it hastened the agreement on the timing of the first multiparty election, quickly declared to be in April 1994. Many White Krugersdorpers still wouldn’t relent, and some claimed that Derby-Lewis was “framed” to ensure he didn’t get elected to the council.90 His wife, Gaye, argued against the “tyranny of the ANC” and called for a White resistance movement that would include cutting power and stopping trains.91 But such calls fell on increasingly deaf ears. Derby-Lewis and Waluś were both sentenced to death. (Because the death penalty was abolished in 1995 under ANC government, both sentences were later commuted to life in prison.)92 Predictions and Prognostications By the late 1980s and early 1990s, predictions, opinions, and prognostications for the future of South Africa were conflicted and divided. One thing was certain: no one shared the optimistic euphoria of the wave of African independence from the 1960s. In those days, the promising rise of inspiring nationalist leaders in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, and other countries across the continent along with first elections following the departure of colonizing Europeans were followed by decades of political and economic disarray and the collapse of democratic hopes. And indeed, it was those very failures that the White South African government had long and cynically trumpeted as a raison d’être for their sustained rule: those Black Africans can’t govern themselves, they argued. As balanced pundits noted in the early 1990s, the South Africans certainly had several things on their side. One, ironically, was the cautionary tale of these prior failures.93 They could now more carefully consider the rules of engagement and the possible pitfalls of particular concentrations of power. Few would take for granted that the end of one unjust system would necessarily herald something better. Moreover, South Africa boasted substantial economic resources as an Upper-middle-income country; many sectors of the government functioned well; a strong and vibrant civil society had emerged in the wake of the anti-Apartheid movement; and it had a deep class of liberation leaders, thoughtful and demonstrating strong commitment to broad principles developed over decades of struggle. Along with other speeches and documents, the Freedom Charter made clear a set of goals and aspirations for democracy, dignity, and development. On the other hand, the challenge of managing ethnic and racial diversity in various parts of the world offered discouraging precedents of what could go wrong. For example, the other major political liberalization of the 1990s, which itself contributed to change in South Africa, was the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And as part of that transition, multiethnic Yugoslavia came apart in bloody conflict. Between 1991 and 1995, over 300,000 people were killed in former Yugoslav republics through conventional warfare and deliberate ethnic cleansing.94 The country was eventually divided into ethnically distinct countries, ironically, the very aspiration of the original Apartheid project. In early April 1994, in the small central African country of Rwanda, a horrific tragedy unfolded. In a place that had once been lauded for its developmental prowess, the indignities of a minority having ruled over a majority were settled with ruthless violence. Hutu extremists murdered as many as 800,000 Tutsis in an intense three-month period, and the conflict, born out of decades of violence, displaced at least a million others, making them into refugees in nearby countries.95 Moreover, the United States remained mired in racial conflict. In most states, cities, and neighborhoods, Blacks and Whites lived very much apart, and huge disparities in quality of life persisted on just about every dimension. In 1992, twenty-eight years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, sections of Los Angeles erupted in violent protest after a jury acquitted four White police officers for yet another case of excessive force against an African American man—in this case, a man named Rodney King. Because the incident had been documented on videotape—at a time prior to the ubiquity of cellphone-based cameras—the gulf between crime and lack of punishment for officers was plain for all to see. Dozens were killed and over two thousand injured in the aftermath.96 What kind of shared future could there be in a place like Krugersdorp and its surroundings, where a White local politician had, just one year earlier, been an accomplice in the assassination of a key ANC leader? Where the White council, with popular support, had for so long rejected the idea of even sharing a movie theater, let alone the council chambers, with people of color? Where a very visible White minority lived in nice houses, many with cars and lifestyles familiar to a European town, while the Black majority lived mostly in a mix of very small homes, with few services, many in iron shanties? On just about every dimension, these groups were worlds apart. And the people of this town, let alone the country, were no strangers to violence. In the afterword of his book After Apartheid: The Future of South Africa, penned in the early 1990s, the Economist reporter Sebastian Mallaby captured the sentiment of many observers when he wrote, “It is easy to be glum about the future of South Africa.” Presciently, he pondered, Twenty years from now, today’s pessimism may seem vindicated: if rich America has failed to cure the poverty of the underclass, there seems little chance that South Africa will. And yet there is a danger in despondency, for it may obscure much of what is good. Measured against the high spirits of Nkrumah’s generation, South Africa will indeed fail. Measured against more reasonable yardsticks, there are grounds for hope.97 In the context of the turbulent and frequently violent politics grabbing the headlines, Whites and Blacks living in South Africa proper, and in its nominally independent homelands, began to prepare for the future, however uncertain it seemed. Whites were pessimistic: in 1993, in a national poll, 65 percent predicted they would be “discriminated against” by a non-White government, with less than 20 percent predicting they would be treated fairly. In fact, the majority of Whites surveyed predicted the economy would get worse, that they would become poorer, that there would be more violence, that they would be less secure, that they would be afraid to criticize, and that there would be higher unemployment. In a follow-up survey taken within a year (of a different random sample), the majority of Whites predicted chaos, autocracy, and violence. Unsurprisingly, the majority of Blacks surveyed about their own futures expressed exactly the opposite expectations. About 84 percent predicted that under the future government, they would be treated “fairly.” Moreover, most felt they would be more secure and more free to criticize and believed that the state would be strong. More than four times as many Blacks said they believed they would be richer (44 percent) in the future compared to those who predicted they would be poorer (11 percent). By contrast, 62 percent of Whites felt they would become poorer and just 4 percent imagined they would be richer.98 Black sentiment was almost surely too hopeful and White sentiment too pessimistic. But the future was coming, including to Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, and the farms of Muldersdrift, where Blacks had never known social, political, or economic equality. The formerly powerless were about to see whether power, attained through democratic means, might help them realize the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, of those who burned their passes at Sharpeville, and of the youth who rose up in Soweto, let alone the likes of Nelson Mandela, who continued to echo the sentiments he expressed at the trial that landed him a twenty-seven-year term in prison. The coming election would mark the most profound political watershed on southern African soil since the formation of the Union in 1909, and perhaps even since the arrival of Dutch settlers in 1652.",

      "content": "5 The Bold Experiment INSTITUTIONS FOR A DIVIDED SOCIETY APARTHEID GOVERNMENT AND AN INCREASINGLY fractious civil war came to an end through a negotiated settlement. The final compromise was itself the product of decades of brokered discussions that progressed in fits and starts. For example, Buthelezi tried and failed to forge a workable plan with a White opposition leader as early as 1975. In 1986, two White politicians formed the Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) as a way to connect exiled Black political leaders with potentially reform-minded Afrikaners. A breakthrough came in 1987 with a successful meeting in Dakar, Senegal. However, despite great interest in the proceedings, the White government officially condemned the meeting because it involved direct communication with banned organizations.1 Throughout the 1980s, while still a prisoner of the South African government, and as violent conflict raged on, Mandela met in secret with White political leaders to consider various democratic and power-sharing proposals. Other ANC leaders did the same at venues inside and outside the country. Only after De Klerk’s 1990 speech did political leaders from the National Party, the ANC, and several other organizations, lawyers, foreign governments, and constitutional experts openly engage in wide-ranging discussions. They debated the merits of the very different options for structuring a new government. They did this in closed meetings and in public forums, in newspaper columns, in books, on the radio, and on television. A few principles gained quick assent from those deliberating the new rules of the game: full citizenship would be accorded to all irrespective of race; there would be no more legally segregated areas or amenities; and the next government would undertake ambitious projects to redress the social and economic legacies of the past. And at the center of it all would be a constitutional democracy: choosing leaders through the vote and recognizing a new constitution as the supreme law of the land. That still left quite a bit on the table for deciding how to govern a newly constituted society. Would citizens vote for individuals or for parties? Would power be concentrated or decentralized? How would the chief executive ultimately be selected? What was the vision for the appropriate role of the state in social and economic planning? What role would traditional leaders and former homeland structures play? Even with the best minds in South Africa and around the world trying to steer a mutually acceptable solution, so many obstacles stood in the way. Could you actually reverse engineer the Apartheid system to create a single, democratic polity? Being realistic about all that had happened over the previous several decades let alone the past several centuries, and the depths of divide in the country, success seemed to be a long shot. Even after Mandela’s release and after various political organizations were no longer banned, violent conflicts marred the country, ranging from attacks by the White, right-wing AWB to considerable violence between the ANC and the IFP, let alone sustained conflict in and around the homeland governments. Given skepticism about the prospects for success, many described the attempt to implement a multiracial democracy in this divided society as a “bold experiment.”2 In the remainder of this chapter, I describe the central contours of how this democratic order was established with respect to three key institutions. First, the elections. I explain why the ballots looked the way they did as voters went into their booths—describing the new electoral rules and the particular choices citizens faced. In turn, those rules and choices would channel the “will” of the people into concrete allocations of political power in government. Second, I highlight a few features of the country’s remarkable constitution, including its deep links to the demands of the resistance movement and a strong foundation of protecting human rights. Those principles marked a set of goalposts for evaluating the consequences of democratic practice in the years to come. And third, I describe the plan to reorient the spatial configuration of the country and undo the vision of Apartheid planners. The new local municipality of Mogale City would be established in the context of new provinces and a new local government structure that aspired for integration rather than separation. Finally, I return to Mogale City to consider some of the early challenges associated with implementing this new democracy in practice. In subsequent chapters, I make the link between this brand of South African democracy—the institutions chosen to structure political conflict in this divided society—and patterns of dignified development over the quarter century following the historic April 1994 election. The Election The successful implementation of a first multiracial election was a critical step toward consolidating this new democracy. Tellingly, virtually all of the adult South Africans over the age of thirty-five I surveyed or interviewed myself in 2019 in Krugersdorp, Munsieville, Kagiso, and Muldersdrift could recall with some detail where they were and how they felt as the voting process unfolded between April 26 and 29, 1994. Nomthandazo Sikoto was born in Soweto in 1966 and came to Kagiso in 1987, already a political activist in her early twenties. She woke up on April 27, 1994, at 6 a.m. to join the now iconic winding queues that were photographed at polling stations around the country. She waited until 2 p.m. to finally cast a vote and said that although she hadn’t eaten anything all day, she didn’t feel hungry. It was an emotional day and she gladly participated in the massive celebrations. She would go on to vote in every subsequent election, and when I met her on the eve of the 2019 national election, she told me she had every intention of casting her vote the next day. Juliana Steyn, a White woman whose name and accent revealed her Afrikaans roots, grew up just outside Krugersdorp. Like most young White adults her age, she joined the South African army as she left high school in 1992. And on that election day in 1994, she saluted the about-to-be-old South African flag—which itself depicted the British flag, as well as the flags of Kruger’s South African Republic and the Orange Free State—for a final farewell. Later in the afternoon, she would salute the new, five-color flag with its bold stripes and angles making a sideways Y. As the other White soldiers had been instructed to do, she ran laps until she could properly sing “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika”—a song performed at the South African Native National Congress in 1912 and adopted as the official hymn of the ANC in 1925.3 At least in the near term, “Nkosi” would serve as one of two dual national anthems in the “new” South Africa. Juliana could already sing the other: “Die Stem van Suid-Afrika,” a holdover from the Apartheid past, which would eventually be edited to avoid references to the Great Trek in deference to post-Apartheid sensibilities. Leslie Gama was still four years too young to cast a vote. He had grown up on a few different White-owned family farms but never strayed from Muldersdrift. The area was so-called because of a family by the name of Mulder who settled there in the mid-nineteenth century and the presence of a large drift, or ford, that allowed passage over the Crocodile River. That passage connects Johannesburg to Krugersdorp and onward to the rest of the West Rand. Leslie did what he was told, and that was to remain at home. He was old enough to recognize the enormity of what was about to unfold. The idea of this unprecedented multiracial election filled his head with worst-case scenarios, rendering it the scariest day of his life. Would his parents return home? Would the area be overcome with violence? He had heard nasty rumors that the election itself was just a ploy to round up Black people. These were not simply the imaginations of a child but concerns that were widely shared among adults throughout the area. Leslie would have to wait and see. For Leslie, Juliana, and Nomthandazo, and for just about everyone in and around the still provisional Krugersdorp District, that day held a mix of joy, excitement, and uncertainty. Over 90 percent of the Black respondents and close to 80 percent of the White respondents I surveyed4 around Mogale City in 2019 said that they voted in that 1994 election.5 Not surprisingly, sentiments divided along racial lines. For Blacks, virtually all recalled the day as one filled with euphoria. “I was at home celebrating with my family and I was joyful for a change from the oppressed life I lived before 1994.” “I was in Kagiso happy with the whole community and chanting the struggle songs.” “It felt like God was coming … like the struggle was over.” “I was in Munsieville South—this is not far from where Desmond Tutu grew up—and was happy because everyone was celebrating.” “That day made me happy.” For Whites, many also recalled feeling hopeful, happy, relieved. But others saw only doom ahead. “I was at home and all Whites including me thought the worst is still coming.” “The only thing that comes to my mind was, Black people will fight White people.” “I did not mind that much but was afraid, thinking that Blacks may as well do revenge to us.” “It was a happy and sad mood in our community because of the changes that were going to happen.” One White man from Dan Pienaarville, who was sixteen at the time of the election, was blunt. “I was here in Krugersdorp and wasn’t happy knowing that we will have a Black president.” The election was South Africa’s, but it reverberated far beyond its borders. Given the scope of the anti-Apartheid movement and fascination with the lead actors—the Nobel committee had already jointly awarded its 1993 Peace Prize to De Klerk and Mandela—the day marked a sharp contrast from the images of conflict, protest, and police brutality that for several decades had dominated external views of the country. Ballots: The Rules and the Choices When citizens arrived at their voting stations in Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, Muldersdrift, and throughout the newly constituted republic in April 1994, they immediately experienced the most important new rules of the game. Each voter received two pieces of paper from the temporary electoral commission employees: one marked “RSA” and the other “Prov”—ballots for the respective national and provincial elections. The ballot papers were printed in color, both much longer than they were wide. Each contained the sentence, “Make your mark next to the party you choose,” which was repeated in the ten other official languages, a recognition of the country’s cultural diversity. Below the instructions, the national ballot listed nineteen party names, symbols, and a headshot of each party leader—but not their names. In other words, neither “Nelson” nor “Mandela” appeared anywhere on the page. In this setup, known as a party-list, proportional representation (PR) system, the composition of the Parliament is determined by the share of votes each party receives from the voters. Prior to the election, the parties register ranked lists of their own preferred party members for those positions. Thus if a party is allocated twenty seats after the election results are in, the first twenty names on that party’s list become Members of Parliament (MPs). Each party would develop its own rules and procedures for determining those lists, and not surprisingly, the ANC lists would be replete with liberation heroes. Once seats are allocated, the MPs must vote on who will be the state president in an election determined by a simple majority. The result is generally straightforward if a single party attains more than 50 percent of the seats: the post goes to the person at the top of that party’s list. Failing that, party leaders engage in bargaining to form a coalition, and typically that means that some parties agree to vote for another party’s leader in exchange for some concessions in terms of policies and/or appointments. Once the leader has been elected, they get to make choices about various government appointments. However, even between elections, the leader serves at the pleasure of the Parliament and can be replaced. Such a system has many virtues but also carries certain important risks. First, and most obviously, it affords significant power to parties and weighs against a focus on any single individual. If you are wary of unchecked individuals, this is a good system. However, if you are concerned about the quality or transparency of parties, it might be less preferable. When elections become competitive, the system can incentivize ambitious political leaders to split off to form their own, smaller and smaller parties. This can burden voters with simply too many choices, and parties can tend to become more about individual personalities than about ideas and policy platforms. The design of a PR system is clearly aimed at being more inclusive of a wider variety of perspectives. It allows even relatively small parties to participate in the legislatures, as they can literally get their own seats at the table.6 By comparison, in a typical “two-party” system that tends to emerge with different sets of electoral rules—as in the case of the United States—small parties with a particular focus are almost never officially represented anywhere. In the U.S. system for electing the national legislature, Americans vote for candidates within specific electoral districts, and the individual with the most votes gets the seat reserved for that contest. It is a “winner-take-all” approach, because unless you get the most votes and win the contest, you get zero representation. While representativeness is a virtue, when institutionalized it also implies that more extreme positions will have opportunities to have their voices recognized. Thus, for example, a PR system is more likely to include far-left and far-right parties in the legislature, for better and worse. No solution is perfect. When there is enormous heterogeneity of preferences, and those are reinforced by cultural differences and economic inequalities, no institutional fix can make everyone happy, let alone guarantee shared prosperity. While it is not possible to know for sure how history would have unfolded under different electoral rules, I am largely convinced that proportional representation was the best system for South Africa in order to keep all organized interests vested in democratic politics. Beyond the electoral rules, the logistics of administering the election were daunting. Compared with the previous all-White national election in 1989, in which the government prepared for 5 million eligible voters, at least 22 million were eligible in 1994, and the number of polling stations and polling booths more than tripled. Moreover, the majority of the electorate approached election day without the experience of having voted before, a problem that challenged the electoral commission, which did not have a multiracial voter roll to work with.7 My good friend Michael Goldberg, who had traveled with me to South Africa in 1991, returned to the country after our graduation. (Frankly, I still harbor jealousy about that fact.) He spent the run-up to the election in 1993 conducting voter education workshops for first-time voters. The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and other voter education organizations implemented programs to train community-based Black South Africans to run their own workshops in their own communities. Mundane topics and logistics needed to be addressed to avoid calamity on election day. What type of identification documents would be accepted? Would individuals enter the voting booth alone or with a family member or friend? In many of the rural areas where Goldberg worked, citizens expressed fears that White farmers would intimidate their workers to vote for their preferred candidates. Voter education workshops and materials emphasized “my vote is my secret.” Not surprisingly, many of the faces and symbols printed on the South African ballot in 1994 were those of the leaders and organizations that had been prominent in the political struggles for political change. Although long at odds with much of the rest of the liberation movement, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader at the helm of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), could campaign on some anti-Apartheid credentials. His opportunity to mount a formal campaign was severely truncated by his own decision to boycott the election, one he reversed just a week before it was scheduled to begin. Buthelezi and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, had enjoyed autonomy and a government budget under the Apartheid system. With eight million Zulus in the country, Buthelezi could threaten the stability and legitimacy of the election. In a strange alliance, during the constitutional negotiations process, Buthelezi worked with White separatists and other Black homeland leaders to demand greater provincial autonomy from what would surely be an ANC-run central government. They failed to extract this revision, but perhaps because they did not want to be political outcasts and/or because the ANC promised the maintenance of the monarchy and a royal budget, Buthelezi capitulated. The White Parliament needed to be called back for one last session to amend the interim constitution to allow for this late entry into the electoral contest, but in the end, Buthelezi’s face and party symbol were affixed as a sticker at the bottom of the millions of paper ballots in time for the election.8 And yet, there was no doubt—at least by the time of the election—that the liberation party was the African National Congress, and the photo of Nelson Mandela deserved to be framed on a wall of portraits of other independence leaders, including Ghana’s Nkrumah, Tanzania’s Nyerere, Kenya’s Kenyatta, and others. During Mandela’s time in prison, especially throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, many other individuals and organizations played a critical role in challenging the Apartheid government, including through mass action organized by trade unions and the coalition of civil society organizations embodied in the UDF. The ANC made a formal “tripartite” alliance with the major trade union federation, COSATU, and with the SACP, partners who shared a vision for the future. The arrangement successfully consolidated electoral support as only the ANC would appear on the ballot. In this sense, one of the country’s greatest blessings entering the transition period was that the mantle of leadership for “Black South Africa” had already largely coalesced around Mandela and his ANC. (In 1993, 56 percent of all South Africans and 81 percent of Black Africans said they favored the ANC.)9 The ANC was a diverse organization committed to a pluralist political order. Many Whites, Coloureds, and Indians had actively participated in and sometimes made the ultimate sacrifice for the struggle. And at least initially, the party visibly maintained individuals within its senior ranks from all four Apartheid-recognized race groups. The non-racialism ideals central to the Freedom Charter were routinely on display, especially in the company that Nelson Mandela kept. The 1994 election marked an unprecedented milestone in providing the previously disenfranchised a focal moment in which to make decisions about whom they wanted as leaders. And they were reminded that there was a choice to be made: despite the high legitimacy of Mandela himself and the ANC, nineteen parties were on the first ballot, and many of them enjoyed relatively strong bases of support and were able to compete freely. Amid the profound diversity and inequality of this newly formed polity, millions of people engaged in the exact same process within the period of just a few days: step into a voting booth, mark an X on each of the same two pieces of paper that were distributed throughout the country, and be able to keep their choices secret.10 For the first time ever, Blacks, Whites, Coloureds, Indians, and those not classified under the Apartheid rubric would collectively vote, marking a dramatic new start to what for a very long time would be called the “New South Africa.” And for the first time, being a Black South African citizen was no longer an oxymoron. The Results: ANC Victory, but Not a Supermajority For many expecting the worst, the largely smooth election came as a surprise. As an ANC leader recounted to me: I think with the release of Mandela, the unbanning of political organizations, we then knew that we were going to really have fundamental change in South Africa. So we were preparing ourselves, [but] … just days before the election, people, the whole of South Africa, were really in a tense state. People of all communities, all different walks of life, were really caught up with the fear of the unknown, what will democracy bring? Would it be like some parts of Africa or Europe where things go haywire? And we all caught up the day after elections on that fateful April day. And the sun rose, things were normal, people walked about, and suddenly, it was a huge sigh of relief for all South Africans who have crossed the Rubicon. We’ve done the big change.11 And back in Muldersdrift, Leslie Gama’s parents did come home that day. Despite rumors of a counterrevolutionary force within the military, it did not disrupt the election. For most adults around Krugersdorp and throughout South Africa, fear gave way to excitement. As happened in many new democracies around the world, people proudly displayed the indelible ink marked on their fingers—applied to thwart attempts to vote more than one time. There were a few bouts of violence. And there were some irregularities, including a mismatch between the electoral results in KwaZulu-Natal and preelection opinion polls.12 But none sufficient to impede the consensus that the election was at least “crudely legitimate.”13 Nationwide, approximately 19.5 million votes were cast, and 12.2 million were marked for the African National Congress. By the formulas of the IEC, their 62.7 percent of valid votes counted translated into 252 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly.14 Although the ANC had been widely expected to gain up to 70 percent of the vote, because they received just less than a two-thirds “supermajority,” the party would not be able to unilaterally alter the constitution. This was an outcome that most could live with, and likely a blessing that the party did not come out of the blocks fully dominant. De Klerk’s National Party—the very one that created and later dismantled Apartheid—captured just over 20 percent of the vote, performing well not just among White voters but also among Indian and Coloured voters, the latter being particularly dominant in the Western Cape. After forty years in power, spearheading one of the world’s most reprehensible systems of modern government, but also helping dismantle it, their campaign rehashed old tropes in new clothes. The party’s leaders continued to market the idea of “Black domination” to minority groups who feared retribution in the new order. For example, the National Party had systematically privileged Coloureds over Black Africans during the Apartheid era, and in the Cape, virtually all Coloureds speak Afrikaans. In turn, the NP successfully mobilized this voting bloc around the idea that they were essentially “Brown Afrikaners” and needed to protect themselves from unchecked ANC power. Many listened, and especially in the Western Cape Province, Coloureds overwhelmingly voted for the NP.15 Buthelezi’s IFP was expectedly strong in the Zulu-dominated region of KwaZulu-Natal where many voters viewed the ANC as virtually an enemy, following years of intense ANC-IFP conflict during the transition. The IFP also did well with Zulu-speaking migrant mine workers, including around Krugersdorp. All told, this translated into 10.5 percent of the national vote share. Constand Viljoen, leader of the Freedom Front and successor to the same Conservative Party that controlled the Krugersdorp council at the end of Apartheid, also received over 400,000 votes nationwide. At the time the Freedom Front, promoting a Volkstaat, a separate independent homeland for Afrikaners, gained much of its support from the urban periphery—places like Krugersdorp on the West Rand, where it received almost 6 percent of the vote.16 Nationwide it took in just 2 percent. Despite some strong historical political roots in the country, both the Democratic Party (DP) and the PAC had weak showings; each attracted less than 2 percent of the vote. And on May 9 the Parliament convened, governed by the new Speaker, an Indian woman and human rights lawyer named Frene Ginwala. Their one order of business was to elect the new state president, Nelson Mandela, and they did so without dissent. He and scores of other leaders would depart almost immediately for Pretoria, a two-hour flight away, as the new government adopted many of the old government’s rules and traditions, including keeping the Parliament in Cape Town and the executive government offices in Pretoria, which serves as a second capital city. (The third capital, of the judicial branch, is in Bloemfontein.) This multicitied capital was one of many holdovers from the creation of the Union of South Africa, which itself merged four separate entities. On the following day, May 10, Mandela was inaugurated as the first post-Apartheid president at the age of seventy-five. The ceremony took place at the Union Building, originally completed in 1913 with the two wings meant to symbolize the union of the English and Afrikaner “races.”17 Now, in 1994, South Africa would, once again, mark with an election the unification of people and territory and much greater cultural diversity within its polity. Both within the ruling party and across the parties that had won seats in the new Parliament, citizens of almost any background could find some representative who looked like them and/or represented their interests and values. Very few could have said that they were fully excluded. The day was nothing short of remarkable. At his inauguration, attended by dozens of world leaders, Mandela proclaimed, “Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.… Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.”18 It took a century of struggle, but in the final decade of the twentieth century, demographic reality finally became the basis for political power in South Africa and legalized apartness was over. Indeed, South Africans emerged relatively peacefully through the first election. Mandela, a political activist, and once widely recognized by Whites as a terrorist, was now the shining symbol of the “New South Africa.” The country, and the larger world, could not get enough of him. I also wanted to see for myself. Following my first year of graduate school in June 1995, I traveled with my soon-to-be fiancée, Amy, to Cape Town for a two-week trip to lay eyes on the new version of the country I had last seen under very different circumstances in 1991. As always, it was a painfully long flight from the United States. We stayed in the not-yet-upgraded Breakwater Lodge, on the outskirts of what was still a relatively small waterfront development along the stunning Atlantic seaboard. Sleep-deprived, we were looking forward to getting some rest. Standing in the way were revelers. There was partying in the hotel. Serious partying. And it went on … All. Night. Long. Earlier that day, South Africa had defeated Australia in the first round of the Rugby World Cup, being hosted in the country for the first time, a dividend of huge proportions for the sport-loving White population. Kegs of Castle Lager flowed through the bars, raising the volume into our room each hour. On the bright side, my friend Michael, still working at NDI, had thoughtfully bought us tickets to the next game, which would turn out to be South Africa versus Romania at Newland Stadium in Cape Town. The game itself was fun to watch, but I was not a big rugby fan. Why throw the ball backward? For me, the real spectacle was the fans. Black spectators accustomed to cheering for any team competing against South Africa were now rooting for a group of essentially all-White men, resolved, at least for now, that they were actually on the same side. And watching the massive-bodied White rugby fans do as Juliana Steyn had done, awkwardly mouthing their way through “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika,” and the Black fans willing to reappropriate this team and their symbols as their own—if that wasn’t a spirit of reconciliation, it was hard to imagine what would be. Pessimists became optimists, and of course the fact that the South Africans would eventually win the cup helped generate a collective sense of pride about what had been accomplished as a new nation in relatively short order. And Mandela conspicuously displayed his forbearance toward White South Africa when he opted to don the Springbok jersey—previously a symbol of “White” South Africa—at the final awards ceremony, a moment dramatically captured in the movie Invictus. Constitutional Rights: Foundations for Restoring Dignity The 1994 election was governed by a temporary, interim constitution, and the resulting Parliament immediately acted as a constitutional assembly to produce a permanent replacement. Signed in late 1996, and in effect as of early 1997, that document set a high bar for the types of rights that would be guaranteed to citizens—protections not simply from a potentially intrusive government (as the American constitution emphasized) but from the everyday realities of social and economic despair. It offered a progressive and inclusive vision of what the New South Africa should look like. Jurists and legal scholars around the world have come to regard the South African document as an extraordinary model—the epitome of a modern constitution.19 Much of the content drew quite explicitly on the demands and aspirations of prior generations of the liberation movement. Since its founding, the ANC leadership frequently comprised educated elites who spotlighted the contradiction between the human rights ideal and the reality of how Black people were treated. Sol Plaatje and other attorneys demanded an unbiased judicial system and equal application of the law as early as the first decades of the twentieth century.20 In 1923, the young ANC produced an “African Bill of Rights for South Africa” to remind the country and the world that Black Africans were also human and deserved to be treated in kind. It called for representation, liberty, and the right to property, arguing that African inhabitants of the Union had, “as human beings, the indisputable right to a place of abode in this land of their fathers.”21 In 1943, the organization adopted a document titled Africans’ Claims in South Africa, also known as The Atlantic Charter from the African’s Point of View. It was a response to the Atlantic Charter, advanced by President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which laid the foundation for the formation of the United Nations, and set out a vision for shared global peace and prosperity.22 As stated in the preface of the ANC document, Churchill had intended the charter to apply only to White people. In their documented response, the ANC wanted to make clear that as human beings, Black Africans were entitled to the same. Next, there was the 1955 Freedom Charter, perhaps the most critical document outlining ANC aspirations for a post-Apartheid future. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, this document, the product of months of citizen input, was launched by the Congress of the People at Kliptown, less than fifty kilometers from Krugersdorp. It drew explicitly on the notion of universal entitlement to the protection of human rights. The Freedom Charter took center stage at some of the secret negotiations between exiled Black leaders and White politicians during the late 1980s. And although Nelson Mandela’s landmark three-hour speech delivered in 1964 while a defendant in the Rivonia trial was not an official ANC charter in the manner of the two aforementioned documents, it took on great political weight for its clarity and bravery, contributing to Mandela’s legitimacy as a future leader even as that trial would land him in prison for much of the next three decades. The speech is best known for his final statement in which he proclaimed that for the values and causes he articulated, “I am prepared to die.” Throughout the speech, he reiterated these long-standing human rights demands and expectations. Although the final constitution made no express reference to Apartheid itself, or to any of these key documents that sought to challenge institutionalized White supremacy, even a casual reading reveals very strong links to this history. For example, the preamble of the 1996 constitution states, “We, the people of South Africa, Recognise the injustices of our past.” And like the Freedom Charter, it called for “non-racialism.” And just as the Freedom Charter proclaimed that “the preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime,” so did the constitution: “[Freedom of expression] does not extend to advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.” A set of fairly standard civil and political rights, including freedom of speech, association, and a free press, that appeared in the final constitution were also echoes from the Freedom Charter. Perhaps most remarkable was the extent to which calls for specific social and economic rights, demanded in Africans’ Claims, the Freedom Charter, and “I Am Prepared to Die,” were also enshrined in the highest law of the land. This included access to free education, housing, social security, and health care and freedom from hunger. By making these rights, the South African constitution opened the possibility for lawyers to push for material progress in the courts when offered evidence of gaps and shortfalls. Again reflecting the Freedom Charter, the constitution also emphasized respect for cultural autonomy or group rights by guaranteeing access to education in a choice of one of the eleven official languages. More generally, the constitution reflected the Freedom Charter’s balancing act of advocating “non-racialism” alongside explicit recognition of past racial discrimination and the need for redress. In his “I Am Prepared to Die” speech, Mandela argued that “the lack of human dignity experienced by Africans was the direct result of the policy of White supremacy,” and in turn, the constitution’s Bill of Rights proclaimed, “Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected.” Also revealing is where the documents diverged. Most conspicuously, the constitution did not reflect the aspiration of the Freedom Charter to nationalize the mines, or frankly, to nationalize much of anything. Moreover, the Freedom Charter made very specific demands for “full employment” and a forty-hour work week, which also did not materialize. These exceptions notwithstanding, the human rights values espoused by the ANC and the resistance movements against institutionalized White supremacy were clearly enshrined in the new constitution. In turn, specific directives invited a wide range of political actors to participate in the quest to extend respect for human dignity to all citizens. The Redrawing of Administrative Boundaries The other big question central to the design of democratic government was how to redraw the internal boundaries of the country. After almost a century of intense racial segregation, including forced relocation to several “homeland” governments, a radical reconfiguration was necessary. One option was a centralized approach, more like the French system, which incorporates a high level of uniformity throughout its territory. That might be appealing in terms of its prospects for providing equitable treatment to all South Africans, but it would face the realities of profound disparities in resources and capacities that would make such a system at least initially unworkable. Another option would be to devolve a great deal of decision making and authority to localized governments, as is the case in the United States. By the time of South Africa’s political transition, decentralization and strong local government had become new “international norms.” You want a real democracy? You need to give some power to politicians who live and interact with people in their communities, not in some distant national capital. It was a compelling argument but needed to be implemented in a manner that would be viewed as fair and feasible, not a straightforward task anywhere, let alone in a place with South Africa’s levels of cultural diversity overlaid with inequality. Boundary-making provides almost limitless possibilities for political conflict. Given that South Africans were already highly segregated into racially demarcated neighborhoods and sometimes regions, and that the conditions in White areas were so much better than the rest (and Indian and Coloured areas were also largely better serviced and more prosperous than Black African areas), and assuming that there would be no more forced movement of people—suddenly the stakes of those internal boundaries became quite high. As finalized in the 1996 constitution, South Africa would be a “quasi-federal” polity. The nine new provinces would have substantial discretion in their budgets and in the administration of many policies, but they would not be truly autonomous and would remain almost entirely dependent on the national government for revenue. Reflecting this relationship, elections for provincial legislatures would be jointly coordinated with national elections, all under the auspices of a national electoral commission. Krugersdorp, formerly in the “Transvaal” Province of the old South Africa, as of 1994 would now sit in Gauteng (along with Johannesburg and Pretoria). Cape Town would become the new capital of the Western Cape Province. Durban, the old Natal Province, and the former KwaZulu homeland would become KwaZulu-Natal. In this critical redrawing, the homelands of Apartheid design would be no more. On election day, the borders, laws, and government of Bop, and the three other independent homelands, had no legal basis; Bop’s oddly unconnected territories were integrated into the Northern Cape, Gauteng, and Free State provinces. And similar reconfigurations would occur throughout the country to varying degrees; some provinces would inherit a great deal of former homeland territory, whereas the Western Cape would inherit none. Meanwhile, the hundreds of traditional leaders whose authority was very much vested in the homeland structure would be offered more than a proverbial bone: the government would recognize particular areas as essentially co-governed by such leaders, a government department would be established to provide national-level representation, and the leaders themselves would receive government salaries.23 FIGURE 5.1. South Africa’s post-Apartheid provincial boundaries. Note: What is today Limpopo Province was initially named Northern Transvaal in 1994, and then in 1995, Northern Province; what is today Mpumalanga was initially named Eastern Transvaal in 1994. Particularly contentious was how the boundaries of the more intimate level of local government would be drawn. In this context, the potential gap between promises, expectations, and realities could be seen most visibly for individual citizens. Again, White South Africa had never fully realized its goal of becoming a White country, and as was the case with Krugersdorp, most of the relatively well-off White towns and cities around the country included and/or were surrounded by racially segregated townships. By the 1980s, many of the latter were formally governed by Black Local Authorities (yes, an official term), and unsurprisingly, as these were generally viewed as illegitimate and underresourced, they did not function well. By contrast, the White local governments generally did just fine and expenditures were matched with sufficient tax revenues. The post-Apartheid challenge was to amalgamate these into integrated polities but also to have local government structures. The possibility that decentralization could backfire was not lost on the ANC, whose leaders recognized that devolution was frequently a mechanism to protect the privileges of White people.24 For example, if Krugersdorp would be allowed to remain essentially “as is,” a largely White town with a White tax base, independent and separate from the neighboring Black areas such as Kagiso and Munsieville, then race-based Apartheid could largely survive in practice. Anticipating this possibility, across South Africa’s nine provinces, close to three hundred local governments were either reconfigured or born anew, including a handful of major metropolitan authorities (including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, and today there are a total of eight).25 While many essentially Black-only municipalities would remain, especially in rural, former homeland areas (where virtually no Whites, Coloureds, or Indians reside), this would mark the end of White-only local government, and municipalities in urban areas and on the urban periphery would now be multiracial polities. For the time being, the mosaic of greater Krugersdorp would be known as Krugersdorp District. Although the big prizes for electoral politics were clearly the seats in the national parliament and the state presidency, subnational governments soon emerged as important political arenas, perhaps in large part because this was where the ANC was vulnerable—not always able to attain over 50 percent of the seats needed to control governments. Most prominently, the ANC lost two of nine provinces in that first election: the Western Cape delivered the majority of its votes to the National Party and KwaZulu-Natal to the IFP. As in the national elections, these reflected the fact that race and ethnicity would loom large over voting patterns, and the ANC was defeated in these two provinces because Black Africans were a minority in the Western Cape and because Zulus dominated KwaZulu-Natal. Whatever one might have thought about the merits of these two opposition parties, the fact that they could enjoy visible access to power undoubtedly helped boost their constituents’ confidence in the system. Local Democracy in Practice In Gauteng, South Africa’s industrial heartland, where more than a quarter of the population squeezes into less than 2 percent of the landmass, the ANC was strong in the 1994 contest, certainly strong enough to win, but did not completely dominate as it did in some of the other provinces. It took in 59.1 percent of the votes cast for the national election and 57.6 percent for the provincial legislature. In an important province like Gauteng, the ANC deployed some of its best political talent. Toxyo Sexwale, a man who served time on Robben Island, supported Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness movement, and spent several years in exile, became the first provincial premier. Like Cyril Ramaphosa, Sexwale was immediately viewed as a possible successor to Mandela. By the end of 1994, residents of the newly integrated Krugersdorp District would be led by a trifecta of former political prisoners, because in addition to Mandela as president and Sexwale as provincial premier, in November of that year, a former political detainee, Stephen Motingoa, became the first Black man to be mayor of Krugersdorp. Motingoa was born and raised in Munsieville and in 1986 was detained without trial by the Apartheid government for more than a year. He was subsequently charged with sedition and subversion, but after his release he worked as a union leader and went to London to get a degree in development studies.26 The ceremonial mayoral chain donned by generations of White men would now be worn by a Black man in the town that Pretorius named after Paul Kruger, the site of Paardekraal, a shrine to Afrikanerdom; a town where the British had put Afrikaners in concentration camps and where Whites reconciled their own civil war around the exclusion of Blacks. Like so much in South Africa at the time, the local government was self-consciously provisional—it was called a Transitional Local Council (TLC). As recently as the late 1980s, many White Krugersdorpers would have described the images of a Black mayor and Black president as the coming of the apocalypse. The West Rander newspaper had to concede that the election went smoothly in the area. However, rather than depicting the images of the new Black voters or Black leaders on the cover, the editor chose instead a portrait of the White mayor of nearby Roodepoort, standing in front of the new South African flag, while glumly holding the old one in his hands.27 In my Historical Memories Survey I asked residents to reflect on this “transition period” from 1994 to 1999: “Was it smooth or difficult?” Their recollections were decidedly mixed,28 and again, predictably cleaved along racial and ethnic lines, but also in terms of where they were living. For the most part, Black residents recalled feeling hopeful. One man, in his late twenties at the time, said he “hoped that things would change, that I would have a better life, that the government would provide us with skills to make our lives better, as well as land.” The most frequently used words and phrases that Black residents used to describe this period and their vision of the future included “better,” “optimistic,” “better life,” and “free education.” Particularly for Black Africans in the more urban areas, the memories were largely upbeat: as a Black woman who was fifty-six when Mandela was elected explained, “There was no problem, and we transitioned smoothly.” Another citizen recalled, “It was smooth because houses were built.” But yet another who today lives in the same ward recalls things differently: “I will say it was a tough transition because Whites did not accept the defeat and there were those who still mistreated the Blacks because of that.” Whites in the more urban areas were also largely positive: “It was smooth because we accepted a better chance to live with and among each other, go to school together, have equal job opportunities,” a woman from Dan Pienaarville explained. “During those years, [we] had a smooth transition because we were able to mix with all races and attend church together.” But in the more rural areas—in Muldersdrift, for example, where Leslie Gama stayed home on election day—the recollections were more negative. A Black woman who was twenty in 1999 recounted, “In 1999, it was tough because people were not free to walk in the streets at night, there were people on bikes that were patrolling at night beating people who were walking in the streets.” Many other Black Africans from the area recall being beaten or challenged by Whites during the transition. Political tensions were high, and some Whites chose to display the old flag, a symbol of loyalty to the old regime.29 Many White Krugersdorpers, especially the Afrikaner population, entered the democratic era highly skeptical of the idea of Black government and of the economic redistribution this would inevitably entail. As early as January 1995, just a few months into the new administration, the Krugersdorp News ran a front-page story: “Councillors in the Local Transitional Council Get Paid Handsomely to Do Their Job, or Not To.” The article mentioned the 2.3-million-rand budget for councillor salaries and highlighted, “White ratepayers carry the burden for the expenditures and salaries of the town’s 54 councillors.… According to the town clerk, Koos Richards, no contributions are being received from Kagiso or Munsieville towards these payments.”30 These White South Africans resented the notion of even a transitional period of racially redistributive tax payments toward shared public services. And White councillors frequently complained that the new government, just less than a year old, would soon bankrupt the council. At the most extreme, some still wanted to opt out of the New South Africa altogether. They never gave up on the core ideology that led Paul Kruger’s family to flee the Cape for the Rand. While hundreds of thousands of the country’s wealthier Whites, especially those who spoke English at home, had already departed South Africa for London, New York, Southern California, Sydney, and Perth,31 Krugersdorp was generally not home to such would-be cosmopolitans. Afrikaner-descended families in particular tended not to have social networks or opportunities in Europe or the British commonwealth. As they liked to point out, they are Africans too. In June 1995, a Freedom Front councillor advocated a referendum to include Krugersdorp in the Volkstaat—a proposal Motingoa and others decried.32 That this idea still had traction reflected the degree to which some were resisting the new order. Nonetheless, the Krugersdorp News would soon accept the reality of political change and published a flattering profile of the mayor five months into his term, sharing his personal history and humanizing a Black person in a manner that had been extraordinarily rare in any of the West Rand news outlets. Motingoa humbly refused to make any analogies between his path and Nelson Mandela’s. However, he did attempt to share the new president’s forgiving disposition: “The torture, humiliation and physical injuries left their mark, but I channel my bitterness into working towards peace and reconciliation.”33 Begrudgingly, the News followed up with a headline, “TLC Is Not Too Bad.” The accompanying story highlighted that many residents were happy about the change: “the TLC has made an effort to beautify Munsieville.” Another, from Dan Pienaarville and with an Afrikaans family name, was cautiously skeptical: “We have to wait and see what is going to happen.”34 Until 2000, the local government system remained provisional as details of demarcation of boundaries and assignment of responsibilities were still under review. But that year, Krugersdorp District was formally consecrated as Mogale City Local Municipality. The new council adopted an African name for the entity while maintaining Krugersdorp as the town that would serve as the seat of that government. Mogale was a freedom-fighting chief, the namesake of the Magaliesberg mountains, who suffered various indignities at the hands of Paul Kruger’s relatives and associates in the early part of the nineteenth century.35 The new mosaic epitomized the opportunities and challenges of post-Apartheid South Africa in localized form. And at least initially, in electoral terms, the municipality was a bellwether town. In the 1994 national election, the 81,232 votes cast for the ANC in what was then Krugersdorp District represented 62.6 percent of the vote share36—almost exactly the party’s share of votes nationwide (62.7 percent). In the first official local election in 2000, the ANC received 60 percent of the Mogale City vote, as compared with 65 percent of the vote in local elections throughout the country. FIGURE 5.2.

The new local government institutions added an important wrinkle to democratic practice in South Africa. On the one hand, each local council would function in some ways like the national parliament in the sense that the seats of the council would be allocated via proportional representation, based on voters’ choices for their preferred party. Each municipality would also be subdivided into a series of wards of approximately equal population size, and each voter would cast a ballot for a single ward councillor, some of whom would stand without any party affiliation. In turn, the council would be filled with the ward councillors, and then seats allocated from the various party lists, such that the total number of seats for each party was proportional to the total number of PR votes cast. The ward councillor and committees elected within wards would be citizens’ points of contact to the council. Citizens could also contact “shadow” ward councillors from other parties, as those who had seats from the PR vote would routinely be assigned to wards the party lost in order to stay connected to citizens.37 From “Bold Experiment” to “Miracle” Considering the elections, the new constitution, the reconfigured administrative boundaries, and frankly the new mood in the country, by the late 1990s, the South Africans had clearly overperformed relative to expectations. Observers inside and outside the country routinely described the new democracy as a “miracle.”38 Others called the few years after 1994 a “honeymoon.” In any case, the formal transition from Apartheid to post-Apartheid government was complete. There was no civil war, no massive reprisals, no fundamental challenges to the legitimacy of the new order. Where South Africa had once been banned and sanctioned, now the world was coming in to see this beautiful country and to get a taste of what was going on. In just a few dramatic years, the political landscape of southern Africa was transformed. People around the world, myself included, celebrated the successful transition and the new moral authority the country’s leaders now assumed on the world stage. And it was in this context that Amy and I returned to South Africa in 1997 to live for a year, primarily so that I could carry out research. As part of my preparations, I studied Xhosa—the Black African language spoken most widely in the Cape—and although I never became fluent, I learned to carry on a conversation, and that turned out to be a nice way to break the ice with a lot of people. In the days after we arrived, I learned that the South Africans were as interested in us as we were in them. To be clear, by “us,” I mean they were literally obsessed with Michael Jackson. The arrival of “Jacko,” as they called him, dominated the front pages of newspapers, even amid reports of gangsterism in Cape Town townships and the forging of a new political party by a former homeland leader and a White National Party politician-turned-anti-Apartheid activist. Jackson’s talent for music and performance, and seeming racial ambiguity, piqued interest across the South African color bar. We made arrangements to affiliate ourselves with local institutions. Amy worked at the South African National Gallery and taught art history at the University of Cape Town. I was supported as a Fulbright Fellow, and as part of that process I arranged for an affiliation with the successor organization to IDASA. Now it would be called the Institute for Democracy in South Africa (IDASA). With sizable amounts of foreign funding, it became a think tank and aggregator of civil society organizations, carrying out a range of functions, including voter education, parliamentary monitoring, and budget analysis. Located in a spectacular colonial-era, high-ceilinged building in Cape Town, on 6 Spin Street, just around the corner from the Parliament buildings, several government buildings, and the National Library, it was just about the best spot I could have asked for to witness all that was going on, and I made some lifelong friends who would remain in the field of democratic development (and even read drafts of the manuscript for this book). Outside “experts” were coming through the halls each week, but effectively, those outsiders were learning more than they were teaching—the South Africans were brimming with ideas and high ideals, and I loved coming into the office each day. No one took for granted that in order to build a democracy, citizens needed to learn more about the process and how it would affect them. Government budgets, for example, can be extraordinarily opaque, so members of IDASA’s Budget Information Service would describe the implications of the budget for women or for children in accessible publications and in workshops. Although the organization clearly had great sympathies for the new ANC government, it set up a Parliamentary Monitoring Service to make sure that power was checked and key debates and decisions were shared with citizens. The Public Opinion Service made sure that it was not just government that was carrying out and analyzing surveys and that nationally representative views on key issues could be articulated in representations to government. New policies and practices were sorely needed to realize the ambitions of the new constitution, and creative and energetic South Africans were rising to the occasion to provide these. I sat in on debates in which various political actors engaged in foundational discussions about what a fair and just society ought to look like. My own research was on the tax system, so I attended parliamentary hearings on proposals to revise that system. Tax experts tried to discuss the highly technical topic in politically neutral language, but they could not avoid falling back on fundamental questions. For instance, when it came time to debate taxes on estates—typically a minor source of revenue for the state—a representative of White farmers said that high estate taxes would force many family farmers to sell off large parts of their farms, effectively ending the family business. In turn, an ANC Member of Parliament stood up and asked, “Would that be so bad?” My doctoral advisor, Robert Price,39 introduced me to Andrew Feinstein, a White ANC Member of Parliament, who would become a personal friend while Amy and I lived in Cape Town. Feinstein was just seven years older than me, had been an anti-Apartheid activist, and had spent some time at UC Berkeley, where I was a graduate student at the time. I enjoyed talking with him about shared interests in nation-building and public finance. (And I was particularly excited when he mentioned one of my working papers in a parliamentary debate.) The fact that a White former activist had been chosen by party elites to represent the party in Parliament spoke volumes about the sustained commitment to being racially inclusive. And when I got to know him in 1997–98, Feinstein was pro-ANC all the way. He pointed out that tax policy was becoming a balancing act: initially, Whites had been willing to pay a “transition tax,” but by this point, many of the wealthiest Whites had moved much of their money offshore to avoid taxation and just in case they decided to leave the country altogether. Indeed, quite a few had already left. He shared with me his perception that White South Africans would resist more in the way of taxation, and they were complaining of crime and invoking the “Specter of Zimbabwe,” by speaking of South Africa “going the way of the rest of Africa.”40 Ironically, many of the very countries that had sanctioned South Africa for Apartheid, including the United States, were willing to embrace White South Africans who were taking their skills and resources out of the country, claiming they did not feel safe. With such an escape valve, it would be difficult to engage in too much redistributive policy. During our year in residence, Amy and I happily joined in the sport of Mandela spectating. Where would he be, and could we get a glimpse? We secured tickets to watch him host Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, one of the great African independence leaders, as he addressed the new government in the Parliament building. Nyerere offered an optimistic portrait of Africa’s future and was met with thunderous applause. A personal highlight was the opportunity to stand in the back row of a press conference held jointly with Mandela and President Bill Clinton. As a Fulbright Fellow, I had been invited to tag along with the White House press corps in exchange for my willingness to serve as a tour guide on the bus rides around town, one of which included CNN’s Wolf Blitzer sitting in front and ABC’s Sam Donaldson firing multiple questions at me as he prepared his report. Mandela and Clinton spoke to the world in March 1998 in the gardens of Tuynhuys (pronounced Tane-hace), the Cape Town office of the presidency, used when Parliament is in session. A stunningly clear blue sky hovered above Table Mountain, which itself stands behind, and towers above, the Cape Dutch building. And to our back was the Company’s Garden, created by the very Dutch settlers who had come to these shores in 1652 to cultivate the fruits and vegetables they craved on their transoceanic journeys. We all watched as the leader of the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world was fully eclipsed by the stature of an elder statesman, who deployed grit and forbearance to lead South Africa through a remarkable transition. American presidents were surely used to having their counterparts show deference to them on diplomatic visits, but in this case, the tables were clearly turned. While South Africa was in many ways burdened by its past, the long legacy of resistance also generated a great deal of political capital useful for democratic development. As described earlier, a strong commitment to a rights orientation especially within the ANC provided a coherent framework for creating democratic institutions. A strong “civil society,” the organized and autonomous associations designed to link citizens to the state, similarly proved to be a favorable by-product of a hard-fought resistance. IDASA and others, including women’s organizations and trade unions, had built strong memberships during the anti-Apartheid era and, at least initially, could credibly give voice to citizens’ wants and needs in the post-Apartheid era. Although the Apartheid state had occasionally used emergency powers to suppress journalistic freedoms, a fairly robust, critical media environment had nonetheless flourished. By 1994, a very wide range of newspapers and radio and television stations were already established and offered frequent news updates from a variety of perspectives. Within a few years, internet access expanded throughout the country and along with it, unprecedented access to information. I sent my first wireless email while in South Africa. However, as in countries throughout the world, internet access would be disproportionately available to those in urban areas and to those who could afford it. Moreover, the political resistance to Apartheid produced a number of great legal minds, which helped contribute to the development of a robust and independent judiciary. Mandela appointed Arthur Chaskalson, a member of his defense team at the Rivonia trial (who had formed the Legal Resources Centre [LRC], a human rights law organization), to be the first president of the Constitutional Court. The court would be filled with respected jurists who could make judgments independent of direct political pressures and help legitimate its place in the new democratic constitutional order. In short, the first post-Apartheid elections and Mandela’s presidency exceeded any reasonable expectations for a peaceful transfer of power. However, the successful introduction of new democratic institutions did not imply that a vibrant multiracial democracy had fully taken root and could survive the long winter of political reality. The initial five years were exceptional in many ways, most obviously because Mandela was no ordinary leader. He would be on the short list, and maybe at the top, of any global ranking of most admired and respected individuals of the twentieth century. This meant that during his presidency, he could broker deals between conflicting parties and elicit compromise over conflict. His profound personal history, sacrifices, and acts of forbearance led even his political adversaries to recognize him as verging on “superhuman.” People followed his directives because of who he was and what he had done in his own courageous life.41 While several of Africa’s most promising independence leaders—Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, and Ivory Coast’s Félix Houphouët-Boigny—each stayed in power for more than thirty years, generally to the great detriment of their countries, Mandela’s tenure in government was far shorter. Of course, he was different from these men in all sorts of ways, including the fact that he was much older when he took office. In 1998, during the fifth year of his five-year term, he celebrated his eightieth birthday, and the country began to face the reality of his humanity. The tall, powerful freedom fighter walked with a slower gait and spoke more softly. And that year, he married Graça Machel, herself a teacher, former government minister, and human rights advocate from Mozambique, who was the widow of former Mozambican state president Samora Machel. Mandela said he wanted a bit of time to live out of the everyday spotlight, and he chose not to stay on as state president or as head of the ANC. It is hard to imagine that this period would have been so smooth and peaceful without Mandela’s generous spirit, cloaked in a history of enormous personal sacrifice. Nonetheless, one of the key tenets of democracy is that government should not revolve around a single person. Rather, its institutions are designed with the intention that the people, despite their diversity, can self-govern. The value of introducing this democratic system to South Africa could only be learned over a longer period of time, in the face of new challenges and in the context of very different leaders.",

      "content": "5 The Bold Experiment INSTITUTIONS FOR A DIVIDED SOCIETY APARTHEID GOVERNMENT AND AN INCREASINGLY fractious civil war came to an end through a negotiated settlement. The final compromise was itself the product of decades of brokered discussions that progressed in fits and starts. For example, Buthelezi tried and failed to forge a workable plan with a White opposition leader as early as 1975. In 1986, two White politicians formed the Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) as a way to connect exiled Black political leaders with potentially reform-minded Afrikaners. A breakthrough came in 1987 with a successful meeting in Dakar, Senegal. However, despite great interest in the proceedings, the White government officially condemned the meeting because it involved direct communication with banned organizations.1 Throughout the 1980s, while still a prisoner of the South African government, and as violent conflict raged on, Mandela met in secret with White political leaders to consider various democratic and power-sharing proposals. Other ANC leaders did the same at venues inside and outside the country. Only after De Klerk’s 1990 speech did political leaders from the National Party, the ANC, and several other organizations, lawyers, foreign governments, and constitutional experts openly engage in wide-ranging discussions. They debated the merits of the very different options for structuring a new government. They did this in closed meetings and in public forums, in newspaper columns, in books, on the radio, and on television. A few principles gained quick assent from those deliberating the new rules of the game: full citizenship would be accorded to all irrespective of race; there would be no more legally segregated areas or amenities; and the next government would undertake ambitious projects to redress the social and economic legacies of the past. And at the center of it all would be a constitutional democracy: choosing leaders through the vote and recognizing a new constitution as the supreme law of the land. That still left quite a bit on the table for deciding how to govern a newly constituted society. Would citizens vote for individuals or for parties? Would power be concentrated or decentralized? How would the chief executive ultimately be selected? What was the vision for the appropriate role of the state in social and economic planning? What role would traditional leaders and former homeland structures play? Even with the best minds in South Africa and around the world trying to steer a mutually acceptable solution, so many obstacles stood in the way. Could you actually reverse engineer the Apartheid system to create a single, democratic polity? Being realistic about all that had happened over the previous several decades let alone the past several centuries, and the depths of divide in the country, success seemed to be a long shot. Even after Mandela’s release and after various political organizations were no longer banned, violent conflicts marred the country, ranging from attacks by the White, right-wing AWB to considerable violence between the ANC and the IFP, let alone sustained conflict in and around the homeland governments. Given skepticism about the prospects for success, many described the attempt to implement a multiracial democracy in this divided society as a “bold experiment.”2 In the remainder of this chapter, I describe the central contours of how this democratic order was established with respect to three key institutions. First, the elections. I explain why the ballots looked the way they did as voters went into their booths—describing the new electoral rules and the particular choices citizens faced. In turn, those rules and choices would channel the “will” of the people into concrete allocations of political power in government. Second, I highlight a few features of the country’s remarkable constitution, including its deep links to the demands of the resistance movement and a strong foundation of protecting human rights. Those principles marked a set of goalposts for evaluating the consequences of democratic practice in the years to come. And third, I describe the plan to reorient the spatial configuration of the country and undo the vision of Apartheid planners. The new local municipality of Mogale City would be established in the context of new provinces and a new local government structure that aspired for integration rather than separation. Finally, I return to Mogale City to consider some of the early challenges associated with implementing this new democracy in practice. In subsequent chapters, I make the link between this brand of South African democracy—the institutions chosen to structure political conflict in this divided society—and patterns of dignified development over the quarter century following the historic April 1994 election. The Election The successful implementation of a first multiracial election was a critical step toward consolidating this new democracy. Tellingly, virtually all of the adult South Africans over the age of thirty-five I surveyed or interviewed myself in 2019 in Krugersdorp, Munsieville, Kagiso, and Muldersdrift could recall with some detail where they were and how they felt as the voting process unfolded between April 26 and 29, 1994. Nomthandazo Sikoto was born in Soweto in 1966 and came to Kagiso in 1987, already a political activist in her early twenties. She woke up on April 27, 1994, at 6 a.m. to join the now iconic winding queues that were photographed at polling stations around the country. She waited until 2 p.m. to finally cast a vote and said that although she hadn’t eaten anything all day, she didn’t feel hungry. It was an emotional day and she gladly participated in the massive celebrations. She would go on to vote in every subsequent election, and when I met her on the eve of the 2019 national election, she told me she had every intention of casting her vote the next day. Juliana Steyn, a White woman whose name and accent revealed her Afrikaans roots, grew up just outside Krugersdorp. Like most young White adults her age, she joined the South African army as she left high school in 1992. And on that election day in 1994, she saluted the about-to-be-old South African flag—which itself depicted the British flag, as well as the flags of Kruger’s South African Republic and the Orange Free State—for a final farewell. Later in the afternoon, she would salute the new, five-color flag with its bold stripes and angles making a sideways Y. As the other White soldiers had been instructed to do, she ran laps until she could properly sing “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika”—a song performed at the South African Native National Congress in 1912 and adopted as the official hymn of the ANC in 1925.3 At least in the near term, “Nkosi” would serve as one of two dual national anthems in the “new” South Africa. Juliana could already sing the other: “Die Stem van Suid-Afrika,” a holdover from the Apartheid past, which would eventually be edited to avoid references to the Great Trek in deference to post-Apartheid sensibilities. Leslie Gama was still four years too young to cast a vote. He had grown up on a few different White-owned family farms but never strayed from Muldersdrift. The area was so-called because of a family by the name of Mulder who settled there in the mid-nineteenth century and the presence of a large drift, or ford, that allowed passage over the Crocodile River. That passage connects Johannesburg to Krugersdorp and onward to the rest of the West Rand. Leslie did what he was told, and that was to remain at home. He was old enough to recognize the enormity of what was about to unfold. The idea of this unprecedented multiracial election filled his head with worst-case scenarios, rendering it the scariest day of his life. Would his parents return home? Would the area be overcome with violence? He had heard nasty rumors that the election itself was just a ploy to round up Black people. These were not simply the imaginations of a child but concerns that were widely shared among adults throughout the area. Leslie would have to wait and see. For Leslie, Juliana, and Nomthandazo, and for just about everyone in and around the still provisional Krugersdorp District, that day held a mix of joy, excitement, and uncertainty. Over 90 percent of the Black respondents and close to 80 percent of the White respondents I surveyed4 around Mogale City in 2019 said that they voted in that 1994 election.5 Not surprisingly, sentiments divided along racial lines. For Blacks, virtually all recalled the day as one filled with euphoria. “I was at home celebrating with my family and I was joyful for a change from the oppressed life I lived before 1994.” “I was in Kagiso happy with the whole community and chanting the struggle songs.” “It felt like God was coming … like the struggle was over.” “I was in Munsieville South—this is not far from where Desmond Tutu grew up—and was happy because everyone was celebrating.” “That day made me happy.” For Whites, many also recalled feeling hopeful, happy, relieved. But others saw only doom ahead. “I was at home and all Whites including me thought the worst is still coming.” “The only thing that comes to my mind was, Black people will fight White people.” “I did not mind that much but was afraid, thinking that Blacks may as well do revenge to us.” “It was a happy and sad mood in our community because of the changes that were going to happen.” One White man from Dan Pienaarville, who was sixteen at the time of the election, was blunt. “I was here in Krugersdorp and wasn’t happy knowing that we will have a Black president.” The election was South Africa’s, but it reverberated far beyond its borders. Given the scope of the anti-Apartheid movement and fascination with the lead actors—the Nobel committee had already jointly awarded its 1993 Peace Prize to De Klerk and Mandela—the day marked a sharp contrast from the images of conflict, protest, and police brutality that for several decades had dominated external views of the country. Ballots: The Rules and the Choices When citizens arrived at their voting stations in Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, Muldersdrift, and throughout the newly constituted republic in April 1994, they immediately experienced the most important new rules of the game. Each voter received two pieces of paper from the temporary electoral commission employees: one marked “RSA” and the other “Prov”—ballots for the respective national and provincial elections. The ballot papers were printed in color, both much longer than they were wide. Each contained the sentence, “Make your mark next to the party you choose,” which was repeated in the ten other official languages, a recognition of the country’s cultural diversity. Below the instructions, the national ballot listed nineteen party names, symbols, and a headshot of each party leader—but not their names. In other words, neither “Nelson” nor “Mandela” appeared anywhere on the page. In this setup, known as a party-list, proportional representation (PR) system, the composition of the Parliament is determined by the share of votes each party receives from the voters. Prior to the election, the parties register ranked lists of their own preferred party members for those positions. Thus if a party is allocated twenty seats after the election results are in, the first twenty names on that party’s list become Members of Parliament (MPs). Each party would develop its own rules and procedures for determining those lists, and not surprisingly, the ANC lists would be replete with liberation heroes. Once seats are allocated, the MPs must vote on who will be the state president in an election determined by a simple majority. The result is generally straightforward if a single party attains more than 50 percent of the seats: the post goes to the person at the top of that party’s list. Failing that, party leaders engage in bargaining to form a coalition, and typically that means that some parties agree to vote for another party’s leader in exchange for some concessions in terms of policies and/or appointments. Once the leader has been elected, they get to make choices about various government appointments. However, even between elections, the leader serves at the pleasure of the Parliament and can be replaced. Such a system has many virtues but also carries certain important risks. First, and most obviously, it affords significant power to parties and weighs against a focus on any single individual. If you are wary of unchecked individuals, this is a good system. However, if you are concerned about the quality or transparency of parties, it might be less preferable. When elections become competitive, the system can incentivize ambitious political leaders to split off to form their own, smaller and smaller parties. This can burden voters with simply too many choices, and parties can tend to become more about individual personalities than about ideas and policy platforms. The design of a PR system is clearly aimed at being more inclusive of a wider variety of perspectives. It allows even relatively small parties to participate in the legislatures, as they can literally get their own seats at the table.6 By comparison, in a typical “two-party” system that tends to emerge with different sets of electoral rules—as in the case of the United States—small parties with a particular focus are almost never officially represented anywhere. In the U.S. system for electing the national legislature, Americans vote for candidates within specific electoral districts, and the individual with the most votes gets the seat reserved for that contest. It is a “winner-take-all” approach, because unless you get the most votes and win the contest, you get zero representation. While representativeness is a virtue, when institutionalized it also implies that more extreme positions will have opportunities to have their voices recognized. Thus, for example, a PR system is more likely to include far-left and far-right parties in the legislature, for better and worse. No solution is perfect. When there is enormous heterogeneity of preferences, and those are reinforced by cultural differences and economic inequalities, no institutional fix can make everyone happy, let alone guarantee shared prosperity. While it is not possible to know for sure how history would have unfolded under different electoral rules, I am largely convinced that proportional representation was the best system for South Africa in order to keep all organized interests vested in democratic politics. Beyond the electoral rules, the logistics of administering the election were daunting. Compared with the previous all-White national election in 1989, in which the government prepared for 5 million eligible voters, at least 22 million were eligible in 1994, and the number of polling stations and polling booths more than tripled. Moreover, the majority of the electorate approached election day without the experience of having voted before, a problem that challenged the electoral commission, which did not have a multiracial voter roll to work with.7 My good friend Michael Goldberg, who had traveled with me to South Africa in 1991, returned to the country after our graduation. (Frankly, I still harbor jealousy about that fact.) He spent the run-up to the election in 1993 conducting voter education workshops for first-time voters. The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and other voter education organizations implemented programs to train community-based Black South Africans to run their own workshops in their own communities. Mundane topics and logistics needed to be addressed to avoid calamity on election day. What type of identification documents would be accepted? Would individuals enter the voting booth alone or with a family member or friend? In many of the rural areas where Goldberg worked, citizens expressed fears that White farmers would intimidate their workers to vote for their preferred candidates. Voter education workshops and materials emphasized “my vote is my secret.” Not surprisingly, many of the faces and symbols printed on the South African ballot in 1994 were those of the leaders and organizations that had been prominent in the political struggles for political change. Although long at odds with much of the rest of the liberation movement, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader at the helm of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), could campaign on some anti-Apartheid credentials. His opportunity to mount a formal campaign was severely truncated by his own decision to boycott the election, one he reversed just a week before it was scheduled to begin. Buthelezi and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, had enjoyed autonomy and a government budget under the Apartheid system. With eight million Zulus in the country, Buthelezi could threaten the stability and legitimacy of the election. In a strange alliance, during the constitutional negotiations process, Buthelezi worked with White separatists and other Black homeland leaders to demand greater provincial autonomy from what would surely be an ANC-run central government. They failed to extract this revision, but perhaps because they did not want to be political outcasts and/or because the ANC promised the maintenance of the monarchy and a royal budget, Buthelezi capitulated. The White Parliament needed to be called back for one last session to amend the interim constitution to allow for this late entry into the electoral contest, but in the end, Buthelezi’s face and party symbol were affixed as a sticker at the bottom of the millions of paper ballots in time for the election.8 And yet, there was no doubt—at least by the time of the election—that the liberation party was the African National Congress, and the photo of Nelson Mandela deserved to be framed on a wall of portraits of other independence leaders, including Ghana’s Nkrumah, Tanzania’s Nyerere, Kenya’s Kenyatta, and others. During Mandela’s time in prison, especially throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, many other individuals and organizations played a critical role in challenging the Apartheid government, including through mass action organized by trade unions and the coalition of civil society organizations embodied in the UDF. The ANC made a formal “tripartite” alliance with the major trade union federation, COSATU, and with the SACP, partners who shared a vision for the future. The arrangement successfully consolidated electoral support as only the ANC would appear on the ballot. In this sense, one of the country’s greatest blessings entering the transition period was that the mantle of leadership for “Black South Africa” had already largely coalesced around Mandela and his ANC. (In 1993, 56 percent of all South Africans and 81 percent of Black Africans said they favored the ANC.)9 The ANC was a diverse organization committed to a pluralist political order. Many Whites, Coloureds, and Indians had actively participated in and sometimes made the ultimate sacrifice for the struggle. And at least initially, the party visibly maintained individuals within its senior ranks from all four Apartheid-recognized race groups. The non-racialism ideals central to the Freedom Charter were routinely on display, especially in the company that Nelson Mandela kept. The 1994 election marked an unprecedented milestone in providing the previously disenfranchised a focal moment in which to make decisions about whom they wanted as leaders. And they were reminded that there was a choice to be made: despite the high legitimacy of Mandela himself and the ANC, nineteen parties were on the first ballot, and many of them enjoyed relatively strong bases of support and were able to compete freely. Amid the profound diversity and inequality of this newly formed polity, millions of people engaged in the exact same process within the period of just a few days: step into a voting booth, mark an X on each of the same two pieces of paper that were distributed throughout the country, and be able to keep their choices secret.10 For the first time ever, Blacks, Whites, Coloureds, Indians, and those not classified under the Apartheid rubric would collectively vote, marking a dramatic new start to what for a very long time would be called the “New South Africa.” And for the first time, being a Black South African citizen was no longer an oxymoron. The Results: ANC Victory, but Not a Supermajority For many expecting the worst, the largely smooth election came as a surprise. As an ANC leader recounted to me: I think with the release of Mandela, the unbanning of political organizations, we then knew that we were going to really have fundamental change in South Africa. So we were preparing ourselves, [but] … just days before the election, people, the whole of South Africa, were really in a tense state. People of all communities, all different walks of life, were really caught up with the fear of the unknown, what will democracy bring? Would it be like some parts of Africa or Europe where things go haywire? And we all caught up the day after elections on that fateful April day. And the sun rose, things were normal, people walked about, and suddenly, it was a huge sigh of relief for all South Africans who have crossed the Rubicon. We’ve done the big change.11 And back in Muldersdrift, Leslie Gama’s parents did come home that day. Despite rumors of a counterrevolutionary force within the military, it did not disrupt the election. For most adults around Krugersdorp and throughout South Africa, fear gave way to excitement. As happened in many new democracies around the world, people proudly displayed the indelible ink marked on their fingers—applied to thwart attempts to vote more than one time. There were a few bouts of violence. And there were some irregularities, including a mismatch between the electoral results in KwaZulu-Natal and preelection opinion polls.12 But none sufficient to impede the consensus that the election was at least “crudely legitimate.”13 Nationwide, approximately 19.5 million votes were cast, and 12.2 million were marked for the African National Congress. By the formulas of the IEC, their 62.7 percent of valid votes counted translated into 252 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly.14 Although the ANC had been widely expected to gain up to 70 percent of the vote, because they received just less than a two-thirds “supermajority,” the party would not be able to unilaterally alter the constitution. This was an outcome that most could live with, and likely a blessing that the party did not come out of the blocks fully dominant. De Klerk’s National Party—the very one that created and later dismantled Apartheid—captured just over 20 percent of the vote, performing well not just among White voters but also among Indian and Coloured voters, the latter being particularly dominant in the Western Cape. After forty years in power, spearheading one of the world’s most reprehensible systems of modern government, but also helping dismantle it, their campaign rehashed old tropes in new clothes. The party’s leaders continued to market the idea of “Black domination” to minority groups who feared retribution in the new order. For example, the National Party had systematically privileged Coloureds over Black Africans during the Apartheid era, and in the Cape, virtually all Coloureds speak Afrikaans. In turn, the NP successfully mobilized this voting bloc around the idea that they were essentially “Brown Afrikaners” and needed to protect themselves from unchecked ANC power. Many listened, and especially in the Western Cape Province, Coloureds overwhelmingly voted for the NP.15 Buthelezi’s IFP was expectedly strong in the Zulu-dominated region of KwaZulu-Natal where many voters viewed the ANC as virtually an enemy, following years of intense ANC-IFP conflict during the transition. The IFP also did well with Zulu-speaking migrant mine workers, including around Krugersdorp. All told, this translated into 10.5 percent of the national vote share. Constand Viljoen, leader of the Freedom Front and successor to the same Conservative Party that controlled the Krugersdorp council at the end of Apartheid, also received over 400,000 votes nationwide. At the time the Freedom Front, promoting a Volkstaat, a separate independent homeland for Afrikaners, gained much of its support from the urban periphery—places like Krugersdorp on the West Rand, where it received almost 6 percent of the vote.16 Nationwide it took in just 2 percent. Despite some strong historical political roots in the country, both the Democratic Party (DP) and the PAC had weak showings; each attracted less than 2 percent of the vote. And on May 9 the Parliament convened, governed by the new Speaker, an Indian woman and human rights lawyer named Frene Ginwala. Their one order of business was to elect the new state president, Nelson Mandela, and they did so without dissent. He and scores of other leaders would depart almost immediately for Pretoria, a two-hour flight away, as the new government adopted many of the old government’s rules and traditions, including keeping the Parliament in Cape Town and the executive government offices in Pretoria, which serves as a second capital city. (The third capital, of the judicial branch, is in Bloemfontein.) This multicitied capital was one of many holdovers from the creation of the Union of South Africa, which itself merged four separate entities. On the following day, May 10, Mandela was inaugurated as the first post-Apartheid president at the age of seventy-five. The ceremony took place at the Union Building, originally completed in 1913 with the two wings meant to symbolize the union of the English and Afrikaner “races.”17 Now, in 1994, South Africa would, once again, mark with an election the unification of people and territory and much greater cultural diversity within its polity. Both within the ruling party and across the parties that had won seats in the new Parliament, citizens of almost any background could find some representative who looked like them and/or represented their interests and values. Very few could have said that they were fully excluded. The day was nothing short of remarkable. At his inauguration, attended by dozens of world leaders, Mandela proclaimed, “Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.… Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.”18 It took a century of struggle, but in the final decade of the twentieth century, demographic reality finally became the basis for political power in South Africa and legalized apartness was over. Indeed, South Africans emerged relatively peacefully through the first election. Mandela, a political activist, and once widely recognized by Whites as a terrorist, was now the shining symbol of the “New South Africa.” The country, and the larger world, could not get enough of him. I also wanted to see for myself. Following my first year of graduate school in June 1995, I traveled with my soon-to-be fiancée, Amy, to Cape Town for a two-week trip to lay eyes on the new version of the country I had last seen under very different circumstances in 1991. As always, it was a painfully long flight from the United States. We stayed in the not-yet-upgraded Breakwater Lodge, on the outskirts of what was still a relatively small waterfront development along the stunning Atlantic seaboard. Sleep-deprived, we were looking forward to getting some rest. Standing in the way were revelers. There was partying in the hotel. Serious partying. And it went on … All. Night. Long. Earlier that day, South Africa had defeated Australia in the first round of the Rugby World Cup, being hosted in the country for the first time, a dividend of huge proportions for the sport-loving White population. Kegs of Castle Lager flowed through the bars, raising the volume into our room each hour. On the bright side, my friend Michael, still working at NDI, had thoughtfully bought us tickets to the next game, which would turn out to be South Africa versus Romania at Newland Stadium in Cape Town. The game itself was fun to watch, but I was not a big rugby fan. Why throw the ball backward? For me, the real spectacle was the fans. Black spectators accustomed to cheering for any team competing against South Africa were now rooting for a group of essentially all-White men, resolved, at least for now, that they were actually on the same side. And watching the massive-bodied White rugby fans do as Juliana Steyn had done, awkwardly mouthing their way through “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika,” and the Black fans willing to reappropriate this team and their symbols as their own—if that wasn’t a spirit of reconciliation, it was hard to imagine what would be. Pessimists became optimists, and of course the fact that the South Africans would eventually win the cup helped generate a collective sense of pride about what had been accomplished as a new nation in relatively short order. And Mandela conspicuously displayed his forbearance toward White South Africa when he opted to don the Springbok jersey—previously a symbol of “White” South Africa—at the final awards ceremony, a moment dramatically captured in the movie Invictus. Constitutional Rights: Foundations for Restoring Dignity The 1994 election was governed by a temporary, interim constitution, and the resulting Parliament immediately acted as a constitutional assembly to produce a permanent replacement. Signed in late 1996, and in effect as of early 1997, that document set a high bar for the types of rights that would be guaranteed to citizens—protections not simply from a potentially intrusive government (as the American constitution emphasized) but from the everyday realities of social and economic despair. It offered a progressive and inclusive vision of what the New South Africa should look like. Jurists and legal scholars around the world have come to regard the South African document as an extraordinary model—the epitome of a modern constitution.19 Much of the content drew quite explicitly on the demands and aspirations of prior generations of the liberation movement. Since its founding, the ANC leadership frequently comprised educated elites who spotlighted the contradiction between the human rights ideal and the reality of how Black people were treated. Sol Plaatje and other attorneys demanded an unbiased judicial system and equal application of the law as early as the first decades of the twentieth century.20 In 1923, the young ANC produced an “African Bill of Rights for South Africa” to remind the country and the world that Black Africans were also human and deserved to be treated in kind. It called for representation, liberty, and the right to property, arguing that African inhabitants of the Union had, “as human beings, the indisputable right to a place of abode in this land of their fathers.”21 In 1943, the organization adopted a document titled Africans’ Claims in South Africa, also known as The Atlantic Charter from the African’s Point of View. It was a response to the Atlantic Charter, advanced by President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which laid the foundation for the formation of the United Nations, and set out a vision for shared global peace and prosperity.22 As stated in the preface of the ANC document, Churchill had intended the charter to apply only to White people. In their documented response, the ANC wanted to make clear that as human beings, Black Africans were entitled to the same. Next, there was the 1955 Freedom Charter, perhaps the most critical document outlining ANC aspirations for a post-Apartheid future. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, this document, the product of months of citizen input, was launched by the Congress of the People at Kliptown, less than fifty kilometers from Krugersdorp. It drew explicitly on the notion of universal entitlement to the protection of human rights. The Freedom Charter took center stage at some of the secret negotiations between exiled Black leaders and White politicians during the late 1980s. And although Nelson Mandela’s landmark three-hour speech delivered in 1964 while a defendant in the Rivonia trial was not an official ANC charter in the manner of the two aforementioned documents, it took on great political weight for its clarity and bravery, contributing to Mandela’s legitimacy as a future leader even as that trial would land him in prison for much of the next three decades. The speech is best known for his final statement in which he proclaimed that for the values and causes he articulated, “I am prepared to die.” Throughout the speech, he reiterated these long-standing human rights demands and expectations. Although the final constitution made no express reference to Apartheid itself, or to any of these key documents that sought to challenge institutionalized White supremacy, even a casual reading reveals very strong links to this history. For example, the preamble of the 1996 constitution states, “We, the people of South Africa, Recognise the injustices of our past.” And like the Freedom Charter, it called for “non-racialism.” And just as the Freedom Charter proclaimed that “the preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime,” so did the constitution: “[Freedom of expression] does not extend to advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.” A set of fairly standard civil and political rights, including freedom of speech, association, and a free press, that appeared in the final constitution were also echoes from the Freedom Charter. Perhaps most remarkable was the extent to which calls for specific social and economic rights, demanded in Africans’ Claims, the Freedom Charter, and “I Am Prepared to Die,” were also enshrined in the highest law of the land. This included access to free education, housing, social security, and health care and freedom from hunger. By making these rights, the South African constitution opened the possibility for lawyers to push for material progress in the courts when offered evidence of gaps and shortfalls. Again reflecting the Freedom Charter, the constitution also emphasized respect for cultural autonomy or group rights by guaranteeing access to education in a choice of one of the eleven official languages. More generally, the constitution reflected the Freedom Charter’s balancing act of advocating “non-racialism” alongside explicit recognition of past racial discrimination and the need for redress. In his “I Am Prepared to Die” speech, Mandela argued that “the lack of human dignity experienced by Africans was the direct result of the policy of White supremacy,” and in turn, the constitution’s Bill of Rights proclaimed, “Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected.” Also revealing is where the documents diverged. Most conspicuously, the constitution did not reflect the aspiration of the Freedom Charter to nationalize the mines, or frankly, to nationalize much of anything. Moreover, the Freedom Charter made very specific demands for “full employment” and a forty-hour work week, which also did not materialize. These exceptions notwithstanding, the human rights values espoused by the ANC and the resistance movements against institutionalized White supremacy were clearly enshrined in the new constitution. In turn, specific directives invited a wide range of political actors to participate in the quest to extend respect for human dignity to all citizens. The Redrawing of Administrative Boundaries The other big question central to the design of democratic government was how to redraw the internal boundaries of the country. After almost a century of intense racial segregation, including forced relocation to several “homeland” governments, a radical reconfiguration was necessary. One option was a centralized approach, more like the French system, which incorporates a high level of uniformity throughout its territory. That might be appealing in terms of its prospects for providing equitable treatment to all South Africans, but it would face the realities of profound disparities in resources and capacities that would make such a system at least initially unworkable. Another option would be to devolve a great deal of decision making and authority to localized governments, as is the case in the United States. By the time of South Africa’s political transition, decentralization and strong local government had become new “international norms.” You want a real democracy? You need to give some power to politicians who live and interact with people in their communities, not in some distant national capital. It was a compelling argument but needed to be implemented in a manner that would be viewed as fair and feasible, not a straightforward task anywhere, let alone in a place with South Africa’s levels of cultural diversity overlaid with inequality. Boundary-making provides almost limitless possibilities for political conflict. Given that South Africans were already highly segregated into racially demarcated neighborhoods and sometimes regions, and that the conditions in White areas were so much better than the rest (and Indian and Coloured areas were also largely better serviced and more prosperous than Black African areas), and assuming that there would be no more forced movement of people—suddenly the stakes of those internal boundaries became quite high. As finalized in the 1996 constitution, South Africa would be a “quasi-federal” polity. The nine new provinces would have substantial discretion in their budgets and in the administration of many policies, but they would not be truly autonomous and would remain almost entirely dependent on the national government for revenue. Reflecting this relationship, elections for provincial legislatures would be jointly coordinated with national elections, all under the auspices of a national electoral commission. Krugersdorp, formerly in the “Transvaal” Province of the old South Africa, as of 1994 would now sit in Gauteng (along with Johannesburg and Pretoria). Cape Town would become the new capital of the Western Cape Province. Durban, the old Natal Province, and the former KwaZulu homeland would become KwaZulu-Natal. In this critical redrawing, the homelands of Apartheid design would be no more. On election day, the borders, laws, and government of Bop, and the three other independent homelands, had no legal basis; Bop’s oddly unconnected territories were integrated into the Northern Cape, Gauteng, and Free State provinces. And similar reconfigurations would occur throughout the country to varying degrees; some provinces would inherit a great deal of former homeland territory, whereas the Western Cape would inherit none. Meanwhile, the hundreds of traditional leaders whose authority was very much vested in the homeland structure would be offered more than a proverbial bone: the government would recognize particular areas as essentially co-governed by such leaders, a government department would be established to provide national-level representation, and the leaders themselves would receive government salaries.23 FIGURE 5.1. South Africa’s post-Apartheid provincial boundaries. Note: What is today Limpopo Province was initially named Northern Transvaal in 1994, and then in 1995, Northern Province; what is today Mpumalanga was initially named Eastern Transvaal in 1994. Particularly contentious was how the boundaries of the more intimate level of local government would be drawn. In this context, the potential gap between promises, expectations, and realities could be seen most visibly for individual citizens. Again, White South Africa had never fully realized its goal of becoming a White country, and as was the case with Krugersdorp, most of the relatively well-off White towns and cities around the country included and/or were surrounded by racially segregated townships. By the 1980s, many of the latter were formally governed by Black Local Authorities (yes, an official term), and unsurprisingly, as these were generally viewed as illegitimate and underresourced, they did not function well. By contrast, the White local governments generally did just fine and expenditures were matched with sufficient tax revenues. The post-Apartheid challenge was to amalgamate these into integrated polities but also to have local government structures. The possibility that decentralization could backfire was not lost on the ANC, whose leaders recognized that devolution was frequently a mechanism to protect the privileges of White people.24 For example, if Krugersdorp would be allowed to remain essentially “as is,” a largely White town with a White tax base, independent and separate from the neighboring Black areas such as Kagiso and Munsieville, then race-based Apartheid could largely survive in practice. Anticipating this possibility, across South Africa’s nine provinces, close to three hundred local governments were either reconfigured or born anew, including a handful of major metropolitan authorities (including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, and today there are a total of eight).25 While many essentially Black-only municipalities would remain, especially in rural, former homeland areas (where virtually no Whites, Coloureds, or Indians reside), this would mark the end of White-only local government, and municipalities in urban areas and on the urban periphery would now be multiracial polities. For the time being, the mosaic of greater Krugersdorp would be known as Krugersdorp District. Although the big prizes for electoral politics were clearly the seats in the national parliament and the state presidency, subnational governments soon emerged as important political arenas, perhaps in large part because this was where the ANC was vulnerable—not always able to attain over 50 percent of the seats needed to control governments. Most prominently, the ANC lost two of nine provinces in that first election: the Western Cape delivered the majority of its votes to the National Party and KwaZulu-Natal to the IFP. As in the national elections, these reflected the fact that race and ethnicity would loom large over voting patterns, and the ANC was defeated in these two provinces because Black Africans were a minority in the Western Cape and because Zulus dominated KwaZulu-Natal. Whatever one might have thought about the merits of these two opposition parties, the fact that they could enjoy visible access to power undoubtedly helped boost their constituents’ confidence in the system. Local Democracy in Practice In Gauteng, South Africa’s industrial heartland, where more than a quarter of the population squeezes into less than 2 percent of the landmass, the ANC was strong in the 1994 contest, certainly strong enough to win, but did not completely dominate as it did in some of the other provinces. It took in 59.1 percent of the votes cast for the national election and 57.6 percent for the provincial legislature. In an important province like Gauteng, the ANC deployed some of its best political talent. Toxyo Sexwale, a man who served time on Robben Island, supported Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness movement, and spent several years in exile, became the first provincial premier. Like Cyril Ramaphosa, Sexwale was immediately viewed as a possible successor to Mandela. By the end of 1994, residents of the newly integrated Krugersdorp District would be led by a trifecta of former political prisoners, because in addition to Mandela as president and Sexwale as provincial premier, in November of that year, a former political detainee, Stephen Motingoa, became the first Black man to be mayor of Krugersdorp. Motingoa was born and raised in Munsieville and in 1986 was detained without trial by the Apartheid government for more than a year. He was subsequently charged with sedition and subversion, but after his release he worked as a union leader and went to London to get a degree in development studies.26 The ceremonial mayoral chain donned by generations of White men would now be worn by a Black man in the town that Pretorius named after Paul Kruger, the site of Paardekraal, a shrine to Afrikanerdom; a town where the British had put Afrikaners in concentration camps and where Whites reconciled their own civil war around the exclusion of Blacks. Like so much in South Africa at the time, the local government was self-consciously provisional—it was called a Transitional Local Council (TLC). As recently as the late 1980s, many White Krugersdorpers would have described the images of a Black mayor and Black president as the coming of the apocalypse. The West Rander newspaper had to concede that the election went smoothly in the area. However, rather than depicting the images of the new Black voters or Black leaders on the cover, the editor chose instead a portrait of the White mayor of nearby Roodepoort, standing in front of the new South African flag, while glumly holding the old one in his hands.27 In my Historical Memories Survey I asked residents to reflect on this “transition period” from 1994 to 1999: “Was it smooth or difficult?” Their recollections were decidedly mixed,28 and again, predictably cleaved along racial and ethnic lines, but also in terms of where they were living. For the most part, Black residents recalled feeling hopeful. One man, in his late twenties at the time, said he “hoped that things would change, that I would have a better life, that the government would provide us with skills to make our lives better, as well as land.” The most frequently used words and phrases that Black residents used to describe this period and their vision of the future included “better,” “optimistic,” “better life,” and “free education.” Particularly for Black Africans in the more urban areas, the memories were largely upbeat: as a Black woman who was fifty-six when Mandela was elected explained, “There was no problem, and we transitioned smoothly.” Another citizen recalled, “It was smooth because houses were built.” But yet another who today lives in the same ward recalls things differently: “I will say it was a tough transition because Whites did not accept the defeat and there were those who still mistreated the Blacks because of that.” Whites in the more urban areas were also largely positive: “It was smooth because we accepted a better chance to live with and among each other, go to school together, have equal job opportunities,” a woman from Dan Pienaarville explained. “During those years, [we] had a smooth transition because we were able to mix with all races and attend church together.” But in the more rural areas—in Muldersdrift, for example, where Leslie Gama stayed home on election day—the recollections were more negative. A Black woman who was twenty in 1999 recounted, “In 1999, it was tough because people were not free to walk in the streets at night, there were people on bikes that were patrolling at night beating people who were walking in the streets.” Many other Black Africans from the area recall being beaten or challenged by Whites during the transition. Political tensions were high, and some Whites chose to display the old flag, a symbol of loyalty to the old regime.29 Many White Krugersdorpers, especially the Afrikaner population, entered the democratic era highly skeptical of the idea of Black government and of the economic redistribution this would inevitably entail. As early as January 1995, just a few months into the new administration, the Krugersdorp News ran a front-page story: “Councillors in the Local Transitional Council Get Paid Handsomely to Do Their Job, or Not To.” The article mentioned the 2.3-million-rand budget for councillor salaries and highlighted, “White ratepayers carry the burden for the expenditures and salaries of the town’s 54 councillors.… According to the town clerk, Koos Richards, no contributions are being received from Kagiso or Munsieville towards these payments.”30 These White South Africans resented the notion of even a transitional period of racially redistributive tax payments toward shared public services. And White councillors frequently complained that the new government, just less than a year old, would soon bankrupt the council. At the most extreme, some still wanted to opt out of the New South Africa altogether. They never gave up on the core ideology that led Paul Kruger’s family to flee the Cape for the Rand. While hundreds of thousands of the country’s wealthier Whites, especially those who spoke English at home, had already departed South Africa for London, New York, Southern California, Sydney, and Perth,31 Krugersdorp was generally not home to such would-be cosmopolitans. Afrikaner-descended families in particular tended not to have social networks or opportunities in Europe or the British commonwealth. As they liked to point out, they are Africans too. In June 1995, a Freedom Front councillor advocated a referendum to include Krugersdorp in the Volkstaat—a proposal Motingoa and others decried.32 That this idea still had traction reflected the degree to which some were resisting the new order. Nonetheless, the Krugersdorp News would soon accept the reality of political change and published a flattering profile of the mayor five months into his term, sharing his personal history and humanizing a Black person in a manner that had been extraordinarily rare in any of the West Rand news outlets. Motingoa humbly refused to make any analogies between his path and Nelson Mandela’s. However, he did attempt to share the new president’s forgiving disposition: “The torture, humiliation and physical injuries left their mark, but I channel my bitterness into working towards peace and reconciliation.”33 Begrudgingly, the News followed up with a headline, “TLC Is Not Too Bad.” The accompanying story highlighted that many residents were happy about the change: “the TLC has made an effort to beautify Munsieville.” Another, from Dan Pienaarville and with an Afrikaans family name, was cautiously skeptical: “We have to wait and see what is going to happen.”34 Until 2000, the local government system remained provisional as details of demarcation of boundaries and assignment of responsibilities were still under review. But that year, Krugersdorp District was formally consecrated as Mogale City Local Municipality. The new council adopted an African name for the entity while maintaining Krugersdorp as the town that would serve as the seat of that government. Mogale was a freedom-fighting chief, the namesake of the Magaliesberg mountains, who suffered various indignities at the hands of Paul Kruger’s relatives and associates in the early part of the nineteenth century.35 The new mosaic epitomized the opportunities and challenges of post-Apartheid South Africa in localized form. And at least initially, in electoral terms, the municipality was a bellwether town. In the 1994 national election, the 81,232 votes cast for the ANC in what was then Krugersdorp District represented 62.6 percent of the vote share36—almost exactly the party’s share of votes nationwide (62.7 percent). In the first official local election in 2000, the ANC received 60 percent of the Mogale City vote, as compared with 65 percent of the vote in local elections throughout the country. FIGURE 5.2.

The new local government institutions added an important wrinkle to democratic practice in South Africa. On the one hand, each local council would function in some ways like the national parliament in the sense that the seats of the council would be allocated via proportional representation, based on voters’ choices for their preferred party. Each municipality would also be subdivided into a series of wards of approximately equal population size, and each voter would cast a ballot for a single ward councillor, some of whom would stand without any party affiliation. In turn, the council would be filled with the ward councillors, and then seats allocated from the various party lists, such that the total number of seats for each party was proportional to the total number of PR votes cast. The ward councillor and committees elected within wards would be citizens’ points of contact to the council. Citizens could also contact “shadow” ward councillors from other parties, as those who had seats from the PR vote would routinely be assigned to wards the party lost in order to stay connected to citizens.37 From “Bold Experiment” to “Miracle” Considering the elections, the new constitution, the reconfigured administrative boundaries, and frankly the new mood in the country, by the late 1990s, the South Africans had clearly overperformed relative to expectations. Observers inside and outside the country routinely described the new democracy as a “miracle.”38 Others called the few years after 1994 a “honeymoon.” In any case, the formal transition from Apartheid to post-Apartheid government was complete. There was no civil war, no massive reprisals, no fundamental challenges to the legitimacy of the new order. Where South Africa had once been banned and sanctioned, now the world was coming in to see this beautiful country and to get a taste of what was going on. In just a few dramatic years, the political landscape of southern Africa was transformed. People around the world, myself included, celebrated the successful transition and the new moral authority the country’s leaders now assumed on the world stage. And it was in this context that Amy and I returned to South Africa in 1997 to live for a year, primarily so that I could carry out research. As part of my preparations, I studied Xhosa—the Black African language spoken most widely in the Cape—and although I never became fluent, I learned to carry on a conversation, and that turned out to be a nice way to break the ice with a lot of people. In the days after we arrived, I learned that the South Africans were as interested in us as we were in them. To be clear, by “us,” I mean they were literally obsessed with Michael Jackson. The arrival of “Jacko,” as they called him, dominated the front pages of newspapers, even amid reports of gangsterism in Cape Town townships and the forging of a new political party by a former homeland leader and a White National Party politician-turned-anti-Apartheid activist. Jackson’s talent for music and performance, and seeming racial ambiguity, piqued interest across the South African color bar. We made arrangements to affiliate ourselves with local institutions. Amy worked at the South African National Gallery and taught art history at the University of Cape Town. I was supported as a Fulbright Fellow, and as part of that process I arranged for an affiliation with the successor organization to IDASA. Now it would be called the Institute for Democracy in South Africa (IDASA). With sizable amounts of foreign funding, it became a think tank and aggregator of civil society organizations, carrying out a range of functions, including voter education, parliamentary monitoring, and budget analysis. Located in a spectacular colonial-era, high-ceilinged building in Cape Town, on 6 Spin Street, just around the corner from the Parliament buildings, several government buildings, and the National Library, it was just about the best spot I could have asked for to witness all that was going on, and I made some lifelong friends who would remain in the field of democratic development (and even read drafts of the manuscript for this book). Outside “experts” were coming through the halls each week, but effectively, those outsiders were learning more than they were teaching—the South Africans were brimming with ideas and high ideals, and I loved coming into the office each day. No one took for granted that in order to build a democracy, citizens needed to learn more about the process and how it would affect them. Government budgets, for example, can be extraordinarily opaque, so members of IDASA’s Budget Information Service would describe the implications of the budget for women or for children in accessible publications and in workshops. Although the organization clearly had great sympathies for the new ANC government, it set up a Parliamentary Monitoring Service to make sure that power was checked and key debates and decisions were shared with citizens. The Public Opinion Service made sure that it was not just government that was carrying out and analyzing surveys and that nationally representative views on key issues could be articulated in representations to government. New policies and practices were sorely needed to realize the ambitions of the new constitution, and creative and energetic South Africans were rising to the occasion to provide these. I sat in on debates in which various political actors engaged in foundational discussions about what a fair and just society ought to look like. My own research was on the tax system, so I attended parliamentary hearings on proposals to revise that system. Tax experts tried to discuss the highly technical topic in politically neutral language, but they could not avoid falling back on fundamental questions. For instance, when it came time to debate taxes on estates—typically a minor source of revenue for the state—a representative of White farmers said that high estate taxes would force many family farmers to sell off large parts of their farms, effectively ending the family business. In turn, an ANC Member of Parliament stood up and asked, “Would that be so bad?” My doctoral advisor, Robert Price,39 introduced me to Andrew Feinstein, a White ANC Member of Parliament, who would become a personal friend while Amy and I lived in Cape Town. Feinstein was just seven years older than me, had been an anti-Apartheid activist, and had spent some time at UC Berkeley, where I was a graduate student at the time. I enjoyed talking with him about shared interests in nation-building and public finance. (And I was particularly excited when he mentioned one of my working papers in a parliamentary debate.) The fact that a White former activist had been chosen by party elites to represent the party in Parliament spoke volumes about the sustained commitment to being racially inclusive. And when I got to know him in 1997–98, Feinstein was pro-ANC all the way. He pointed out that tax policy was becoming a balancing act: initially, Whites had been willing to pay a “transition tax,” but by this point, many of the wealthiest Whites had moved much of their money offshore to avoid taxation and just in case they decided to leave the country altogether. Indeed, quite a few had already left. He shared with me his perception that White South Africans would resist more in the way of taxation, and they were complaining of crime and invoking the “Specter of Zimbabwe,” by speaking of South Africa “going the way of the rest of Africa.”40 Ironically, many of the very countries that had sanctioned South Africa for Apartheid, including the United States, were willing to embrace White South Africans who were taking their skills and resources out of the country, claiming they did not feel safe. With such an escape valve, it would be difficult to engage in too much redistributive policy. During our year in residence, Amy and I happily joined in the sport of Mandela spectating. Where would he be, and could we get a glimpse? We secured tickets to watch him host Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, one of the great African independence leaders, as he addressed the new government in the Parliament building. Nyerere offered an optimistic portrait of Africa’s future and was met with thunderous applause. A personal highlight was the opportunity to stand in the back row of a press conference held jointly with Mandela and President Bill Clinton. As a Fulbright Fellow, I had been invited to tag along with the White House press corps in exchange for my willingness to serve as a tour guide on the bus rides around town, one of which included CNN’s Wolf Blitzer sitting in front and ABC’s Sam Donaldson firing multiple questions at me as he prepared his report. Mandela and Clinton spoke to the world in March 1998 in the gardens of Tuynhuys (pronounced Tane-hace), the Cape Town office of the presidency, used when Parliament is in session. A stunningly clear blue sky hovered above Table Mountain, which itself stands behind, and towers above, the Cape Dutch building. And to our back was the Company’s Garden, created by the very Dutch settlers who had come to these shores in 1652 to cultivate the fruits and vegetables they craved on their transoceanic journeys. We all watched as the leader of the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world was fully eclipsed by the stature of an elder statesman, who deployed grit and forbearance to lead South Africa through a remarkable transition. American presidents were surely used to having their counterparts show deference to them on diplomatic visits, but in this case, the tables were clearly turned. While South Africa was in many ways burdened by its past, the long legacy of resistance also generated a great deal of political capital useful for democratic development. As described earlier, a strong commitment to a rights orientation especially within the ANC provided a coherent framework for creating democratic institutions. A strong “civil society,” the organized and autonomous associations designed to link citizens to the state, similarly proved to be a favorable by-product of a hard-fought resistance. IDASA and others, including women’s organizations and trade unions, had built strong memberships during the anti-Apartheid era and, at least initially, could credibly give voice to citizens’ wants and needs in the post-Apartheid era. Although the Apartheid state had occasionally used emergency powers to suppress journalistic freedoms, a fairly robust, critical media environment had nonetheless flourished. By 1994, a very wide range of newspapers and radio and television stations were already established and offered frequent news updates from a variety of perspectives. Within a few years, internet access expanded throughout the country and along with it, unprecedented access to information. I sent my first wireless email while in South Africa. However, as in countries throughout the world, internet access would be disproportionately available to those in urban areas and to those who could afford it. Moreover, the political resistance to Apartheid produced a number of great legal minds, which helped contribute to the development of a robust and independent judiciary. Mandela appointed Arthur Chaskalson, a member of his defense team at the Rivonia trial (who had formed the Legal Resources Centre [LRC], a human rights law organization), to be the first president of the Constitutional Court. The court would be filled with respected jurists who could make judgments independent of direct political pressures and help legitimate its place in the new democratic constitutional order. In short, the first post-Apartheid elections and Mandela’s presidency exceeded any reasonable expectations for a peaceful transfer of power. However, the successful introduction of new democratic institutions did not imply that a vibrant multiracial democracy had fully taken root and could survive the long winter of political reality. The initial five years were exceptional in many ways, most obviously because Mandela was no ordinary leader. He would be on the short list, and maybe at the top, of any global ranking of most admired and respected individuals of the twentieth century. This meant that during his presidency, he could broker deals between conflicting parties and elicit compromise over conflict. His profound personal history, sacrifices, and acts of forbearance led even his political adversaries to recognize him as verging on “superhuman.” People followed his directives because of who he was and what he had done in his own courageous life.41 While several of Africa’s most promising independence leaders—Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, and Ivory Coast’s Félix Houphouët-Boigny—each stayed in power for more than thirty years, generally to the great detriment of their countries, Mandela’s tenure in government was far shorter. Of course, he was different from these men in all sorts of ways, including the fact that he was much older when he took office. In 1998, during the fifth year of his five-year term, he celebrated his eightieth birthday, and the country began to face the reality of his humanity. The tall, powerful freedom fighter walked with a slower gait and spoke more softly. And that year, he married Graça Machel, herself a teacher, former government minister, and human rights advocate from Mozambique, who was the widow of former Mozambican state president Samora Machel. Mandela said he wanted a bit of time to live out of the everyday spotlight, and he chose not to stay on as state president or as head of the ANC. It is hard to imagine that this period would have been so smooth and peaceful without Mandela’s generous spirit, cloaked in a history of enormous personal sacrifice. Nonetheless, one of the key tenets of democracy is that government should not revolve around a single person. Rather, its institutions are designed with the intention that the people, despite their diversity, can self-govern. The value of introducing this democratic system to South Africa could only be learned over a longer period of time, in the face of new challenges and in the context of very different leaders.",

      "content": "5 The Bold Experiment INSTITUTIONS FOR A DIVIDED SOCIETY APARTHEID GOVERNMENT AND AN INCREASINGLY fractious civil war came to an end through a negotiated settlement. The final compromise was itself the product of decades of brokered discussions that progressed in fits and starts. For example, Buthelezi tried and failed to forge a workable plan with a White opposition leader as early as 1975. In 1986, two White politicians formed the Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) as a way to connect exiled Black political leaders with potentially reform-minded Afrikaners. A breakthrough came in 1987 with a successful meeting in Dakar, Senegal. However, despite great interest in the proceedings, the White government officially condemned the meeting because it involved direct communication with banned organizations.1 Throughout the 1980s, while still a prisoner of the South African government, and as violent conflict raged on, Mandela met in secret with White political leaders to consider various democratic and power-sharing proposals. Other ANC leaders did the same at venues inside and outside the country. Only after De Klerk’s 1990 speech did political leaders from the National Party, the ANC, and several other organizations, lawyers, foreign governments, and constitutional experts openly engage in wide-ranging discussions. They debated the merits of the very different options for structuring a new government. They did this in closed meetings and in public forums, in newspaper columns, in books, on the radio, and on television. A few principles gained quick assent from those deliberating the new rules of the game: full citizenship would be accorded to all irrespective of race; there would be no more legally segregated areas or amenities; and the next government would undertake ambitious projects to redress the social and economic legacies of the past. And at the center of it all would be a constitutional democracy: choosing leaders through the vote and recognizing a new constitution as the supreme law of the land. That still left quite a bit on the table for deciding how to govern a newly constituted society. Would citizens vote for individuals or for parties? Would power be concentrated or decentralized? How would the chief executive ultimately be selected? What was the vision for the appropriate role of the state in social and economic planning? What role would traditional leaders and former homeland structures play? Even with the best minds in South Africa and around the world trying to steer a mutually acceptable solution, so many obstacles stood in the way. Could you actually reverse engineer the Apartheid system to create a single, democratic polity? Being realistic about all that had happened over the previous several decades let alone the past several centuries, and the depths of divide in the country, success seemed to be a long shot. Even after Mandela’s release and after various political organizations were no longer banned, violent conflicts marred the country, ranging from attacks by the White, right-wing AWB to considerable violence between the ANC and the IFP, let alone sustained conflict in and around the homeland governments. Given skepticism about the prospects for success, many described the attempt to implement a multiracial democracy in this divided society as a “bold experiment.”2 In the remainder of this chapter, I describe the central contours of how this democratic order was established with respect to three key institutions. First, the elections. I explain why the ballots looked the way they did as voters went into their booths—describing the new electoral rules and the particular choices citizens faced. In turn, those rules and choices would channel the “will” of the people into concrete allocations of political power in government. Second, I highlight a few features of the country’s remarkable constitution, including its deep links to the demands of the resistance movement and a strong foundation of protecting human rights. Those principles marked a set of goalposts for evaluating the consequences of democratic practice in the years to come. And third, I describe the plan to reorient the spatial configuration of the country and undo the vision of Apartheid planners. The new local municipality of Mogale City would be established in the context of new provinces and a new local government structure that aspired for integration rather than separation. Finally, I return to Mogale City to consider some of the early challenges associated with implementing this new democracy in practice. In subsequent chapters, I make the link between this brand of South African democracy—the institutions chosen to structure political conflict in this divided society—and patterns of dignified development over the quarter century following the historic April 1994 election. The Election The successful implementation of a first multiracial election was a critical step toward consolidating this new democracy. Tellingly, virtually all of the adult South Africans over the age of thirty-five I surveyed or interviewed myself in 2019 in Krugersdorp, Munsieville, Kagiso, and Muldersdrift could recall with some detail where they were and how they felt as the voting process unfolded between April 26 and 29, 1994. Nomthandazo Sikoto was born in Soweto in 1966 and came to Kagiso in 1987, already a political activist in her early twenties. She woke up on April 27, 1994, at 6 a.m. to join the now iconic winding queues that were photographed at polling stations around the country. She waited until 2 p.m. to finally cast a vote and said that although she hadn’t eaten anything all day, she didn’t feel hungry. It was an emotional day and she gladly participated in the massive celebrations. She would go on to vote in every subsequent election, and when I met her on the eve of the 2019 national election, she told me she had every intention of casting her vote the next day. Juliana Steyn, a White woman whose name and accent revealed her Afrikaans roots, grew up just outside Krugersdorp. Like most young White adults her age, she joined the South African army as she left high school in 1992. And on that election day in 1994, she saluted the about-to-be-old South African flag—which itself depicted the British flag, as well as the flags of Kruger’s South African Republic and the Orange Free State—for a final farewell. Later in the afternoon, she would salute the new, five-color flag with its bold stripes and angles making a sideways Y. As the other White soldiers had been instructed to do, she ran laps until she could properly sing “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika”—a song performed at the South African Native National Congress in 1912 and adopted as the official hymn of the ANC in 1925.3 At least in the near term, “Nkosi” would serve as one of two dual national anthems in the “new” South Africa. Juliana could already sing the other: “Die Stem van Suid-Afrika,” a holdover from the Apartheid past, which would eventually be edited to avoid references to the Great Trek in deference to post-Apartheid sensibilities. Leslie Gama was still four years too young to cast a vote. He had grown up on a few different White-owned family farms but never strayed from Muldersdrift. The area was so-called because of a family by the name of Mulder who settled there in the mid-nineteenth century and the presence of a large drift, or ford, that allowed passage over the Crocodile River. That passage connects Johannesburg to Krugersdorp and onward to the rest of the West Rand. Leslie did what he was told, and that was to remain at home. He was old enough to recognize the enormity of what was about to unfold. The idea of this unprecedented multiracial election filled his head with worst-case scenarios, rendering it the scariest day of his life. Would his parents return home? Would the area be overcome with violence? He had heard nasty rumors that the election itself was just a ploy to round up Black people. These were not simply the imaginations of a child but concerns that were widely shared among adults throughout the area. Leslie would have to wait and see. For Leslie, Juliana, and Nomthandazo, and for just about everyone in and around the still provisional Krugersdorp District, that day held a mix of joy, excitement, and uncertainty. Over 90 percent of the Black respondents and close to 80 percent of the White respondents I surveyed4 around Mogale City in 2019 said that they voted in that 1994 election.5 Not surprisingly, sentiments divided along racial lines. For Blacks, virtually all recalled the day as one filled with euphoria. “I was at home celebrating with my family and I was joyful for a change from the oppressed life I lived before 1994.” “I was in Kagiso happy with the whole community and chanting the struggle songs.” “It felt like God was coming … like the struggle was over.” “I was in Munsieville South—this is not far from where Desmond Tutu grew up—and was happy because everyone was celebrating.” “That day made me happy.” For Whites, many also recalled feeling hopeful, happy, relieved. But others saw only doom ahead. “I was at home and all Whites including me thought the worst is still coming.” “The only thing that comes to my mind was, Black people will fight White people.” “I did not mind that much but was afraid, thinking that Blacks may as well do revenge to us.” “It was a happy and sad mood in our community because of the changes that were going to happen.” One White man from Dan Pienaarville, who was sixteen at the time of the election, was blunt. “I was here in Krugersdorp and wasn’t happy knowing that we will have a Black president.” The election was South Africa’s, but it reverberated far beyond its borders. Given the scope of the anti-Apartheid movement and fascination with the lead actors—the Nobel committee had already jointly awarded its 1993 Peace Prize to De Klerk and Mandela—the day marked a sharp contrast from the images of conflict, protest, and police brutality that for several decades had dominated external views of the country. Ballots: The Rules and the Choices When citizens arrived at their voting stations in Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, Muldersdrift, and throughout the newly constituted republic in April 1994, they immediately experienced the most important new rules of the game. Each voter received two pieces of paper from the temporary electoral commission employees: one marked “RSA” and the other “Prov”—ballots for the respective national and provincial elections. The ballot papers were printed in color, both much longer than they were wide. Each contained the sentence, “Make your mark next to the party you choose,” which was repeated in the ten other official languages, a recognition of the country’s cultural diversity. Below the instructions, the national ballot listed nineteen party names, symbols, and a headshot of each party leader—but not their names. In other words, neither “Nelson” nor “Mandela” appeared anywhere on the page. In this setup, known as a party-list, proportional representation (PR) system, the composition of the Parliament is determined by the share of votes each party receives from the voters. Prior to the election, the parties register ranked lists of their own preferred party members for those positions. Thus if a party is allocated twenty seats after the election results are in, the first twenty names on that party’s list become Members of Parliament (MPs). Each party would develop its own rules and procedures for determining those lists, and not surprisingly, the ANC lists would be replete with liberation heroes. Once seats are allocated, the MPs must vote on who will be the state president in an election determined by a simple majority. The result is generally straightforward if a single party attains more than 50 percent of the seats: the post goes to the person at the top of that party’s list. Failing that, party leaders engage in bargaining to form a coalition, and typically that means that some parties agree to vote for another party’s leader in exchange for some concessions in terms of policies and/or appointments. Once the leader has been elected, they get to make choices about various government appointments. However, even between elections, the leader serves at the pleasure of the Parliament and can be replaced. Such a system has many virtues but also carries certain important risks. First, and most obviously, it affords significant power to parties and weighs against a focus on any single individual. If you are wary of unchecked individuals, this is a good system. However, if you are concerned about the quality or transparency of parties, it might be less preferable. When elections become competitive, the system can incentivize ambitious political leaders to split off to form their own, smaller and smaller parties. This can burden voters with simply too many choices, and parties can tend to become more about individual personalities than about ideas and policy platforms. The design of a PR system is clearly aimed at being more inclusive of a wider variety of perspectives. It allows even relatively small parties to participate in the legislatures, as they can literally get their own seats at the table.6 By comparison, in a typical “two-party” system that tends to emerge with different sets of electoral rules—as in the case of the United States—small parties with a particular focus are almost never officially represented anywhere. In the U.S. system for electing the national legislature, Americans vote for candidates within specific electoral districts, and the individual with the most votes gets the seat reserved for that contest. It is a “winner-take-all” approach, because unless you get the most votes and win the contest, you get zero representation. While representativeness is a virtue, when institutionalized it also implies that more extreme positions will have opportunities to have their voices recognized. Thus, for example, a PR system is more likely to include far-left and far-right parties in the legislature, for better and worse. No solution is perfect. When there is enormous heterogeneity of preferences, and those are reinforced by cultural differences and economic inequalities, no institutional fix can make everyone happy, let alone guarantee shared prosperity. While it is not possible to know for sure how history would have unfolded under different electoral rules, I am largely convinced that proportional representation was the best system for South Africa in order to keep all organized interests vested in democratic politics. Beyond the electoral rules, the logistics of administering the election were daunting. Compared with the previous all-White national election in 1989, in which the government prepared for 5 million eligible voters, at least 22 million were eligible in 1994, and the number of polling stations and polling booths more than tripled. Moreover, the majority of the electorate approached election day without the experience of having voted before, a problem that challenged the electoral commission, which did not have a multiracial voter roll to work with.7 My good friend Michael Goldberg, who had traveled with me to South Africa in 1991, returned to the country after our graduation. (Frankly, I still harbor jealousy about that fact.) He spent the run-up to the election in 1993 conducting voter education workshops for first-time voters. The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and other voter education organizations implemented programs to train community-based Black South Africans to run their own workshops in their own communities. Mundane topics and logistics needed to be addressed to avoid calamity on election day. What type of identification documents would be accepted? Would individuals enter the voting booth alone or with a family member or friend? In many of the rural areas where Goldberg worked, citizens expressed fears that White farmers would intimidate their workers to vote for their preferred candidates. Voter education workshops and materials emphasized “my vote is my secret.” Not surprisingly, many of the faces and symbols printed on the South African ballot in 1994 were those of the leaders and organizations that had been prominent in the political struggles for political change. Although long at odds with much of the rest of the liberation movement, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader at the helm of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), could campaign on some anti-Apartheid credentials. His opportunity to mount a formal campaign was severely truncated by his own decision to boycott the election, one he reversed just a week before it was scheduled to begin. Buthelezi and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, had enjoyed autonomy and a government budget under the Apartheid system. With eight million Zulus in the country, Buthelezi could threaten the stability and legitimacy of the election. In a strange alliance, during the constitutional negotiations process, Buthelezi worked with White separatists and other Black homeland leaders to demand greater provincial autonomy from what would surely be an ANC-run central government. They failed to extract this revision, but perhaps because they did not want to be political outcasts and/or because the ANC promised the maintenance of the monarchy and a royal budget, Buthelezi capitulated. The White Parliament needed to be called back for one last session to amend the interim constitution to allow for this late entry into the electoral contest, but in the end, Buthelezi’s face and party symbol were affixed as a sticker at the bottom of the millions of paper ballots in time for the election.8 And yet, there was no doubt—at least by the time of the election—that the liberation party was the African National Congress, and the photo of Nelson Mandela deserved to be framed on a wall of portraits of other independence leaders, including Ghana’s Nkrumah, Tanzania’s Nyerere, Kenya’s Kenyatta, and others. During Mandela’s time in prison, especially throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, many other individuals and organizations played a critical role in challenging the Apartheid government, including through mass action organized by trade unions and the coalition of civil society organizations embodied in the UDF. The ANC made a formal “tripartite” alliance with the major trade union federation, COSATU, and with the SACP, partners who shared a vision for the future. The arrangement successfully consolidated electoral support as only the ANC would appear on the ballot. In this sense, one of the country’s greatest blessings entering the transition period was that the mantle of leadership for “Black South Africa” had already largely coalesced around Mandela and his ANC. (In 1993, 56 percent of all South Africans and 81 percent of Black Africans said they favored the ANC.)9 The ANC was a diverse organization committed to a pluralist political order. Many Whites, Coloureds, and Indians had actively participated in and sometimes made the ultimate sacrifice for the struggle. And at least initially, the party visibly maintained individuals within its senior ranks from all four Apartheid-recognized race groups. The non-racialism ideals central to the Freedom Charter were routinely on display, especially in the company that Nelson Mandela kept. The 1994 election marked an unprecedented milestone in providing the previously disenfranchised a focal moment in which to make decisions about whom they wanted as leaders. And they were reminded that there was a choice to be made: despite the high legitimacy of Mandela himself and the ANC, nineteen parties were on the first ballot, and many of them enjoyed relatively strong bases of support and were able to compete freely. Amid the profound diversity and inequality of this newly formed polity, millions of people engaged in the exact same process within the period of just a few days: step into a voting booth, mark an X on each of the same two pieces of paper that were distributed throughout the country, and be able to keep their choices secret.10 For the first time ever, Blacks, Whites, Coloureds, Indians, and those not classified under the Apartheid rubric would collectively vote, marking a dramatic new start to what for a very long time would be called the “New South Africa.” And for the first time, being a Black South African citizen was no longer an oxymoron. The Results: ANC Victory, but Not a Supermajority For many expecting the worst, the largely smooth election came as a surprise. As an ANC leader recounted to me: I think with the release of Mandela, the unbanning of political organizations, we then knew that we were going to really have fundamental change in South Africa. So we were preparing ourselves, [but] … just days before the election, people, the whole of South Africa, were really in a tense state. People of all communities, all different walks of life, were really caught up with the fear of the unknown, what will democracy bring? Would it be like some parts of Africa or Europe where things go haywire? And we all caught up the day after elections on that fateful April day. And the sun rose, things were normal, people walked about, and suddenly, it was a huge sigh of relief for all South Africans who have crossed the Rubicon. We’ve done the big change.11 And back in Muldersdrift, Leslie Gama’s parents did come home that day. Despite rumors of a counterrevolutionary force within the military, it did not disrupt the election. For most adults around Krugersdorp and throughout South Africa, fear gave way to excitement. As happened in many new democracies around the world, people proudly displayed the indelible ink marked on their fingers—applied to thwart attempts to vote more than one time. There were a few bouts of violence. And there were some irregularities, including a mismatch between the electoral results in KwaZulu-Natal and preelection opinion polls.12 But none sufficient to impede the consensus that the election was at least “crudely legitimate.”13 Nationwide, approximately 19.5 million votes were cast, and 12.2 million were marked for the African National Congress. By the formulas of the IEC, their 62.7 percent of valid votes counted translated into 252 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly.14 Although the ANC had been widely expected to gain up to 70 percent of the vote, because they received just less than a two-thirds “supermajority,” the party would not be able to unilaterally alter the constitution. This was an outcome that most could live with, and likely a blessing that the party did not come out of the blocks fully dominant. De Klerk’s National Party—the very one that created and later dismantled Apartheid—captured just over 20 percent of the vote, performing well not just among White voters but also among Indian and Coloured voters, the latter being particularly dominant in the Western Cape. After forty years in power, spearheading one of the world’s most reprehensible systems of modern government, but also helping dismantle it, their campaign rehashed old tropes in new clothes. The party’s leaders continued to market the idea of “Black domination” to minority groups who feared retribution in the new order. For example, the National Party had systematically privileged Coloureds over Black Africans during the Apartheid era, and in the Cape, virtually all Coloureds speak Afrikaans. In turn, the NP successfully mobilized this voting bloc around the idea that they were essentially “Brown Afrikaners” and needed to protect themselves from unchecked ANC power. Many listened, and especially in the Western Cape Province, Coloureds overwhelmingly voted for the NP.15 Buthelezi’s IFP was expectedly strong in the Zulu-dominated region of KwaZulu-Natal where many voters viewed the ANC as virtually an enemy, following years of intense ANC-IFP conflict during the transition. The IFP also did well with Zulu-speaking migrant mine workers, including around Krugersdorp. All told, this translated into 10.5 percent of the national vote share. Constand Viljoen, leader of the Freedom Front and successor to the same Conservative Party that controlled the Krugersdorp council at the end of Apartheid, also received over 400,000 votes nationwide. At the time the Freedom Front, promoting a Volkstaat, a separate independent homeland for Afrikaners, gained much of its support from the urban periphery—places like Krugersdorp on the West Rand, where it received almost 6 percent of the vote.16 Nationwide it took in just 2 percent. Despite some strong historical political roots in the country, both the Democratic Party (DP) and the PAC had weak showings; each attracted less than 2 percent of the vote. And on May 9 the Parliament convened, governed by the new Speaker, an Indian woman and human rights lawyer named Frene Ginwala. Their one order of business was to elect the new state president, Nelson Mandela, and they did so without dissent. He and scores of other leaders would depart almost immediately for Pretoria, a two-hour flight away, as the new government adopted many of the old government’s rules and traditions, including keeping the Parliament in Cape Town and the executive government offices in Pretoria, which serves as a second capital city. (The third capital, of the judicial branch, is in Bloemfontein.) This multicitied capital was one of many holdovers from the creation of the Union of South Africa, which itself merged four separate entities. On the following day, May 10, Mandela was inaugurated as the first post-Apartheid president at the age of seventy-five. The ceremony took place at the Union Building, originally completed in 1913 with the two wings meant to symbolize the union of the English and Afrikaner “races.”17 Now, in 1994, South Africa would, once again, mark with an election the unification of people and territory and much greater cultural diversity within its polity. Both within the ruling party and across the parties that had won seats in the new Parliament, citizens of almost any background could find some representative who looked like them and/or represented their interests and values. Very few could have said that they were fully excluded. The day was nothing short of remarkable. At his inauguration, attended by dozens of world leaders, Mandela proclaimed, “Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.… Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.”18 It took a century of struggle, but in the final decade of the twentieth century, demographic reality finally became the basis for political power in South Africa and legalized apartness was over. Indeed, South Africans emerged relatively peacefully through the first election. Mandela, a political activist, and once widely recognized by Whites as a terrorist, was now the shining symbol of the “New South Africa.” The country, and the larger world, could not get enough of him. I also wanted to see for myself. Following my first year of graduate school in June 1995, I traveled with my soon-to-be fiancée, Amy, to Cape Town for a two-week trip to lay eyes on the new version of the country I had last seen under very different circumstances in 1991. As always, it was a painfully long flight from the United States. We stayed in the not-yet-upgraded Breakwater Lodge, on the outskirts of what was still a relatively small waterfront development along the stunning Atlantic seaboard. Sleep-deprived, we were looking forward to getting some rest. Standing in the way were revelers. There was partying in the hotel. Serious partying. And it went on … All. Night. Long. Earlier that day, South Africa had defeated Australia in the first round of the Rugby World Cup, being hosted in the country for the first time, a dividend of huge proportions for the sport-loving White population. Kegs of Castle Lager flowed through the bars, raising the volume into our room each hour. On the bright side, my friend Michael, still working at NDI, had thoughtfully bought us tickets to the next game, which would turn out to be South Africa versus Romania at Newland Stadium in Cape Town. The game itself was fun to watch, but I was not a big rugby fan. Why throw the ball backward? For me, the real spectacle was the fans. Black spectators accustomed to cheering for any team competing against South Africa were now rooting for a group of essentially all-White men, resolved, at least for now, that they were actually on the same side. And watching the massive-bodied White rugby fans do as Juliana Steyn had done, awkwardly mouthing their way through “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika,” and the Black fans willing to reappropriate this team and their symbols as their own—if that wasn’t a spirit of reconciliation, it was hard to imagine what would be. Pessimists became optimists, and of course the fact that the South Africans would eventually win the cup helped generate a collective sense of pride about what had been accomplished as a new nation in relatively short order. And Mandela conspicuously displayed his forbearance toward White South Africa when he opted to don the Springbok jersey—previously a symbol of “White” South Africa—at the final awards ceremony, a moment dramatically captured in the movie Invictus. Constitutional Rights: Foundations for Restoring Dignity The 1994 election was governed by a temporary, interim constitution, and the resulting Parliament immediately acted as a constitutional assembly to produce a permanent replacement. Signed in late 1996, and in effect as of early 1997, that document set a high bar for the types of rights that would be guaranteed to citizens—protections not simply from a potentially intrusive government (as the American constitution emphasized) but from the everyday realities of social and economic despair. It offered a progressive and inclusive vision of what the New South Africa should look like. Jurists and legal scholars around the world have come to regard the South African document as an extraordinary model—the epitome of a modern constitution.19 Much of the content drew quite explicitly on the demands and aspirations of prior generations of the liberation movement. Since its founding, the ANC leadership frequently comprised educated elites who spotlighted the contradiction between the human rights ideal and the reality of how Black people were treated. Sol Plaatje and other attorneys demanded an unbiased judicial system and equal application of the law as early as the first decades of the twentieth century.20 In 1923, the young ANC produced an “African Bill of Rights for South Africa” to remind the country and the world that Black Africans were also human and deserved to be treated in kind. It called for representation, liberty, and the right to property, arguing that African inhabitants of the Union had, “as human beings, the indisputable right to a place of abode in this land of their fathers.”21 In 1943, the organization adopted a document titled Africans’ Claims in South Africa, also known as The Atlantic Charter from the African’s Point of View. It was a response to the Atlantic Charter, advanced by President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which laid the foundation for the formation of the United Nations, and set out a vision for shared global peace and prosperity.22 As stated in the preface of the ANC document, Churchill had intended the charter to apply only to White people. In their documented response, the ANC wanted to make clear that as human beings, Black Africans were entitled to the same. Next, there was the 1955 Freedom Charter, perhaps the most critical document outlining ANC aspirations for a post-Apartheid future. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, this document, the product of months of citizen input, was launched by the Congress of the People at Kliptown, less than fifty kilometers from Krugersdorp. It drew explicitly on the notion of universal entitlement to the protection of human rights. The Freedom Charter took center stage at some of the secret negotiations between exiled Black leaders and White politicians during the late 1980s. And although Nelson Mandela’s landmark three-hour speech delivered in 1964 while a defendant in the Rivonia trial was not an official ANC charter in the manner of the two aforementioned documents, it took on great political weight for its clarity and bravery, contributing to Mandela’s legitimacy as a future leader even as that trial would land him in prison for much of the next three decades. The speech is best known for his final statement in which he proclaimed that for the values and causes he articulated, “I am prepared to die.” Throughout the speech, he reiterated these long-standing human rights demands and expectations. Although the final constitution made no express reference to Apartheid itself, or to any of these key documents that sought to challenge institutionalized White supremacy, even a casual reading reveals very strong links to this history. For example, the preamble of the 1996 constitution states, “We, the people of South Africa, Recognise the injustices of our past.” And like the Freedom Charter, it called for “non-racialism.” And just as the Freedom Charter proclaimed that “the preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime,” so did the constitution: “[Freedom of expression] does not extend to advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.” A set of fairly standard civil and political rights, including freedom of speech, association, and a free press, that appeared in the final constitution were also echoes from the Freedom Charter. Perhaps most remarkable was the extent to which calls for specific social and economic rights, demanded in Africans’ Claims, the Freedom Charter, and “I Am Prepared to Die,” were also enshrined in the highest law of the land. This included access to free education, housing, social security, and health care and freedom from hunger. By making these rights, the South African constitution opened the possibility for lawyers to push for material progress in the courts when offered evidence of gaps and shortfalls. Again reflecting the Freedom Charter, the constitution also emphasized respect for cultural autonomy or group rights by guaranteeing access to education in a choice of one of the eleven official languages. More generally, the constitution reflected the Freedom Charter’s balancing act of advocating “non-racialism” alongside explicit recognition of past racial discrimination and the need for redress. In his “I Am Prepared to Die” speech, Mandela argued that “the lack of human dignity experienced by Africans was the direct result of the policy of White supremacy,” and in turn, the constitution’s Bill of Rights proclaimed, “Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected.” Also revealing is where the documents diverged. Most conspicuously, the constitution did not reflect the aspiration of the Freedom Charter to nationalize the mines, or frankly, to nationalize much of anything. Moreover, the Freedom Charter made very specific demands for “full employment” and a forty-hour work week, which also did not materialize. These exceptions notwithstanding, the human rights values espoused by the ANC and the resistance movements against institutionalized White supremacy were clearly enshrined in the new constitution. In turn, specific directives invited a wide range of political actors to participate in the quest to extend respect for human dignity to all citizens. The Redrawing of Administrative Boundaries The other big question central to the design of democratic government was how to redraw the internal boundaries of the country. After almost a century of intense racial segregation, including forced relocation to several “homeland” governments, a radical reconfiguration was necessary. One option was a centralized approach, more like the French system, which incorporates a high level of uniformity throughout its territory. That might be appealing in terms of its prospects for providing equitable treatment to all South Africans, but it would face the realities of profound disparities in resources and capacities that would make such a system at least initially unworkable. Another option would be to devolve a great deal of decision making and authority to localized governments, as is the case in the United States. By the time of South Africa’s political transition, decentralization and strong local government had become new “international norms.” You want a real democracy? You need to give some power to politicians who live and interact with people in their communities, not in some distant national capital. It was a compelling argument but needed to be implemented in a manner that would be viewed as fair and feasible, not a straightforward task anywhere, let alone in a place with South Africa’s levels of cultural diversity overlaid with inequality. Boundary-making provides almost limitless possibilities for political conflict. Given that South Africans were already highly segregated into racially demarcated neighborhoods and sometimes regions, and that the conditions in White areas were so much better than the rest (and Indian and Coloured areas were also largely better serviced and more prosperous than Black African areas), and assuming that there would be no more forced movement of people—suddenly the stakes of those internal boundaries became quite high. As finalized in the 1996 constitution, South Africa would be a “quasi-federal” polity. The nine new provinces would have substantial discretion in their budgets and in the administration of many policies, but they would not be truly autonomous and would remain almost entirely dependent on the national government for revenue. Reflecting this relationship, elections for provincial legislatures would be jointly coordinated with national elections, all under the auspices of a national electoral commission. Krugersdorp, formerly in the “Transvaal” Province of the old South Africa, as of 1994 would now sit in Gauteng (along with Johannesburg and Pretoria). Cape Town would become the new capital of the Western Cape Province. Durban, the old Natal Province, and the former KwaZulu homeland would become KwaZulu-Natal. In this critical redrawing, the homelands of Apartheid design would be no more. On election day, the borders, laws, and government of Bop, and the three other independent homelands, had no legal basis; Bop’s oddly unconnected territories were integrated into the Northern Cape, Gauteng, and Free State provinces. And similar reconfigurations would occur throughout the country to varying degrees; some provinces would inherit a great deal of former homeland territory, whereas the Western Cape would inherit none. Meanwhile, the hundreds of traditional leaders whose authority was very much vested in the homeland structure would be offered more than a proverbial bone: the government would recognize particular areas as essentially co-governed by such leaders, a government department would be established to provide national-level representation, and the leaders themselves would receive government salaries.23 FIGURE 5.1. South Africa’s post-Apartheid provincial boundaries. Note: What is today Limpopo Province was initially named Northern Transvaal in 1994, and then in 1995, Northern Province; what is today Mpumalanga was initially named Eastern Transvaal in 1994. Particularly contentious was how the boundaries of the more intimate level of local government would be drawn. In this context, the potential gap between promises, expectations, and realities could be seen most visibly for individual citizens. Again, White South Africa had never fully realized its goal of becoming a White country, and as was the case with Krugersdorp, most of the relatively well-off White towns and cities around the country included and/or were surrounded by racially segregated townships. By the 1980s, many of the latter were formally governed by Black Local Authorities (yes, an official term), and unsurprisingly, as these were generally viewed as illegitimate and underresourced, they did not function well. By contrast, the White local governments generally did just fine and expenditures were matched with sufficient tax revenues. The post-Apartheid challenge was to amalgamate these into integrated polities but also to have local government structures. The possibility that decentralization could backfire was not lost on the ANC, whose leaders recognized that devolution was frequently a mechanism to protect the privileges of White people.24 For example, if Krugersdorp would be allowed to remain essentially “as is,” a largely White town with a White tax base, independent and separate from the neighboring Black areas such as Kagiso and Munsieville, then race-based Apartheid could largely survive in practice. Anticipating this possibility, across South Africa’s nine provinces, close to three hundred local governments were either reconfigured or born anew, including a handful of major metropolitan authorities (including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, and today there are a total of eight).25 While many essentially Black-only municipalities would remain, especially in rural, former homeland areas (where virtually no Whites, Coloureds, or Indians reside), this would mark the end of White-only local government, and municipalities in urban areas and on the urban periphery would now be multiracial polities. For the time being, the mosaic of greater Krugersdorp would be known as Krugersdorp District. Although the big prizes for electoral politics were clearly the seats in the national parliament and the state presidency, subnational governments soon emerged as important political arenas, perhaps in large part because this was where the ANC was vulnerable—not always able to attain over 50 percent of the seats needed to control governments. Most prominently, the ANC lost two of nine provinces in that first election: the Western Cape delivered the majority of its votes to the National Party and KwaZulu-Natal to the IFP. As in the national elections, these reflected the fact that race and ethnicity would loom large over voting patterns, and the ANC was defeated in these two provinces because Black Africans were a minority in the Western Cape and because Zulus dominated KwaZulu-Natal. Whatever one might have thought about the merits of these two opposition parties, the fact that they could enjoy visible access to power undoubtedly helped boost their constituents’ confidence in the system. Local Democracy in Practice In Gauteng, South Africa’s industrial heartland, where more than a quarter of the population squeezes into less than 2 percent of the landmass, the ANC was strong in the 1994 contest, certainly strong enough to win, but did not completely dominate as it did in some of the other provinces. It took in 59.1 percent of the votes cast for the national election and 57.6 percent for the provincial legislature. In an important province like Gauteng, the ANC deployed some of its best political talent. Toxyo Sexwale, a man who served time on Robben Island, supported Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness movement, and spent several years in exile, became the first provincial premier. Like Cyril Ramaphosa, Sexwale was immediately viewed as a possible successor to Mandela. By the end of 1994, residents of the newly integrated Krugersdorp District would be led by a trifecta of former political prisoners, because in addition to Mandela as president and Sexwale as provincial premier, in November of that year, a former political detainee, Stephen Motingoa, became the first Black man to be mayor of Krugersdorp. Motingoa was born and raised in Munsieville and in 1986 was detained without trial by the Apartheid government for more than a year. He was subsequently charged with sedition and subversion, but after his release he worked as a union leader and went to London to get a degree in development studies.26 The ceremonial mayoral chain donned by generations of White men would now be worn by a Black man in the town that Pretorius named after Paul Kruger, the site of Paardekraal, a shrine to Afrikanerdom; a town where the British had put Afrikaners in concentration camps and where Whites reconciled their own civil war around the exclusion of Blacks. Like so much in South Africa at the time, the local government was self-consciously provisional—it was called a Transitional Local Council (TLC). As recently as the late 1980s, many White Krugersdorpers would have described the images of a Black mayor and Black president as the coming of the apocalypse. The West Rander newspaper had to concede that the election went smoothly in the area. However, rather than depicting the images of the new Black voters or Black leaders on the cover, the editor chose instead a portrait of the White mayor of nearby Roodepoort, standing in front of the new South African flag, while glumly holding the old one in his hands.27 In my Historical Memories Survey I asked residents to reflect on this “transition period” from 1994 to 1999: “Was it smooth or difficult?” Their recollections were decidedly mixed,28 and again, predictably cleaved along racial and ethnic lines, but also in terms of where they were living. For the most part, Black residents recalled feeling hopeful. One man, in his late twenties at the time, said he “hoped that things would change, that I would have a better life, that the government would provide us with skills to make our lives better, as well as land.” The most frequently used words and phrases that Black residents used to describe this period and their vision of the future included “better,” “optimistic,” “better life,” and “free education.” Particularly for Black Africans in the more urban areas, the memories were largely upbeat: as a Black woman who was fifty-six when Mandela was elected explained, “There was no problem, and we transitioned smoothly.” Another citizen recalled, “It was smooth because houses were built.” But yet another who today lives in the same ward recalls things differently: “I will say it was a tough transition because Whites did not accept the defeat and there were those who still mistreated the Blacks because of that.” Whites in the more urban areas were also largely positive: “It was smooth because we accepted a better chance to live with and among each other, go to school together, have equal job opportunities,” a woman from Dan Pienaarville explained. “During those years, [we] had a smooth transition because we were able to mix with all races and attend church together.” But in the more rural areas—in Muldersdrift, for example, where Leslie Gama stayed home on election day—the recollections were more negative. A Black woman who was twenty in 1999 recounted, “In 1999, it was tough because people were not free to walk in the streets at night, there were people on bikes that were patrolling at night beating people who were walking in the streets.” Many other Black Africans from the area recall being beaten or challenged by Whites during the transition. Political tensions were high, and some Whites chose to display the old flag, a symbol of loyalty to the old regime.29 Many White Krugersdorpers, especially the Afrikaner population, entered the democratic era highly skeptical of the idea of Black government and of the economic redistribution this would inevitably entail. As early as January 1995, just a few months into the new administration, the Krugersdorp News ran a front-page story: “Councillors in the Local Transitional Council Get Paid Handsomely to Do Their Job, or Not To.” The article mentioned the 2.3-million-rand budget for councillor salaries and highlighted, “White ratepayers carry the burden for the expenditures and salaries of the town’s 54 councillors.… According to the town clerk, Koos Richards, no contributions are being received from Kagiso or Munsieville towards these payments.”30 These White South Africans resented the notion of even a transitional period of racially redistributive tax payments toward shared public services. And White councillors frequently complained that the new government, just less than a year old, would soon bankrupt the council. At the most extreme, some still wanted to opt out of the New South Africa altogether. They never gave up on the core ideology that led Paul Kruger’s family to flee the Cape for the Rand. While hundreds of thousands of the country’s wealthier Whites, especially those who spoke English at home, had already departed South Africa for London, New York, Southern California, Sydney, and Perth,31 Krugersdorp was generally not home to such would-be cosmopolitans. Afrikaner-descended families in particular tended not to have social networks or opportunities in Europe or the British commonwealth. As they liked to point out, they are Africans too. In June 1995, a Freedom Front councillor advocated a referendum to include Krugersdorp in the Volkstaat—a proposal Motingoa and others decried.32 That this idea still had traction reflected the degree to which some were resisting the new order. Nonetheless, the Krugersdorp News would soon accept the reality of political change and published a flattering profile of the mayor five months into his term, sharing his personal history and humanizing a Black person in a manner that had been extraordinarily rare in any of the West Rand news outlets. Motingoa humbly refused to make any analogies between his path and Nelson Mandela’s. However, he did attempt to share the new president’s forgiving disposition: “The torture, humiliation and physical injuries left their mark, but I channel my bitterness into working towards peace and reconciliation.”33 Begrudgingly, the News followed up with a headline, “TLC Is Not Too Bad.” The accompanying story highlighted that many residents were happy about the change: “the TLC has made an effort to beautify Munsieville.” Another, from Dan Pienaarville and with an Afrikaans family name, was cautiously skeptical: “We have to wait and see what is going to happen.”34 Until 2000, the local government system remained provisional as details of demarcation of boundaries and assignment of responsibilities were still under review. But that year, Krugersdorp District was formally consecrated as Mogale City Local Municipality. The new council adopted an African name for the entity while maintaining Krugersdorp as the town that would serve as the seat of that government. Mogale was a freedom-fighting chief, the namesake of the Magaliesberg mountains, who suffered various indignities at the hands of Paul Kruger’s relatives and associates in the early part of the nineteenth century.35 The new mosaic epitomized the opportunities and challenges of post-Apartheid South Africa in localized form. And at least initially, in electoral terms, the municipality was a bellwether town. In the 1994 national election, the 81,232 votes cast for the ANC in what was then Krugersdorp District represented 62.6 percent of the vote share36—almost exactly the party’s share of votes nationwide (62.7 percent). In the first official local election in 2000, the ANC received 60 percent of the Mogale City vote, as compared with 65 percent of the vote in local elections throughout the country. FIGURE 5.2.

The new local government institutions added an important wrinkle to democratic practice in South Africa. On the one hand, each local council would function in some ways like the national parliament in the sense that the seats of the council would be allocated via proportional representation, based on voters’ choices for their preferred party. Each municipality would also be subdivided into a series of wards of approximately equal population size, and each voter would cast a ballot for a single ward councillor, some of whom would stand without any party affiliation. In turn, the council would be filled with the ward councillors, and then seats allocated from the various party lists, such that the total number of seats for each party was proportional to the total number of PR votes cast. The ward councillor and committees elected within wards would be citizens’ points of contact to the council. Citizens could also contact “shadow” ward councillors from other parties, as those who had seats from the PR vote would routinely be assigned to wards the party lost in order to stay connected to citizens.37 From “Bold Experiment” to “Miracle” Considering the elections, the new constitution, the reconfigured administrative boundaries, and frankly the new mood in the country, by the late 1990s, the South Africans had clearly overperformed relative to expectations. Observers inside and outside the country routinely described the new democracy as a “miracle.”38 Others called the few years after 1994 a “honeymoon.” In any case, the formal transition from Apartheid to post-Apartheid government was complete. There was no civil war, no massive reprisals, no fundamental challenges to the legitimacy of the new order. Where South Africa had once been banned and sanctioned, now the world was coming in to see this beautiful country and to get a taste of what was going on. In just a few dramatic years, the political landscape of southern Africa was transformed. People around the world, myself included, celebrated the successful transition and the new moral authority the country’s leaders now assumed on the world stage. And it was in this context that Amy and I returned to South Africa in 1997 to live for a year, primarily so that I could carry out research. As part of my preparations, I studied Xhosa—the Black African language spoken most widely in the Cape—and although I never became fluent, I learned to carry on a conversation, and that turned out to be a nice way to break the ice with a lot of people. In the days after we arrived, I learned that the South Africans were as interested in us as we were in them. To be clear, by “us,” I mean they were literally obsessed with Michael Jackson. The arrival of “Jacko,” as they called him, dominated the front pages of newspapers, even amid reports of gangsterism in Cape Town townships and the forging of a new political party by a former homeland leader and a White National Party politician-turned-anti-Apartheid activist. Jackson’s talent for music and performance, and seeming racial ambiguity, piqued interest across the South African color bar. We made arrangements to affiliate ourselves with local institutions. Amy worked at the South African National Gallery and taught art history at the University of Cape Town. I was supported as a Fulbright Fellow, and as part of that process I arranged for an affiliation with the successor organization to IDASA. Now it would be called the Institute for Democracy in South Africa (IDASA). With sizable amounts of foreign funding, it became a think tank and aggregator of civil society organizations, carrying out a range of functions, including voter education, parliamentary monitoring, and budget analysis. Located in a spectacular colonial-era, high-ceilinged building in Cape Town, on 6 Spin Street, just around the corner from the Parliament buildings, several government buildings, and the National Library, it was just about the best spot I could have asked for to witness all that was going on, and I made some lifelong friends who would remain in the field of democratic development (and even read drafts of the manuscript for this book). Outside “experts” were coming through the halls each week, but effectively, those outsiders were learning more than they were teaching—the South Africans were brimming with ideas and high ideals, and I loved coming into the office each day. No one took for granted that in order to build a democracy, citizens needed to learn more about the process and how it would affect them. Government budgets, for example, can be extraordinarily opaque, so members of IDASA’s Budget Information Service would describe the implications of the budget for women or for children in accessible publications and in workshops. Although the organization clearly had great sympathies for the new ANC government, it set up a Parliamentary Monitoring Service to make sure that power was checked and key debates and decisions were shared with citizens. The Public Opinion Service made sure that it was not just government that was carrying out and analyzing surveys and that nationally representative views on key issues could be articulated in representations to government. New policies and practices were sorely needed to realize the ambitions of the new constitution, and creative and energetic South Africans were rising to the occasion to provide these. I sat in on debates in which various political actors engaged in foundational discussions about what a fair and just society ought to look like. My own research was on the tax system, so I attended parliamentary hearings on proposals to revise that system. Tax experts tried to discuss the highly technical topic in politically neutral language, but they could not avoid falling back on fundamental questions. For instance, when it came time to debate taxes on estates—typically a minor source of revenue for the state—a representative of White farmers said that high estate taxes would force many family farmers to sell off large parts of their farms, effectively ending the family business. In turn, an ANC Member of Parliament stood up and asked, “Would that be so bad?” My doctoral advisor, Robert Price,39 introduced me to Andrew Feinstein, a White ANC Member of Parliament, who would become a personal friend while Amy and I lived in Cape Town. Feinstein was just seven years older than me, had been an anti-Apartheid activist, and had spent some time at UC Berkeley, where I was a graduate student at the time. I enjoyed talking with him about shared interests in nation-building and public finance. (And I was particularly excited when he mentioned one of my working papers in a parliamentary debate.) The fact that a White former activist had been chosen by party elites to represent the party in Parliament spoke volumes about the sustained commitment to being racially inclusive. And when I got to know him in 1997–98, Feinstein was pro-ANC all the way. He pointed out that tax policy was becoming a balancing act: initially, Whites had been willing to pay a “transition tax,” but by this point, many of the wealthiest Whites had moved much of their money offshore to avoid taxation and just in case they decided to leave the country altogether. Indeed, quite a few had already left. He shared with me his perception that White South Africans would resist more in the way of taxation, and they were complaining of crime and invoking the “Specter of Zimbabwe,” by speaking of South Africa “going the way of the rest of Africa.”40 Ironically, many of the very countries that had sanctioned South Africa for Apartheid, including the United States, were willing to embrace White South Africans who were taking their skills and resources out of the country, claiming they did not feel safe. With such an escape valve, it would be difficult to engage in too much redistributive policy. During our year in residence, Amy and I happily joined in the sport of Mandela spectating. Where would he be, and could we get a glimpse? We secured tickets to watch him host Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, one of the great African independence leaders, as he addressed the new government in the Parliament building. Nyerere offered an optimistic portrait of Africa’s future and was met with thunderous applause. A personal highlight was the opportunity to stand in the back row of a press conference held jointly with Mandela and President Bill Clinton. As a Fulbright Fellow, I had been invited to tag along with the White House press corps in exchange for my willingness to serve as a tour guide on the bus rides around town, one of which included CNN’s Wolf Blitzer sitting in front and ABC’s Sam Donaldson firing multiple questions at me as he prepared his report. Mandela and Clinton spoke to the world in March 1998 in the gardens of Tuynhuys (pronounced Tane-hace), the Cape Town office of the presidency, used when Parliament is in session. A stunningly clear blue sky hovered above Table Mountain, which itself stands behind, and towers above, the Cape Dutch building. And to our back was the Company’s Garden, created by the very Dutch settlers who had come to these shores in 1652 to cultivate the fruits and vegetables they craved on their transoceanic journeys. We all watched as the leader of the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world was fully eclipsed by the stature of an elder statesman, who deployed grit and forbearance to lead South Africa through a remarkable transition. American presidents were surely used to having their counterparts show deference to them on diplomatic visits, but in this case, the tables were clearly turned. While South Africa was in many ways burdened by its past, the long legacy of resistance also generated a great deal of political capital useful for democratic development. As described earlier, a strong commitment to a rights orientation especially within the ANC provided a coherent framework for creating democratic institutions. A strong “civil society,” the organized and autonomous associations designed to link citizens to the state, similarly proved to be a favorable by-product of a hard-fought resistance. IDASA and others, including women’s organizations and trade unions, had built strong memberships during the anti-Apartheid era and, at least initially, could credibly give voice to citizens’ wants and needs in the post-Apartheid era. Although the Apartheid state had occasionally used emergency powers to suppress journalistic freedoms, a fairly robust, critical media environment had nonetheless flourished. By 1994, a very wide range of newspapers and radio and television stations were already established and offered frequent news updates from a variety of perspectives. Within a few years, internet access expanded throughout the country and along with it, unprecedented access to information. I sent my first wireless email while in South Africa. However, as in countries throughout the world, internet access would be disproportionately available to those in urban areas and to those who could afford it. Moreover, the political resistance to Apartheid produced a number of great legal minds, which helped contribute to the development of a robust and independent judiciary. Mandela appointed Arthur Chaskalson, a member of his defense team at the Rivonia trial (who had formed the Legal Resources Centre [LRC], a human rights law organization), to be the first president of the Constitutional Court. The court would be filled with respected jurists who could make judgments independent of direct political pressures and help legitimate its place in the new democratic constitutional order. In short, the first post-Apartheid elections and Mandela’s presidency exceeded any reasonable expectations for a peaceful transfer of power. However, the successful introduction of new democratic institutions did not imply that a vibrant multiracial democracy had fully taken root and could survive the long winter of political reality. The initial five years were exceptional in many ways, most obviously because Mandela was no ordinary leader. He would be on the short list, and maybe at the top, of any global ranking of most admired and respected individuals of the twentieth century. This meant that during his presidency, he could broker deals between conflicting parties and elicit compromise over conflict. His profound personal history, sacrifices, and acts of forbearance led even his political adversaries to recognize him as verging on “superhuman.” People followed his directives because of who he was and what he had done in his own courageous life.41 While several of Africa’s most promising independence leaders—Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, and Ivory Coast’s Félix Houphouët-Boigny—each stayed in power for more than thirty years, generally to the great detriment of their countries, Mandela’s tenure in government was far shorter. Of course, he was different from these men in all sorts of ways, including the fact that he was much older when he took office. In 1998, during the fifth year of his five-year term, he celebrated his eightieth birthday, and the country began to face the reality of his humanity. The tall, powerful freedom fighter walked with a slower gait and spoke more softly. And that year, he married Graça Machel, herself a teacher, former government minister, and human rights advocate from Mozambique, who was the widow of former Mozambican state president Samora Machel. Mandela said he wanted a bit of time to live out of the everyday spotlight, and he chose not to stay on as state president or as head of the ANC. It is hard to imagine that this period would have been so smooth and peaceful without Mandela’s generous spirit, cloaked in a history of enormous personal sacrifice. Nonetheless, one of the key tenets of democracy is that government should not revolve around a single person. Rather, its institutions are designed with the intention that the people, despite their diversity, can self-govern. The value of introducing this democratic system to South Africa could only be learned over a longer period of time, in the face of new challenges and in the context of very different leaders.",

      "content": "6 Democracy after Mandela A STRESS TEST EVEN DURING THE SURPRISINGLY PEACEFUL and productive first years of the Mandela presidency, not everyone was convinced that South Africa’s future was so bright. A group of prominent South African scholars commissioned a collection of essays investigating how democracy had gone awry in other parts of the world. For example, they wondered if South Africa might soon resemble Mexico, where a liberation party managed to secure political control for over seventy years and engaged in wanton corruption to the detriment of the economy and society.1 After only one election, historians and social scientists were already classifying the ANC as a “dominant party” and suggesting that their own country might be incapable of becoming a liberal democracy. Maybe it was unfair and overly cynical to be worrying about such outcomes this early in the post-Apartheid history. And yet, considering the size of the ANC majority, and the precedents of other liberation leaders and parties becoming autocratic in other parts of the world, it was a plausible concern. If one party got a firm grip on power, would ordinary citizens have any chance of holding politicians accountable? Fast forward to the 2019 election. If I had shared these early predictions with the voters I encountered all around Mogale City, many would have concluded that these skeptics had been soothsayers. During the two decades from the twilight of Mandela’s presidency until the 2019 elections, the once conventional wisdom that the country had emerged as a democratic “miracle” faded into a distant memory. In its place, the airwaves, headlines, and bookstores shared ongoing sagas of government corruption and failed projects. For millions of South African citizens, corruption indeed emerged as the existential problem, and a dominant ANC was to blame. Several important books documented the illicit practices of government officials at all levels with titles such as Licence to Loot, How to Steal a City, and Anatomy of the ANC in Power.2 The latter two describe the precipitous downfall of the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, the metropolitan municipality centered in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape Province. The various authors painted depressing portraits of the undoing of a high-minded, ideologically driven liberation party and the spreading rot of malfeasance in the daily operations of government. It is worth noting, however, that Stephan Hofstatter (author of Licence to Loot) would later be dismissed from the Sunday Times for false reporting and was confronted at a book launch by angry government officials accusing him of misrepresentations.3 Through such books, as well as from print and broadcast news, everyday conversations, and social media, citizens became aware that more than a few politicians were concocting elaborate schemes to divert government resources into their own pockets, while millions of people remained poor, out of work, and without reliable access to basic services. In the weeks and months leading up to the 2019 elections, even ANC supporters and local councillors in Mogale City—including the ANC mayor, Patrick Lipudi—shared with me their awareness of and concerns about the problem of corruption within ANC ranks. The opposition described the ANC as almost uniformly crooked. In 2015, the majority of South Africans said they perceived substantial corruption in all levels of government; over 63 percent said that the level had “increased a lot” in the previous year.4 In fact, when I mentioned to various South Africans in 2019 that I was writing a book about post-Apartheid South Africa, they essentially responded, “Oh, so a book about the corrupt ANC?” Meanwhile, citizens were increasingly resorting to protest in a manner reminiscent of the anti-Apartheid days. Many protests turned destructive and violent, and at least as worrying, on a few occasions, the national government and various local governments used violence against protesting and striking citizens. The prevalence of such well-documented political pathologies begs the question: How could I possibly describe South Africa’s democracy as a “success story” if all of this was going on? It’s a fair question. Democratic practice in Mogale City and throughout South Africa during this period has indeed been uneven, maybe even downright ugly. Many chapters of this history would not find their way into a textbook of civic best practices. Corruption and violence can seem almost routine in some pockets of the country. Nonetheless, democratic politics has operated in a manner that has been increasingly competitive, with substantial opportunities for citizen engagement and oversight from various guardrails within society. Politicians are frequently held accountable for unethical behavior, undesirable policies, or simply being perceived as not doing a good job. While many might have hoped for or even expected a government in which all public servants operated with complete integrity, and that all disputes would be resolved through deliberative debate, such outcomes were highly unlikely given the country’s political history, let alone the record of other countries that have undergone major regime changes like South Africa’s. In fact, many of the wealthiest and oldest democracies still struggle with such problems to varying degrees. This clearly includes the United States, especially of recent vintage. In this chapter, I offer evidence of democratic accountability at work—even in the face of substantial challenges and contradictions—in three steps. First, I review some of the most important ways in which democratic institutions constrained the two longest-serving presidents amid all of their deficiencies. Second, I describe democratic accountability at the local level, especially in Mogale City, again while still acknowledging many of its very real problems. And third, I detail some of the South African patterns of democratic performance and accountability and the extent of corruption and violence in a broader and comparative perspective. To hear South African commentators describe their country’s failures at democratic governance, one might think that theirs was a failed state. In fact, in 2015, more than one-third of surveyed Gauteng residents said it was a failed state.5 But if we consider actual failed states—Somalia, Chad, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, or the Democratic Republic of Congo—we recognize the extent of hyperbole in such assessments of South Africa. The reality of South African government is not nearly so apocalyptic. In many ways, it is highly functional. Constraining Power at the Very Top As I discussed in the prior chapter, of the idiosyncrasies that make South Africa unique, a prominent one is Nelson Mandela. The legendary iconoclast gave South Africa many things, but in becoming president, he did not offer a good test for democracy. Mandela embraced his jailers, repeatedly called for calm and forgiveness over revenge, donned the symbols of oppression in a spirit of reconciliation, and chose to leave office after only one term. He revealed that he was no ordinary politician or person. That South Africa could function effectively with him at the helm left it to the imagination whether it was democracy or his demigod-like stature and self-restraint that ordained such success. Most politicians are instead far more mortal. Almost by definition, they are ambitious and crave power—to a greater extent than the average citizen. Many are very public spirited, but certainly not all, and the pressures and temptations of power can induce greed, unscrupulous efforts to remain in office, and inclinations to favor friends and loyalists for jobs and policies rather than the broader interests of the country. One of the key tests for democratic politics is whether the “people” can constrain such tendencies, especially of those at the pinnacle of power, so that the polity does not become hostage to leaders’ wants and needs or to efforts to divert government resources. After Mandela, the ANC bench was still deep with qualified and impressive possibilities, but this lot was decidedly mortal and offered a solid “stress test” for democratic politics. The office of the presidency alternated to four different men between the time of Mandela’s retirement and the 2019 election. But just two—Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma—led for eighteen of those twenty years. Given their personal biographies, either would have been a viable national leader, irrespective of leadership selection rules. During their tenures in office, national politics was dominated by their deeds, their misdeeds, and their own struggles for power. Mbeki was an ANC stalwart. During the years of struggle, he devoted his life to the organization, joining the youth league at the age of fourteen, working in exile, and receiving military training in the Soviet Union; he was based for many years in Lusaka, Zambia. Moreover, his father, Govan Mbeki, was a politicized Fort Hare graduate, an ANC leader, and jailed with Mandela following the Rivonia trial. Despite membership in the South African Communist Party, Mbeki opposed the ANC becoming a party of socialism, citing a desire to remain a “broad church.” This approach served him well for most of his career, allowing him to become the international face of the ANC and to negotiate effectively with White South Africa.6 His appointment to be Mandela’s deputy president in 1994 put him on a clear path to lead the ANC’s party ticket. Mbeki could seem more professorial than a veteran of a militant liberation movement. Not particularly tall or physically imposing, he wore a beard, spoke in measured paces, and routinely exuded the academic prowess of a man with an advanced degree in economics from Sussex University. He put forward many bold ideas, some productive, including positive visions for African regional integration and upliftment. And yet, like other exiles, especially those involved in the military wing, he had no experience being governed from below. Just prior to becoming state president, one commentator noted Mbeki’s penchant for centralizing power in an essay with the headline, “Mbeki: Democrat or Autocrat?”7 Jacob Zuma was also a former exile from the era of resistance politics. Born in KwaZulu-Natal in 1942, he painted a stark contrast to Mbeki. The son of a policeman and a domestic worker,8 his working-class credentials were a large part of his public appeal: “I never went to school, but I educated myself,”9 he proudly proclaimed. Also not particularly tall, but a sturdier figure, with a clean-shaven face and head, Zuma had been active in the military wing of the ANC, served prison time on Robben Island with Mandela, and also had strong ANC credentials, including working with Mbeki for the cause of liberation. Seen by his comrades as a committed cadre, “fearless, loyal, and affable,”10 he rose in the ranks owing to a strong social IQ and effectiveness as an underground operative. Though visibly proud of his Zulu heritage, he was not a cultural autonomist and stood by the ANC throughout its conflicts with the IFP.11 However, Zuma had few close relationships with White South Africans in the manner that Mbeki or Mandela did. Compared with Mbeki, Zuma exuded more energy and less introspection. He was an antidote to Mbeki’s air of elitism in substance and style. Though he served as deputy president under Mbeki, his ascendancy to the top position was shrouded in some doubt in the midst of not simply ongoing corruption investigations but charges of rape. The latter resulted in a very public trial. Although the court declared that the sex was consensual, during the course of the proceedings, it was revealed that Zuma had had unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman, and he famously declared that it was “ok” because he showered afterward, a statement that even the exonerating judge would condemn for its lack of scientific merit. Notwithstanding such sagas, Zuma was elected ANC president in 2007,12 even as many wondered whether he would be South Africa’s populist autocrat. Both men had great ambitions for themselves, and each tried to subvert democratic procedures in various ways during their respective tenures (1999–2008 and 2009–18). But both were also overtly humbled in their presidential careers through the machinations of direct democratic pressures and internal party struggles for power. The various media outlets challenged each man’s record, and they faced steady and well-organized reactions from civil society; their policies and actions were corrected by the courts; and ultimately their own powers were constrained by their party while the party’s power was constrained by voters at the polls. Violations of Public Trust As I will discuss in the next two chapters, many successful policies were enacted and implemented during Mbeki’s and Zuma’s respective terms. Yet, both men violated the public’s trust on various occasions by hiding or participating in illicit schemes and by making self-serving and counterproductive policies and appointments. One policy episode, for which Mbeki became infamous around the globe, was his heterodox approach to the devastating AIDS pandemic, which had been ravaging southern Africa since the late 1980s. He and his chosen health minister refused to embrace the widely held scientific understanding of the role that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plays in sickness and death. He went so far as to argue that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was not caused by a virus.13 He also rejected the use of scientifically proven anti-retroviral drug therapies, depriving the population of their value for prevention and treatment. Mbeki and his chosen group of advisors came to be known as AIDS denialists. Their approach may have cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people viable opportunities to extend their lives.14 It was a stunning blind spot, and Mbeki was relentlessly stubborn. Owing to these retrograde policies, the South African government, once again, became something of a pariah. I was so struck by the extent to which this problem was spiraling out of control and not receiving the response it deserved that it became the focus of my own research for the next several years.15 A second major scandal involved both Mbeki and Zuma; it came to be known simply as the “Arms Deal.” As early as 1998, while Mandela was still president, the government announced its intention to modernize its defense force and that it would procure billions of dollars in heavy equipment. As a start, the initiative was roundly criticized as inappropriate for a country that faced no apparent defense threats. More notably, the companies that wanted to bid on those contracts and their host governments frequently engaged in various forms of bribery to influence the decision makers to throw the highly lucrative business deals their way. ANC officials accepted luxury cars, money, and other perks. The procurement process was repeatedly found to be irregular in the sense that standards for rating certain bids were changed midstream to favor particular firms.16 Although to my knowledge Mbeki has not been directly implicated in any attempts to gain personally from the deals, he was criticized for blocking open investigations.17 Zuma, on the other hand, has been accused of securing various illegal payments while deputy president and was dismissed by Mbeki for corrupt dealings. In both cases, Mbeki’s wrongdoings were matters of process, of subverting open government and transparency and attempting to centralize power and to protect party insiders while potentially scapegoating political rivals. Zuma, by contrast, sought to enrich himself and his family and friends, taking malfeasance to great new heights. In this regard, his presidency was clearly the blight of the post-Apartheid history. The most egregious of such transactions involved an Indian-born family, the Guptas. The Gupta saga is long and now legendary in South Africa. The family came to South Africa from India in the early 1990s in initially modest fashion. Over the decades, they became so enmeshed in the work of South African government that they gave rise to a term now used frequently in everyday dialogue: “state capture.”18 In their quest for political and economic influence, the family provided jobs to Zuma family members and to those of other politicians. (By one estimate, ANC politicians skimmed tens of billions of dollars from public funds.) They enticed complicity through first-class plane tickets, rides on private planes, jobs, money, and other perks. And in turn, the president and other government leaders gave the Guptas access to lucrative government deals and control over the selection of key government positions. Naturally, their favored selections treated them extremely well in all business dealings, allowing the Guptas to become one of the country’s richest families—in a country where the richest families are very rich, by any standard.19 In sometimes wanton fashion, the Guptas gained access to a military base for a private wedding; they used their influence to attain the post of finance minister for a loyal crony; and they earned millions from shady business deals involving government contracts.20 Relatedly, Zuma and others in the ANC engaged in similar types of dealings with the Krugersdorp-based company Bosasa. The company routinely traded perks and kickbacks in return for government contracts and influence. A whistleblower from the company recounted the ways in which the Bosasa CEO was able to control Zuma’s public statements and actions,21 furthering the notion of a state captured by private interests. Finally, on a much smaller scale in financial terms, but symbolically extremely disquieting for South Africans, Zuma spent approximately 7.8 million rand of public money on upgrades to his personal homestead in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal. These included a swimming pool, a cattle pen, and an amphitheater, amenities that were hidden as expenses under the otherwise allowable rubric of “security upgrades.”22 Responses and Repercussions Together, this set of incursions—Mbeki’s AIDS policies, the arms deal, “Gupta-gate,” Bosasa, and Nkandla—left the ANC’s reputation tarnished when it made its case to the voters in 2019. Along with other inevitable scandals and policy failures, they fed critics daily fodder. What does the fact that such betrayals of the public’s trust could unfold over the first quarter century of post-Apartheid government reflect about the quality of democracy? Here, I think much of the answer lies with how citizens and various actors responded to evidence and allegations. And in this regard, the fact that we know so much about these problems and that government officials have not been able to stem the flow of incriminating information reveals a great deal about the success of South Africa’s democracy. To appreciate the openness, it is important to consider the situation in non-democratic regimes, including Zimbabwe under Mugabe, or in countries such as Bahrain, Qatar, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, where there has been very little space for critics to openly challenge and demand consequences for malfeasance. While citizens in these tightly managed authoritarian countries may perceive corruption or hear about it through rumors, or gain access to some international reporting via the internet or satellite news, the absence of effective opposition parties and the immediate threat of repression have implied a completely different landscape for accountability. In South Africa, citizens and civil society have been emboldened to challenge the state and its various leaders by name. For example, several former anti-Apartheid activists banded together to forge new organizations and movements to speak out against Mbeki’s retrograde AIDS policies. In particular, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC)—led by many former anti-Apartheid activists and exiles—emerged as a global leader in the fight for treatment access. They led marches, held press conferences, and built coalitions to criticize the government’s actions. They developed clever slogans and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase “HIV Positive” in order to counter stigma against the disease. The press relentlessly critiqued government policy while political cartoonists and entertainment personalities routinely mocked officials who persisted in denying the well-accepted science around HIV prevention and AIDS treatment. Medical professionals and social scientists spoke out against the government’s policies, as did leaders of various opposition political parties. If the government was trying to silence or repress any of these actors, they did not do a very good job of it. These organizations won their court cases, and the government obeyed, changing course on its HIV policies.23 Relatedly, throughout the post-Apartheid period, the news media—and as amplified on social media—consistently shined a bright light on allegations and evidence of corruption. In fact, rare has been the day when any major news outlet has not reported on the status of some government corruption allegation or another. In at least one case, the response and resulting impact were almost immediate. When Zuma installed a Gupta ally into the office of the finance minister, the business community and the various news organizations went ballistic, as seen in these headlines: “Firing Nene Proves Jacob Zuma Is the Dolt behind the Bolt,”24 “Finance Minister Switch Seen as Another Zuma Clanger,”25 and “Van Rooyen ‘Bad for ANC in Polls.’ ”26 Within days of the appointment, Zuma faced so much backlash, along with a sharp drop in the markets, that he shuffled the crony to a less central position and appointed the trusted and reliable Pravin Gordhan to the job. This episode also demonstrated the business sector’s autonomy and ability to challenge the government even publicly in the face of poor governance practice.27 That said, like other parties in power, the ANC has frequently sought to keep such information out of the public view and certainly has tried to clamp down on unflattering news. As it turned out, a key whistleblower was Andrew Feinstein, the ANC MP I had met in the first month of my yearlong stay in the country in 1997–98. When Feinstein tried to get to the bottom of the arms deal, he met serious resistance. ANC leaders removed him from the parliamentary public accounts committee.28 The more he pressed, the more he was alienated from the party, and in 2001, he resigned from his beloved ANC. He migrated to London and published a popular book, After the Party, detailing this and other scandals that undermined his confidence in the organization.29 The ANC’s treatment of Feinstein is an obvious blemish on its democratic record. For many, the arms deal was a massive fraud plus cover-up, and critics can point to a weak-toothed commission as having done little to redress the wrongdoing. At the very least, in 2001, the ANC’s Chief Whip, Tony Yengeni, and Zuma’s financial advisor were both sentenced to prison. Even after twenty years, the ANC has not been able to bury the case; public protectors and the media continue to elicit allegations and evidence. A new judge condemned a prior ruling that made light of the case and reopened it for additional scrutiny, a welcome development for many of those who challenged the government in the first place.30 Throughout their tenures, both Mbeki and Zuma faced hard-hitting everyday scrutiny in the news media. In 2004, Archbishop Desmond Tutu began to publicly criticize Mbeki and his administration for bad policies, including on AIDS,31 and for Mbeki’s general failure to encourage open discussion and debate within the ANC.32 Following further public exchanges between them, ANC officials tried to defuse the situation by expressing respect for Tutu’s position.33 Tutu continued to criticize Mbeki throughout the remainder of his term, going so far as to publicly state that neither he nor Zuma would be an appropriate pick for the ANC leadership in 2007.34 By 2008, owing to a wide range of factors, including disappointments about economic policy on the part of trade union and SACP leaders,35 Mbeki lost the support of the ANC and was forced to resign. Two years into Zuma’s presidency, Tutu once again raised his voice as national muse, and again, his challenges were covered widely. He captured the growing frustration with the governing liberation party in a particularly alarming manner when he described it as “worse than the Apartheid government.” He quickly qualified this bold charge with, “because at least you were expecting it from the Apartheid government.” Ever the conscience of the country, Tutu cast his ire on Zuma to a greater degree than he did Mbeki: “Hey Mr. Zuma, you and your government don’t represent me. You represent your own interests … I am warning you out of love. I am warning you like I warned the nationalists [National Party Apartheid government] that one day we will start praying for the defeat of the ANC government. You are disgraceful.”36 Tutu was particularly upset with Zuma’s refusal to grant a visa to Tibet’s Dalai Lama, a move that seemed to reflect greater sympathies for an authoritarian Chinese government than the core human rights values enshrined in the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Relatedly, he was fingering the growing sense that Zuma was inclined to flout the rule of law and needed to be held to account. Widely seen as independent, the courts have even held Zuma personally accountable. He was convicted in the highest court for using state money to upgrade Nkandla. In a unanimous judgment, it ruled, “The President has failed to uphold, defend and respect the constitution as the supreme law of the land.” And indeed, the case came to the court in the first place owing to a March 2014 report of the government public protector.37 The court ordered that he respect the earlier report requiring him to repay the government money.38 And indeed, Zuma eventually did pay, taking out a second mortgage to do so.39 Some might say, not enough punishment for what he did. But it’s important to ask: Where else in the world does a president face such consequences while still in power? By April 2017, protest movements increasingly targeted Zuma directly. A popular hashtag, #ZumaMustFall, circulated widely on social media, and South Africans of every race began to hit the streets insisting that he resign.40 Thousands of South Africans returned to protest following yet another cabinet reshuffle that included the dismissal of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The 2017 protests were organized by Save SA—a collaboration of South African activists41 led by both members of the business community and old ANC stalwarts.42 One protester remarked, “I’m an ANC person but we want our old ANC back.”43 The Gupta-related scandals and the arms deal raised the ire of various government bodies charged with protecting the integrity of the government. The public protector, Thuli Madonsela, forced Zuma to appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate, among other things, his own multiple misdeeds. By the time of the 2019 election, the investigators were hard at work gathering evidence, and in several of my interviews with Mogale City political leaders in the run-up to the election, they had the television on, watching how the inquiry was unfolding and might be reverberating for their own political careers. Electoral Implications Given all of the media attention to the growing level of corruption within the country, the big question that remained was whether the general public—that is, voters—would take action. Again, one of the key features of South Africa’s electoral system is that for most contests, citizens vote for parties, not candidates, which meant that ANC supporters who opposed Zuma could not directly punish him without casting a vote for a less-preferred party. As the 2014 national and provincial election approached, Zuma’s documented bad behavior and various problems in the country amounted to blood in the water for rival political sharks. Political challenges mounted from both the right and the left, from White and Black. Importantly, a generational divide began to split the political arena, as those born in the early 1990s who had never lived under Apartheid—“Born Frees”—were coming of age as voters and as students, and they did not like what they saw. The most significant sources of political opposition during Zuma’s reign were embodied in two men who were both half his age, but in most ways, they could not have been more different. (And both would still be campaigning in 2019, as detailed in chapter 1.) First, there was young Julius Malema, who turned thirty-three prior to the 2014 election and was initially strongly favored by Zuma. The ANC had long recognized the political significance of young people, even before they demonstrated their revolutionary potential in the Soweto uprising. Malema’s supporters could liken him to a radical political leader, like Steve Biko, who on principled grounds challenged the ANC for taking its focus away from the needs of Black people. Alongside his working-class credentials, Malema also received multiple degrees, including in philosophy, and studied for an advanced degree at Wits (the University of the Witwatersrand, pronounced “Vits”), where he helped to politicize fellow students. From scratch, he built a new political party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a self-described “radical and militant economic emancipation movement.”44 Malema keenly used the symbolism of class identity, including the wearing of red hardhats and jumpsuits, to attract a loyal following.45 The EFF has rejected the racially inclusive approach of the ANC, moving from a discourse of “reconciliation” to one of “justice,” and brought ideas like expropriation of land and mines, without compensation, into the mainstream dialogue.46 Second, there was Mmusi Maimane, born in Krugersdorp, raised in the nearby Dobsonville section of Soweto, the product of a Xhosa-Tswana marriage, and ordained as a pastor. In May 2014, Maimane was elected to lead the DA’s parliamentary representation, and in 2015 he defeated Wilmot James (a Coloured academic who had led IDASA while I was an intern there) to become their new leader. For the first time, a Black African took the helm of a party that had previously relied disproportionately on the votes of Whites and Coloureds. It remained to be seen whether the party’s momentum could continue. Both Malema and Maimane relentlessly targeted Zuma for his corruption and bad policies in the run-up to the 2014 national elections. Undoubtedly, many ordinary ANC voters held their noses when they ticked their choices. It did turn out to be the ANC’s worst performance to date. Nonetheless, the party enjoyed a comfortable win with 62.1 percent of all votes. The DA took over 22 percent of the vote, and the EFF, just a year old, earned a remarkable 6.4 percent as third-place finisher, delivering 25 seats to the upstart party, which would afford a prominent and vocal platform for their policies. For now, the ANC and Jacob Zuma were here to stay. However, the everyday problems facing citizens were significant, public sentiment was growing foul, and protests mounted. In 2015, over 60 percent of Gauteng residents said they thought the country was going in the wrong direction.47 And in Parliament in May 2016, Maimane and other opposition party leaders would press and embarrass Zuma in angry exchanges concerning the details of his relationship with the Guptas.48 In this context, in August 2016, South Africans visited the voting booths once again, now to cast ballots to decide local elections. The contest turned out to be a watershed. To begin with, it boasted the highest turnout yet recorded for a local election, alongside an increased voter’s roll from 23 million in 2011 to 26 million in 2016.49 In many parts of the country, that August 3 election was a complete drubbing for the ANC, at least relative to how they had performed in all the previous elections. The party lost political control of several of the largest and most important municipalities, including Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay—the latter centered in Port Elizabeth, a traditional ANC stronghold.50 It still received almost 54 percent of all votes cast nationwide, but that was a huge setback, and the message was clear: the days of ANC “hegemony” were over. Nationwide, the DA increased its take of the vote to 27 percent and despite never having competed in a previous local election, the EFF received over 8 percent. The pushback was a largely urban phenomenon. The ANC failed to secure a majority in five of eight major municipalities (previously it had solidly controlled seven of the eight). This meant it would be in majority power in just three of the biggest cities and in coalition in two others. For South Africa’s increasingly urbanized, cosmopolitan, and multiracial middle class, Zuma was an embarrassment and an affront to the modernizing project they were advancing.51 While Gauteng was installing a high-speed train to move arriving passengers from Oliver Tambo International Airport to Johannesburg and Pretoria, Zuma would be photographed in traditional African regalia. The print media, including foreign media, made reference to his multiple wives,52 a not-so-subtle reminder that he was a traditional polygamist. It’s not as though the ANC lost all their voters in the urban areas. Rather, it was just enough to be consequential for who would govern. And as this was a local election, Zuma was not even on the ballot. To a large degree, all South African elections are referenda on the combined spheres of government and speak to voters’ views of the party in power. The opposition parties persisted in their drive to capture vote share. In August 2017, the DA advanced a motion of “no confidence” in the president, and a secret ballot freed up several ANC members to vote against Zuma in Parliament. This reflected splits within the ANC that had been festering since Mbeki’s presidency, but Zuma’s loss of popular support surely boosted the strength of his ANC rivals. While the motion did not pass, based on the vote count, at least 30 percent of the ANC MPs must have supported it, a telling sign in a country where the ANC had previously maintained strong party discipline.53 When it came time to select the future ANC leadership, the party’s elites had to decide whether to support Zuma’s ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, for more of the same. Zuma was not attempting a play at a third term, but returning another Zuma to the top of the ballot would have spoken volumes about the collective deafness of party insiders to the broader electorate. It was a hard-fought internal battle between rival sections of the ANC. At the December 2017 ANC convention, Ramaphosa—who had been serving as deputy president but in an increasingly strained relationship with Zuma—was selected as the next leader by a slim margin. Under consistent fire, in February 2018, Jacob Zuma finally resigned from office, and Ramaphosa moved into the presidency, turning the page on a dark chapter.54 This is how he became the “incumbent” running in the 2019 election. Closer to the People Analogous questions of politics and accountability have loomed large in local municipalities like Mogale City. By design, local governments were intended to bring democracy “closer to the people” with the notion that citizens would have more direct voice in government, especially through contact with their elected government leaders. As at the national level, several patterns have gnawed at democratic ideals, including the use of violence in politics and a degree of manipulation of political rules toward the end of securing political power. And perhaps quite understandably, these problems have weighed heavily on the attitudes and perceptions of ordinary citizens who are inundated with information about the failings of their government. I wondered whether I would wind up finding a story in Mogale City that was reminiscent of the national scandals documented above or local exposés that have become well-known on South African bookshelves. Yes, there was Bosasa, the Krugersdorp-based company implicated in large-scale national malfeasance. But what about in local government? When I pushed councillors, journalists, and citizens for clear examples of corruption in the form of stealing, they couldn’t come up with any. I didn’t see big luxury cars in the council parking lot, though I was told that at least one councillor maintained an expensive Harley Davidson motorcycle. I heard suspicions of favoritism in the awarding of some local government contracts and read reports of irregularities in processes relative to stated procedures, but I never found any smoking guns in terms of large-scale instances of government fraud. When I pushed for specifics, critics of the local ANC government mostly described bad policies and implementation, inequality, and incompetence. According to the critics, the local government operated with a bloated head count even while being unable to pay certain bulk service providers for the municipality’s access to water or electricity. These are quite fair and important concerns, nothing to celebrate. But this was not massive “state capture” at the local level or an epidemic of greed. Admittedly, the fact that I did not uncover massive fraud in government should not be taken as dispositive. Unlike other academic researchers, journalists, and disillusioned government employees who were embedded in local governments—as was the case in the examples cited above, including those documented in How to Steal a City—I always conducted my research as an outsider, and perhaps potential whistleblowers didn’t trust me to share their stories. Some DA councillors said they were fairly certain that evidence of corruption would eventually rear its head because there were simply too many irregularities in the government accounts to believe otherwise. But speculation is not evidence. Moreover, Mogale has had—at least for certain periods—a comparatively strong record on governance. In a rare nod, the Krugersdorp News reported in 2015, “Auditor General Applauds Mogale City,”55 detailing the fact that the municipality had received a clean audit. The regulator announced, “We are impressed highly by the level of governance in Mogale City and hope that we would be able to learn from the way this municipality has done its work.” And while a skeptic might worry that a government organization is likely to sugarcoat, the Auditor General’s reputation is very strong, and its reports have been generally extremely critical of local governments. In fact, the office titled its 2018–19 report on local government performance “Not Much to Go Around, Yet Not the Right Hands at the Till”; in the introduction it leveled a blanket condemnation of poor financial management for most municipalities.56 Nonetheless, even in that report, the office singled out Mogale City as one of two (out of a total of eight) Gauteng Province municipalities for being proactive and upgrading their financial oversight in line with best practices. Based on these reports, Mogale emerges as one of the better-governed of South Africa’s more than 200 local municipalities, but you would never know it from talking with most residents. In 2017, overwhelmingly, 86 percent of Mogale residents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “Corruption is the main threat to our democracy”—the level of agreement was almost identical to that of residents in all other Gauteng municipalities. Overall, sentiment about the municipality was lukewarm: about 29 percent said they were dissatisfied and another 12 percent very dissatisfied with local government.57 Even the Auditor General’s reports made clear that there was lots of room for improvement, but my larger point is that throughout South Africa, there are important success stories, including in local government, and yet those are rarely acknowledged or internalized. For example, one academic study by South Africa–based scholars simply declared that South African decentralization has failed with almost no recognition of within-country variation, appreciation of constraints, or reference to analogous attempts.58 Bare-Knuckled Competition Especially after 2004, Mogale residents, like millions of citizens across the country, increasingly engaged in some form of protest. (In 2013, just over 2 percent of Mogale residents reported taking part in a protest but that grew to over 8 percent in 2017–18.)59 And like protests in other democracies, these have manifested in a mix of constructive and destructive forms. Sometimes, they offer a unique opportunity for ordinary citizens to have their collective voices heard when it appears that their elected leaders and various elite intermediaries seem oblivious to their wants and needs. Other times, they provide opportunities to play out vendettas, advance agendas for career advancement, and may cause collateral damage in terms of human harm and property destruction. In a 2011 state of the city address, Mogale mayor Koketso Calvin Seerane couldn’t help but recognize that such service delivery protests were an indicator of citizens’ discontent and needed to be addressed by the government.60 Many citizens expected more than they were getting, and many returned to the streets in the manner of protest politics born of the Apartheid days. By the end of the first twenty years of South Africa’s democracy, the country would be forced to embrace the dishonorable label, “The Protest Capital of the World.”61 Concentrated largely in urban areas, in townships like Kagiso and Munsieville, such protests are usually referred to in quotation marks—that is, as “service delivery protests”—because they are largely, but not entirely, and certainly not always, directly motivated by concerns about basic service delivery, in the sense of water, electricity, sanitation, or housing. As they have come to encompass a broader range of demands and grievances, other observers have used the more apt label of community protest.62 For the most part, the protests are directed at local governments. And as several South African analysts note, citizens have used both ballots and “bricks”—a euphemism for the sometimes destructive quality of the protests—to keep politicians on their toes.63 For example, in 2014, unhappy, landless residents from a rural area in the northern part of Mogale City took to the streets and blocked an important thoroughfare, demanding title to land that would allow them to build their own houses. In July 2015, residents of an informal settlement in Muldersdrift, protesting about service delivery issues, burned garbage and blocked a route into Krugersdorp with rocks and trees. They highlighted that they still had just two water taps for almost twelve thousand people and no flush toilets, and that the settlement was on a swamp, which caused beds and personal belongings to frequently get wet.

Alongside news of national scandals, the monumental 2016 local election was held. As happened in several other municipalities, the ANC took a devastating hit in Mogale City. The party fell just short of a majority with 48.9 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, the largely White but increasingly multiracial DA came in a strong second with 34.9 percent. And the EFF took a significant 11.6 percent. And under the PR system, parties with even less support wound up with seats, making them politically important in a close election: the right-wing, largely Afrikaner Freedom Front Plus (FF+)—which took in less than 1 percent of the vote nationally in 2014—got 2.2 percent and 2 seats in Mogale; and the Zulu-based IFP received less than 1 percent of the vote, but it was enough for a single seat on the council. Every seat would matter. With such vote tallies, the ANC wound up just one seat short (38 of 77) of the majority required to vote in its own mayor at the first sitting of the local councillors less than two weeks after the polls closed. A coalition was needed to form a government, and national-level negotiations ultimately determined the political fate of Mogale City: the four opposition parties agreed to band together to kick the ANC out of power. That meant agreeing on who the councillors from these different parties would vote for when asked to select a mayor from among their ranks. Without too much fuss, they cast 39 votes for Lynn Pannall, from the DA, an older White woman with over a decade of experience as a councillor. It’s hard to know who was more shocked: the White Krugersdorpers who watched a Black mayor take charge more than twenty years earlier or these ANC councillors who looked on—“gobsmacked”64—as a White woman became mayor in a municipality that was comprised of more than 75 percent Black voters. Despite the high energy and higher hopes the coalition partners envisioned in their unseating of the ANC, coalition government itself proved extremely difficult, particularly with a bureaucracy now filled with ANC supporters (a reverse of the early post-Apartheid years when ANC political leaders at various levels of government would face seas of Afrikaner bureaucrats). The only thing these parties really shared was a disdain for the ANC. When it came to the priorities of the community, the parties represented distinct constituencies and promoted very different party platforms. For example, the DA was resolutely pro-market, while the EFF called for massive land redistribution. Style-wise, they were oil and water. Less than four months into her mayoral term, Mayor Pannall declared that she was exhausted and in need of medical leave and that she would resign her post just about immediately. (The work of a South African councillor must be one of the most stressful jobs out there; according to my own survey of councillors in 2016, a full 45 percent said they feared violence against them because of their work, a fear that is well-founded given the reality of violence they often face at the hands of rivals and disgruntled constituents.)65 To replace her, the DA put forward Michael Holenstein, a younger, entrepreneurial man, originally from Switzerland. And in short order, he became the second White mayor of the largely Black Mogale City Local Municipality in the post-Apartheid era. Holenstein explained to me that as mayor, he tried to clean house in the administration. Whereas Pannall had indicated a willingness to work with bureaucrats who had long served under the ANC, Holenstein said that he couldn’t get anything done, they were overpaying staff, and there was no clear organization or reporting structures in the administration. He tried to reorganize and to restructure the bureaucracy. Not surprisingly, the ANC did not see Holenstein in a particularly positive light, let alone the fact that they could not stand the notion of being out of power. Holenstein recalled trying to have community meetings and ANC supporters would dance and shout to interrupt him. Within six months, the ANC tabled a motion of no confidence, charging political interference in the administration and that he had put the municipality in a poor financial situation owing to bad policy leadership.66 Theoretically, the DA should have succeeded in rebuffing the motion with a simple majority. Officially, the coalition still stood. But when the ballots were counted, it passed with 39 votes. And when the council voted for mayor—a process that Holenstein decried because contrary to the rules of order, there was a secret vote, and despite being a candidate, the Speaker presided—now the ANC’s Lipudi came out on top.67 Someone—perhaps as many as three councillors—had turned their backs on the coalition. The ANC had clearly persuaded at least one councillor from a rival party to vote for them and insisted on a secret ballot, which would allow the defector to proceed anonymously. When I interviewed them about the unexpected transition, Mayor Lipudi as well as the new Speaker, Noluthando Mangole, recounted the episode in matter-of-fact terms, smiling. There was clearly a part of the story they would not share: how they persuaded a councillor from another party to vote for ANC leaders and who that person was. Mangole said it was justified that the ANC should be in power as they won the most votes: “We don’t have a party that is called coalition in the elections.” Of course, that was beside the point under the prevailing electoral rules for local government. FIGURE 6.2. Mogale City mayor Patrick Lipudi in his office, June 28, 2019. Lipudi passed away from a short illness (details unknown) in January 2020. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The DA was not happy. It implemented a lie detector test within its ranks. One councillor refused to take the test and offered his resignation instead while maintaining that he had not defected in the vote.68 In interviews, several councillors told me they believed the resigning councillor was the defector. They said he was unhappy to not have had a higher position in the local party and had been demoted from the mayoral committee. In turn, at least for a few months, the DA and the other opposition parties played their own game of “make-the-municipality-ungovernable,” and they boycotted the council sitting, making it impossible for the ANC, by council rules, to pass its budget. A DA provincial leader explained, “They have demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to get back into power in Mogale City so they can merely further their corruption. The DA will not stop fighting for the change that the people of Mogale City called for. We, along with our partners, will not simply sit back and let the ANC further plunder municipal resources.”69 The situation got ugly. At the end of August, a raucous council meeting involved a fistfight between EFF supporters and the local security agency sitting in the council gallery, spurned by frustrations around the fragile coalition.70 Meanwhile, street protests and revolts continued. In response, the local government sometimes used force to protect property rights or to quell disobedience.71 In particular, when protests involve squatters or land invasions, the municipality has frequently sent in the Red Ants,72 an infamous private security company that specializes in removing invaders.73 Their tactics remind many of the Apartheid days when the National Party government would infamously bulldoze the homes of Black residents living in White areas, arguing that the dwellings were in contravention of Apartheid law. On the eastern side of Mogale City, a growing informal settlement, adjacent to the thriving and luxurious Cradlestone Mall, stood in the way of further development plans for the owner, ABSA Bank. ABSA coordinated with the municipality to bring in the Red Ants to solve their problem in December 2018. At a cost of over 2 million rand, they moved the squatters to another spot in Muldersdrift, breeding more anger and frustration among residents.74 But Also Accountability In the wake of headline-catching problems and pathologies, the brief democratic history in Mogale—and across many of the urban and near-urban municipalities in South Africa—also reveals some important gains in terms of empowering citizens. Some of this I’ve observed directly, while other gains are only detectable by studying patterns in available data. To begin with, while the 2016 election in Mogale did not bring about lasting change in the composition of government, the hard-fought political battle was certainly evidence of growing electoral competition, which in turn seems to be key for political responsiveness in South Africa and elsewhere. Given the electoral cycle, such that no more than three years goes by without either a local or national/provincial election, there is never a time when a contest is both too far in the future or such a distant memory that any aspiring leader can rest on their laurels. In turn, councillors are well aware that their fortunes can always turn and that they depend on the support of the governed. Politicians say they are compelled to show up in various neighborhoods, to hear complaints, and to respond to them. One could say that talk is cheap, but there is good reason to believe that responsiveness impacts politicians’ careers. For example, Philip Martin, Nina McMurry, and I studied the renominations of elected councillors in Gauteng and around the country and examined whether the leading political parties simply deployed “loyal cadres” to valued local councillor positions or were willing to remove councillors who had lost the faith of citizens. Analyzing the career trajectories of over eight thousand councillors, we found that in areas where political competition was high, the leading parties (the ANC and the DA) were much more likely to end the careers of those who had failed to satisfy their constituents (as measured by responses to surveys). Those who were well regarded by citizens tended to be renominated or promoted. By contrast, in noncompetitive areas, party choices appeared uncorrelated with what citizens said about the quality of services or their own councillor.75 And while citizens may be angered by a lot of what they see, they are nonetheless extremely engaged not simply via protest but in the very institutions designed to channel links between voters and their representatives. In my Historical Memories Survey of Mogale residents who would have been eligible to vote in 1994, almost all Black residents reported having voted in all 5 national elections (average of 4.9 elections) including the 2014 election. For Whites, the average is somewhat lower at 4.7 (although a small share of the sample, those who didn’t vote in 1994, reported having voted much less frequently than those who did).76 Moreover, 41 percent of Mogale residents said they had participated in ward meetings and 41 percent in street committee or residents’ meetings, all of which reflect very high levels of community engagement.77 Despite the common refrain I heard that there is no effective opposition in South Africa, I found several instances of individuals and parties holding the government to account. For example, when I met with Juliana Steyn—the Afrikaner soldier who had to sing “Nkosi” the day of the first election and who in 2019 worked for a government agency—she explained to me that when the opposition parties ask questions in national parliament on designated days, people like her are forced to respond quickly with data and analysis so the relevant government official can provide coherent and factual responses. Such “fire drills” may distract employees from their immediate work, but they also serve an important accountability mechanism given a general fear of embarrassment at all levels. When I visited Mogale local council meetings I repeatedly saw that opposition questions and challenges were often met with resentful glares and words from ANC officeholders, but nonetheless, the engagement provoked research and responses. Relatedly, the Krugersdorp News publishes stories and pointed letters, which are read by many of the municipality’s top political leaders and, in turn, they frequently feel compelled to reply and to defend their positions. Indeed, several said as much to me. Moreover, White Krugersdorpers have largely chosen to engage the democratic system rather than exit it altogether, as one might have predicted in the early 1990s. Even the cultural autonomists in the FF+ who remain very interested in the prospects of developing a separate homeland, or Volkstaat, actively participate in local politics: Whites have found representation in political parties, campaigned, held office, and channeled their frustrations with ballots, not the bullets some extremists had threatened to use prior to Mandela’s inauguration. Perhaps this is not surprising, as Whites do still overwhelmingly constitute the local tax base, and they want to have some oversight regarding how money is spent. Yet, their willingness to scrutinize budgets and to highlight inconsistencies almost surely keeps government officials on their toes in a way that would not be true in their absence. It is also worth highlighting the challenging and important role that ward councillors play, especially in lower-income neighborhoods and townships. These are South Africa’s only directly elected leaders, and for many, this is a tough job. Each councillor represents a constituency of about ten thousand people, and their home address and mobile phone number are known to all. And their phone must be switched on for most of the day. They are regularly called on by their constituents for every type of problem, sometimes way beyond the scope of their legal mandates—including marital and neighborly disputes. I interviewed several ward councillors in Mogale City, and dozens around the country, and many proudly showed me their extensive WhatsApp chats, containing endlessly long back-and-forths with constituents, replete with lists of questions and needs and the responses they provided. Particularly for Black constituents whose families did not benefit from generations of obtaining access to government services, councillors serve as important intermediaries in helping them attain basic documents like proof of residence or ensuring that an ambulance arrives when they need medical care. Ward councillors vary widely in terms of their efforts and how they are received by their communities. But the logic of electoral competition in competitive wards incentivizes responsiveness toward these needs as such outreach seems to affect citizen perceptions and, in turn, party and voter decisions about whether to keep incumbents in place.78 And because these councillors generally live within the communities they serve, citizens hold them accountable through everyday interactions, what one scholar aptly labeled, in a different context, “dignified public expression.”79 Of course, not all are successful—many are downright derelict in their duties—but for those regarded as effective, citizens report that the key traits are demonstration of efforts to attain access to public services and simply being available to listen to their needs.80 Tshepo Nzwane—who came to be a local councillor after a childhood in which he bombed the local school—said that one hundred to two hundred people show up at each of his community meetings. For millions of people who never had a say in government, their votes and opinions are very meaningful with respect to whether that individual keeps their job, and they have the opportunity to inform and be informed by that representative on a regular basis. Much of this is the mundane stuff of everyday democratic government. Still, this is what past generations understandably wished for. Comparative Perspectives: From Laggard to Leader Democratic “success” is a matter of perspective and requires a field of vision that spans both time and space. The notion that South Africa became a relatively robust liberal democracy during the post-Apartheid era might be difficult to see when buried beneath many quotidian realities. As such, it’s important to consider some of the failures and accomplishments in governance in a more comparative perspective. First let’s consider the worries that a single party, the ANC, would dominate politics so thoroughly that South Africa would become like the Mexican one-party state under the PRI. In practice, between 1994 and 2016, citizens went to the polls five times to vote in national and provincial elections, and five additional times for local government elections. The elections have been certified time and again without major instances of vote rigging, ballot-box stuffing, voter intimidation, or the like. Looking back now, we know that South Africa did not become a one-party state. It is true that, as shown in figure 6.3, the ANC received the majority of all votes cast in every electoral contest, and gains in 1999 and 2004 contributed to a sense at the time that South Africa was well on its way to single-party domination.81 But the trends have not moved toward a monopolization of political power. In fact, just the opposite has happened. By the time of the 2019 election, an ANC victory was clearly not a foregone conclusion. Not only has South Africa avoided the problem of “three-termism,”82 no president has served even two full terms. Even when the ANC managed to achieve a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament,83 the party did not use this as an occasion to rewrite the constitution in a manner that would radically tilt the rules in its own favor or to the benefit of its main constituents. While the majority of all constitutional amendments (13 of 17) were implemented from 1999 to 2009, most addressed questions of boundary management and between-election party-switching among elected leaders. To a degree, these may have been designed with ANC interests in mind regarding political control and centralization of power, but they were minor tweaks and, as we know now, certainly did not manage to stem the tide of ANC political losses in subsequent years. FIGURE 6.3. ANC vote share, elections 1994–2016. Source: Author analysis of IEC data. Relatedly, there were and continue to be grave concerns about corruption in South Africa. Throughout history, public officials, entrusted to work on behalf of society, have frequently used their powers and influence to secure private gains for themselves and for their families. Corrupt practices were problematic in the early days of the (White) South African Republic and in the postcolonial Nigerian state. As the German sociologist Max Weber documented with respect to India in the early Middle Ages, government officeholders used their positions expressly to secure benefits for themselves.84 Corruption was notoriously prevalent in various American cities, it has been a problem in Asian success stories, including Japan and China, and it has been at the root of many failures in African governance. The Scandinavian countries and a few others seem to have escaped major corruption problems, but not most. Corruption is highly prevalent in much of Africa, and one compelling explanation for such practice in post-Apartheid South Africa and in other parts of the continent is the theory of the Nigerian political scientist Peter Ekeh. He presciently argued with respect to his own country that following generations of rule under an illegitimate colonial state, many postcolonial bureaucrats felt more compelled to deliver directly to their immediate kinship networks than to serve the broad mandates of what had long been an illegitimate state, designed to plunder.85 When viewed in comparative perspective, the extent of South African corruption, including increases in corruption, does not appear as extreme as South African commentators frequently portray. As a starting point, a substantial amount of government behavior that would be labeled as corruption today was rife under Apartheid. (And that is separate from the fact that the system itself was founded on a wildly unjust proposition, so the degree of bureaucratic “integrity” within such a system is not much to celebrate.) One carefully documented study revealed that the White-run state routinely engaged in corrupt arms and oil deals in order to subvert sanctions.86 The fact that foreign governments and arms corporations would wind up engaged with the ANC in similar practices may say more about the period before democracy than about the recent past. Moreover, on most international comparative scales (based primarily on expert opinion), South Africa still upholds higher levels of government integrity than most. In the 2019 Transparency International rating of 180 countries, South Africa ranked seventieth (least corrupt), tied with Hungary and Romania, above China and India, and fifth among continental countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, knowing a country’s GDP per capita in 1990 predicts two-thirds of the variation in country corruption scores in 2019, and on that basis alone, South Africa’s corruption score is almost perfectly predicted.87 While this may not be much consolation for South African citizens whose public resources are pilfered, it does suggest that the extent of South African corruption may not be as remarkable as sometimes argued. It’s also important to consider the problems of crime and violence, prominent realities in Mogale City and throughout South Africa. Most South Africans identify these as serious concerns, and the scars of violent confrontations are plain to see. As with corruption, we can expect a degree of violence in all societies, but the question is, how much is there, and to what extent does it undermine the democratic project itself? In fact, the very point of democracy is to resolve questions of leadership selection and other conflicts without violence.88 Once again, post-Apartheid South Africa is very much a product of its past. As I discussed in chapter 4, we cannot lost sight of the fact that Krugersdorp itself was born as a violent town and the Union of South Africa was forged out of extraordinarily violent conflict in its original incarnation in the early part of the twentieth century. The institutionalization of White supremacy was a violent process89 that was eventually met with several decades of violent resistance, culminating in civil war. Half-hearted attempts to introduce Black local government under Apartheid government provoked further cycles of violence. For example, on September 3, 1984—“Bloody Monday”—Black township residents throughout the West Rand protested against service fee increases and the perceived illegitimacy of local councillors, resulting in four killed, events followed by increased state repression and mushrooming body counts.90 Combining such history with the country’s vast inequality, it is hardly surprising that violence has persisted in the post-Apartheid era. The prevalence of violence is not at all unique to South Africa’s democracy. In many countries of the Global South—including India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines—it is a routine aspect of political life. Along these lines, one analyst proposed the new label of “violent democracy”91 for South Africa, applicable to these other countries as well. In related research and analysis, observers have highlighted the ways in which inequalities of wealth and power frequently result in violent conflict. Claims made concerning violations of public trust around corruption are sometimes themselves the result of frustrated actors who have found themselves shut out of patronage links.92 Particularly disturbing is the extent of violence involved in the struggle to obtain and to maintain positions in local government councils. Between the start of 2016 and September 2018, approximately ninety politicians were killed in the context of turf battles, struggles for office, and reprisals, including against those who acted as whistleblowers in exposing government corruption.93 To recognize that such violence has strong historical and comparative precedents does not imply that it is tolerable. Whether in South Africa or elsewhere, there may be a tipping point at which we can no longer describe these countries as being governed by ballots but rather by bullets. It is hard to say exactly how to draw that line, but for all the violence that finds a home in contemporary South Africa, it is still not the basis for most leadership selections or policymaking. Violence in South Africa and many other countries can still be understood as awful by-products of still incomplete democratic development. And even wealthy and long-standing democracies like the United States remain vulnerable to violent conflict in political life. Moreover, we should not lose sight of the big picture—that democratic institutions appear to have been central in solving the problem of existential crisis, putting an end to civil war, and lowering the amount of measured political violence in South Africa. For example, based on a systematic coding of social conflicts across the African continent, more than 12,000 deaths resulted from various social conflicts in South Africa between the start of 1990 and April 24, 1994 (preelection). By contrast, for the much longer period after the 1994 election until the end of 2017, the number from such causes was less than 2,500. South Africa went from being the deadliest place on the continent in terms of such conflict-related fatalities to being completely unremarkable in comparative terms.94 While there are important examples of the post-Apartheid government using deadly force against striking workers and protesters, these are still a rarity and the state no longer routinely kills and tortures people to advance its agenda. In fact, a serious mismatch between trends in crime, including violent crime (which has largely gone down), and perceptions and fears of crime and violence (which continue to go up) during the post-Apartheid period perhaps unfairly contributes to concerns about the quality of democracy. For example, the homicide rate in South Africa has fallen dramatically since 1994. Notwithstanding some uptick in recent years, the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people dropped from 63 in 1994 to 35.7 in 2017,95 and yet, I am quite sure you would never learn this from talking to ordinary South Africans in Mogale or almost anywhere else. Two different studies, one for the period 1998–200396 and another that extends to 2016–17,97 both highlight that even with corroborated data revealing either stabilization or decline in crime rates, citizens report feeling more unsafe. Part of the problem may be that even with some reductions, overall South African levels are very high, and it is this persistence that shapes attitudes. Or it might be widespread discussion in the media or social media and/or particular crimes that most affect citizen perceptions. In any case, the notion that during the democratic era things have begun to “spin out of control” simply does not accord with reality in the country. FIGURE 6.4. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. Finally, I want to point out that democratic practice itself has been remarkably successful when seen in comparative terms. For example, based on metrics from the Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) project, and with respect to their Electoral Democracy and slightly more demanding Liberal Democracy indexes, looking back again to the 1980s, South Africa was truly a global laggard in the practice of liberal democracy, ranking 113th out of 169, just above Uzbekistan. But it propelled itself into the top 50 in global rankings in the early 1990s, making one of the biggest jumps worldwide. South Africa’s democratization path is clearly demonstrated in figures 6.4 and 6.5, which depict the V-DEM Democracy scores relative to other Upper-middle-income and other African countries. FIGURE 6.5. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other African countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. And frankly, when considering just about every dimension measured with respect to democratic process—an open media environment that allows for the free circulation of information, including a free press that actively attempts to monitor government practice; freedom for civil society (organizations of people independent from the state); and a judiciary that can similarly act independently of the government and can rebuke practices that contravene the fundamental laws of the land, as established in the constitution—South Africa performs extremely well in comparative perspective.98 On several dimensions, the expert coders report some decline in democratic performance after 2012, no doubt owing to many of the scandals during the Zuma presidency. Nonetheless, relative to the democratic retreat in many other countries, including in Africa, South Africa’s decline was modest and the country mostly held steady in the eyes of observers with a broad comparative framework in mind. Recalling the location of a key set of goalposts, the Freedom Charter offered a set of ideals for a political future, including the idea that multiracial democracy should be understood not simply as a means to an end but an end in itself. And on such scores, given the historical record just presented, the shift from “unfreedom” to “freedom” in the political arena was absolutely profound in South Africa. Many will quite reasonably retort, “You can’t eat freedom.” Which is why it’s also important to consider post-Apartheid trends in material prosperity, the subject of the next chapter.",

A group of prominent South African scholars commissioned a collection of essays investigating how democracy had gone awry in other parts of the world. For example, they wondered if South Africa might soon resemble Mexico, where a liberation party managed to secure political control for over seventy years and engaged in wanton corruption to the detriment of the economy and society.1 After only one election, historians and social scientists were already classifying the ANC as a “dominant party” and suggesting that their own country might be incapable of becoming a liberal democracy. Maybe it was unfair and overly cynical to be worrying about such outcomes this early in the post-Apartheid history. And yet, considering the size of the ANC majority, and the precedents of other liberation leaders and parties becoming autocratic in other parts of the world, it was a plausible concern. If one party got a firm grip on power, would ordinary citizens have any chance of holding politicians accountable? Fast forward to the 2019 election. If I had shared these early predictions with the voters I encountered all around Mogale City, many would have concluded that these skeptics had been soothsayers. During the two decades from the twilight of Mandela’s presidency until the 2019 elections, the once conventional wisdom that the country had emerged as a democratic “miracle” faded into a distant memory. In its place, the airwaves, headlines, and bookstores shared ongoing sagas of government corruption and failed projects. For millions of South African citizens, corruption indeed emerged as the existential problem, and a dominant ANC was to blame. Several important books documented the illicit practices of government officials at all levels with titles such as Licence to Loot, How to Steal a City, and Anatomy of the ANC in Power.2 The latter two describe the precipitous downfall of the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, the metropolitan municipality centered in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape Province. The various authors painted depressing portraits of the undoing of a high-minded, ideologically driven liberation party and the spreading rot of malfeasance in the daily operations of government. It is worth noting, however, that Stephan Hofstatter (author of Licence to Loot) would later be dismissed from the Sunday Times for false reporting and was confronted at a book launch by angry government officials accusing him of misrepresentations.3 Through such books, as well as from print and broadcast news, everyday conversations, and social media, citizens became aware that more than a few politicians were concocting elaborate schemes to divert government resources into their own pockets, while millions of people remained poor, out of work, and without reliable access to basic services. In the weeks and months leading up to the 2019 elections, even ANC supporters and local councillors in Mogale City—including the ANC mayor, Patrick Lipudi—shared with me their awareness of and concerns about the problem of corruption within ANC ranks. The opposition described the ANC as almost uniformly crooked. In 2015, the majority of South Africans said they perceived substantial corruption in all levels of government; over 63 percent said that the level had “increased a lot” in the previous year.4 In fact, when I mentioned to various South Africans in 2019 that I was writing a book about post-Apartheid South Africa, they essentially responded, “Oh, so a book about the corrupt ANC?” Meanwhile, citizens were increasingly resorting to protest in a manner reminiscent of the anti-Apartheid days. Many protests turned destructive and violent, and at least as worrying, on a few occasions, the national government and various local governments used violence against protesting and striking citizens. The prevalence of such well-documented political pathologies begs the question: How could I possibly describe South Africa’s democracy as a “success story” if all of this was going on? It’s a fair question. Democratic practice in Mogale City and throughout South Africa during this period has indeed been uneven, maybe even downright ugly. Many chapters of this history would not find their way into a textbook of civic best practices. Corruption and violence can seem almost routine in some pockets of the country. Nonetheless, democratic politics has operated in a manner that has been increasingly competitive, with substantial opportunities for citizen engagement and oversight from various guardrails within society. Politicians are frequently held accountable for unethical behavior, undesirable policies, or simply being perceived as not doing a good job. While many might have hoped for or even expected a government in which all public servants operated with complete integrity, and that all disputes would be resolved through deliberative debate, such outcomes were highly unlikely given the country’s political history, let alone the record of other countries that have undergone major regime changes like South Africa’s. In fact, many of the wealthiest and oldest democracies still struggle with such problems to varying degrees. This clearly includes the United States, especially of recent vintage. In this chapter, I offer evidence of democratic accountability at work—even in the face of substantial challenges and contradictions—in three steps. First, I review some of the most important ways in which democratic institutions constrained the two longest-serving presidents amid all of their deficiencies. Second, I describe democratic accountability at the local level, especially in Mogale City, again while still acknowledging many of its very real problems. And third, I detail some of the South African patterns of democratic performance and accountability and the extent of corruption and violence in a broader and comparative perspective. To hear South African commentators describe their country’s failures at democratic governance, one might think that theirs was a failed state. In fact, in 2015, more than one-third of surveyed Gauteng residents said it was a failed state.5 But if we consider actual failed states—Somalia, Chad, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, or the Democratic Republic of Congo—we recognize the extent of hyperbole in such assessments of South Africa. The reality of South African government is not nearly so apocalyptic. In many ways, it is highly functional. Constraining Power at the Very Top As I discussed in the prior chapter, of the idiosyncrasies that make South Africa unique, a prominent one is Nelson Mandela. The legendary iconoclast gave South Africa many things, but in becoming president, he did not offer a good test for democracy. Mandela embraced his jailers, repeatedly called for calm and forgiveness over revenge, donned the symbols of oppression in a spirit of reconciliation, and chose to leave office after only one term. He revealed that he was no ordinary politician or person. That South Africa could function effectively with him at the helm left it to the imagination whether it was democracy or his demigod-like stature and self-restraint that ordained such success. Most politicians are instead far more mortal. Almost by definition, they are ambitious and crave power—to a greater extent than the average citizen. Many are very public spirited, but certainly not all, and the pressures and temptations of power can induce greed, unscrupulous efforts to remain in office, and inclinations to favor friends and loyalists for jobs and policies rather than the broader interests of the country. One of the key tests for democratic politics is whether the “people” can constrain such tendencies, especially of those at the pinnacle of power, so that the polity does not become hostage to leaders’ wants and needs or to efforts to divert government resources. After Mandela, the ANC bench was still deep with qualified and impressive possibilities, but this lot was decidedly mortal and offered a solid “stress test” for democratic politics. The office of the presidency alternated to four different men between the time of Mandela’s retirement and the 2019 election. But just two—Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma—led for eighteen of those twenty years. Given their personal biographies, either would have been a viable national leader, irrespective of leadership selection rules. During their tenures in office, national politics was dominated by their deeds, their misdeeds, and their own struggles for power. Mbeki was an ANC stalwart. During the years of struggle, he devoted his life to the organization, joining the youth league at the age of fourteen, working in exile, and receiving military training in the Soviet Union; he was based for many years in Lusaka, Zambia. Moreover, his father, Govan Mbeki, was a politicized Fort Hare graduate, an ANC leader, and jailed with Mandela following the Rivonia trial. Despite membership in the South African Communist Party, Mbeki opposed the ANC becoming a party of socialism, citing a desire to remain a “broad church.” This approach served him well for most of his career, allowing him to become the international face of the ANC and to negotiate effectively with White South Africa.6 His appointment to be Mandela’s deputy president in 1994 put him on a clear path to lead the ANC’s party ticket. Mbeki could seem more professorial than a veteran of a militant liberation movement. Not particularly tall or physically imposing, he wore a beard, spoke in measured paces, and routinely exuded the academic prowess of a man with an advanced degree in economics from Sussex University. He put forward many bold ideas, some productive, including positive visions for African regional integration and upliftment. And yet, like other exiles, especially those involved in the military wing, he had no experience being governed from below. Just prior to becoming state president, one commentator noted Mbeki’s penchant for centralizing power in an essay with the headline, “Mbeki: Democrat or Autocrat?”7 Jacob Zuma was also a former exile from the era of resistance politics. Born in KwaZulu-Natal in 1942, he painted a stark contrast to Mbeki. The son of a policeman and a domestic worker,8 his working-class credentials were a large part of his public appeal: “I never went to school, but I educated myself,”9 he proudly proclaimed. Also not particularly tall, but a sturdier figure, with a clean-shaven face and head, Zuma had been active in the military wing of the ANC, served prison time on Robben Island with Mandela, and also had strong ANC credentials, including working with Mbeki for the cause of liberation. Seen by his comrades as a committed cadre, “fearless, loyal, and affable,”10 he rose in the ranks owing to a strong social IQ and effectiveness as an underground operative. Though visibly proud of his Zulu heritage, he was not a cultural autonomist and stood by the ANC throughout its conflicts with the IFP.11 However, Zuma had few close relationships with White South Africans in the manner that Mbeki or Mandela did. Compared with Mbeki, Zuma exuded more energy and less introspection. He was an antidote to Mbeki’s air of elitism in substance and style. Though he served as deputy president under Mbeki, his ascendancy to the top position was shrouded in some doubt in the midst of not simply ongoing corruption investigations but charges of rape. The latter resulted in a very public trial. Although the court declared that the sex was consensual, during the course of the proceedings, it was revealed that Zuma had had unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman, and he famously declared that it was “ok” because he showered afterward, a statement that even the exonerating judge would condemn for its lack of scientific merit. Notwithstanding such sagas, Zuma was elected ANC president in 2007,12 even as many wondered whether he would be South Africa’s populist autocrat. Both men had great ambitions for themselves, and each tried to subvert democratic procedures in various ways during their respective tenures (1999–2008 and 2009–18). But both were also overtly humbled in their presidential careers through the machinations of direct democratic pressures and internal party struggles for power. The various media outlets challenged each man’s record, and they faced steady and well-organized reactions from civil society; their policies and actions were corrected by the courts; and ultimately their own powers were constrained by their party while the party’s power was constrained by voters at the polls. Violations of Public Trust As I will discuss in the next two chapters, many successful policies were enacted and implemented during Mbeki’s and Zuma’s respective terms. Yet, both men violated the public’s trust on various occasions by hiding or participating in illicit schemes and by making self-serving and counterproductive policies and appointments. One policy episode, for which Mbeki became infamous around the globe, was his heterodox approach to the devastating AIDS pandemic, which had been ravaging southern Africa since the late 1980s. He and his chosen health minister refused to embrace the widely held scientific understanding of the role that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plays in sickness and death. He went so far as to argue that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was not caused by a virus.13 He also rejected the use of scientifically proven anti-retroviral drug therapies, depriving the population of their value for prevention and treatment. Mbeki and his chosen group of advisors came to be known as AIDS denialists. Their approach may have cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people viable opportunities to extend their lives.14 It was a stunning blind spot, and Mbeki was relentlessly stubborn. Owing to these retrograde policies, the South African government, once again, became something of a pariah. I was so struck by the extent to which this problem was spiraling out of control and not receiving the response it deserved that it became the focus of my own research for the next several years.15 A second major scandal involved both Mbeki and Zuma; it came to be known simply as the “Arms Deal.” As early as 1998, while Mandela was still president, the government announced its intention to modernize its defense force and that it would procure billions of dollars in heavy equipment. As a start, the initiative was roundly criticized as inappropriate for a country that faced no apparent defense threats. More notably, the companies that wanted to bid on those contracts and their host governments frequently engaged in various forms of bribery to influence the decision makers to throw the highly lucrative business deals their way. ANC officials accepted luxury cars, money, and other perks. The procurement process was repeatedly found to be irregular in the sense that standards for rating certain bids were changed midstream to favor particular firms.16 Although to my knowledge Mbeki has not been directly implicated in any attempts to gain personally from the deals, he was criticized for blocking open investigations.17 Zuma, on the other hand, has been accused of securing various illegal payments while deputy president and was dismissed by Mbeki for corrupt dealings. In both cases, Mbeki’s wrongdoings were matters of process, of subverting open government and transparency and attempting to centralize power and to protect party insiders while potentially scapegoating political rivals. Zuma, by contrast, sought to enrich himself and his family and friends, taking malfeasance to great new heights. In this regard, his presidency was clearly the blight of the post-Apartheid history. The most egregious of such transactions involved an Indian-born family, the Guptas. The Gupta saga is long and now legendary in South Africa. The family came to South Africa from India in the early 1990s in initially modest fashion. Over the decades, they became so enmeshed in the work of South African government that they gave rise to a term now used frequently in everyday dialogue: “state capture.”18 In their quest for political and economic influence, the family provided jobs to Zuma family members and to those of other politicians. (By one estimate, ANC politicians skimmed tens of billions of dollars from public funds.) They enticed complicity through first-class plane tickets, rides on private planes, jobs, money, and other perks. And in turn, the president and other government leaders gave the Guptas access to lucrative government deals and control over the selection of key government positions. Naturally, their favored selections treated them extremely well in all business dealings, allowing the Guptas to become one of the country’s richest families—in a country where the richest families are very rich, by any standard.19 In sometimes wanton fashion, the Guptas gained access to a military base for a private wedding; they used their influence to attain the post of finance minister for a loyal crony; and they earned millions from shady business deals involving government contracts.20 Relatedly, Zuma and others in the ANC engaged in similar types of dealings with the Krugersdorp-based company Bosasa. The company routinely traded perks and kickbacks in return for government contracts and influence. A whistleblower from the company recounted the ways in which the Bosasa CEO was able to control Zuma’s public statements and actions,21 furthering the notion of a state captured by private interests. Finally, on a much smaller scale in financial terms, but symbolically extremely disquieting for South Africans, Zuma spent approximately 7.8 million rand of public money on upgrades to his personal homestead in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal. These included a swimming pool, a cattle pen, and an amphitheater, amenities that were hidden as expenses under the otherwise allowable rubric of “security upgrades.”22 Responses and Repercussions Together, this set of incursions—Mbeki’s AIDS policies, the arms deal, “Gupta-gate,” Bosasa, and Nkandla—left the ANC’s reputation tarnished when it made its case to the voters in 2019. Along with other inevitable scandals and policy failures, they fed critics daily fodder. What does the fact that such betrayals of the public’s trust could unfold over the first quarter century of post-Apartheid government reflect about the quality of democracy? Here, I think much of the answer lies with how citizens and various actors responded to evidence and allegations. And in this regard, the fact that we know so much about these problems and that government officials have not been able to stem the flow of incriminating information reveals a great deal about the success of South Africa’s democracy. To appreciate the openness, it is important to consider the situation in non-democratic regimes, including Zimbabwe under Mugabe, or in countries such as Bahrain, Qatar, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, where there has been very little space for critics to openly challenge and demand consequences for malfeasance. While citizens in these tightly managed authoritarian countries may perceive corruption or hear about it through rumors, or gain access to some international reporting via the internet or satellite news, the absence of effective opposition parties and the immediate threat of repression have implied a completely different landscape for accountability. In South Africa, citizens and civil society have been emboldened to challenge the state and its various leaders by name. For example, several former anti-Apartheid activists banded together to forge new organizations and movements to speak out against Mbeki’s retrograde AIDS policies. In particular, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC)—led by many former anti-Apartheid activists and exiles—emerged as a global leader in the fight for treatment access. They led marches, held press conferences, and built coalitions to criticize the government’s actions. They developed clever slogans and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase “HIV Positive” in order to counter stigma against the disease. The press relentlessly critiqued government policy while political cartoonists and entertainment personalities routinely mocked officials who persisted in denying the well-accepted science around HIV prevention and AIDS treatment. Medical professionals and social scientists spoke out against the government’s policies, as did leaders of various opposition political parties. If the government was trying to silence or repress any of these actors, they did not do a very good job of it. These organizations won their court cases, and the government obeyed, changing course on its HIV policies.23 Relatedly, throughout the post-Apartheid period, the news media—and as amplified on social media—consistently shined a bright light on allegations and evidence of corruption. In fact, rare has been the day when any major news outlet has not reported on the status of some government corruption allegation or another. In at least one case, the response and resulting impact were almost immediate. When Zuma installed a Gupta ally into the office of the finance minister, the business community and the various news organizations went ballistic, as seen in these headlines: “Firing Nene Proves Jacob Zuma Is the Dolt behind the Bolt,”24 “Finance Minister Switch Seen as Another Zuma Clanger,”25 and “Van Rooyen ‘Bad for ANC in Polls.’ ”26 Within days of the appointment, Zuma faced so much backlash, along with a sharp drop in the markets, that he shuffled the crony to a less central position and appointed the trusted and reliable Pravin Gordhan to the job. This episode also demonstrated the business sector’s autonomy and ability to challenge the government even publicly in the face of poor governance practice.27 That said, like other parties in power, the ANC has frequently sought to keep such information out of the public view and certainly has tried to clamp down on unflattering news. As it turned out, a key whistleblower was Andrew Feinstein, the ANC MP I had met in the first month of my yearlong stay in the country in 1997–98. When Feinstein tried to get to the bottom of the arms deal, he met serious resistance. ANC leaders removed him from the parliamentary public accounts committee.28 The more he pressed, the more he was alienated from the party, and in 2001, he resigned from his beloved ANC. He migrated to London and published a popular book, After the Party, detailing this and other scandals that undermined his confidence in the organization.29 The ANC’s treatment of Feinstein is an obvious blemish on its democratic record. For many, the arms deal was a massive fraud plus cover-up, and critics can point to a weak-toothed commission as having done little to redress the wrongdoing. At the very least, in 2001, the ANC’s Chief Whip, Tony Yengeni, and Zuma’s financial advisor were both sentenced to prison. Even after twenty years, the ANC has not been able to bury the case; public protectors and the media continue to elicit allegations and evidence. A new judge condemned a prior ruling that made light of the case and reopened it for additional scrutiny, a welcome development for many of those who challenged the government in the first place.30 Throughout their tenures, both Mbeki and Zuma faced hard-hitting everyday scrutiny in the news media. In 2004, Archbishop Desmond Tutu began to publicly criticize Mbeki and his administration for bad policies, including on AIDS,31 and for Mbeki’s general failure to encourage open discussion and debate within the ANC.32 Following further public exchanges between them, ANC officials tried to defuse the situation by expressing respect for Tutu’s position.33 Tutu continued to criticize Mbeki throughout the remainder of his term, going so far as to publicly state that neither he nor Zuma would be an appropriate pick for the ANC leadership in 2007.34 By 2008, owing to a wide range of factors, including disappointments about economic policy on the part of trade union and SACP leaders,35 Mbeki lost the support of the ANC and was forced to resign. Two years into Zuma’s presidency, Tutu once again raised his voice as national muse, and again, his challenges were covered widely. He captured the growing frustration with the governing liberation party in a particularly alarming manner when he described it as “worse than the Apartheid government.” He quickly qualified this bold charge with, “because at least you were expecting it from the Apartheid government.” Ever the conscience of the country, Tutu cast his ire on Zuma to a greater degree than he did Mbeki: “Hey Mr. Zuma, you and your government don’t represent me. You represent your own interests … I am warning you out of love. I am warning you like I warned the nationalists [National Party Apartheid government] that one day we will start praying for the defeat of the ANC government. You are disgraceful.”36 Tutu was particularly upset with Zuma’s refusal to grant a visa to Tibet’s Dalai Lama, a move that seemed to reflect greater sympathies for an authoritarian Chinese government than the core human rights values enshrined in the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Relatedly, he was fingering the growing sense that Zuma was inclined to flout the rule of law and needed to be held to account. Widely seen as independent, the courts have even held Zuma personally accountable. He was convicted in the highest court for using state money to upgrade Nkandla. In a unanimous judgment, it ruled, “The President has failed to uphold, defend and respect the constitution as the supreme law of the land.” And indeed, the case came to the court in the first place owing to a March 2014 report of the government public protector.37 The court ordered that he respect the earlier report requiring him to repay the government money.38 And indeed, Zuma eventually did pay, taking out a second mortgage to do so.39 Some might say, not enough punishment for what he did. But it’s important to ask: Where else in the world does a president face such consequences while still in power? By April 2017, protest movements increasingly targeted Zuma directly. A popular hashtag, #ZumaMustFall, circulated widely on social media, and South Africans of every race began to hit the streets insisting that he resign.40 Thousands of South Africans returned to protest following yet another cabinet reshuffle that included the dismissal of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The 2017 protests were organized by Save SA—a collaboration of South African activists41 led by both members of the business community and old ANC stalwarts.42 One protester remarked, “I’m an ANC person but we want our old ANC back.”43 The Gupta-related scandals and the arms deal raised the ire of various government bodies charged with protecting the integrity of the government. The public protector, Thuli Madonsela, forced Zuma to appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate, among other things, his own multiple misdeeds. By the time of the 2019 election, the investigators were hard at work gathering evidence, and in several of my interviews with Mogale City political leaders in the run-up to the election, they had the television on, watching how the inquiry was unfolding and might be reverberating for their own political careers. Electoral Implications Given all of the media attention to the growing level of corruption within the country, the big question that remained was whether the general public—that is, voters—would take action. Again, one of the key features of South Africa’s electoral system is that for most contests, citizens vote for parties, not candidates, which meant that ANC supporters who opposed Zuma could not directly punish him without casting a vote for a less-preferred party. As the 2014 national and provincial election approached, Zuma’s documented bad behavior and various problems in the country amounted to blood in the water for rival political sharks. Political challenges mounted from both the right and the left, from White and Black. Importantly, a generational divide began to split the political arena, as those born in the early 1990s who had never lived under Apartheid—“Born Frees”—were coming of age as voters and as students, and they did not like what they saw. The most significant sources of political opposition during Zuma’s reign were embodied in two men who were both half his age, but in most ways, they could not have been more different. (And both would still be campaigning in 2019, as detailed in chapter 1.) First, there was young Julius Malema, who turned thirty-three prior to the 2014 election and was initially strongly favored by Zuma. The ANC had long recognized the political significance of young people, even before they demonstrated their revolutionary potential in the Soweto uprising. Malema’s supporters could liken him to a radical political leader, like Steve Biko, who on principled grounds challenged the ANC for taking its focus away from the needs of Black people. Alongside his working-class credentials, Malema also received multiple degrees, including in philosophy, and studied for an advanced degree at Wits (the University of the Witwatersrand, pronounced “Vits”), where he helped to politicize fellow students. From scratch, he built a new political party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a self-described “radical and militant economic emancipation movement.”44 Malema keenly used the symbolism of class identity, including the wearing of red hardhats and jumpsuits, to attract a loyal following.45 The EFF has rejected the racially inclusive approach of the ANC, moving from a discourse of “reconciliation” to one of “justice,” and brought ideas like expropriation of land and mines, without compensation, into the mainstream dialogue.46 Second, there was Mmusi Maimane, born in Krugersdorp, raised in the nearby Dobsonville section of Soweto, the product of a Xhosa-Tswana marriage, and ordained as a pastor. In May 2014, Maimane was elected to lead the DA’s parliamentary representation, and in 2015 he defeated Wilmot James (a Coloured academic who had led IDASA while I was an intern there) to become their new leader. For the first time, a Black African took the helm of a party that had previously relied disproportionately on the votes of Whites and Coloureds. It remained to be seen whether the party’s momentum could continue. Both Malema and Maimane relentlessly targeted Zuma for his corruption and bad policies in the run-up to the 2014 national elections. Undoubtedly, many ordinary ANC voters held their noses when they ticked their choices. It did turn out to be the ANC’s worst performance to date. Nonetheless, the party enjoyed a comfortable win with 62.1 percent of all votes. The DA took over 22 percent of the vote, and the EFF, just a year old, earned a remarkable 6.4 percent as third-place finisher, delivering 25 seats to the upstart party, which would afford a prominent and vocal platform for their policies. For now, the ANC and Jacob Zuma were here to stay. However, the everyday problems facing citizens were significant, public sentiment was growing foul, and protests mounted. In 2015, over 60 percent of Gauteng residents said they thought the country was going in the wrong direction.47 And in Parliament in May 2016, Maimane and other opposition party leaders would press and embarrass Zuma in angry exchanges concerning the details of his relationship with the Guptas.48 In this context, in August 2016, South Africans visited the voting booths once again, now to cast ballots to decide local elections. The contest turned out to be a watershed. To begin with, it boasted the highest turnout yet recorded for a local election, alongside an increased voter’s roll from 23 million in 2011 to 26 million in 2016.49 In many parts of the country, that August 3 election was a complete drubbing for the ANC, at least relative to how they had performed in all the previous elections. The party lost political control of several of the largest and most important municipalities, including Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay—the latter centered in Port Elizabeth, a traditional ANC stronghold.50 It still received almost 54 percent of all votes cast nationwide, but that was a huge setback, and the message was clear: the days of ANC “hegemony” were over. Nationwide, the DA increased its take of the vote to 27 percent and despite never having competed in a previous local election, the EFF received over 8 percent. The pushback was a largely urban phenomenon. The ANC failed to secure a majority in five of eight major municipalities (previously it had solidly controlled seven of the eight). This meant it would be in majority power in just three of the biggest cities and in coalition in two others. For South Africa’s increasingly urbanized, cosmopolitan, and multiracial middle class, Zuma was an embarrassment and an affront to the modernizing project they were advancing.51 While Gauteng was installing a high-speed train to move arriving passengers from Oliver Tambo International Airport to Johannesburg and Pretoria, Zuma would be photographed in traditional African regalia. The print media, including foreign media, made reference to his multiple wives,52 a not-so-subtle reminder that he was a traditional polygamist. It’s not as though the ANC lost all their voters in the urban areas. Rather, it was just enough to be consequential for who would govern. And as this was a local election, Zuma was not even on the ballot. To a large degree, all South African elections are referenda on the combined spheres of government and speak to voters’ views of the party in power. The opposition parties persisted in their drive to capture vote share. In August 2017, the DA advanced a motion of “no confidence” in the president, and a secret ballot freed up several ANC members to vote against Zuma in Parliament. This reflected splits within the ANC that had been festering since Mbeki’s presidency, but Zuma’s loss of popular support surely boosted the strength of his ANC rivals. While the motion did not pass, based on the vote count, at least 30 percent of the ANC MPs must have supported it, a telling sign in a country where the ANC had previously maintained strong party discipline.53 When it came time to select the future ANC leadership, the party’s elites had to decide whether to support Zuma’s ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, for more of the same. Zuma was not attempting a play at a third term, but returning another Zuma to the top of the ballot would have spoken volumes about the collective deafness of party insiders to the broader electorate. It was a hard-fought internal battle between rival sections of the ANC. At the December 2017 ANC convention, Ramaphosa—who had been serving as deputy president but in an increasingly strained relationship with Zuma—was selected as the next leader by a slim margin. Under consistent fire, in February 2018, Jacob Zuma finally resigned from office, and Ramaphosa moved into the presidency, turning the page on a dark chapter.54 This is how he became the “incumbent” running in the 2019 election. Closer to the People Analogous questions of politics and accountability have loomed large in local municipalities like Mogale City. By design, local governments were intended to bring democracy “closer to the people” with the notion that citizens would have more direct voice in government, especially through contact with their elected government leaders. As at the national level, several patterns have gnawed at democratic ideals, including the use of violence in politics and a degree of manipulation of political rules toward the end of securing political power. And perhaps quite understandably, these problems have weighed heavily on the attitudes and perceptions of ordinary citizens who are inundated with information about the failings of their government. I wondered whether I would wind up finding a story in Mogale City that was reminiscent of the national scandals documented above or local exposés that have become well-known on South African bookshelves. Yes, there was Bosasa, the Krugersdorp-based company implicated in large-scale national malfeasance. But what about in local government? When I pushed councillors, journalists, and citizens for clear examples of corruption in the form of stealing, they couldn’t come up with any. I didn’t see big luxury cars in the council parking lot, though I was told that at least one councillor maintained an expensive Harley Davidson motorcycle. I heard suspicions of favoritism in the awarding of some local government contracts and read reports of irregularities in processes relative to stated procedures, but I never found any smoking guns in terms of large-scale instances of government fraud. When I pushed for specifics, critics of the local ANC government mostly described bad policies and implementation, inequality, and incompetence. According to the critics, the local government operated with a bloated head count even while being unable to pay certain bulk service providers for the municipality’s access to water or electricity. These are quite fair and important concerns, nothing to celebrate. But this was not massive “state capture” at the local level or an epidemic of greed. Admittedly, the fact that I did not uncover massive fraud in government should not be taken as dispositive. Unlike other academic researchers, journalists, and disillusioned government employees who were embedded in local governments—as was the case in the examples cited above, including those documented in How to Steal a City—I always conducted my research as an outsider, and perhaps potential whistleblowers didn’t trust me to share their stories. Some DA councillors said they were fairly certain that evidence of corruption would eventually rear its head because there were simply too many irregularities in the government accounts to believe otherwise. But speculation is not evidence. Moreover, Mogale has had—at least for certain periods—a comparatively strong record on governance. In a rare nod, the Krugersdorp News reported in 2015, “Auditor General Applauds Mogale City,”55 detailing the fact that the municipality had received a clean audit. The regulator announced, “We are impressed highly by the level of governance in Mogale City and hope that we would be able to learn from the way this municipality has done its work.” And while a skeptic might worry that a government organization is likely to sugarcoat, the Auditor General’s reputation is very strong, and its reports have been generally extremely critical of local governments. In fact, the office titled its 2018–19 report on local government performance “Not Much to Go Around, Yet Not the Right Hands at the Till”; in the introduction it leveled a blanket condemnation of poor financial management for most municipalities.56 Nonetheless, even in that report, the office singled out Mogale City as one of two (out of a total of eight) Gauteng Province municipalities for being proactive and upgrading their financial oversight in line with best practices. Based on these reports, Mogale emerges as one of the better-governed of South Africa’s more than 200 local municipalities, but you would never know it from talking with most residents. In 2017, overwhelmingly, 86 percent of Mogale residents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “Corruption is the main threat to our democracy”—the level of agreement was almost identical to that of residents in all other Gauteng municipalities. Overall, sentiment about the municipality was lukewarm: about 29 percent said they were dissatisfied and another 12 percent very dissatisfied with local government.57 Even the Auditor General’s reports made clear that there was lots of room for improvement, but my larger point is that throughout South Africa, there are important success stories, including in local government, and yet those are rarely acknowledged or internalized. For example, one academic study by South Africa–based scholars simply declared that South African decentralization has failed with almost no recognition of within-country variation, appreciation of constraints, or reference to analogous attempts.58 Bare-Knuckled Competition Especially after 2004, Mogale residents, like millions of citizens across the country, increasingly engaged in some form of protest. (In 2013, just over 2 percent of Mogale residents reported taking part in a protest but that grew to over 8 percent in 2017–18.)59 And like protests in other democracies, these have manifested in a mix of constructive and destructive forms. Sometimes, they offer a unique opportunity for ordinary citizens to have their collective voices heard when it appears that their elected leaders and various elite intermediaries seem oblivious to their wants and needs. Other times, they provide opportunities to play out vendettas, advance agendas for career advancement, and may cause collateral damage in terms of human harm and property destruction. In a 2011 state of the city address, Mogale mayor Koketso Calvin Seerane couldn’t help but recognize that such service delivery protests were an indicator of citizens’ discontent and needed to be addressed by the government.60 Many citizens expected more than they were getting, and many returned to the streets in the manner of protest politics born of the Apartheid days. By the end of the first twenty years of South Africa’s democracy, the country would be forced to embrace the dishonorable label, “The Protest Capital of the World.”61 Concentrated largely in urban areas, in townships like Kagiso and Munsieville, such protests are usually referred to in quotation marks—that is, as “service delivery protests”—because they are largely, but not entirely, and certainly not always, directly motivated by concerns about basic service delivery, in the sense of water, electricity, sanitation, or housing. As they have come to encompass a broader range of demands and grievances, other observers have used the more apt label of community protest.62 For the most part, the protests are directed at local governments. And as several South African analysts note, citizens have used both ballots and “bricks”—a euphemism for the sometimes destructive quality of the protests—to keep politicians on their toes.63 For example, in 2014, unhappy, landless residents from a rural area in the northern part of Mogale City took to the streets and blocked an important thoroughfare, demanding title to land that would allow them to build their own houses. In July 2015, residents of an informal settlement in Muldersdrift, protesting about service delivery issues, burned garbage and blocked a route into Krugersdorp with rocks and trees. They highlighted that they still had just two water taps for almost twelve thousand people and no flush toilets, and that the settlement was on a swamp, which caused beds and personal belongings to frequently get wet.

Alongside news of national scandals, the monumental 2016 local election was held. As happened in several other municipalities, the ANC took a devastating hit in Mogale City. The party fell just short of a majority with 48.9 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, the largely White but increasingly multiracial DA came in a strong second with 34.9 percent. And the EFF took a significant 11.6 percent. And under the PR system, parties with even less support wound up with seats, making them politically important in a close election: the right-wing, largely Afrikaner Freedom Front Plus (FF+)—which took in less than 1 percent of the vote nationally in 2014—got 2.2 percent and 2 seats in Mogale; and the Zulu-based IFP received less than 1 percent of the vote, but it was enough for a single seat on the council. Every seat would matter. With such vote tallies, the ANC wound up just one seat short (38 of 77) of the majority required to vote in its own mayor at the first sitting of the local councillors less than two weeks after the polls closed. A coalition was needed to form a government, and national-level negotiations ultimately determined the political fate of Mogale City: the four opposition parties agreed to band together to kick the ANC out of power. That meant agreeing on who the councillors from these different parties would vote for when asked to select a mayor from among their ranks. Without too much fuss, they cast 39 votes for Lynn Pannall, from the DA, an older White woman with over a decade of experience as a councillor. It’s hard to know who was more shocked: the White Krugersdorpers who watched a Black mayor take charge more than twenty years earlier or these ANC councillors who looked on—“gobsmacked”64—as a White woman became mayor in a municipality that was comprised of more than 75 percent Black voters. Despite the high energy and higher hopes the coalition partners envisioned in their unseating of the ANC, coalition government itself proved extremely difficult, particularly with a bureaucracy now filled with ANC supporters (a reverse of the early post-Apartheid years when ANC political leaders at various levels of government would face seas of Afrikaner bureaucrats). The only thing these parties really shared was a disdain for the ANC. When it came to the priorities of the community, the parties represented distinct constituencies and promoted very different party platforms. For example, the DA was resolutely pro-market, while the EFF called for massive land redistribution. Style-wise, they were oil and water. Less than four months into her mayoral term, Mayor Pannall declared that she was exhausted and in need of medical leave and that she would resign her post just about immediately. (The work of a South African councillor must be one of the most stressful jobs out there; according to my own survey of councillors in 2016, a full 45 percent said they feared violence against them because of their work, a fear that is well-founded given the reality of violence they often face at the hands of rivals and disgruntled constituents.)65 To replace her, the DA put forward Michael Holenstein, a younger, entrepreneurial man, originally from Switzerland. And in short order, he became the second White mayor of the largely Black Mogale City Local Municipality in the post-Apartheid era. Holenstein explained to me that as mayor, he tried to clean house in the administration. Whereas Pannall had indicated a willingness to work with bureaucrats who had long served under the ANC, Holenstein said that he couldn’t get anything done, they were overpaying staff, and there was no clear organization or reporting structures in the administration. He tried to reorganize and to restructure the bureaucracy. Not surprisingly, the ANC did not see Holenstein in a particularly positive light, let alone the fact that they could not stand the notion of being out of power. Holenstein recalled trying to have community meetings and ANC supporters would dance and shout to interrupt him. Within six months, the ANC tabled a motion of no confidence, charging political interference in the administration and that he had put the municipality in a poor financial situation owing to bad policy leadership.66 Theoretically, the DA should have succeeded in rebuffing the motion with a simple majority. Officially, the coalition still stood. But when the ballots were counted, it passed with 39 votes. And when the council voted for mayor—a process that Holenstein decried because contrary to the rules of order, there was a secret vote, and despite being a candidate, the Speaker presided—now the ANC’s Lipudi came out on top.67 Someone—perhaps as many as three councillors—had turned their backs on the coalition. The ANC had clearly persuaded at least one councillor from a rival party to vote for them and insisted on a secret ballot, which would allow the defector to proceed anonymously. When I interviewed them about the unexpected transition, Mayor Lipudi as well as the new Speaker, Noluthando Mangole, recounted the episode in matter-of-fact terms, smiling. There was clearly a part of the story they would not share: how they persuaded a councillor from another party to vote for ANC leaders and who that person was. Mangole said it was justified that the ANC should be in power as they won the most votes: “We don’t have a party that is called coalition in the elections.” Of course, that was beside the point under the prevailing electoral rules for local government. FIGURE 6.2. Mogale City mayor Patrick Lipudi in his office, June 28, 2019. Lipudi passed away from a short illness (details unknown) in January 2020. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The DA was not happy. It implemented a lie detector test within its ranks. One councillor refused to take the test and offered his resignation instead while maintaining that he had not defected in the vote.68 In interviews, several councillors told me they believed the resigning councillor was the defector. They said he was unhappy to not have had a higher position in the local party and had been demoted from the mayoral committee. In turn, at least for a few months, the DA and the other opposition parties played their own game of “make-the-municipality-ungovernable,” and they boycotted the council sitting, making it impossible for the ANC, by council rules, to pass its budget. A DA provincial leader explained, “They have demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to get back into power in Mogale City so they can merely further their corruption. The DA will not stop fighting for the change that the people of Mogale City called for. We, along with our partners, will not simply sit back and let the ANC further plunder municipal resources.”69 The situation got ugly. At the end of August, a raucous council meeting involved a fistfight between EFF supporters and the local security agency sitting in the council gallery, spurned by frustrations around the fragile coalition.70 Meanwhile, street protests and revolts continued. In response, the local government sometimes used force to protect property rights or to quell disobedience.71 In particular, when protests involve squatters or land invasions, the municipality has frequently sent in the Red Ants,72 an infamous private security company that specializes in removing invaders.73 Their tactics remind many of the Apartheid days when the National Party government would infamously bulldoze the homes of Black residents living in White areas, arguing that the dwellings were in contravention of Apartheid law. On the eastern side of Mogale City, a growing informal settlement, adjacent to the thriving and luxurious Cradlestone Mall, stood in the way of further development plans for the owner, ABSA Bank. ABSA coordinated with the municipality to bring in the Red Ants to solve their problem in December 2018. At a cost of over 2 million rand, they moved the squatters to another spot in Muldersdrift, breeding more anger and frustration among residents.74 But Also Accountability In the wake of headline-catching problems and pathologies, the brief democratic history in Mogale—and across many of the urban and near-urban municipalities in South Africa—also reveals some important gains in terms of empowering citizens. Some of this I’ve observed directly, while other gains are only detectable by studying patterns in available data. To begin with, while the 2016 election in Mogale did not bring about lasting change in the composition of government, the hard-fought political battle was certainly evidence of growing electoral competition, which in turn seems to be key for political responsiveness in South Africa and elsewhere. Given the electoral cycle, such that no more than three years goes by without either a local or national/provincial election, there is never a time when a contest is both too far in the future or such a distant memory that any aspiring leader can rest on their laurels. In turn, councillors are well aware that their fortunes can always turn and that they depend on the support of the governed. Politicians say they are compelled to show up in various neighborhoods, to hear complaints, and to respond to them. One could say that talk is cheap, but there is good reason to believe that responsiveness impacts politicians’ careers. For example, Philip Martin, Nina McMurry, and I studied the renominations of elected councillors in Gauteng and around the country and examined whether the leading political parties simply deployed “loyal cadres” to valued local councillor positions or were willing to remove councillors who had lost the faith of citizens. Analyzing the career trajectories of over eight thousand councillors, we found that in areas where political competition was high, the leading parties (the ANC and the DA) were much more likely to end the careers of those who had failed to satisfy their constituents (as measured by responses to surveys). Those who were well regarded by citizens tended to be renominated or promoted. By contrast, in noncompetitive areas, party choices appeared uncorrelated with what citizens said about the quality of services or their own councillor.75 And while citizens may be angered by a lot of what they see, they are nonetheless extremely engaged not simply via protest but in the very institutions designed to channel links between voters and their representatives. In my Historical Memories Survey of Mogale residents who would have been eligible to vote in 1994, almost all Black residents reported having voted in all 5 national elections (average of 4.9 elections) including the 2014 election. For Whites, the average is somewhat lower at 4.7 (although a small share of the sample, those who didn’t vote in 1994, reported having voted much less frequently than those who did).76 Moreover, 41 percent of Mogale residents said they had participated in ward meetings and 41 percent in street committee or residents’ meetings, all of which reflect very high levels of community engagement.77 Despite the common refrain I heard that there is no effective opposition in South Africa, I found several instances of individuals and parties holding the government to account. For example, when I met with Juliana Steyn—the Afrikaner soldier who had to sing “Nkosi” the day of the first election and who in 2019 worked for a government agency—she explained to me that when the opposition parties ask questions in national parliament on designated days, people like her are forced to respond quickly with data and analysis so the relevant government official can provide coherent and factual responses. Such “fire drills” may distract employees from their immediate work, but they also serve an important accountability mechanism given a general fear of embarrassment at all levels. When I visited Mogale local council meetings I repeatedly saw that opposition questions and challenges were often met with resentful glares and words from ANC officeholders, but nonetheless, the engagement provoked research and responses. Relatedly, the Krugersdorp News publishes stories and pointed letters, which are read by many of the municipality’s top political leaders and, in turn, they frequently feel compelled to reply and to defend their positions. Indeed, several said as much to me. Moreover, White Krugersdorpers have largely chosen to engage the democratic system rather than exit it altogether, as one might have predicted in the early 1990s. Even the cultural autonomists in the FF+ who remain very interested in the prospects of developing a separate homeland, or Volkstaat, actively participate in local politics: Whites have found representation in political parties, campaigned, held office, and channeled their frustrations with ballots, not the bullets some extremists had threatened to use prior to Mandela’s inauguration. Perhaps this is not surprising, as Whites do still overwhelmingly constitute the local tax base, and they want to have some oversight regarding how money is spent. Yet, their willingness to scrutinize budgets and to highlight inconsistencies almost surely keeps government officials on their toes in a way that would not be true in their absence. It is also worth highlighting the challenging and important role that ward councillors play, especially in lower-income neighborhoods and townships. These are South Africa’s only directly elected leaders, and for many, this is a tough job. Each councillor represents a constituency of about ten thousand people, and their home address and mobile phone number are known to all. And their phone must be switched on for most of the day. They are regularly called on by their constituents for every type of problem, sometimes way beyond the scope of their legal mandates—including marital and neighborly disputes. I interviewed several ward councillors in Mogale City, and dozens around the country, and many proudly showed me their extensive WhatsApp chats, containing endlessly long back-and-forths with constituents, replete with lists of questions and needs and the responses they provided. Particularly for Black constituents whose families did not benefit from generations of obtaining access to government services, councillors serve as important intermediaries in helping them attain basic documents like proof of residence or ensuring that an ambulance arrives when they need medical care. Ward councillors vary widely in terms of their efforts and how they are received by their communities. But the logic of electoral competition in competitive wards incentivizes responsiveness toward these needs as such outreach seems to affect citizen perceptions and, in turn, party and voter decisions about whether to keep incumbents in place.78 And because these councillors generally live within the communities they serve, citizens hold them accountable through everyday interactions, what one scholar aptly labeled, in a different context, “dignified public expression.”79 Of course, not all are successful—many are downright derelict in their duties—but for those regarded as effective, citizens report that the key traits are demonstration of efforts to attain access to public services and simply being available to listen to their needs.80 Tshepo Nzwane—who came to be a local councillor after a childhood in which he bombed the local school—said that one hundred to two hundred people show up at each of his community meetings. For millions of people who never had a say in government, their votes and opinions are very meaningful with respect to whether that individual keeps their job, and they have the opportunity to inform and be informed by that representative on a regular basis. Much of this is the mundane stuff of everyday democratic government. Still, this is what past generations understandably wished for. Comparative Perspectives: From Laggard to Leader Democratic “success” is a matter of perspective and requires a field of vision that spans both time and space. The notion that South Africa became a relatively robust liberal democracy during the post-Apartheid era might be difficult to see when buried beneath many quotidian realities. As such, it’s important to consider some of the failures and accomplishments in governance in a more comparative perspective. First let’s consider the worries that a single party, the ANC, would dominate politics so thoroughly that South Africa would become like the Mexican one-party state under the PRI. In practice, between 1994 and 2016, citizens went to the polls five times to vote in national and provincial elections, and five additional times for local government elections. The elections have been certified time and again without major instances of vote rigging, ballot-box stuffing, voter intimidation, or the like. Looking back now, we know that South Africa did not become a one-party state. It is true that, as shown in figure 6.3, the ANC received the majority of all votes cast in every electoral contest, and gains in 1999 and 2004 contributed to a sense at the time that South Africa was well on its way to single-party domination.81 But the trends have not moved toward a monopolization of political power. In fact, just the opposite has happened. By the time of the 2019 election, an ANC victory was clearly not a foregone conclusion. Not only has South Africa avoided the problem of “three-termism,”82 no president has served even two full terms. Even when the ANC managed to achieve a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament,83 the party did not use this as an occasion to rewrite the constitution in a manner that would radically tilt the rules in its own favor or to the benefit of its main constituents. While the majority of all constitutional amendments (13 of 17) were implemented from 1999 to 2009, most addressed questions of boundary management and between-election party-switching among elected leaders. To a degree, these may have been designed with ANC interests in mind regarding political control and centralization of power, but they were minor tweaks and, as we know now, certainly did not manage to stem the tide of ANC political losses in subsequent years. FIGURE 6.3. ANC vote share, elections 1994–2016. Source: Author analysis of IEC data. Relatedly, there were and continue to be grave concerns about corruption in South Africa. Throughout history, public officials, entrusted to work on behalf of society, have frequently used their powers and influence to secure private gains for themselves and for their families. Corrupt practices were problematic in the early days of the (White) South African Republic and in the postcolonial Nigerian state. As the German sociologist Max Weber documented with respect to India in the early Middle Ages, government officeholders used their positions expressly to secure benefits for themselves.84 Corruption was notoriously prevalent in various American cities, it has been a problem in Asian success stories, including Japan and China, and it has been at the root of many failures in African governance. The Scandinavian countries and a few others seem to have escaped major corruption problems, but not most. Corruption is highly prevalent in much of Africa, and one compelling explanation for such practice in post-Apartheid South Africa and in other parts of the continent is the theory of the Nigerian political scientist Peter Ekeh. He presciently argued with respect to his own country that following generations of rule under an illegitimate colonial state, many postcolonial bureaucrats felt more compelled to deliver directly to their immediate kinship networks than to serve the broad mandates of what had long been an illegitimate state, designed to plunder.85 When viewed in comparative perspective, the extent of South African corruption, including increases in corruption, does not appear as extreme as South African commentators frequently portray. As a starting point, a substantial amount of government behavior that would be labeled as corruption today was rife under Apartheid. (And that is separate from the fact that the system itself was founded on a wildly unjust proposition, so the degree of bureaucratic “integrity” within such a system is not much to celebrate.) One carefully documented study revealed that the White-run state routinely engaged in corrupt arms and oil deals in order to subvert sanctions.86 The fact that foreign governments and arms corporations would wind up engaged with the ANC in similar practices may say more about the period before democracy than about the recent past. Moreover, on most international comparative scales (based primarily on expert opinion), South Africa still upholds higher levels of government integrity than most. In the 2019 Transparency International rating of 180 countries, South Africa ranked seventieth (least corrupt), tied with Hungary and Romania, above China and India, and fifth among continental countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, knowing a country’s GDP per capita in 1990 predicts two-thirds of the variation in country corruption scores in 2019, and on that basis alone, South Africa’s corruption score is almost perfectly predicted.87 While this may not be much consolation for South African citizens whose public resources are pilfered, it does suggest that the extent of South African corruption may not be as remarkable as sometimes argued. It’s also important to consider the problems of crime and violence, prominent realities in Mogale City and throughout South Africa. Most South Africans identify these as serious concerns, and the scars of violent confrontations are plain to see. As with corruption, we can expect a degree of violence in all societies, but the question is, how much is there, and to what extent does it undermine the democratic project itself? In fact, the very point of democracy is to resolve questions of leadership selection and other conflicts without violence.88 Once again, post-Apartheid South Africa is very much a product of its past. As I discussed in chapter 4, we cannot lost sight of the fact that Krugersdorp itself was born as a violent town and the Union of South Africa was forged out of extraordinarily violent conflict in its original incarnation in the early part of the twentieth century. The institutionalization of White supremacy was a violent process89 that was eventually met with several decades of violent resistance, culminating in civil war. Half-hearted attempts to introduce Black local government under Apartheid government provoked further cycles of violence. For example, on September 3, 1984—“Bloody Monday”—Black township residents throughout the West Rand protested against service fee increases and the perceived illegitimacy of local councillors, resulting in four killed, events followed by increased state repression and mushrooming body counts.90 Combining such history with the country’s vast inequality, it is hardly surprising that violence has persisted in the post-Apartheid era. The prevalence of violence is not at all unique to South Africa’s democracy. In many countries of the Global South—including India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines—it is a routine aspect of political life. Along these lines, one analyst proposed the new label of “violent democracy”91 for South Africa, applicable to these other countries as well. In related research and analysis, observers have highlighted the ways in which inequalities of wealth and power frequently result in violent conflict. Claims made concerning violations of public trust around corruption are sometimes themselves the result of frustrated actors who have found themselves shut out of patronage links.92 Particularly disturbing is the extent of violence involved in the struggle to obtain and to maintain positions in local government councils. Between the start of 2016 and September 2018, approximately ninety politicians were killed in the context of turf battles, struggles for office, and reprisals, including against those who acted as whistleblowers in exposing government corruption.93 To recognize that such violence has strong historical and comparative precedents does not imply that it is tolerable. Whether in South Africa or elsewhere, there may be a tipping point at which we can no longer describe these countries as being governed by ballots but rather by bullets. It is hard to say exactly how to draw that line, but for all the violence that finds a home in contemporary South Africa, it is still not the basis for most leadership selections or policymaking. Violence in South Africa and many other countries can still be understood as awful by-products of still incomplete democratic development. And even wealthy and long-standing democracies like the United States remain vulnerable to violent conflict in political life. Moreover, we should not lose sight of the big picture—that democratic institutions appear to have been central in solving the problem of existential crisis, putting an end to civil war, and lowering the amount of measured political violence in South Africa. For example, based on a systematic coding of social conflicts across the African continent, more than 12,000 deaths resulted from various social conflicts in South Africa between the start of 1990 and April 24, 1994 (preelection). By contrast, for the much longer period after the 1994 election until the end of 2017, the number from such causes was less than 2,500. South Africa went from being the deadliest place on the continent in terms of such conflict-related fatalities to being completely unremarkable in comparative terms.94 While there are important examples of the post-Apartheid government using deadly force against striking workers and protesters, these are still a rarity and the state no longer routinely kills and tortures people to advance its agenda. In fact, a serious mismatch between trends in crime, including violent crime (which has largely gone down), and perceptions and fears of crime and violence (which continue to go up) during the post-Apartheid period perhaps unfairly contributes to concerns about the quality of democracy. For example, the homicide rate in South Africa has fallen dramatically since 1994. Notwithstanding some uptick in recent years, the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people dropped from 63 in 1994 to 35.7 in 2017,95 and yet, I am quite sure you would never learn this from talking to ordinary South Africans in Mogale or almost anywhere else. Two different studies, one for the period 1998–200396 and another that extends to 2016–17,97 both highlight that even with corroborated data revealing either stabilization or decline in crime rates, citizens report feeling more unsafe. Part of the problem may be that even with some reductions, overall South African levels are very high, and it is this persistence that shapes attitudes. Or it might be widespread discussion in the media or social media and/or particular crimes that most affect citizen perceptions. In any case, the notion that during the democratic era things have begun to “spin out of control” simply does not accord with reality in the country. FIGURE 6.4. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. Finally, I want to point out that democratic practice itself has been remarkably successful when seen in comparative terms. For example, based on metrics from the Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) project, and with respect to their Electoral Democracy and slightly more demanding Liberal Democracy indexes, looking back again to the 1980s, South Africa was truly a global laggard in the practice of liberal democracy, ranking 113th out of 169, just above Uzbekistan. But it propelled itself into the top 50 in global rankings in the early 1990s, making one of the biggest jumps worldwide. South Africa’s democratization path is clearly demonstrated in figures 6.4 and 6.5, which depict the V-DEM Democracy scores relative to other Upper-middle-income and other African countries. FIGURE 6.5. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other African countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. And frankly, when considering just about every dimension measured with respect to democratic process—an open media environment that allows for the free circulation of information, including a free press that actively attempts to monitor government practice; freedom for civil society (organizations of people independent from the state); and a judiciary that can similarly act independently of the government and can rebuke practices that contravene the fundamental laws of the land, as established in the constitution—South Africa performs extremely well in comparative perspective.98 On several dimensions, the expert coders report some decline in democratic performance after 2012, no doubt owing to many of the scandals during the Zuma presidency. Nonetheless, relative to the democratic retreat in many other countries, including in Africa, South Africa’s decline was modest and the country mostly held steady in the eyes of observers with a broad comparative framework in mind. Recalling the location of a key set of goalposts, the Freedom Charter offered a set of ideals for a political future, including the idea that multiracial democracy should be understood not simply as a means to an end but an end in itself. And on such scores, given the historical record just presented, the shift from “unfreedom” to “freedom” in the political arena was absolutely profound in South Africa. Many will quite reasonably retort, “You can’t eat freedom.” Which is why it’s also important to consider post-Apartheid trends in material prosperity, the subject of the next chapter.",

      "content": "6 Democracy after Mandela A STRESS TEST EVEN DURING THE SURPRISINGLY PEACEFUL and productive first years of the Mandela presidency, not everyone was convinced that South Africa’s future was so bright. A group of prominent South African scholars commissioned a collection of essays investigating how democracy had gone awry in other parts of the world. For example, they wondered if South Africa might soon resemble Mexico, where a liberation party managed to secure political control for over seventy years and engaged in wanton corruption to the detriment of the economy and society.1 After only one election, historians and social scientists were already classifying the ANC as a “dominant party” and suggesting that their own country might be incapable of becoming a liberal democracy. Maybe it was unfair and overly cynical to be worrying about such outcomes this early in the post-Apartheid history. And yet, considering the size of the ANC majority, and the precedents of other liberation leaders and parties becoming autocratic in other parts of the world, it was a plausible concern. If one party got a firm grip on power, would ordinary citizens have any chance of holding politicians accountable? Fast forward to the 2019 election. If I had shared these early predictions with the voters I encountered all around Mogale City, many would have concluded that these skeptics had been soothsayers. During the two decades from the twilight of Mandela’s presidency until the 2019 elections, the once conventional wisdom that the country had emerged as a democratic “miracle” faded into a distant memory. In its place, the airwaves, headlines, and bookstores shared ongoing sagas of government corruption and failed projects. For millions of South African citizens, corruption indeed emerged as the existential problem, and a dominant ANC was to blame. Several important books documented the illicit practices of government officials at all levels with titles such as Licence to Loot, How to Steal a City, and Anatomy of the ANC in Power.2 The latter two describe the precipitous downfall of the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, the metropolitan municipality centered in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape Province. The various authors painted depressing portraits of the undoing of a high-minded, ideologically driven liberation party and the spreading rot of malfeasance in the daily operations of government. It is worth noting, however, that Stephan Hofstatter (author of Licence to Loot) would later be dismissed from the Sunday Times for false reporting and was confronted at a book launch by angry government officials accusing him of misrepresentations.3 Through such books, as well as from print and broadcast news, everyday conversations, and social media, citizens became aware that more than a few politicians were concocting elaborate schemes to divert government resources into their own pockets, while millions of people remained poor, out of work, and without reliable access to basic services. In the weeks and months leading up to the 2019 elections, even ANC supporters and local councillors in Mogale City—including the ANC mayor, Patrick Lipudi—shared with me their awareness of and concerns about the problem of corruption within ANC ranks. The opposition described the ANC as almost uniformly crooked. In 2015, the majority of South Africans said they perceived substantial corruption in all levels of government; over 63 percent said that the level had “increased a lot” in the previous year.4 In fact, when I mentioned to various South Africans in 2019 that I was writing a book about post-Apartheid South Africa, they essentially responded, “Oh, so a book about the corrupt ANC?” Meanwhile, citizens were increasingly resorting to protest in a manner reminiscent of the anti-Apartheid days. Many protests turned destructive and violent, and at least as worrying, on a few occasions, the national government and various local governments used violence against protesting and striking citizens. The prevalence of such well-documented political pathologies begs the question: How could I possibly describe South Africa’s democracy as a “success story” if all of this was going on? It’s a fair question. Democratic practice in Mogale City and throughout South Africa during this period has indeed been uneven, maybe even downright ugly. Many chapters of this history would not find their way into a textbook of civic best practices. Corruption and violence can seem almost routine in some pockets of the country. Nonetheless, democratic politics has operated in a manner that has been increasingly competitive, with substantial opportunities for citizen engagement and oversight from various guardrails within society. Politicians are frequently held accountable for unethical behavior, undesirable policies, or simply being perceived as not doing a good job. While many might have hoped for or even expected a government in which all public servants operated with complete integrity, and that all disputes would be resolved through deliberative debate, such outcomes were highly unlikely given the country’s political history, let alone the record of other countries that have undergone major regime changes like South Africa’s. In fact, many of the wealthiest and oldest democracies still struggle with such problems to varying degrees. This clearly includes the United States, especially of recent vintage. In this chapter, I offer evidence of democratic accountability at work—even in the face of substantial challenges and contradictions—in three steps. First, I review some of the most important ways in which democratic institutions constrained the two longest-serving presidents amid all of their deficiencies. Second, I describe democratic accountability at the local level, especially in Mogale City, again while still acknowledging many of its very real problems. And third, I detail some of the South African patterns of democratic performance and accountability and the extent of corruption and violence in a broader and comparative perspective. To hear South African commentators describe their country’s failures at democratic governance, one might think that theirs was a failed state. In fact, in 2015, more than one-third of surveyed Gauteng residents said it was a failed state.5 But if we consider actual failed states—Somalia, Chad, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, or the Democratic Republic of Congo—we recognize the extent of hyperbole in such assessments of South Africa. The reality of South African government is not nearly so apocalyptic. In many ways, it is highly functional. Constraining Power at the Very Top As I discussed in the prior chapter, of the idiosyncrasies that make South Africa unique, a prominent one is Nelson Mandela. The legendary iconoclast gave South Africa many things, but in becoming president, he did not offer a good test for democracy. Mandela embraced his jailers, repeatedly called for calm and forgiveness over revenge, donned the symbols of oppression in a spirit of reconciliation, and chose to leave office after only one term. He revealed that he was no ordinary politician or person. That South Africa could function effectively with him at the helm left it to the imagination whether it was democracy or his demigod-like stature and self-restraint that ordained such success. Most politicians are instead far more mortal. Almost by definition, they are ambitious and crave power—to a greater extent than the average citizen. Many are very public spirited, but certainly not all, and the pressures and temptations of power can induce greed, unscrupulous efforts to remain in office, and inclinations to favor friends and loyalists for jobs and policies rather than the broader interests of the country. One of the key tests for democratic politics is whether the “people” can constrain such tendencies, especially of those at the pinnacle of power, so that the polity does not become hostage to leaders’ wants and needs or to efforts to divert government resources. After Mandela, the ANC bench was still deep with qualified and impressive possibilities, but this lot was decidedly mortal and offered a solid “stress test” for democratic politics. The office of the presidency alternated to four different men between the time of Mandela’s retirement and the 2019 election. But just two—Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma—led for eighteen of those twenty years. Given their personal biographies, either would have been a viable national leader, irrespective of leadership selection rules. During their tenures in office, national politics was dominated by their deeds, their misdeeds, and their own struggles for power. Mbeki was an ANC stalwart. During the years of struggle, he devoted his life to the organization, joining the youth league at the age of fourteen, working in exile, and receiving military training in the Soviet Union; he was based for many years in Lusaka, Zambia. Moreover, his father, Govan Mbeki, was a politicized Fort Hare graduate, an ANC leader, and jailed with Mandela following the Rivonia trial. Despite membership in the South African Communist Party, Mbeki opposed the ANC becoming a party of socialism, citing a desire to remain a “broad church.” This approach served him well for most of his career, allowing him to become the international face of the ANC and to negotiate effectively with White South Africa.6 His appointment to be Mandela’s deputy president in 1994 put him on a clear path to lead the ANC’s party ticket. Mbeki could seem more professorial than a veteran of a militant liberation movement. Not particularly tall or physically imposing, he wore a beard, spoke in measured paces, and routinely exuded the academic prowess of a man with an advanced degree in economics from Sussex University. He put forward many bold ideas, some productive, including positive visions for African regional integration and upliftment. And yet, like other exiles, especially those involved in the military wing, he had no experience being governed from below. Just prior to becoming state president, one commentator noted Mbeki’s penchant for centralizing power in an essay with the headline, “Mbeki: Democrat or Autocrat?”7 Jacob Zuma was also a former exile from the era of resistance politics. Born in KwaZulu-Natal in 1942, he painted a stark contrast to Mbeki. The son of a policeman and a domestic worker,8 his working-class credentials were a large part of his public appeal: “I never went to school, but I educated myself,”9 he proudly proclaimed. Also not particularly tall, but a sturdier figure, with a clean-shaven face and head, Zuma had been active in the military wing of the ANC, served prison time on Robben Island with Mandela, and also had strong ANC credentials, including working with Mbeki for the cause of liberation. Seen by his comrades as a committed cadre, “fearless, loyal, and affable,”10 he rose in the ranks owing to a strong social IQ and effectiveness as an underground operative. Though visibly proud of his Zulu heritage, he was not a cultural autonomist and stood by the ANC throughout its conflicts with the IFP.11 However, Zuma had few close relationships with White South Africans in the manner that Mbeki or Mandela did. Compared with Mbeki, Zuma exuded more energy and less introspection. He was an antidote to Mbeki’s air of elitism in substance and style. Though he served as deputy president under Mbeki, his ascendancy to the top position was shrouded in some doubt in the midst of not simply ongoing corruption investigations but charges of rape. The latter resulted in a very public trial. Although the court declared that the sex was consensual, during the course of the proceedings, it was revealed that Zuma had had unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman, and he famously declared that it was “ok” because he showered afterward, a statement that even the exonerating judge would condemn for its lack of scientific merit. Notwithstanding such sagas, Zuma was elected ANC president in 2007,12 even as many wondered whether he would be South Africa’s populist autocrat. Both men had great ambitions for themselves, and each tried to subvert democratic procedures in various ways during their respective tenures (1999–2008 and 2009–18). But both were also overtly humbled in their presidential careers through the machinations of direct democratic pressures and internal party struggles for power. The various media outlets challenged each man’s record, and they faced steady and well-organized reactions from civil society; their policies and actions were corrected by the courts; and ultimately their own powers were constrained by their party while the party’s power was constrained by voters at the polls. Violations of Public Trust As I will discuss in the next two chapters, many successful policies were enacted and implemented during Mbeki’s and Zuma’s respective terms. Yet, both men violated the public’s trust on various occasions by hiding or participating in illicit schemes and by making self-serving and counterproductive policies and appointments. One policy episode, for which Mbeki became infamous around the globe, was his heterodox approach to the devastating AIDS pandemic, which had been ravaging southern Africa since the late 1980s. He and his chosen health minister refused to embrace the widely held scientific understanding of the role that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plays in sickness and death. He went so far as to argue that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was not caused by a virus.13 He also rejected the use of scientifically proven anti-retroviral drug therapies, depriving the population of their value for prevention and treatment. Mbeki and his chosen group of advisors came to be known as AIDS denialists. Their approach may have cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people viable opportunities to extend their lives.14 It was a stunning blind spot, and Mbeki was relentlessly stubborn. Owing to these retrograde policies, the South African government, once again, became something of a pariah. I was so struck by the extent to which this problem was spiraling out of control and not receiving the response it deserved that it became the focus of my own research for the next several years.15 A second major scandal involved both Mbeki and Zuma; it came to be known simply as the “Arms Deal.” As early as 1998, while Mandela was still president, the government announced its intention to modernize its defense force and that it would procure billions of dollars in heavy equipment. As a start, the initiative was roundly criticized as inappropriate for a country that faced no apparent defense threats. More notably, the companies that wanted to bid on those contracts and their host governments frequently engaged in various forms of bribery to influence the decision makers to throw the highly lucrative business deals their way. ANC officials accepted luxury cars, money, and other perks. The procurement process was repeatedly found to be irregular in the sense that standards for rating certain bids were changed midstream to favor particular firms.16 Although to my knowledge Mbeki has not been directly implicated in any attempts to gain personally from the deals, he was criticized for blocking open investigations.17 Zuma, on the other hand, has been accused of securing various illegal payments while deputy president and was dismissed by Mbeki for corrupt dealings. In both cases, Mbeki’s wrongdoings were matters of process, of subverting open government and transparency and attempting to centralize power and to protect party insiders while potentially scapegoating political rivals. Zuma, by contrast, sought to enrich himself and his family and friends, taking malfeasance to great new heights. In this regard, his presidency was clearly the blight of the post-Apartheid history. The most egregious of such transactions involved an Indian-born family, the Guptas. The Gupta saga is long and now legendary in South Africa. The family came to South Africa from India in the early 1990s in initially modest fashion. Over the decades, they became so enmeshed in the work of South African government that they gave rise to a term now used frequently in everyday dialogue: “state capture.”18 In their quest for political and economic influence, the family provided jobs to Zuma family members and to those of other politicians. (By one estimate, ANC politicians skimmed tens of billions of dollars from public funds.) They enticed complicity through first-class plane tickets, rides on private planes, jobs, money, and other perks. And in turn, the president and other government leaders gave the Guptas access to lucrative government deals and control over the selection of key government positions. Naturally, their favored selections treated them extremely well in all business dealings, allowing the Guptas to become one of the country’s richest families—in a country where the richest families are very rich, by any standard.19 In sometimes wanton fashion, the Guptas gained access to a military base for a private wedding; they used their influence to attain the post of finance minister for a loyal crony; and they earned millions from shady business deals involving government contracts.20 Relatedly, Zuma and others in the ANC engaged in similar types of dealings with the Krugersdorp-based company Bosasa. The company routinely traded perks and kickbacks in return for government contracts and influence. A whistleblower from the company recounted the ways in which the Bosasa CEO was able to control Zuma’s public statements and actions,21 furthering the notion of a state captured by private interests. Finally, on a much smaller scale in financial terms, but symbolically extremely disquieting for South Africans, Zuma spent approximately 7.8 million rand of public money on upgrades to his personal homestead in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal. These included a swimming pool, a cattle pen, and an amphitheater, amenities that were hidden as expenses under the otherwise allowable rubric of “security upgrades.”22 Responses and Repercussions Together, this set of incursions—Mbeki’s AIDS policies, the arms deal, “Gupta-gate,” Bosasa, and Nkandla—left the ANC’s reputation tarnished when it made its case to the voters in 2019. Along with other inevitable scandals and policy failures, they fed critics daily fodder. What does the fact that such betrayals of the public’s trust could unfold over the first quarter century of post-Apartheid government reflect about the quality of democracy? Here, I think much of the answer lies with how citizens and various actors responded to evidence and allegations. And in this regard, the fact that we know so much about these problems and that government officials have not been able to stem the flow of incriminating information reveals a great deal about the success of South Africa’s democracy. To appreciate the openness, it is important to consider the situation in non-democratic regimes, including Zimbabwe under Mugabe, or in countries such as Bahrain, Qatar, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, where there has been very little space for critics to openly challenge and demand consequences for malfeasance. While citizens in these tightly managed authoritarian countries may perceive corruption or hear about it through rumors, or gain access to some international reporting via the internet or satellite news, the absence of effective opposition parties and the immediate threat of repression have implied a completely different landscape for accountability. In South Africa, citizens and civil society have been emboldened to challenge the state and its various leaders by name. For example, several former anti-Apartheid activists banded together to forge new organizations and movements to speak out against Mbeki’s retrograde AIDS policies. In particular, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC)—led by many former anti-Apartheid activists and exiles—emerged as a global leader in the fight for treatment access. They led marches, held press conferences, and built coalitions to criticize the government’s actions. They developed clever slogans and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase “HIV Positive” in order to counter stigma against the disease. The press relentlessly critiqued government policy while political cartoonists and entertainment personalities routinely mocked officials who persisted in denying the well-accepted science around HIV prevention and AIDS treatment. Medical professionals and social scientists spoke out against the government’s policies, as did leaders of various opposition political parties. If the government was trying to silence or repress any of these actors, they did not do a very good job of it. These organizations won their court cases, and the government obeyed, changing course on its HIV policies.23 Relatedly, throughout the post-Apartheid period, the news media—and as amplified on social media—consistently shined a bright light on allegations and evidence of corruption. In fact, rare has been the day when any major news outlet has not reported on the status of some government corruption allegation or another. In at least one case, the response and resulting impact were almost immediate. When Zuma installed a Gupta ally into the office of the finance minister, the business community and the various news organizations went ballistic, as seen in these headlines: “Firing Nene Proves Jacob Zuma Is the Dolt behind the Bolt,”24 “Finance Minister Switch Seen as Another Zuma Clanger,”25 and “Van Rooyen ‘Bad for ANC in Polls.’ ”26 Within days of the appointment, Zuma faced so much backlash, along with a sharp drop in the markets, that he shuffled the crony to a less central position and appointed the trusted and reliable Pravin Gordhan to the job. This episode also demonstrated the business sector’s autonomy and ability to challenge the government even publicly in the face of poor governance practice.27 That said, like other parties in power, the ANC has frequently sought to keep such information out of the public view and certainly has tried to clamp down on unflattering news. As it turned out, a key whistleblower was Andrew Feinstein, the ANC MP I had met in the first month of my yearlong stay in the country in 1997–98. When Feinstein tried to get to the bottom of the arms deal, he met serious resistance. ANC leaders removed him from the parliamentary public accounts committee.28 The more he pressed, the more he was alienated from the party, and in 2001, he resigned from his beloved ANC. He migrated to London and published a popular book, After the Party, detailing this and other scandals that undermined his confidence in the organization.29 The ANC’s treatment of Feinstein is an obvious blemish on its democratic record. For many, the arms deal was a massive fraud plus cover-up, and critics can point to a weak-toothed commission as having done little to redress the wrongdoing. At the very least, in 2001, the ANC’s Chief Whip, Tony Yengeni, and Zuma’s financial advisor were both sentenced to prison. Even after twenty years, the ANC has not been able to bury the case; public protectors and the media continue to elicit allegations and evidence. A new judge condemned a prior ruling that made light of the case and reopened it for additional scrutiny, a welcome development for many of those who challenged the government in the first place.30 Throughout their tenures, both Mbeki and Zuma faced hard-hitting everyday scrutiny in the news media. In 2004, Archbishop Desmond Tutu began to publicly criticize Mbeki and his administration for bad policies, including on AIDS,31 and for Mbeki’s general failure to encourage open discussion and debate within the ANC.32 Following further public exchanges between them, ANC officials tried to defuse the situation by expressing respect for Tutu’s position.33 Tutu continued to criticize Mbeki throughout the remainder of his term, going so far as to publicly state that neither he nor Zuma would be an appropriate pick for the ANC leadership in 2007.34 By 2008, owing to a wide range of factors, including disappointments about economic policy on the part of trade union and SACP leaders,35 Mbeki lost the support of the ANC and was forced to resign. Two years into Zuma’s presidency, Tutu once again raised his voice as national muse, and again, his challenges were covered widely. He captured the growing frustration with the governing liberation party in a particularly alarming manner when he described it as “worse than the Apartheid government.” He quickly qualified this bold charge with, “because at least you were expecting it from the Apartheid government.” Ever the conscience of the country, Tutu cast his ire on Zuma to a greater degree than he did Mbeki: “Hey Mr. Zuma, you and your government don’t represent me. You represent your own interests … I am warning you out of love. I am warning you like I warned the nationalists [National Party Apartheid government] that one day we will start praying for the defeat of the ANC government. You are disgraceful.”36 Tutu was particularly upset with Zuma’s refusal to grant a visa to Tibet’s Dalai Lama, a move that seemed to reflect greater sympathies for an authoritarian Chinese government than the core human rights values enshrined in the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Relatedly, he was fingering the growing sense that Zuma was inclined to flout the rule of law and needed to be held to account. Widely seen as independent, the courts have even held Zuma personally accountable. He was convicted in the highest court for using state money to upgrade Nkandla. In a unanimous judgment, it ruled, “The President has failed to uphold, defend and respect the constitution as the supreme law of the land.” And indeed, the case came to the court in the first place owing to a March 2014 report of the government public protector.37 The court ordered that he respect the earlier report requiring him to repay the government money.38 And indeed, Zuma eventually did pay, taking out a second mortgage to do so.39 Some might say, not enough punishment for what he did. But it’s important to ask: Where else in the world does a president face such consequences while still in power? By April 2017, protest movements increasingly targeted Zuma directly. A popular hashtag, #ZumaMustFall, circulated widely on social media, and South Africans of every race began to hit the streets insisting that he resign.40 Thousands of South Africans returned to protest following yet another cabinet reshuffle that included the dismissal of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The 2017 protests were organized by Save SA—a collaboration of South African activists41 led by both members of the business community and old ANC stalwarts.42 One protester remarked, “I’m an ANC person but we want our old ANC back.”43 The Gupta-related scandals and the arms deal raised the ire of various government bodies charged with protecting the integrity of the government. The public protector, Thuli Madonsela, forced Zuma to appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate, among other things, his own multiple misdeeds. By the time of the 2019 election, the investigators were hard at work gathering evidence, and in several of my interviews with Mogale City political leaders in the run-up to the election, they had the television on, watching how the inquiry was unfolding and might be reverberating for their own political careers. Electoral Implications Given all of the media attention to the growing level of corruption within the country, the big question that remained was whether the general public—that is, voters—would take action. Again, one of the key features of South Africa’s electoral system is that for most contests, citizens vote for parties, not candidates, which meant that ANC supporters who opposed Zuma could not directly punish him without casting a vote for a less-preferred party. As the 2014 national and provincial election approached, Zuma’s documented bad behavior and various problems in the country amounted to blood in the water for rival political sharks. Political challenges mounted from both the right and the left, from White and Black. Importantly, a generational divide began to split the political arena, as those born in the early 1990s who had never lived under Apartheid—“Born Frees”—were coming of age as voters and as students, and they did not like what they saw. The most significant sources of political opposition during Zuma’s reign were embodied in two men who were both half his age, but in most ways, they could not have been more different. (And both would still be campaigning in 2019, as detailed in chapter 1.) First, there was young Julius Malema, who turned thirty-three prior to the 2014 election and was initially strongly favored by Zuma. The ANC had long recognized the political significance of young people, even before they demonstrated their revolutionary potential in the Soweto uprising. Malema’s supporters could liken him to a radical political leader, like Steve Biko, who on principled grounds challenged the ANC for taking its focus away from the needs of Black people. Alongside his working-class credentials, Malema also received multiple degrees, including in philosophy, and studied for an advanced degree at Wits (the University of the Witwatersrand, pronounced “Vits”), where he helped to politicize fellow students. From scratch, he built a new political party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a self-described “radical and militant economic emancipation movement.”44 Malema keenly used the symbolism of class identity, including the wearing of red hardhats and jumpsuits, to attract a loyal following.45 The EFF has rejected the racially inclusive approach of the ANC, moving from a discourse of “reconciliation” to one of “justice,” and brought ideas like expropriation of land and mines, without compensation, into the mainstream dialogue.46 Second, there was Mmusi Maimane, born in Krugersdorp, raised in the nearby Dobsonville section of Soweto, the product of a Xhosa-Tswana marriage, and ordained as a pastor. In May 2014, Maimane was elected to lead the DA’s parliamentary representation, and in 2015 he defeated Wilmot James (a Coloured academic who had led IDASA while I was an intern there) to become their new leader. For the first time, a Black African took the helm of a party that had previously relied disproportionately on the votes of Whites and Coloureds. It remained to be seen whether the party’s momentum could continue. Both Malema and Maimane relentlessly targeted Zuma for his corruption and bad policies in the run-up to the 2014 national elections. Undoubtedly, many ordinary ANC voters held their noses when they ticked their choices. It did turn out to be the ANC’s worst performance to date. Nonetheless, the party enjoyed a comfortable win with 62.1 percent of all votes. The DA took over 22 percent of the vote, and the EFF, just a year old, earned a remarkable 6.4 percent as third-place finisher, delivering 25 seats to the upstart party, which would afford a prominent and vocal platform for their policies. For now, the ANC and Jacob Zuma were here to stay. However, the everyday problems facing citizens were significant, public sentiment was growing foul, and protests mounted. In 2015, over 60 percent of Gauteng residents said they thought the country was going in the wrong direction.47 And in Parliament in May 2016, Maimane and other opposition party leaders would press and embarrass Zuma in angry exchanges concerning the details of his relationship with the Guptas.48 In this context, in August 2016, South Africans visited the voting booths once again, now to cast ballots to decide local elections. The contest turned out to be a watershed. To begin with, it boasted the highest turnout yet recorded for a local election, alongside an increased voter’s roll from 23 million in 2011 to 26 million in 2016.49 In many parts of the country, that August 3 election was a complete drubbing for the ANC, at least relative to how they had performed in all the previous elections. The party lost political control of several of the largest and most important municipalities, including Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay—the latter centered in Port Elizabeth, a traditional ANC stronghold.50 It still received almost 54 percent of all votes cast nationwide, but that was a huge setback, and the message was clear: the days of ANC “hegemony” were over. Nationwide, the DA increased its take of the vote to 27 percent and despite never having competed in a previous local election, the EFF received over 8 percent. The pushback was a largely urban phenomenon. The ANC failed to secure a majority in five of eight major municipalities (previously it had solidly controlled seven of the eight). This meant it would be in majority power in just three of the biggest cities and in coalition in two others. For South Africa’s increasingly urbanized, cosmopolitan, and multiracial middle class, Zuma was an embarrassment and an affront to the modernizing project they were advancing.51 While Gauteng was installing a high-speed train to move arriving passengers from Oliver Tambo International Airport to Johannesburg and Pretoria, Zuma would be photographed in traditional African regalia. The print media, including foreign media, made reference to his multiple wives,52 a not-so-subtle reminder that he was a traditional polygamist. It’s not as though the ANC lost all their voters in the urban areas. Rather, it was just enough to be consequential for who would govern. And as this was a local election, Zuma was not even on the ballot. To a large degree, all South African elections are referenda on the combined spheres of government and speak to voters’ views of the party in power. The opposition parties persisted in their drive to capture vote share. In August 2017, the DA advanced a motion of “no confidence” in the president, and a secret ballot freed up several ANC members to vote against Zuma in Parliament. This reflected splits within the ANC that had been festering since Mbeki’s presidency, but Zuma’s loss of popular support surely boosted the strength of his ANC rivals. While the motion did not pass, based on the vote count, at least 30 percent of the ANC MPs must have supported it, a telling sign in a country where the ANC had previously maintained strong party discipline.53 When it came time to select the future ANC leadership, the party’s elites had to decide whether to support Zuma’s ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, for more of the same. Zuma was not attempting a play at a third term, but returning another Zuma to the top of the ballot would have spoken volumes about the collective deafness of party insiders to the broader electorate. It was a hard-fought internal battle between rival sections of the ANC. At the December 2017 ANC convention, Ramaphosa—who had been serving as deputy president but in an increasingly strained relationship with Zuma—was selected as the next leader by a slim margin. Under consistent fire, in February 2018, Jacob Zuma finally resigned from office, and Ramaphosa moved into the presidency, turning the page on a dark chapter.54 This is how he became the “incumbent” running in the 2019 election. Closer to the People Analogous questions of politics and accountability have loomed large in local municipalities like Mogale City. By design, local governments were intended to bring democracy “closer to the people” with the notion that citizens would have more direct voice in government, especially through contact with their elected government leaders. As at the national level, several patterns have gnawed at democratic ideals, including the use of violence in politics and a degree of manipulation of political rules toward the end of securing political power. And perhaps quite understandably, these problems have weighed heavily on the attitudes and perceptions of ordinary citizens who are inundated with information about the failings of their government. I wondered whether I would wind up finding a story in Mogale City that was reminiscent of the national scandals documented above or local exposés that have become well-known on South African bookshelves. Yes, there was Bosasa, the Krugersdorp-based company implicated in large-scale national malfeasance. But what about in local government? When I pushed councillors, journalists, and citizens for clear examples of corruption in the form of stealing, they couldn’t come up with any. I didn’t see big luxury cars in the council parking lot, though I was told that at least one councillor maintained an expensive Harley Davidson motorcycle. I heard suspicions of favoritism in the awarding of some local government contracts and read reports of irregularities in processes relative to stated procedures, but I never found any smoking guns in terms of large-scale instances of government fraud. When I pushed for specifics, critics of the local ANC government mostly described bad policies and implementation, inequality, and incompetence. According to the critics, the local government operated with a bloated head count even while being unable to pay certain bulk service providers for the municipality’s access to water or electricity. These are quite fair and important concerns, nothing to celebrate. But this was not massive “state capture” at the local level or an epidemic of greed. Admittedly, the fact that I did not uncover massive fraud in government should not be taken as dispositive. Unlike other academic researchers, journalists, and disillusioned government employees who were embedded in local governments—as was the case in the examples cited above, including those documented in How to Steal a City—I always conducted my research as an outsider, and perhaps potential whistleblowers didn’t trust me to share their stories. Some DA councillors said they were fairly certain that evidence of corruption would eventually rear its head because there were simply too many irregularities in the government accounts to believe otherwise. But speculation is not evidence. Moreover, Mogale has had—at least for certain periods—a comparatively strong record on governance. In a rare nod, the Krugersdorp News reported in 2015, “Auditor General Applauds Mogale City,”55 detailing the fact that the municipality had received a clean audit. The regulator announced, “We are impressed highly by the level of governance in Mogale City and hope that we would be able to learn from the way this municipality has done its work.” And while a skeptic might worry that a government organization is likely to sugarcoat, the Auditor General’s reputation is very strong, and its reports have been generally extremely critical of local governments. In fact, the office titled its 2018–19 report on local government performance “Not Much to Go Around, Yet Not the Right Hands at the Till”; in the introduction it leveled a blanket condemnation of poor financial management for most municipalities.56 Nonetheless, even in that report, the office singled out Mogale City as one of two (out of a total of eight) Gauteng Province municipalities for being proactive and upgrading their financial oversight in line with best practices. Based on these reports, Mogale emerges as one of the better-governed of South Africa’s more than 200 local municipalities, but you would never know it from talking with most residents. In 2017, overwhelmingly, 86 percent of Mogale residents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “Corruption is the main threat to our democracy”—the level of agreement was almost identical to that of residents in all other Gauteng municipalities. Overall, sentiment about the municipality was lukewarm: about 29 percent said they were dissatisfied and another 12 percent very dissatisfied with local government.57 Even the Auditor General’s reports made clear that there was lots of room for improvement, but my larger point is that throughout South Africa, there are important success stories, including in local government, and yet those are rarely acknowledged or internalized. For example, one academic study by South Africa–based scholars simply declared that South African decentralization has failed with almost no recognition of within-country variation, appreciation of constraints, or reference to analogous attempts.58 Bare-Knuckled Competition Especially after 2004, Mogale residents, like millions of citizens across the country, increasingly engaged in some form of protest. (In 2013, just over 2 percent of Mogale residents reported taking part in a protest but that grew to over 8 percent in 2017–18.)59 And like protests in other democracies, these have manifested in a mix of constructive and destructive forms. Sometimes, they offer a unique opportunity for ordinary citizens to have their collective voices heard when it appears that their elected leaders and various elite intermediaries seem oblivious to their wants and needs. Other times, they provide opportunities to play out vendettas, advance agendas for career advancement, and may cause collateral damage in terms of human harm and property destruction. In a 2011 state of the city address, Mogale mayor Koketso Calvin Seerane couldn’t help but recognize that such service delivery protests were an indicator of citizens’ discontent and needed to be addressed by the government.60 Many citizens expected more than they were getting, and many returned to the streets in the manner of protest politics born of the Apartheid days. By the end of the first twenty years of South Africa’s democracy, the country would be forced to embrace the dishonorable label, “The Protest Capital of the World.”61 Concentrated largely in urban areas, in townships like Kagiso and Munsieville, such protests are usually referred to in quotation marks—that is, as “service delivery protests”—because they are largely, but not entirely, and certainly not always, directly motivated by concerns about basic service delivery, in the sense of water, electricity, sanitation, or housing. As they have come to encompass a broader range of demands and grievances, other observers have used the more apt label of community protest.62 For the most part, the protests are directed at local governments. And as several South African analysts note, citizens have used both ballots and “bricks”—a euphemism for the sometimes destructive quality of the protests—to keep politicians on their toes.63 For example, in 2014, unhappy, landless residents from a rural area in the northern part of Mogale City took to the streets and blocked an important thoroughfare, demanding title to land that would allow them to build their own houses. In July 2015, residents of an informal settlement in Muldersdrift, protesting about service delivery issues, burned garbage and blocked a route into Krugersdorp with rocks and trees. They highlighted that they still had just two water taps for almost twelve thousand people and no flush toilets, and that the settlement was on a swamp, which caused beds and personal belongings to frequently get wet.

Alongside news of national scandals, the monumental 2016 local election was held. As happened in several other municipalities, the ANC took a devastating hit in Mogale City. The party fell just short of a majority with 48.9 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, the largely White but increasingly multiracial DA came in a strong second with 34.9 percent. And the EFF took a significant 11.6 percent. And under the PR system, parties with even less support wound up with seats, making them politically important in a close election: the right-wing, largely Afrikaner Freedom Front Plus (FF+)—which took in less than 1 percent of the vote nationally in 2014—got 2.2 percent and 2 seats in Mogale; and the Zulu-based IFP received less than 1 percent of the vote, but it was enough for a single seat on the council. Every seat would matter. With such vote tallies, the ANC wound up just one seat short (38 of 77) of the majority required to vote in its own mayor at the first sitting of the local councillors less than two weeks after the polls closed. A coalition was needed to form a government, and national-level negotiations ultimately determined the political fate of Mogale City: the four opposition parties agreed to band together to kick the ANC out of power. That meant agreeing on who the councillors from these different parties would vote for when asked to select a mayor from among their ranks. Without too much fuss, they cast 39 votes for Lynn Pannall, from the DA, an older White woman with over a decade of experience as a councillor. It’s hard to know who was more shocked: the White Krugersdorpers who watched a Black mayor take charge more than twenty years earlier or these ANC councillors who looked on—“gobsmacked”64—as a White woman became mayor in a municipality that was comprised of more than 75 percent Black voters. Despite the high energy and higher hopes the coalition partners envisioned in their unseating of the ANC, coalition government itself proved extremely difficult, particularly with a bureaucracy now filled with ANC supporters (a reverse of the early post-Apartheid years when ANC political leaders at various levels of government would face seas of Afrikaner bureaucrats). The only thing these parties really shared was a disdain for the ANC. When it came to the priorities of the community, the parties represented distinct constituencies and promoted very different party platforms. For example, the DA was resolutely pro-market, while the EFF called for massive land redistribution. Style-wise, they were oil and water. Less than four months into her mayoral term, Mayor Pannall declared that she was exhausted and in need of medical leave and that she would resign her post just about immediately. (The work of a South African councillor must be one of the most stressful jobs out there; according to my own survey of councillors in 2016, a full 45 percent said they feared violence against them because of their work, a fear that is well-founded given the reality of violence they often face at the hands of rivals and disgruntled constituents.)65 To replace her, the DA put forward Michael Holenstein, a younger, entrepreneurial man, originally from Switzerland. And in short order, he became the second White mayor of the largely Black Mogale City Local Municipality in the post-Apartheid era. Holenstein explained to me that as mayor, he tried to clean house in the administration. Whereas Pannall had indicated a willingness to work with bureaucrats who had long served under the ANC, Holenstein said that he couldn’t get anything done, they were overpaying staff, and there was no clear organization or reporting structures in the administration. He tried to reorganize and to restructure the bureaucracy. Not surprisingly, the ANC did not see Holenstein in a particularly positive light, let alone the fact that they could not stand the notion of being out of power. Holenstein recalled trying to have community meetings and ANC supporters would dance and shout to interrupt him. Within six months, the ANC tabled a motion of no confidence, charging political interference in the administration and that he had put the municipality in a poor financial situation owing to bad policy leadership.66 Theoretically, the DA should have succeeded in rebuffing the motion with a simple majority. Officially, the coalition still stood. But when the ballots were counted, it passed with 39 votes. And when the council voted for mayor—a process that Holenstein decried because contrary to the rules of order, there was a secret vote, and despite being a candidate, the Speaker presided—now the ANC’s Lipudi came out on top.67 Someone—perhaps as many as three councillors—had turned their backs on the coalition. The ANC had clearly persuaded at least one councillor from a rival party to vote for them and insisted on a secret ballot, which would allow the defector to proceed anonymously. When I interviewed them about the unexpected transition, Mayor Lipudi as well as the new Speaker, Noluthando Mangole, recounted the episode in matter-of-fact terms, smiling. There was clearly a part of the story they would not share: how they persuaded a councillor from another party to vote for ANC leaders and who that person was. Mangole said it was justified that the ANC should be in power as they won the most votes: “We don’t have a party that is called coalition in the elections.” Of course, that was beside the point under the prevailing electoral rules for local government. FIGURE 6.2. Mogale City mayor Patrick Lipudi in his office, June 28, 2019. Lipudi passed away from a short illness (details unknown) in January 2020. Credit: Evan Lieberman. The DA was not happy. It implemented a lie detector test within its ranks. One councillor refused to take the test and offered his resignation instead while maintaining that he had not defected in the vote.68 In interviews, several councillors told me they believed the resigning councillor was the defector. They said he was unhappy to not have had a higher position in the local party and had been demoted from the mayoral committee. In turn, at least for a few months, the DA and the other opposition parties played their own game of “make-the-municipality-ungovernable,” and they boycotted the council sitting, making it impossible for the ANC, by council rules, to pass its budget. A DA provincial leader explained, “They have demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to get back into power in Mogale City so they can merely further their corruption. The DA will not stop fighting for the change that the people of Mogale City called for. We, along with our partners, will not simply sit back and let the ANC further plunder municipal resources.”69 The situation got ugly. At the end of August, a raucous council meeting involved a fistfight between EFF supporters and the local security agency sitting in the council gallery, spurned by frustrations around the fragile coalition.70 Meanwhile, street protests and revolts continued. In response, the local government sometimes used force to protect property rights or to quell disobedience.71 In particular, when protests involve squatters or land invasions, the municipality has frequently sent in the Red Ants,72 an infamous private security company that specializes in removing invaders.73 Their tactics remind many of the Apartheid days when the National Party government would infamously bulldoze the homes of Black residents living in White areas, arguing that the dwellings were in contravention of Apartheid law. On the eastern side of Mogale City, a growing informal settlement, adjacent to the thriving and luxurious Cradlestone Mall, stood in the way of further development plans for the owner, ABSA Bank. ABSA coordinated with the municipality to bring in the Red Ants to solve their problem in December 2018. At a cost of over 2 million rand, they moved the squatters to another spot in Muldersdrift, breeding more anger and frustration among residents.74 But Also Accountability In the wake of headline-catching problems and pathologies, the brief democratic history in Mogale—and across many of the urban and near-urban municipalities in South Africa—also reveals some important gains in terms of empowering citizens. Some of this I’ve observed directly, while other gains are only detectable by studying patterns in available data. To begin with, while the 2016 election in Mogale did not bring about lasting change in the composition of government, the hard-fought political battle was certainly evidence of growing electoral competition, which in turn seems to be key for political responsiveness in South Africa and elsewhere. Given the electoral cycle, such that no more than three years goes by without either a local or national/provincial election, there is never a time when a contest is both too far in the future or such a distant memory that any aspiring leader can rest on their laurels. In turn, councillors are well aware that their fortunes can always turn and that they depend on the support of the governed. Politicians say they are compelled to show up in various neighborhoods, to hear complaints, and to respond to them. One could say that talk is cheap, but there is good reason to believe that responsiveness impacts politicians’ careers. For example, Philip Martin, Nina McMurry, and I studied the renominations of elected councillors in Gauteng and around the country and examined whether the leading political parties simply deployed “loyal cadres” to valued local councillor positions or were willing to remove councillors who had lost the faith of citizens. Analyzing the career trajectories of over eight thousand councillors, we found that in areas where political competition was high, the leading parties (the ANC and the DA) were much more likely to end the careers of those who had failed to satisfy their constituents (as measured by responses to surveys). Those who were well regarded by citizens tended to be renominated or promoted. By contrast, in noncompetitive areas, party choices appeared uncorrelated with what citizens said about the quality of services or their own councillor.75 And while citizens may be angered by a lot of what they see, they are nonetheless extremely engaged not simply via protest but in the very institutions designed to channel links between voters and their representatives. In my Historical Memories Survey of Mogale residents who would have been eligible to vote in 1994, almost all Black residents reported having voted in all 5 national elections (average of 4.9 elections) including the 2014 election. For Whites, the average is somewhat lower at 4.7 (although a small share of the sample, those who didn’t vote in 1994, reported having voted much less frequently than those who did).76 Moreover, 41 percent of Mogale residents said they had participated in ward meetings and 41 percent in street committee or residents’ meetings, all of which reflect very high levels of community engagement.77 Despite the common refrain I heard that there is no effective opposition in South Africa, I found several instances of individuals and parties holding the government to account. For example, when I met with Juliana Steyn—the Afrikaner soldier who had to sing “Nkosi” the day of the first election and who in 2019 worked for a government agency—she explained to me that when the opposition parties ask questions in national parliament on designated days, people like her are forced to respond quickly with data and analysis so the relevant government official can provide coherent and factual responses. Such “fire drills” may distract employees from their immediate work, but they also serve an important accountability mechanism given a general fear of embarrassment at all levels. When I visited Mogale local council meetings I repeatedly saw that opposition questions and challenges were often met with resentful glares and words from ANC officeholders, but nonetheless, the engagement provoked research and responses. Relatedly, the Krugersdorp News publishes stories and pointed letters, which are read by many of the municipality’s top political leaders and, in turn, they frequently feel compelled to reply and to defend their positions. Indeed, several said as much to me. Moreover, White Krugersdorpers have largely chosen to engage the democratic system rather than exit it altogether, as one might have predicted in the early 1990s. Even the cultural autonomists in the FF+ who remain very interested in the prospects of developing a separate homeland, or Volkstaat, actively participate in local politics: Whites have found representation in political parties, campaigned, held office, and channeled their frustrations with ballots, not the bullets some extremists had threatened to use prior to Mandela’s inauguration. Perhaps this is not surprising, as Whites do still overwhelmingly constitute the local tax base, and they want to have some oversight regarding how money is spent. Yet, their willingness to scrutinize budgets and to highlight inconsistencies almost surely keeps government officials on their toes in a way that would not be true in their absence. It is also worth highlighting the challenging and important role that ward councillors play, especially in lower-income neighborhoods and townships. These are South Africa’s only directly elected leaders, and for many, this is a tough job. Each councillor represents a constituency of about ten thousand people, and their home address and mobile phone number are known to all. And their phone must be switched on for most of the day. They are regularly called on by their constituents for every type of problem, sometimes way beyond the scope of their legal mandates—including marital and neighborly disputes. I interviewed several ward councillors in Mogale City, and dozens around the country, and many proudly showed me their extensive WhatsApp chats, containing endlessly long back-and-forths with constituents, replete with lists of questions and needs and the responses they provided. Particularly for Black constituents whose families did not benefit from generations of obtaining access to government services, councillors serve as important intermediaries in helping them attain basic documents like proof of residence or ensuring that an ambulance arrives when they need medical care. Ward councillors vary widely in terms of their efforts and how they are received by their communities. But the logic of electoral competition in competitive wards incentivizes responsiveness toward these needs as such outreach seems to affect citizen perceptions and, in turn, party and voter decisions about whether to keep incumbents in place.78 And because these councillors generally live within the communities they serve, citizens hold them accountable through everyday interactions, what one scholar aptly labeled, in a different context, “dignified public expression.”79 Of course, not all are successful—many are downright derelict in their duties—but for those regarded as effective, citizens report that the key traits are demonstration of efforts to attain access to public services and simply being available to listen to their needs.80 Tshepo Nzwane—who came to be a local councillor after a childhood in which he bombed the local school—said that one hundred to two hundred people show up at each of his community meetings. For millions of people who never had a say in government, their votes and opinions are very meaningful with respect to whether that individual keeps their job, and they have the opportunity to inform and be informed by that representative on a regular basis. Much of this is the mundane stuff of everyday democratic government. Still, this is what past generations understandably wished for. Comparative Perspectives: From Laggard to Leader Democratic “success” is a matter of perspective and requires a field of vision that spans both time and space. The notion that South Africa became a relatively robust liberal democracy during the post-Apartheid era might be difficult to see when buried beneath many quotidian realities. As such, it’s important to consider some of the failures and accomplishments in governance in a more comparative perspective. First let’s consider the worries that a single party, the ANC, would dominate politics so thoroughly that South Africa would become like the Mexican one-party state under the PRI. In practice, between 1994 and 2016, citizens went to the polls five times to vote in national and provincial elections, and five additional times for local government elections. The elections have been certified time and again without major instances of vote rigging, ballot-box stuffing, voter intimidation, or the like. Looking back now, we know that South Africa did not become a one-party state. It is true that, as shown in figure 6.3, the ANC received the majority of all votes cast in every electoral contest, and gains in 1999 and 2004 contributed to a sense at the time that South Africa was well on its way to single-party domination.81 But the trends have not moved toward a monopolization of political power. In fact, just the opposite has happened. By the time of the 2019 election, an ANC victory was clearly not a foregone conclusion. Not only has South Africa avoided the problem of “three-termism,”82 no president has served even two full terms. Even when the ANC managed to achieve a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament,83 the party did not use this as an occasion to rewrite the constitution in a manner that would radically tilt the rules in its own favor or to the benefit of its main constituents. While the majority of all constitutional amendments (13 of 17) were implemented from 1999 to 2009, most addressed questions of boundary management and between-election party-switching among elected leaders. To a degree, these may have been designed with ANC interests in mind regarding political control and centralization of power, but they were minor tweaks and, as we know now, certainly did not manage to stem the tide of ANC political losses in subsequent years. FIGURE 6.3. ANC vote share, elections 1994–2016. Source: Author analysis of IEC data. Relatedly, there were and continue to be grave concerns about corruption in South Africa. Throughout history, public officials, entrusted to work on behalf of society, have frequently used their powers and influence to secure private gains for themselves and for their families. Corrupt practices were problematic in the early days of the (White) South African Republic and in the postcolonial Nigerian state. As the German sociologist Max Weber documented with respect to India in the early Middle Ages, government officeholders used their positions expressly to secure benefits for themselves.84 Corruption was notoriously prevalent in various American cities, it has been a problem in Asian success stories, including Japan and China, and it has been at the root of many failures in African governance. The Scandinavian countries and a few others seem to have escaped major corruption problems, but not most. Corruption is highly prevalent in much of Africa, and one compelling explanation for such practice in post-Apartheid South Africa and in other parts of the continent is the theory of the Nigerian political scientist Peter Ekeh. He presciently argued with respect to his own country that following generations of rule under an illegitimate colonial state, many postcolonial bureaucrats felt more compelled to deliver directly to their immediate kinship networks than to serve the broad mandates of what had long been an illegitimate state, designed to plunder.85 When viewed in comparative perspective, the extent of South African corruption, including increases in corruption, does not appear as extreme as South African commentators frequently portray. As a starting point, a substantial amount of government behavior that would be labeled as corruption today was rife under Apartheid. (And that is separate from the fact that the system itself was founded on a wildly unjust proposition, so the degree of bureaucratic “integrity” within such a system is not much to celebrate.) One carefully documented study revealed that the White-run state routinely engaged in corrupt arms and oil deals in order to subvert sanctions.86 The fact that foreign governments and arms corporations would wind up engaged with the ANC in similar practices may say more about the period before democracy than about the recent past. Moreover, on most international comparative scales (based primarily on expert opinion), South Africa still upholds higher levels of government integrity than most. In the 2019 Transparency International rating of 180 countries, South Africa ranked seventieth (least corrupt), tied with Hungary and Romania, above China and India, and fifth among continental countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, knowing a country’s GDP per capita in 1990 predicts two-thirds of the variation in country corruption scores in 2019, and on that basis alone, South Africa’s corruption score is almost perfectly predicted.87 While this may not be much consolation for South African citizens whose public resources are pilfered, it does suggest that the extent of South African corruption may not be as remarkable as sometimes argued. It’s also important to consider the problems of crime and violence, prominent realities in Mogale City and throughout South Africa. Most South Africans identify these as serious concerns, and the scars of violent confrontations are plain to see. As with corruption, we can expect a degree of violence in all societies, but the question is, how much is there, and to what extent does it undermine the democratic project itself? In fact, the very point of democracy is to resolve questions of leadership selection and other conflicts without violence.88 Once again, post-Apartheid South Africa is very much a product of its past. As I discussed in chapter 4, we cannot lost sight of the fact that Krugersdorp itself was born as a violent town and the Union of South Africa was forged out of extraordinarily violent conflict in its original incarnation in the early part of the twentieth century. The institutionalization of White supremacy was a violent process89 that was eventually met with several decades of violent resistance, culminating in civil war. Half-hearted attempts to introduce Black local government under Apartheid government provoked further cycles of violence. For example, on September 3, 1984—“Bloody Monday”—Black township residents throughout the West Rand protested against service fee increases and the perceived illegitimacy of local councillors, resulting in four killed, events followed by increased state repression and mushrooming body counts.90 Combining such history with the country’s vast inequality, it is hardly surprising that violence has persisted in the post-Apartheid era. The prevalence of violence is not at all unique to South Africa’s democracy. In many countries of the Global South—including India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines—it is a routine aspect of political life. Along these lines, one analyst proposed the new label of “violent democracy”91 for South Africa, applicable to these other countries as well. In related research and analysis, observers have highlighted the ways in which inequalities of wealth and power frequently result in violent conflict. Claims made concerning violations of public trust around corruption are sometimes themselves the result of frustrated actors who have found themselves shut out of patronage links.92 Particularly disturbing is the extent of violence involved in the struggle to obtain and to maintain positions in local government councils. Between the start of 2016 and September 2018, approximately ninety politicians were killed in the context of turf battles, struggles for office, and reprisals, including against those who acted as whistleblowers in exposing government corruption.93 To recognize that such violence has strong historical and comparative precedents does not imply that it is tolerable. Whether in South Africa or elsewhere, there may be a tipping point at which we can no longer describe these countries as being governed by ballots but rather by bullets. It is hard to say exactly how to draw that line, but for all the violence that finds a home in contemporary South Africa, it is still not the basis for most leadership selections or policymaking. Violence in South Africa and many other countries can still be understood as awful by-products of still incomplete democratic development. And even wealthy and long-standing democracies like the United States remain vulnerable to violent conflict in political life. Moreover, we should not lose sight of the big picture—that democratic institutions appear to have been central in solving the problem of existential crisis, putting an end to civil war, and lowering the amount of measured political violence in South Africa. For example, based on a systematic coding of social conflicts across the African continent, more than 12,000 deaths resulted from various social conflicts in South Africa between the start of 1990 and April 24, 1994 (preelection). By contrast, for the much longer period after the 1994 election until the end of 2017, the number from such causes was less than 2,500. South Africa went from being the deadliest place on the continent in terms of such conflict-related fatalities to being completely unremarkable in comparative terms.94 While there are important examples of the post-Apartheid government using deadly force against striking workers and protesters, these are still a rarity and the state no longer routinely kills and tortures people to advance its agenda. In fact, a serious mismatch between trends in crime, including violent crime (which has largely gone down), and perceptions and fears of crime and violence (which continue to go up) during the post-Apartheid period perhaps unfairly contributes to concerns about the quality of democracy. For example, the homicide rate in South Africa has fallen dramatically since 1994. Notwithstanding some uptick in recent years, the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people dropped from 63 in 1994 to 35.7 in 2017,95 and yet, I am quite sure you would never learn this from talking to ordinary South Africans in Mogale or almost anywhere else. Two different studies, one for the period 1998–200396 and another that extends to 2016–17,97 both highlight that even with corroborated data revealing either stabilization or decline in crime rates, citizens report feeling more unsafe. Part of the problem may be that even with some reductions, overall South African levels are very high, and it is this persistence that shapes attitudes. Or it might be widespread discussion in the media or social media and/or particular crimes that most affect citizen perceptions. In any case, the notion that during the democratic era things have begun to “spin out of control” simply does not accord with reality in the country. FIGURE 6.4. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. Finally, I want to point out that democratic practice itself has been remarkably successful when seen in comparative terms. For example, based on metrics from the Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) project, and with respect to their Electoral Democracy and slightly more demanding Liberal Democracy indexes, looking back again to the 1980s, South Africa was truly a global laggard in the practice of liberal democracy, ranking 113th out of 169, just above Uzbekistan. But it propelled itself into the top 50 in global rankings in the early 1990s, making one of the biggest jumps worldwide. South Africa’s democratization path is clearly demonstrated in figures 6.4 and 6.5, which depict the V-DEM Democracy scores relative to other Upper-middle-income and other African countries. FIGURE 6.5. Electoral Democracy Scores, South Africa compared to other African countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. And frankly, when considering just about every dimension measured with respect to democratic process—an open media environment that allows for the free circulation of information, including a free press that actively attempts to monitor government practice; freedom for civil society (organizations of people independent from the state); and a judiciary that can similarly act independently of the government and can rebuke practices that contravene the fundamental laws of the land, as established in the constitution—South Africa performs extremely well in comparative perspective.98 On several dimensions, the expert coders report some decline in democratic performance after 2012, no doubt owing to many of the scandals during the Zuma presidency. Nonetheless, relative to the democratic retreat in many other countries, including in Africa, South Africa’s decline was modest and the country mostly held steady in the eyes of observers with a broad comparative framework in mind. Recalling the location of a key set of goalposts, the Freedom Charter offered a set of ideals for a political future, including the idea that multiracial democracy should be understood not simply as a means to an end but an end in itself. And on such scores, given the historical record just presented, the shift from “unfreedom” to “freedom” in the political arena was absolutely profound in South Africa. Many will quite reasonably retort, “You can’t eat freedom.” Which is why it’s also important to consider post-Apartheid trends in material prosperity, the subject of the next chapter.",

Famously, the document declared, “There Shall be Houses, Security, and Comfort.” Almost forty years later, those dreams were still not realities for millions of South Africans. As such, during its first electoral campaign in 1994, the ANC’s party leaders promised to provide houses, health care, lighting, security, and other sources of material prosperity to those who went without. In fact, when he was speaking to prospective voters, Mandela could sometimes be mistaken for an ordinary politician, as he promised “a better life for all” if elected. Stanley Greenberg, a veteran American political strategist who assisted with the inaugural ANC campaign, recalled Mandela as being a fiercely competitive politician. The liberation stalwart was not satisfied with the idea of simply taking in the votes they would receive because of his organization’s role in the struggle or his own personal stature.1 Mandela wanted to win the election convincing citizens that an ANC government would actually deliver concrete improvements to their lives. Moreover, the 1996 constitution enshrined several material needs as rights, including with respect to health care, reproductive health, sufficient food and water, adequate housing, basic education, and social security for those unable to support themselves. By 2019, even in Mogale City, located in South Africa’s richest province and industrial heartland, citizens routinely asserted that the government had failed to deliver what people needed. The rhetoric surrounding persistent service delivery protests echoed what many residents—Black and White—said to me in interviews: the government has accomplished nothing. And throughout the 2019 election campaign, political opponents pointed to the realities of poverty, inequality, and obvious human want as evidence of the government’s disastrous performance over the previous quarter century. In turn, many suspect that democracy has not been a help but rather a hindrance to human development. To be sure, the record is littered with disappointments. The complaints and protests are rooted in actual instances of deprivation. And South Africa remains a profoundly unequal society. Yet, it is also the case that since the end of Apartheid, South Africa has chalked up some extraordinary accomplishments in terms of improving the material well-being of its citizens, especially the most vulnerable. And much of this can be directly linked to democratic practice—that is, the application of competitive political pressures to enact and to implement development-enhancing policies. Moreover, many of the disappointments and even the severe shortfalls of the post-Apartheid record reflect at least as much about the continued weight of the country’s historical legacies and global conditions as they do about the performance of democratic government. Various government critics have rightly highlighted how social and economic policies and practices could have been more thoroughgoing, implemented earlier and more efficiently. But if we take a step back to focus not just on the critiques but also on what has been accomplished during the first quarter century, we see that much of the record on material progress, especially for the poor, and in light of the country’s history, is quite remarkable. First, I consider the conditions of human settlement, including access to basic services, where the changes are most apparent especially at the local level. Second, I look at the challenge of growing and equalizing cash incomes. And third, I briefly describe the record of investing in human capital, including with respect to health and education. Once again, I try to highlight patterns in Mogale relative to the rest of South Africa, and South Africa in comparative context. Give Me Shelter From 1994, the idea of a “better life” for millions of South Africans largely connoted gaining access to formal housing and basic services—electricity, water, and sanitation. And to varying degrees, politicians from the ANC, and from competing parties, promised during all of the subsequent election campaigns that they would expand access to these.2 For millions of people, the results were life-changing. The most important signature project was the RDP house: RDP is the acronym for the first government’s economic and development strategy, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. In a country where millions of people lacked reliable shelter, the government proposed to build millions of homes. While the design has undergone some revision over the years, it has always been a very basic, rectangular concrete structure with a tin roof, designed to provide accommodation for a single family. The intentions and ambitions were noble: people deserve to live in a real, secure shelter, not in an overcrowded shack. If your household income fell below a certain level, and you were a South African citizen, you would be eligible to get one of these houses. But you had to get in line. Good data on the number of houses actually built are hard to come by. One reasonable estimate that echoes what various government officials have shared with me is that between 1994 and 2015, over 2.8 million houses were delivered, meaning that approximately one-third of all South African residences are fully subsidized by the government.3 Certainly nowhere else in Africa has such a scheme existed, and I have not been able to find anything comparable anywhere in the Global South, let alone in the richest countries. The most generous programs elsewhere involve low-cost loans or subsidies for housing, but not a title deed to a house free of charge. Due in large part to the RDP, in 2016, 79 percent of South Africans lived in formal housing—marking a 21-percentage-point gain since 1995.4 And beyond just houses, statistical data reveal an important and broader portrait of change, one in which democratic pressures have arguably been quite important. First, consider electrification. In 1996, 58 percent of households had electricity connections and by 2016, over 90 percent had access.5 To be sure, the country has in recent years faced long periods of rolling blackouts and sometimes-interrupted power supplies—all of which are the sources of daily frustration and anger. Yet, the transformation in access is both impressive and, to a degree, the cause of such shortages as so many more people now make demands on the system. Consider also basic water and sanitation services. In 1996, just 47 percent of Black Africans had piped water in their dwellings (compared with over 96 percent of Whites).6 By 2011, that figure had jumped to 67 percent for Black Africans (and 99 percent of Whites). By 2015, over 95 percent of all South Africans had direct access to piped water.7 In 1996, just 50 percent of households had access to flush toilets connected to sewerage systems or septic tanks. By 2016, coverage increased to 64 percent of households.8 And in an important related public health trend, in 2000, over 12 percent of the population practiced open defecation, but that was down to less than 2 percent by 2018.9 These are solid jumps in service coverage in the context of a growing population—but I don’t want to overstate the South African picture because in countries around the world, citizens have also enjoyed substantial improvements in recent decades. For example, across sub-Saharan Africa, the gains in electrification coverage were from 16 percent to 43 percent; among Low- and Middle-income countries, the number of households covered went from 65 percent to 85 percent. Nonetheless, South Africa still outperforms these group averages. South Africa also bested neighbors Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Mozambique in terms of gains in service coverage. Only in Botswana was the overall change more significant (17 percent had access to electricity in 1995; 64 percent had it in 2016) but, of course, from a much lower base.10 The fact that we’ve observed all of this progress during the era of democratic politics doesn’t necessarily imply that democracy caused these changes. It’s impossible to know how things would have been under a different type of political system. Looking at the timing and geographic distribution of who got what and when, there are good reasons to think that democratic pressures—starting from the Mandela campaign—did play a role. For example, one excellent study demonstrates that in areas where electricity was provided by the national parastatal (Eskom), during the 1996–2001 period, increased electrification of households was most profound in the areas with the largest numbers of newly enfranchised (i.e., non-White) voters.11 The authors interpret this to imply that since just about everywhere the new pivotal voters were Black and likely without electricity, this would lead the government to want to be responsive to voters in providing this service in order to improve the likelihood of a win in the next election. And they argue that those in power were acting to satisfy a large number of new voters who largely lacked services—a winning strategy if voters value them. Relatedly, for a later period (approximately 2001–11), Daniel de Kadt and I found that changes in levels of citizen support for the ANC across almost three thousand wards was inversely related to changes in the extent of basic service provision, especially of water access. Although initially counterintuitive, we concluded that this was a nuanced form of accountability and now potentially more forward-looking. For those areas that had not yet seen great improvements in service provision, citizens were more likely to continue to support the ANC in the hopes that they would be next, whereas the citizens in now-serviced areas were more likely to be looking to other parties to focus on policies beyond basic service provision.12 Together, these studies highlight the ways in which the links between service delivery and voting can incentivize action, especially when political competition is high. While electoral pressures may always loom large, the courts and appeals to constitutional rights have also proved to be extremely important sources of pressure for government to provide basic services for the poor, including with respect to housing, land rights, health, and education. For example, the legal case Government of the Republic of South Africa vs. Grootboom (2000) was particularly influential. Irene Grootboom and others had been evicted from their informal dwellings by the government, which was trying to build some low-cost housing on their site. In turn, drawing on the constitutional right to shelter, Grootboom went to court to force the government to provide at least temporary adequate housing, especially because children were involved. The court found that, indeed, the government had this obligation, which essentially breathed life into the aspirations of the constitution, saying that these rights were not simply platitudes but needed to be enforced. The ruling argued that the denial of shelter was tantamount to the denial of human dignity and the opportunity to enjoy other rights enshrined in the constitution.13 While that judgment had many positive long-term effects in helping to make the courts an effective vehicle for social transformation, and securing the right to housing, one cannot escape the unfortunate reality that Irene Grootboom herself never got housing and died poor and in a shack in 2008. Many South Africans have been frustrated and frequently engage in protest because supply has not kept up with demand. To put the size of the promise in perspective, each house costs approximately 10,000 USD to build, and South Africa’s per capita income is less than 7,000 USD. Nonetheless, these political pressures continue to keep further development and allocation of RDP houses on the political agenda, often to the dismay of local politicians, who face running lists of people waiting for theirs. Township Life Traveling up and down Mogale City’s rolling hills and around its sometimes narrow streets, I spoke with citizens, politicians, journalists, and civil society leaders. I tried to learn the extent to which the statistical portraits described above resonated with the lived realities in various neighborhoods, with a particular focus on the predominantly Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville and the formal and informal settlements around the more rural Muldersdrift. I concluded in short order that the municipality is not a standout success story by any means, nor is it the opposite. In fact, Mogale’s record of development seems to reflect much of what has transpired in other midsized South African municipalities. Norman Sedumedi, a former teacher who serves as the councillor for Ward 24 in Munsieville, the township in which he was born and raised, provided some history. As an ANC politician with a record to defend, he wanted to highlight progress when I asked if there was any to report. Still, the facts of what he shared with me when I asked, “What’s changed?” were easily corroborated, including by my own site visits. He spoke of Munsieville’s relatively new sports complex and a regional park, as well as the fact that all the streets were tarred and that all the houses, except some small and newer informal settlements, had electricity. He described the high school and the primary schools built to accommodate additional children and to reduce the length of their walk to school. The government had built health clinics and early childhood development and youth centers. He conceded that many of them don’t work as they had hoped or intended. I passed the relatively new senior center on multiple occasions, and indeed, I could see throngs of older residents coming and going, and at least superficially, it appeared to play a vibrant role in the community. By contrast, the tennis courts without nets that stood barren next to a locked recreational center reminded me how public projects can sometimes become white elephants. FIGURE 7.1. Corane Street, Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. When it came to the subject of housing and service provision, Sedumedi shared both a record of pride and a concern for dependency on the state in the context of low growth and high unemployment. He also expressed a general sense of exasperation that “it is a moving target. You never get it right for as long as people are alive and for as long as we have not fixed the issue of changing the economic landscape. Because the more the economy remains as it is, all of the burden will be for the state.” He said that since 1994, between 3,000 and 4,000 RDP houses had been built in the area. He worried that free housing, health care, and education might be disincentivizing people to work. On the other hand, it’s also hard to imagine how productive people could be without these basic needs. In the larger Black township of Kagiso, I spoke with seventy-nine-year-old Lerato Dube. We met at the Kagiso Methodist Church on a Tuesday afternoon, the time she serves soup to local residents. Her hair was wrapped in a bright green ANC bandana, and it was just a day before the 2019 election. She insisted on being referred to as Gogo (Zulu for Granny) and on serving me as well, so I obliged with some embarrassment at being fed a meal meant for those who actually needed one. But there was more soup available than takers on that afternoon, and this was her preference. So while I ate, I asked her to tell me about her life, what had changed, what had stayed the same. Dube was born in KwaZulu-Natal a few years before Apartheid was implemented14 and recounted what amounted to local transformation. When I [came to] Kagiso [in] 1992, Kagiso wasn’t like this. They were making fires with coal and wood. There was no electricity. They were lighting candles and lamps. There was no road. The taxi was no taxi because there was no road. It looked like a field.15 … Times goes and comes until 1994, then we ask electric and got. Then we asked for water. Even the water, it was very, very slow. The old house, that’s the other side of our house, there was the water on the outside. They were not allowed to make a pipe to put the water inside. If you want to wash, in cold or raining or snowing, you stand outside and do your washing or maybe bathing. After 1994, things [were becoming] better and better because now … we got water everywhere. We got the right toilet everywhere. Then we got the proper houses. Older South Africans, like other South Africans, have many concerns and frustrations about what has not changed, and about the changes they see that are for the worse, including increased drug use and violence among young people. But like Dube, many highlight that the material circumstances of their lives are radically different today from what they previously experienced, particularly for those who moved from shacks and squatter camps to their own homes. Notable exceptions are those who worked as teachers or nurses during the Apartheid days, who tended to have access to simple but formal government houses and some basic services. As of 2018, approximately 20 percent of all Black Mogale residents lived in RDP houses.16 Moreover, basic service delivery has expanded widely. In my sample, of adults forty years of age and older who said they had always lived in the area of Mogale City, as shown in figure 7.2, the racial gap in service delivery closed quite dramatically during the democratic era. In 1994, just 24 percent of Blacks had access to electricity, while 79 percent of Whites had access; by 2019, both approached universal access: 84.5 percent of Blacks and 95.4 percent of Whites.17 For Black South Africans who received RDP houses, they were much more likely to have access to other basic services compared with all other Black South Africans. For instance, in Mogale City, 99 percent of those living in RDP houses in 2019 had access to electricity, flush toilets, and piped water. Among all other Black residents, 15 to 20 percent fewer Black households had access to those services.18 Again, the RDP houses are modest structures generally erected in neighborhoods that look nothing like the established suburbs of Krugersdorp North or Noordheuwel, which are still mostly populated by Whites. While the houses were meant to displace shacks, in many cases, homeowners have built shack “additions,” which they rent out, or they move into the additions themselves and rent out the house. In many cases, homeowners have sold their homes, sometimes to recently arrived foreign nationals, which has generated resentment and has tended to exacerbate the sense of a fundamental housing crisis, certainly in Mogale City. FIGURE 7.2. The Black-White gap in basic service delivery, Mogale City (1970–2019). Source: Author analysis of HMS_2019. Based on survey responses for year of access among respondents who always lived in Mogale City area. All of these patterns are frustrating but quite understandable responses to the basic condition of having an asset but little income. In turn, many RDP housing developments do not present as vibrant communities or the sources of local or national pride that planners once might have hoped. Nonetheless, even well-founded frustrations ought not obscure the fundamental accomplishment of providing formal shelter for so many. Ethembalethu: A Case Study of Possibility Most RDP housing communities are characterized by a somewhat harsh and uninviting design aesthetic, familiar among state-sponsored housing developments the world over. One notable and positive exception is virtually hidden amid the farmlands, light industry, and scenic wedding venues of Muldersdrift in northeast Mogale City. The area typifies “urban periphery,” in the sense that one is surrounded by agriculture and agro-industry, and yet, in just a few minutes you can be in a sizable town, and in less than an hour, a major urban metropolis. A community called Ethembalethu (“ours” in Zulu) proved to be one of the most extraordinary RDP housing developments I’ve seen anywhere in South Africa. I traveled to the area for the first time on the recommendation of a local activist who, having learned of my broader interests, suggested I check it out. The story of how this community came to be offers important reminders of the social and political hurdles that remain for human development even in the post-Apartheid era, as well as the ways in which wealthy White landowners still wield enormous power despite their relatively small numbers. It also highlights the opportunities for organized citizens to achieve their goals and to build robust and prosperous communities, including through democratic participation and engagement. Ethembalethu sits at the end of an unmarked road just off the M5, a few miles north of Krugersdorp. An unoccupied guard station serves as a gateway to the neighborhood. The area is comprised of more than one hundred houses, all with the same basic RDP “core” structure, but most of the owners have expanded their living spaces with sturdy additions. Residents had painted the outsides in bright colors with different finishes, and many owners planted small lawns out front. On the various days I visited, groups of people walked the streets, talking and visiting with neighbors. It was not a luxury development, but from the outside, it radiated a sense of security and comfort and amounted to not simply a set of houses but a coherent community. And unlike in Munsieville and Kagiso, in Ethembalethu, there were no shacks anywhere (a fact I verified with satellite images from Google Maps). To learn more, I was referred to Molefi Selibo. As councillor for Ward 23, Selibo had his champions and his detractors within Mogale City, as most ambitious political leaders do. But even his critics were willing to acknowledge that his efforts in building the Ethembalethu community were successful, and perhaps even exemplary. On a return visit, I contacted Selibo and he agreed to meet with me in his small ward office, situated in a converted shipping container off Clinic Road in Muldersdrift, just south of the RDP community. FIGURE 7.3. Row of RDP houses in Ethembalethu community, Muldersdrift, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Selibo was born near the largely Afrikaner city of Bloemfontein in 1958 and came to the Muldersdrift area in search of work in 1986. An entrepreneur, he built a hair salon business, which he maintained for twenty years, and like barbers and hairdressers the world over, people came to him with their concerns, looking for advice. He recalled his efforts with pride: “A lot of people were interested to come to my salon because of how I handled issues. They said, ‘I think you can assist us as a community leader.’ ” He took on this role and highlighted that Black people in Muldersdrift had long lived with housing insecurity. They tended to stay on the farms where they worked. And if your boss fired you, you also lost your home. Political change offered the promise of new opportunities, but absent any specific promises about how they would get houses, in 1994, Selibo decided to start an organization, mainly to mobilize the community to buy land. And by 1996, they formally established the Muldersdrift Home Trust Foundation. At the time, Selibo himself resided in a small structure built by a White landowner, lived without electricity, and used a pit toilet. The fundamental strategy of the nascent organization was to require members to contribute 100 rand per month in a saving scheme, in order to accumulate the capital needed to buy land and to form a partnership with government. Less than a year later, they identified an appropriate parcel and began negotiations with a landowner, who initially agreed, with a modestly revised counterproposal. However, when other White landowners learned about the deal that was being struck—which would bring a sizable group of Black neighbors to subdivide a plot for housing—they persuaded him to not sell and bought the land away from him. At the time, Selibo had about two hundred members and they persisted, identifying yet another piece of land. This time they were more careful about the negotiations and tried to ensure that White landowners would not get wind of the deal. They negotiated and signed an agreement in 1997. At that point, they began to engage town planners, environmentalists, and others to formalize the arrangement. Yet once again, the prospect of this new community rooting itself in Muldersdrift did not sit well with many White residents from the area. As Selibo explained, “The challenge was that those who were in charge at that time were very close to White landowners in the area. [Ours] was the first organization led by a Black community in the White area … and they were not comfortable with that.” Soon thereafter, Selibo received another cancellation letter, as the landowners had pressured the seller to renege on the agreement. Selibo pushed back and said they had a binding contract. Even in post-Apartheid South Africa, with Black-led local, provincial, and national governments, the system still seemed stacked against them. Selibo recounted, “When the community was visiting the site, the landowners called police who came and arrested the people who were visiting. ‘They are trespassing.’ And they obliged. We were arrested on the property that we bought.” Selibo continued on, and the White landowners tried another tack: they withdrew from their frivolous court case against Selibo’s group and approached him with the offer of an out-of-court settlement. They would pay Selibo’s group for all of their costs, including lawyers’ fees, and for the price of the land including interest, and on top of that, an additional 250,000 rand. The Whites were willing to pay a tidy sum to avoid having Black neighbors. Insulting, of course, but Selibo and his community decided to take the money in a 1999 settlement, and then they identified a new plot that was almost four times the size of the original. Once again, they negotiated with the landowner, but now they didn’t have enough to cover the full price of the larger plot. They wrote to the provincial government and the national government to share their story and to ask for assistance. During that time, it was not easy for a nongovernment organization—for a government to give it money. We were still new in the democracy and didn’t have all the legislation. [The government] was very interested and supportive of our approach in terms of dealing with the housing issue. They were very interested and said we will assist … but we will transfer money to the municipality, and then you and the municipality will enter into a land agreement to drive this forward. From that point, in 2002, Selibo said he continued to meet with members every two weeks to keep them informed. Along with the municipality, they submitted a “township application,” and by local code, this triggered an invitation for local comments. Yet again, White landowners organized and tried in various ways to object. And according to Selibo, many of the people handling housing-related issues in the area were still White and still sympathetic to the landowners, and this led to more delays. The process would be delayed and delayed and delayed. They didn’t realize we were becoming specialists. You do like that to a person you are empowering that person. So now we are able to articulate each and every aspect of development. We were able to do our homework to do deal with the landowners in the area and to defend ourselves in the process, but it took a long time. A “long time” is really an understatement. But the agreements were finally approved. Selibo and his community received the land, and the government agreed to build RDP houses on it. In April 2014, more than 120 houses were finally completed and the government handed them over to waiting residents. The national government news agency released a piece announcing the ceremony, in which a Mogale local government leader proclaimed, “Land is important to human settlements. We need land to build houses and when you have a house, your dignity is restored.”19 For all the endless stories about what has not worked in terms of housing and development in South Africa, I was surprised to find almost no coverage of the ceremony or the development itself in the news media.20 Selibo highlighted that more recently, another 133 houses had been approved for development. When I asked him why he thought that the final product appeared so different from other RDP communities, he emphasized that what made the community unique was that it had developed solidarity through the years, and they created their own informal zoning regulations, which reflected a desire to avoid what had gone wrong elsewhere. Now we have a code of conduct. You can extend, but you can’t have a shack, you can’t sell it. But now the issue is that … it is a beautiful safe village and no one wants to move. Everyone wants to get a space here. They realize we have a treasure here. Especially in that village, their lives have improved significantly and the way we have been doing the work in the area, we have assisted them to get job opportunities, because we have worked as a family for a long time. It’s not easy in the country with high unemployment rate, but in that village, close to 99 percent are working because we have instilled responsibility. Even if they go and work for you … they have instilled a sense of responsibility and built one another. You would be very happy if someone came to work for you given how they conduct themselves. Also discussing how can we build ourselves. Their lives have improved a lot. When I conducted my Historical Memories Survey in Mogale, I decided to “oversample” in Ethembalethu to see whether the assertions of success had any merit. In a typical survey, given the small size of the area relative to the rest of Mogale City, we might have wound up with zero or just a few of the residents. But I was interested to see if the area was “the real deal” from the perspective of the people who actually lived there. We interviewed fourteen owners of these RDP houses, which is still a very small sample—more illustrative than statistically representative—but enough to shed some light on what makes the community unique. For example, 79 percent said they “never” felt unsafe walking in their neighborhood, as compared with 52 percent of Blacks in other areas of the same ward, and compared with just 34 percent of Black RDP owners in Mogale City. It seemed discouraging to find that only 46 percent of Ethembalethu residents said that “most people in their neighborhood could be trusted,” but that’s still much better than 30 percent of RDP owners throughout the municipality. And I asked the survey enumerators to rate the respondent’s “level of cooperation,” and fully 100 percent of the Ethembalethu respondents were “fully cooperative,” as compared with just 82 percent of RDP owners municipality wide. The residents seemed to have higher levels of the “social capital”21 that helps make democracy work. As I spoke with Selibo, I reminded myself to consider the research conducted by one of my former students, Gwyneth McClendon, who wrote an acclaimed book on the topic of envy in politics.22 A central problem she raised was the enormous challenges of delivering public housing because, particularly in South Africa, those who have not yet received this benefit can become very envious of those who have. And that frustration can turn to destructive behavior, leaving everyone worse off. I asked Selibo if that was a problem here, and he said, unequivocally, yes. “It’s a major problem in this area. Especially in this ward. Because now we have this beautiful township and a lot of community members [those in his ward] are still in that poor status. Most of the time we can’t always speak of Ethembalethu because people are not staying there and they are envious.” He went on to mention future plans, and indeed perhaps the best antidote to envious behavior is a credible commitment that the same benefits will be extended to all. On the other hand, given the twenty-year process to get phase one completed, this could be a dangerous proposition if that timetable is not accelerated given the growing impatience with demands. And in fact, Leslie Gama, whom I met in Muldersdrift on the last weekend of voter registration and whose parents went off to vote while he stayed at home during the first election of the new democratic era, showed me his designs to replicate what had been achieved in Ethembalethu. On an individual level, Gama bears some striking similarities to Selibo. He also grew up in a rural area with few human comforts. He stayed in Muldersdrift with his grandparents in a house made of mud bricks, built on a cattle farm. Because the construction process involved smearing cow dung on the bricks, he said that even today when he smells cow dung, he is reminded of his childhood. Leslie and his family had no electricity, and they got their water from a neighboring farm, illegally tapping into an irrigation system. They dug their own pit latrines to use as toilets. And he even worked for a spell in a hair salon. He started his own organization, Umnotho, which for about seven years by the time I met him in 2019 had been collecting money from families who wanted to upgrade their lives from shacks to formal settlements. I was very impressed by the bountiful gardens the community had grown and the detailed plans—including architectural drawings and models—they had commissioned for an integrated community. But just like Selibo, Gama faced the hurdles of local opposition, zoning rules, and occasional theft from his offices, as well as the challenge of getting the right attention from the right officials. Nonetheless, given his tenacity, the cohesion and support of his community, the progress he has detailed to me since we met, and the example of Ethembalethu, I am cautiously optimistic that he’ll succeed in this or a related venture. FIGURE 7.4. Slabs awaiting RDP houses in Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Without active involvement from community leaders like Selibo and Gama, government policies can languish. Too frequently, housing projects get started but remain unfinished owing to lack of planning, funding, and/or oversight, let alone as the result of a stalemate between competing political interests. In Munsieville, I toured a site with a checkerboard of concrete slabs designed to support RDP houses but that, at least for the time being, were nothing but useless eyesores. The latter, of course, tend to capture the imagination of democracy skeptics all around the municipality. While important, my broader point is that such failures are not the whole story. Income, Security, and Equality Beyond shelter and basic services, citizens want jobs, income, and to not be on the wrong end of extreme inequality. In 2019, Ramaphosa and the ANC campaigned on the slogan “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a tacit acknowledgment of what was needed. Nonetheless, while the economic record is certainly not the basis for a victory lap, it is also not dispositive for the value of democracy in the country. Moreover, although unemployment and inequality remain staggeringly high, the government has also provided critical cash grants to provide social security for millions of the most vulnerable. It may not have been rapid economic development, but the record contributed to dignified development. As a liberation movement, the ANC had been on record, including quite explicitly in the Freedom Charter, calling for the nationalization of the mines and of large sections of the economy. Moreover, the organization and its alliance partners, COSATU and the SACP, all drew heavily on Marxist-Leninist thought as guiding principles. They envisioned a new democratically elected government having a very strong hand in all aspects of the economy. As they prepared to govern, and once in power, ANC elites engaged in far-ranging discussions with a variety of economists and others inside and outside the country concerning strategies that would thread the needle between achieving economic growth and attaining some level of adequate redistribution in the near term. They actively and openly debated various models and the lessons to be learned from other countries’ experiences. Like most planners at the time, they wondered how they could emulate the high-performing economies in East Asia. Prominently in the background of such debates and discussions was the collapse of the Soviet Union. The failed record of centrally planned economies provided leverage for White business leaders to strike bargains with the liberation party and its partners to avert nationalization. They made the familiar argument that the new government should not “kill the goose that lays the golden egg.” (White business was the goose here.) Neo-liberal economic principles had gained global prominence and if you didn’t play by those rules, it was clear that international financial institutions would restrict access to credit and investments. Mandela and other top ANC brass were ultimately persuaded against nationalizing and, for that matter, against massive land distribution. As early as 1996, they adopted an economic strategy that involved privatization of state assets, trade liberalization, and bureaucratic reform.23 The compromise solution was to combine a largely free market system, while actively promoting Black economic empowerment. Companies could remain private, but they would need to demonstrate active inclusion of those who had been disadvantaged under Apartheid. And the government would be tasked with providing social support to the poor and extending social benefits widely. In October 1997, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel delivered a keynote speech for a book launch hosted by the Budget Information Service at IDASA. I had just started my work there the previous week and the event immediately highlighted for me the emerging political fault lines on economic policy. Like many of the other government leaders, Manuel had spent several years of his adult life in jail protesting the old government; he had long been a champion of the poor and the working class. Now, he was already being accused of being a lackey for the well-heeled. Critics said that the government’s revised economic strategy, called Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), with its emphasis on fiscal discipline and low inflation, reflected an abandonment of a focus on jobs and development for the impoverished masses. Manuel resisted this characterization. He quoted phrases from the original RDP plan to remind critics that the party had always intended to proceed in a fiscally responsible manner. And he quoted from Capital, in which Karl Marx argued that the burden of budget deficits falls on the working class. He was sharp and persuasive. Given the scale of wants and needs, the challenge of building the economy was enormous. At the very least, most assumed that simply ending Apartheid would yield some important economic benefits. First, the government should attain some savings from the elimination of multiple and inflated homeland governments, which cost much more than they took in, and a reduction in military spending, as it would no longer be at war with much of the country and the region. They would also save on the resources wasted controlling the movement of Black people. International economic sanctions would end, and perhaps foreign investors would flock to South Africa. The most optimistic held out hope that the merging of these two wildly different segments of the economy would quickly lead to everyone living at the level of White South Africans.24 In practice, the period 1994–2007 actually produced solid economic growth, especially compared with the disastrous last decade of Apartheid that preceded it. And during this interval, the incomes, opportunities, and lifestyles for millions of Black South Africans improved, generating widespread expansion of the Black middle class. As in the United States, the term “middle class” means many things to many people—certainly in South Africa, it does not connote an average or the middle of the income distribution but a lifestyle associated with some degree of comfort with disposable income. In other words, millions of Black South Africans began to gain access to the lifestyles that had been enjoyed almost exclusively by Whites: university for their children, the ability to purchase goods at one of South Africa’s many shopping malls, perhaps the ability to own an automobile. By some estimates, in terms of “affluence,” the middle class grew from 2.2 million in 1993 to 4.9 million in 2008 (and by 2008, 20 percent of the 1 million “upper class” were now Black African).25 For many, this was exactly the dream of a post-Apartheid South Africa. On the other hand, growth in this segment of the population gave rise to a growing chasm between Black haves and Black have-nots. For many of the millions without the disposable income to take advantage of new shopping opportunities or to purchase the latest mobile phone, let alone to have a decent roof over their heads, patience began to wear thin. Many criticized the GEAR plan as an abandonment of the poor majority. And then the global financial crisis of 2007–8 ravaged South Africa’s economy. In 2009, the year Jacob Zuma became president, the economy contracted by 1.5 percent—almost 3 percent, when calculated on a per capita basis. After that, the economy failed to sustain a serious recovery throughout his term. Per capita GDP growth practically screeched to a halt at 0.3 percent during those years. All told, between 1994 and 2018, South Africa’s average annual economic growth on a per capita basis was a paltry 1.2 percent.26 There is no single definitive answer for why the South African economy grew at the pace it did. Political conflicts and news of corruption within the ANC surely scared off some potential investments and deprived citizens of resources that would otherwise have been used on public expenditures.27 Insufficient infrastructure investment to meet the demands of citizens and businesses has also surely constrained productivity and growth. It is certainly plausible that the strength of organized labor contributed to wage bills that made some companies uncompetitive. And foreign direct investment into Africa has always been extremely low, and despite the end of Apartheid, investment into South Africa remained modest relative to initial hopes. FIGURE 7.5. GDP per capita growth, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Moreover, it is hard to ignore the extent to which the previous decade was challenging for most Upper-middle-income countries.28 For example, during this period, Brazil chalked up an average annual growth rate of 1.3 percent, almost exactly the same as South Africa’s, and with peaks and valleys that are remarkably similar. If we evaluate South Africa’s economic performance relative to other Upper-middle-income countries29 and to the rest of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as presented in figure 7.5, the country’s lackluster economic performance still appears to lag. However, on average, those countries only grew about 1.2 and 0.8 percentage points faster than South Africa did, and even these comparisons are driven by a few high-growth countries rather than a consistent difference. And within these sets of countries for this period, there is really no discernible difference between democracies and non-democracies (despite some compelling research suggesting that democracies do tend to grow faster on average).30 For those who like to hold out the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to describe Black rule in South Africa, it’s important to dispel the myth that South Africa’s post-Apartheid economic performance has in any way resembled Zimbabwe’s. With respect to the latter, one of my favorite teaching props is a photo I took of a Zimbabwean one hundred trillion dollar note, along with a photo of ordinary Zimbabweans using this currency as wallpaper. With declining government revenues, Zimbabwe’s authoritarian government under Robert Mugabe simply printed more and more money to finance its expenditures amid the president’s lavish lifestyle. In turn, the country experienced hyperinflation and the collapse of its currency. Stores could not set consistent prices nor could they reliably stock goods. Increasingly, citizens were forced to barter with one another to get what they needed. By contrast, South Africans have experienced only minor devaluations of their currency, and their economy has been generally well managed with low rates of inflation, low debt, and small budget deficits. Notably, the post-Apartheid period was marked by steep declines in the mining industry. The country’s gold output decreased steadily since 1994, with some decline already underway between 1980 and 1994.31 The historical discovery of gold near Krugersdorp preceded Mandela’s election by more than a century. The mining went very deep into the Rand, and it simply became much less profitable relative to the degree it once was as the effort-to-yield ratio continually climbed, and it would no longer be a source of easy profits in the new democracy. The collapse of mining has hit Mogale hard. As one resident recounted, “We would grow up seeing [miners] with their hats going down into the mines, and then coming up. It used to be a very vibrant area. But now of late, there’s a lot of unemployment. You feel pity when you see them on the corners staying or sitting idle by the shops, and becoming drunk.” From multiple vantage points within the municipal borders, one can see the large, ugly West Rand Consolidated Mine hill. It’s a reminder of what made this city (gold) and what it is now (essentially without a mining sector). Thousands of able-bodied people are not gainfully employed. Instead, a few informal miners dangerously try to retrieve small treasures where they can, with little regard for personal safety. The failure to grow the economy deprived the country of a key weapon against the Apartheid legacies of high unemployment, high poverty, and high inequality. By any measure, South African unemployment levels have remained staggering—at least 25 percent—in the decades following the end of Apartheid, perhaps over 40 percent if applying a “strict” definition.32 And on surveys, in interviews, and on the radio and other media, lack of jobs was the most important issue that people indicated as a concern for them. In 2017–18, a full 44 percent of Mogale residents surveyed said they were “unemployed and looking for work”—and that figure is low for all of Gauteng Province, where 52 percent responded this way.33 Are democratic politics to blame? As figure 7.6 clearly shows, South African unemployment in 2018, as reported using International Labor Organization models, was very high in comparative perspective—measured as the worst among Upper-middle-income countries. But it was already high at the dawn of the democratic era, so the failure is one of being unable to solve an existing problem rather than creating a new one. The picture of inequality is similar: in the decade after 1995, already high levels of income inequality intensified. After 2005 this trend reversed somewhat, and by 2015 income inequality was at the approximate level it had been in the mid-1990s.34 The fact that a highly unequal society has remained highly unequal is nothing to celebrate. But again, in the current state of the world, in which wealthier people have much better work and investment opportunities,35 the South African story is clearly part of a global one. Even after the 2008 worldwide economic meltdown, increasing numbers of South Africans came to own major household assets—realizing a “middle-class” lifestyle. In 2009, just 15.1 percent owned a computer; by 2015 that number jumped to 22.1 percent. Similar gains were observed with respect to satellite television (13.0 to 35.1 percent), washing machines (27.5 to 35.9 percent), and refrigerators (64.7 to 79.7 percent).36 FIGURE 7.6. Unemployment in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1996–2018). Source: Author analysis of International Labor Organization estimates in WDI. As the United Nations has recently documented, during approximately the period considered here (1990–2015), two-thirds of the share of income going to the top 1 percent increased in 59 of 100 countries with available data.37 Cash Is King One of the most important ways in which the post-Apartheid government has assisted the poor—in the face of a weak economy, dismal employment prospects, and high inequality—has been through direct cash grants, fulfilling a constitutional right and Freedom Charter aspiration to social security. In 2018–19, in a country of 56 million people, 17.6 million were beneficiaries of social grants. The vast majority of these funds are allocated through a Child Support Grant (12.5 million children) and the Old-Age Grant (3.5 million people older than sixty). Other grants are given to people with disabilities, for care dependency, to war veterans, and to support the care of foster children.38 The system is far from perfect, and news stories occasionally pop up about fraud and delays. Yet, this does not go unchecked: for example, in 2012, the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) introduced a biometric scheme in the payout process that saved millions of rand in false claims. Even that was not foolproof, and the DA and others charged that fraud persisted. In 2018, the biometric system was scrapped in favor of a legacy system.39 While such stories and reports frequently contribute to claims and perceptions that the entire agency is corrupt and failing, by and large, most people are paid every month; and the incidence of grant relief has been extremely pro-poor—certainly relative to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and among most Upper-middle-income countries. In many other countries with generous social insurance schemes, particularly in Latin America, the wealthier segments of society manage to capture disproportionate gains, making the net distribution of resources even more unequal. By contrast, according to data from the World Bank ASPIRE database, for the period approximately 2008–16, South Africa provided the most generous transfers with the greatest impact for reducing income inequality by targeting the very poorest.40 Cash grants have contributed to decreasing poverty rates, especially extreme poverty,41 particularly after 2000.42 Although the amount transferred for each grant tends to be modest—about $30 per month for a child grant, for example—getting cash into the hands of the very poor allows individuals and caregivers to buy the essentials. This critical set of grants helped lower the share of the population living under an international poverty line43 from about 34 percent in the period 1993–96 to about 17.5 percent in the period 2010–14.44 Investments in Human Value Reflecting both global trends and the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, South Africa’s 1996 constitution identified access to health care and basic education as fundamental rights of citizenship. Health and education are often described as key components of “human capital,”45 in the sense that investments in these can generate returns in the form of economic productivity. I believe that is too limited a view: we also value better health and education because they are inextricably linked to human autonomy and well-being. Promoting health and education might be better understood simply as investments in and recognition of the value of humans. From the dawn of South Africa’s new democracy, activist critics, journalists, and academics have repeatedly highlighted government failures in meeting crucial needs in these sectors. For example, Section 27, an organization so named for the section of the constitution that details citizens’ social and economic rights, has routinely applied intense pressure to improve both outcomes, especially among the poor, through the media, organized protests, court cases, and direct presentations to government bodies. The LRC, Lawyers for Human Rights, and a host of sector-specific NGOs have developed or adapted their missions to hold the government accountable to make good on constitutional promises. And once again, the list of gaps such organizations have identified is real and observable—especially if one looks at persistent disparities between the haves and have-nots. For example, much like in the United States, the quality of everyday health-care access remains very much a function of ability to pay. The Netcare Krugersdorp Hospital and the Yusuf Dadoo Hospital are situated about a mile apart from one another, but the distance between the quality of facilities and care received is much, much greater. At the former, where people must pay for their care, the outside looks like the glossy Boston hospital buildings I see close to my home and work, and inside, the shelves are stocked and patients can expect to be seen relatively quickly and to receive excellent care. At the latter, citizens report that wait times are long, supplies are frequently unavailable, and the likelihood that the facilities will be clean is low. Similar gaps divide the educational sphere. Notably, there are three types of primary and secondary schools: public schools that are fully free; those in which fees are collected; and private or independent schools. For example, Monument High School, the site of the first polling station I visited on election day in 2019, is a former “Model C” school. These were once White-only public schools and tend to be located in historically White areas. During the early 1990s, as Apartheid was ending, they were afforded greater autonomy, and the government allowed them to collect fees. Today, these are generally the highest-quality public schools, and in Mogale City, both White and Black families who can afford the fees—but not the cost of private school—tend to send their children there. By contrast, most townships, like Munsieville and Kagiso, host public schools in which parents are not expected to pay fees, but the resulting resources and quality—for example, at Munsieville Primary School and Lodirile Secondary School in Rietvallei—tend to be much more modest. As one Mogale City teacher described to me, “These schools are often not that clean and do not look like conducive environments for productive teaching and learning.” And for those who can afford it or who attain scholarships, South Africa boasts many excellent private schools, including in Mogale City, where independent school franchises have come in to meet the growing demand from families—for example, Alma Mater International School and Curro Krugersdorp Independent School, where students can expect access to world-class media resources, relatively small student-to-teacher ratios, and outstanding athletic facilities. These schools also tend to prepare students for possible overseas university education and frequently follow British curricula. As of 2019, of the approximately 75,000 students in Mogale City schools, only about 5 percent attended private schools, and an additional 31 percent attended fee-collecting public schools. As in most things South African, the gulf between what a minority—even if increasingly multiracial—can access relative to the rest is so enormous as to make for frustrating comparisons. As just one important metric of school quality for which objective data are available, I calculated student-to-teacher ratios for Mogale City primary and secondary schools and found that at the 15 independent schools, the ratio was 12:1, at the 23 fee-collecting public schools it was 24:1, and at the 47 no-fee public schools it was 34:1. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, the neighborhoods (wards) for the fee-collecting public schools were 39 percent Black with just 7 percent of the residents living in informal settlements; the no-fee schools were, on average, 91 percent Black and 27 percent of residents in informal settlements.46 In turn, we should not be surprised when we see inequality reproduced across generations given this state of affairs. Even serious concerns about persistent inequities—wholly reminiscent of the American health and educational systems—should not obscure critical efforts and accomplishments or the challenging context that democratic governments have faced. In both sectors, the government has spent heavily, has vastly widened access, and has made some clear and observable inroads, especially in improving the quality of life and capacities of the very poor. In terms of education, in 2019 the South African government spent approximately 50 percent more as a share of GDP (6.5 percent) compared with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (4.3 percent) or the average of all Upper-middle-income (UMI) countries (4.1 percent).47 And with respect to health, government spending increased substantially over the period 2002–18 such that by the latter year South Africa was also vastly outspending peers from these reference groups (4.4 percent/GDP for South Africa compared with 3.2 percent for UMI countries and 1.9 percent for Africa).48 Moreover, in each sector, democratic processes have contributed to important gains and corrections. Health and Health Care Just a few months after his inauguration, Mandela’s government rolled out as a first signature project a new program offering free health care for all pregnant and nursing women as well as all children under six.49 The newly covered population was guaranteed treatment at all public hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. And to accommodate increased demand, the policy was coupled with the construction of new clinics.50 By 2003, free hospital care was extended to children older than six with disabilities.51 In turn, the share of births attended by professional staff grew from 82 percent in 1994 to 97 percent in 2016.52 And in 2017, South Africa had the highest numbers of physicians, nurses, and midwives relative to the size of the population of all non-island, sub-Saharan African countries.53 FIGURE 7.7. Average life expectancy at birth in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income and African countries (1995–2017). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Owing at least in part to the availability of these inputs and other policies, leading indicators suggest that health and well-being for the most vulnerable have improved. The under-5 mortality rate at the time of Mandela’s election in 1994 was 61 deaths per 1,000, and that dropped to a low of 37.1 by 2017. As depicted in figure 7.7, at the beginning of the democratic period the life expectancy rate in South Africa was the lowest of all Upper-middle-income countries but among the highest of all other African countries. However, it took a profound dip in the late 1990s owing to the rash of deaths from the staggering AIDS epidemic. Once the government finally adopted policies and practices of administering anti-retroviral drug therapy, extending the lives of those living with HIV—responding to political pressures as described in chapter 6—estimated life expectancy quickly returned to an upward trajectory, albeit diminished relative to its economic peers. Indeed, the mushrooming of extraordinarily large HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics at the tail end of the Apartheid era proved to be an overwhelming burden on other aspects of the health-care system. As early as the mid-1990s, more than 10 percent of the adult population aged 15–49 was living with HIV, and by 2000, the incidence (new cases) of tuberculosis was almost 800 per 100,000 people. Both disease burdens were much higher than the typical experience of most African and Upper-middle-income country cohorts or, frankly, countries anywhere in the world.54 While it’s true that the ongoing size of these epidemics in terms of numbers infected can be partially ascribed to early government failures in response, it is also important to point out that both HIV and tuberculosis have remained highly prevalent throughout the southern African region, even in countries like Botswana that responded much earlier and more aggressively (in part because successful treatment has kept people alive). Moreover, the South African government, despite its early flawed response under Mbeki, and after relentless democratic challenges from civil society, went on to embark on the world’s largest AIDS treatment program.55 Today, both its AIDS and tuberculosis government responses are far-reaching and world class—and various studies have identified South Africa as leading the way in best practices.56 Moreover, concerns about poor health and health disparities are not simply a matter of access to formal health care. Better infrastructure and living conditions in the form of clean water, sanitation, and shelter are themselves critically important for healthy outcomes, and progress in those areas contributes to better health outcomes for the very poor and is likely reflected in positive trends in life expectancy and infant mortality. On the other hand, the persistence of vast socioeconomic differences in South Africa will no doubt continue to reproduce inequalities in health outcomes for some time, and even the equalization of health-care resources would almost surely not be sufficient to equalize health outcomes in the near term. Along these lines, particularly in Mogale City, the legacy of the country’s mining economy contributes to widespread environmental risks. Despite the metaphorical status of “gold dust,” the reality is that mining dust is a major health hazard. First, for miners who have worked or continue to work deep in the mines, silicosis—also known as “black lung”—is a debilitating disease acquired from the inhalation of the very fine silica dust generated through the process of extraction. It causes shortness of breath and chest pain and makes individuals more vulnerable to tuberculosis, already widely prevalent in the country. Second, Krugersdorp and other mining towns are replete with mine dumps or tailings. When the wind blows, toxic dust fills the air and seeps into the local streams and canals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the brunt of such environmental degradation is again borne by poor and Black citizens, including in Mogale, especially in and around the mines of Kagiso, which are replete with acid mine drainage.57 One notoriously awful site is the Mintails mine I passed on election day. Within these tailings, scientists have detected arsenic, lead, and other chemicals, frequently radioactive. Nonetheless, children routinely play on toxic mining excavations as if they were sand dunes, as they are not sufficiently guarded from the general public.58 Although concerns about the safe cleanup of such sites rarely find their way into electoral politics, pressure from other democratic institutions has proven important to raise awareness and to apply pressure on businesses and government to take action. I became aware of these concerns through my own involvement with the LRC, as I was introduced to a partner of theirs, Mariette Liefferink, sometimes described as South Africa’s “Erin Brockovich” because of her passionate involvement in environmental issues. On our tour of the area, she pointed out the neglect and failings of various mining corporations to properly close the dormant mines, as well as the ways in which they have tried to avoid taking responsibility by selling off their assets to very small companies that could never afford to pay any claims for damages. She, the LRC, and others have been documenting the extent of environmental degradation and the harms caused and have sought justice for those most affected, especially through the courts. Undoubtedly, the democratic era ushered in the opportunities to pursue such work, first by putting an accent on the indignities leveled against those central and/or proximate to the mining economy; and second by actually securing some compensation for them. They highlight, of course, that much work remains, but they have had some important successes. Most notably, owing to a vast class action suit, in May 2018 the mining companies agreed to an unprecedented 5 billion rand (400 million USD) settlement for thousands of miners suffering from silicosis.59 Education As has been the case for health, in terms of equity of access to schooling, particularly to higher levels of education, we can document substantial progress. For example, I consider the distribution of the highest level of education attained by individuals in the Mogale area on two South African census rounds: 1991 and 2011, and just those individuals aged 19 to 29 in each. This restriction helps us isolate the educational opportunities created before and after 1994. In 1991, close to 70 percent of Whites had completed at least their “matric” year—named for the all-important standardized, national high school completion exam—which is viewed as the critical attainment of credentials for high-paying jobs that demand skills. At that time, not even 20 percent of Blacks had those credentials. And more than 50 percent of Blacks lacked even a completed primary education. By 2011, the gap had substantially narrowed: Blacks gained almost 30 percentage points, with just shy of 50 percent completing at least secondary school, and in this later round, less than 8 percent had not completed primary school. And this did not come at the “expense” of White enrollments: by 2011, secondary school rates among Whites had climbed to 76 percent. When considering the national level—and in comparative perspective—secondary school enrollment was already higher in 1990 than the average for Upper-middle-income countries (and much higher compared with African countries). And all the way until 2018, South Africa at least kept pace with growth in enrollment as compared with both of the reference groups.60 Such broad portraits clearly mask critical nuances with respect to the actual quality of education that students receive, let alone the attainment of education as an ultimate goal. The gaps are troubling, and some studies have even concluded that the quality of education overall has decreased during the post-Apartheid period.61 One often-cited indicator of government failure on education is the fact that South African students have generally performed poorly on international tests.62 This is true. On the other hand, South African students were already performing relatively poorly in 1995, and at least achieved some marginal gains, especially between 2001 and 2011 and particularly among the lowest-performing students. As one nuanced assessment of twenty years of South African education has highlighted, such benchmarks need to be viewed in context—especially the fact that most of the other countries that participate in such testing are far richer.63 While many countries around the world face legacies of uneven and unequal educational systems, few are burdened by a history comparable to that of the Apartheid system’s “Bantu Education,” which deliberately sought to limit the potential of a majority of learners with respect to curriculum and promotion of critical thinking skills, which also affected the training of teachers.64 Combine this with persistent de facto residential segregation, and it is not surprising that huge educational gaps remain across racial lines, as well as between students in free public schools, fee-paying public schools, and private schools, where parents also tend to be more educated.65 A particularly grave affront to human dignity lies with the horrific quality of public educational facilities and instruction in rural areas—outside the industrial Gauteng Province. Eighty or more students are routinely forced to crowd themselves into classrooms, and their schools frequently lack running water, functioning toilets, and well-trained teachers. In one tragic account, first documented in the New York Times66 and that subsequently went “viral” in the South African media, two children drowned in pit toilets in a dilapidated school in Mpumalanga Province. The story juxtaposed the greediness of government officials and the disappearance of millions of dollars of funding next to a tragic and truly unpleasant death of young people, providing powerful fodder for citizen anger. Ten days after the publication of the original article, and no doubt spurred on by the embarrassing revelations, President Ramaphosa announced the launch of a new program, the Sanitation Appropriate for Education Initiative. According to Ramaphosa, the initiative would “spare generations of young South Africans the indignity, discomfort and danger of using pit latrines and other unsafe facilities in our schools.”67 The good news? One NGO subsequently calculated that the initiative resulted in the upgrading of toilets in twenty thousand schools. The bad? The same NGO estimated that at this pace, it would take nineteen years to complete the job on a national scale.68 Did the news story cause the policy change? The proximity of the actions and the responses suggests that it certainly triggered the timing of the reactions, but it’s hard to imagine that the story would have come to light if there were not already so much political attention being paid to sanitary conditions and if civil society organizations and public interest lawyers were not already applying pressure through political campaigns and sometimes through appeals to constitutional law in the courts. Like many gains in a democratic polity, it was victory from a million cuts. For people in remote rural areas, democratic political pressures ultimately led to government actions that would bring visibility and material improvements to their lives. In a polity that valued economic growth above all else, rural schoolchildren might have been deliberately overlooked as a necessary casualty of “development.” In the context of democratic South Africa, at the very least, no one can publicly question the deservingness of these children to receive the same opportunities and services. Continuing to shine a light on deficiencies sometimes elicits action, even if rarely sufficient to close substantial gaps. Palpable Progress, if Incomplete For every material gain I’ve detailed here, one could add valid caveats and qualifications. Electrification? But what about rolling blackouts? Social grants? Those are too small to be meaningful! Housing? Too many people still waiting and the construction is shoddy! All of these are fair concerns and useful grist for the democratic mill. In no country in the world do people think that all of their material needs have been met, and by any objective standard, most South Africans still have much to wish for, not the least of which are better opportunities to work, to earn a steady income, and to gain access to high-quality education and health care. Nonetheless, I think it’s hard to deny that the overall gains have been quite substantial for millions of people who hoped for material comfort and a degree of economic security after Apartheid. When asked, people can document meaningful change. In fact, perhaps this entire book is motivated by the transformation I’ve observed with my own eyes over the past several decades: I have continued to return to the very places I first toured almost thirty years ago, including largely Black townships on the outskirts of the three largest South African cities: Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban. Observable conditions have improved substantially, sometimes dramatically. Back then, raw sewage ran through the streets, and electrical connections were rare. At night, in many areas, high-mast street lamps projected harsh, bright light over large areas, as if for an airport rather than a human settlement. During June and July—wintertime in the southern hemisphere—the putrid smell of burning garbage could sting your nose for miles around as people sought to keep warm. Today, Soweto is a city unto itself, one in which poverty persists, but alongside an increasingly thriving Black middle class with upscale amenities. In Khayelitsha, near Cape Town and Kwamashu, near Durban, and in townships and locations across the country, tarred roads have replaced dirt passageways; more people live in houses and flats (apartments) rather than shacks; and millions more enjoy electricity, lighting, piped water, and flush toilets. Since my first visit to South Africa, I have traveled to every one of the country’s nine provinces and have been to urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Now, having in mind the many other African contexts I have visited in the meantime, including rural and urban Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, it is hard to imagine many South Africans wanting to trade places with their counterparts on the respective socioeconomic ladders of any of the countries north of the Limpopo River. Only in the small (and also democratic) countries of Mauritius, Cape Verde, and Botswana and the small, oil-rich, but not democratic country of Gabon do measured overall levels of service provision consistently approximate what South Africans enjoy.69 And these accomplishments were set against the extremely challenging background of high inequality, a difficult global economic environment, an evaporating mineral economy, and substantial backlogs in the development of human capital. With respect to the latter point, we should not forget that the New South Africa was comprised of millions of Black South African adults who had been previously denied a decent education and yet were called on to run vast government agencies and fill the management ranks of businesses. Moreover, we can blame Jacob Zuma for many things, but not for the global economic meltdown that coincided with the start of his presidency. The social and economic legacies of South Africa’s past have not been easily overcome. Life in the still largely White suburbs around Krugersdorp remains far, far more comfortable than in the townships of Munsieville and Kagiso. Nonetheless, the conditions of the latter have measurably improved, with much greater parity in access to government services. This pattern is repeated in much of the country. Political competition, citizen pressure, and respect for the constitutional order have all contributed to such dignified development and reflect well on the value of democracy in South Africa.",

Famously, the document declared, “There Shall be Houses, Security, and Comfort.” Almost forty years later, those dreams were still not realities for millions of South Africans. As such, during its first electoral campaign in 1994, the ANC’s party leaders promised to provide houses, health care, lighting, security, and other sources of material prosperity to those who went without. In fact, when he was speaking to prospective voters, Mandela could sometimes be mistaken for an ordinary politician, as he promised “a better life for all” if elected. Stanley Greenberg, a veteran American political strategist who assisted with the inaugural ANC campaign, recalled Mandela as being a fiercely competitive politician. The liberation stalwart was not satisfied with the idea of simply taking in the votes they would receive because of his organization’s role in the struggle or his own personal stature.1 Mandela wanted to win the election convincing citizens that an ANC government would actually deliver concrete improvements to their lives. Moreover, the 1996 constitution enshrined several material needs as rights, including with respect to health care, reproductive health, sufficient food and water, adequate housing, basic education, and social security for those unable to support themselves. By 2019, even in Mogale City, located in South Africa’s richest province and industrial heartland, citizens routinely asserted that the government had failed to deliver what people needed. The rhetoric surrounding persistent service delivery protests echoed what many residents—Black and White—said to me in interviews: the government has accomplished nothing. And throughout the 2019 election campaign, political opponents pointed to the realities of poverty, inequality, and obvious human want as evidence of the government’s disastrous performance over the previous quarter century. In turn, many suspect that democracy has not been a help but rather a hindrance to human development. To be sure, the record is littered with disappointments. The complaints and protests are rooted in actual instances of deprivation. And South Africa remains a profoundly unequal society. Yet, it is also the case that since the end of Apartheid, South Africa has chalked up some extraordinary accomplishments in terms of improving the material well-being of its citizens, especially the most vulnerable. And much of this can be directly linked to democratic practice—that is, the application of competitive political pressures to enact and to implement development-enhancing policies. Moreover, many of the disappointments and even the severe shortfalls of the post-Apartheid record reflect at least as much about the continued weight of the country’s historical legacies and global conditions as they do about the performance of democratic government. Various government critics have rightly highlighted how social and economic policies and practices could have been more thoroughgoing, implemented earlier and more efficiently. But if we take a step back to focus not just on the critiques but also on what has been accomplished during the first quarter century, we see that much of the record on material progress, especially for the poor, and in light of the country’s history, is quite remarkable. First, I consider the conditions of human settlement, including access to basic services, where the changes are most apparent especially at the local level. Second, I look at the challenge of growing and equalizing cash incomes. And third, I briefly describe the record of investing in human capital, including with respect to health and education. Once again, I try to highlight patterns in Mogale relative to the rest of South Africa, and South Africa in comparative context. Give Me Shelter From 1994, the idea of a “better life” for millions of South Africans largely connoted gaining access to formal housing and basic services—electricity, water, and sanitation. And to varying degrees, politicians from the ANC, and from competing parties, promised during all of the subsequent election campaigns that they would expand access to these.2 For millions of people, the results were life-changing. The most important signature project was the RDP house: RDP is the acronym for the first government’s economic and development strategy, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. In a country where millions of people lacked reliable shelter, the government proposed to build millions of homes. While the design has undergone some revision over the years, it has always been a very basic, rectangular concrete structure with a tin roof, designed to provide accommodation for a single family. The intentions and ambitions were noble: people deserve to live in a real, secure shelter, not in an overcrowded shack. If your household income fell below a certain level, and you were a South African citizen, you would be eligible to get one of these houses. But you had to get in line. Good data on the number of houses actually built are hard to come by. One reasonable estimate that echoes what various government officials have shared with me is that between 1994 and 2015, over 2.8 million houses were delivered, meaning that approximately one-third of all South African residences are fully subsidized by the government.3 Certainly nowhere else in Africa has such a scheme existed, and I have not been able to find anything comparable anywhere in the Global South, let alone in the richest countries. The most generous programs elsewhere involve low-cost loans or subsidies for housing, but not a title deed to a house free of charge. Due in large part to the RDP, in 2016, 79 percent of South Africans lived in formal housing—marking a 21-percentage-point gain since 1995.4 And beyond just houses, statistical data reveal an important and broader portrait of change, one in which democratic pressures have arguably been quite important. First, consider electrification. In 1996, 58 percent of households had electricity connections and by 2016, over 90 percent had access.5 To be sure, the country has in recent years faced long periods of rolling blackouts and sometimes-interrupted power supplies—all of which are the sources of daily frustration and anger. Yet, the transformation in access is both impressive and, to a degree, the cause of such shortages as so many more people now make demands on the system. Consider also basic water and sanitation services. In 1996, just 47 percent of Black Africans had piped water in their dwellings (compared with over 96 percent of Whites).6 By 2011, that figure had jumped to 67 percent for Black Africans (and 99 percent of Whites). By 2015, over 95 percent of all South Africans had direct access to piped water.7 In 1996, just 50 percent of households had access to flush toilets connected to sewerage systems or septic tanks. By 2016, coverage increased to 64 percent of households.8 And in an important related public health trend, in 2000, over 12 percent of the population practiced open defecation, but that was down to less than 2 percent by 2018.9 These are solid jumps in service coverage in the context of a growing population—but I don’t want to overstate the South African picture because in countries around the world, citizens have also enjoyed substantial improvements in recent decades. For example, across sub-Saharan Africa, the gains in electrification coverage were from 16 percent to 43 percent; among Low- and Middle-income countries, the number of households covered went from 65 percent to 85 percent. Nonetheless, South Africa still outperforms these group averages. South Africa also bested neighbors Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Mozambique in terms of gains in service coverage. Only in Botswana was the overall change more significant (17 percent had access to electricity in 1995; 64 percent had it in 2016) but, of course, from a much lower base.10 The fact that we’ve observed all of this progress during the era of democratic politics doesn’t necessarily imply that democracy caused these changes. It’s impossible to know how things would have been under a different type of political system. Looking at the timing and geographic distribution of who got what and when, there are good reasons to think that democratic pressures—starting from the Mandela campaign—did play a role. For example, one excellent study demonstrates that in areas where electricity was provided by the national parastatal (Eskom), during the 1996–2001 period, increased electrification of households was most profound in the areas with the largest numbers of newly enfranchised (i.e., non-White) voters.11 The authors interpret this to imply that since just about everywhere the new pivotal voters were Black and likely without electricity, this would lead the government to want to be responsive to voters in providing this service in order to improve the likelihood of a win in the next election. And they argue that those in power were acting to satisfy a large number of new voters who largely lacked services—a winning strategy if voters value them. Relatedly, for a later period (approximately 2001–11), Daniel de Kadt and I found that changes in levels of citizen support for the ANC across almost three thousand wards was inversely related to changes in the extent of basic service provision, especially of water access. Although initially counterintuitive, we concluded that this was a nuanced form of accountability and now potentially more forward-looking. For those areas that had not yet seen great improvements in service provision, citizens were more likely to continue to support the ANC in the hopes that they would be next, whereas the citizens in now-serviced areas were more likely to be looking to other parties to focus on policies beyond basic service provision.12 Together, these studies highlight the ways in which the links between service delivery and voting can incentivize action, especially when political competition is high. While electoral pressures may always loom large, the courts and appeals to constitutional rights have also proved to be extremely important sources of pressure for government to provide basic services for the poor, including with respect to housing, land rights, health, and education. For example, the legal case Government of the Republic of South Africa vs. Grootboom (2000) was particularly influential. Irene Grootboom and others had been evicted from their informal dwellings by the government, which was trying to build some low-cost housing on their site. In turn, drawing on the constitutional right to shelter, Grootboom went to court to force the government to provide at least temporary adequate housing, especially because children were involved. The court found that, indeed, the government had this obligation, which essentially breathed life into the aspirations of the constitution, saying that these rights were not simply platitudes but needed to be enforced. The ruling argued that the denial of shelter was tantamount to the denial of human dignity and the opportunity to enjoy other rights enshrined in the constitution.13 While that judgment had many positive long-term effects in helping to make the courts an effective vehicle for social transformation, and securing the right to housing, one cannot escape the unfortunate reality that Irene Grootboom herself never got housing and died poor and in a shack in 2008. Many South Africans have been frustrated and frequently engage in protest because supply has not kept up with demand. To put the size of the promise in perspective, each house costs approximately 10,000 USD to build, and South Africa’s per capita income is less than 7,000 USD. Nonetheless, these political pressures continue to keep further development and allocation of RDP houses on the political agenda, often to the dismay of local politicians, who face running lists of people waiting for theirs. Township Life Traveling up and down Mogale City’s rolling hills and around its sometimes narrow streets, I spoke with citizens, politicians, journalists, and civil society leaders. I tried to learn the extent to which the statistical portraits described above resonated with the lived realities in various neighborhoods, with a particular focus on the predominantly Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville and the formal and informal settlements around the more rural Muldersdrift. I concluded in short order that the municipality is not a standout success story by any means, nor is it the opposite. In fact, Mogale’s record of development seems to reflect much of what has transpired in other midsized South African municipalities. Norman Sedumedi, a former teacher who serves as the councillor for Ward 24 in Munsieville, the township in which he was born and raised, provided some history. As an ANC politician with a record to defend, he wanted to highlight progress when I asked if there was any to report. Still, the facts of what he shared with me when I asked, “What’s changed?” were easily corroborated, including by my own site visits. He spoke of Munsieville’s relatively new sports complex and a regional park, as well as the fact that all the streets were tarred and that all the houses, except some small and newer informal settlements, had electricity. He described the high school and the primary schools built to accommodate additional children and to reduce the length of their walk to school. The government had built health clinics and early childhood development and youth centers. He conceded that many of them don’t work as they had hoped or intended. I passed the relatively new senior center on multiple occasions, and indeed, I could see throngs of older residents coming and going, and at least superficially, it appeared to play a vibrant role in the community. By contrast, the tennis courts without nets that stood barren next to a locked recreational center reminded me how public projects can sometimes become white elephants. FIGURE 7.1. Corane Street, Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. When it came to the subject of housing and service provision, Sedumedi shared both a record of pride and a concern for dependency on the state in the context of low growth and high unemployment. He also expressed a general sense of exasperation that “it is a moving target. You never get it right for as long as people are alive and for as long as we have not fixed the issue of changing the economic landscape. Because the more the economy remains as it is, all of the burden will be for the state.” He said that since 1994, between 3,000 and 4,000 RDP houses had been built in the area. He worried that free housing, health care, and education might be disincentivizing people to work. On the other hand, it’s also hard to imagine how productive people could be without these basic needs. In the larger Black township of Kagiso, I spoke with seventy-nine-year-old Lerato Dube. We met at the Kagiso Methodist Church on a Tuesday afternoon, the time she serves soup to local residents. Her hair was wrapped in a bright green ANC bandana, and it was just a day before the 2019 election. She insisted on being referred to as Gogo (Zulu for Granny) and on serving me as well, so I obliged with some embarrassment at being fed a meal meant for those who actually needed one. But there was more soup available than takers on that afternoon, and this was her preference. So while I ate, I asked her to tell me about her life, what had changed, what had stayed the same. Dube was born in KwaZulu-Natal a few years before Apartheid was implemented14 and recounted what amounted to local transformation. When I [came to] Kagiso [in] 1992, Kagiso wasn’t like this. They were making fires with coal and wood. There was no electricity. They were lighting candles and lamps. There was no road. The taxi was no taxi because there was no road. It looked like a field.15 … Times goes and comes until 1994, then we ask electric and got. Then we asked for water. Even the water, it was very, very slow. The old house, that’s the other side of our house, there was the water on the outside. They were not allowed to make a pipe to put the water inside. If you want to wash, in cold or raining or snowing, you stand outside and do your washing or maybe bathing. After 1994, things [were becoming] better and better because now … we got water everywhere. We got the right toilet everywhere. Then we got the proper houses. Older South Africans, like other South Africans, have many concerns and frustrations about what has not changed, and about the changes they see that are for the worse, including increased drug use and violence among young people. But like Dube, many highlight that the material circumstances of their lives are radically different today from what they previously experienced, particularly for those who moved from shacks and squatter camps to their own homes. Notable exceptions are those who worked as teachers or nurses during the Apartheid days, who tended to have access to simple but formal government houses and some basic services. As of 2018, approximately 20 percent of all Black Mogale residents lived in RDP houses.16 Moreover, basic service delivery has expanded widely. In my sample, of adults forty years of age and older who said they had always lived in the area of Mogale City, as shown in figure 7.2, the racial gap in service delivery closed quite dramatically during the democratic era. In 1994, just 24 percent of Blacks had access to electricity, while 79 percent of Whites had access; by 2019, both approached universal access: 84.5 percent of Blacks and 95.4 percent of Whites.17 For Black South Africans who received RDP houses, they were much more likely to have access to other basic services compared with all other Black South Africans. For instance, in Mogale City, 99 percent of those living in RDP houses in 2019 had access to electricity, flush toilets, and piped water. Among all other Black residents, 15 to 20 percent fewer Black households had access to those services.18 Again, the RDP houses are modest structures generally erected in neighborhoods that look nothing like the established suburbs of Krugersdorp North or Noordheuwel, which are still mostly populated by Whites. While the houses were meant to displace shacks, in many cases, homeowners have built shack “additions,” which they rent out, or they move into the additions themselves and rent out the house. In many cases, homeowners have sold their homes, sometimes to recently arrived foreign nationals, which has generated resentment and has tended to exacerbate the sense of a fundamental housing crisis, certainly in Mogale City. FIGURE 7.2. The Black-White gap in basic service delivery, Mogale City (1970–2019). Source: Author analysis of HMS_2019. Based on survey responses for year of access among respondents who always lived in Mogale City area. All of these patterns are frustrating but quite understandable responses to the basic condition of having an asset but little income. In turn, many RDP housing developments do not present as vibrant communities or the sources of local or national pride that planners once might have hoped. Nonetheless, even well-founded frustrations ought not obscure the fundamental accomplishment of providing formal shelter for so many. Ethembalethu: A Case Study of Possibility Most RDP housing communities are characterized by a somewhat harsh and uninviting design aesthetic, familiar among state-sponsored housing developments the world over. One notable and positive exception is virtually hidden amid the farmlands, light industry, and scenic wedding venues of Muldersdrift in northeast Mogale City. The area typifies “urban periphery,” in the sense that one is surrounded by agriculture and agro-industry, and yet, in just a few minutes you can be in a sizable town, and in less than an hour, a major urban metropolis. A community called Ethembalethu (“ours” in Zulu) proved to be one of the most extraordinary RDP housing developments I’ve seen anywhere in South Africa. I traveled to the area for the first time on the recommendation of a local activist who, having learned of my broader interests, suggested I check it out. The story of how this community came to be offers important reminders of the social and political hurdles that remain for human development even in the post-Apartheid era, as well as the ways in which wealthy White landowners still wield enormous power despite their relatively small numbers. It also highlights the opportunities for organized citizens to achieve their goals and to build robust and prosperous communities, including through democratic participation and engagement. Ethembalethu sits at the end of an unmarked road just off the M5, a few miles north of Krugersdorp. An unoccupied guard station serves as a gateway to the neighborhood. The area is comprised of more than one hundred houses, all with the same basic RDP “core” structure, but most of the owners have expanded their living spaces with sturdy additions. Residents had painted the outsides in bright colors with different finishes, and many owners planted small lawns out front. On the various days I visited, groups of people walked the streets, talking and visiting with neighbors. It was not a luxury development, but from the outside, it radiated a sense of security and comfort and amounted to not simply a set of houses but a coherent community. And unlike in Munsieville and Kagiso, in Ethembalethu, there were no shacks anywhere (a fact I verified with satellite images from Google Maps). To learn more, I was referred to Molefi Selibo. As councillor for Ward 23, Selibo had his champions and his detractors within Mogale City, as most ambitious political leaders do. But even his critics were willing to acknowledge that his efforts in building the Ethembalethu community were successful, and perhaps even exemplary. On a return visit, I contacted Selibo and he agreed to meet with me in his small ward office, situated in a converted shipping container off Clinic Road in Muldersdrift, just south of the RDP community. FIGURE 7.3. Row of RDP houses in Ethembalethu community, Muldersdrift, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Selibo was born near the largely Afrikaner city of Bloemfontein in 1958 and came to the Muldersdrift area in search of work in 1986. An entrepreneur, he built a hair salon business, which he maintained for twenty years, and like barbers and hairdressers the world over, people came to him with their concerns, looking for advice. He recalled his efforts with pride: “A lot of people were interested to come to my salon because of how I handled issues. They said, ‘I think you can assist us as a community leader.’ ” He took on this role and highlighted that Black people in Muldersdrift had long lived with housing insecurity. They tended to stay on the farms where they worked. And if your boss fired you, you also lost your home. Political change offered the promise of new opportunities, but absent any specific promises about how they would get houses, in 1994, Selibo decided to start an organization, mainly to mobilize the community to buy land. And by 1996, they formally established the Muldersdrift Home Trust Foundation. At the time, Selibo himself resided in a small structure built by a White landowner, lived without electricity, and used a pit toilet. The fundamental strategy of the nascent organization was to require members to contribute 100 rand per month in a saving scheme, in order to accumulate the capital needed to buy land and to form a partnership with government. Less than a year later, they identified an appropriate parcel and began negotiations with a landowner, who initially agreed, with a modestly revised counterproposal. However, when other White landowners learned about the deal that was being struck—which would bring a sizable group of Black neighbors to subdivide a plot for housing—they persuaded him to not sell and bought the land away from him. At the time, Selibo had about two hundred members and they persisted, identifying yet another piece of land. This time they were more careful about the negotiations and tried to ensure that White landowners would not get wind of the deal. They negotiated and signed an agreement in 1997. At that point, they began to engage town planners, environmentalists, and others to formalize the arrangement. Yet once again, the prospect of this new community rooting itself in Muldersdrift did not sit well with many White residents from the area. As Selibo explained, “The challenge was that those who were in charge at that time were very close to White landowners in the area. [Ours] was the first organization led by a Black community in the White area … and they were not comfortable with that.” Soon thereafter, Selibo received another cancellation letter, as the landowners had pressured the seller to renege on the agreement. Selibo pushed back and said they had a binding contract. Even in post-Apartheid South Africa, with Black-led local, provincial, and national governments, the system still seemed stacked against them. Selibo recounted, “When the community was visiting the site, the landowners called police who came and arrested the people who were visiting. ‘They are trespassing.’ And they obliged. We were arrested on the property that we bought.” Selibo continued on, and the White landowners tried another tack: they withdrew from their frivolous court case against Selibo’s group and approached him with the offer of an out-of-court settlement. They would pay Selibo’s group for all of their costs, including lawyers’ fees, and for the price of the land including interest, and on top of that, an additional 250,000 rand. The Whites were willing to pay a tidy sum to avoid having Black neighbors. Insulting, of course, but Selibo and his community decided to take the money in a 1999 settlement, and then they identified a new plot that was almost four times the size of the original. Once again, they negotiated with the landowner, but now they didn’t have enough to cover the full price of the larger plot. They wrote to the provincial government and the national government to share their story and to ask for assistance. During that time, it was not easy for a nongovernment organization—for a government to give it money. We were still new in the democracy and didn’t have all the legislation. [The government] was very interested and supportive of our approach in terms of dealing with the housing issue. They were very interested and said we will assist … but we will transfer money to the municipality, and then you and the municipality will enter into a land agreement to drive this forward. From that point, in 2002, Selibo said he continued to meet with members every two weeks to keep them informed. Along with the municipality, they submitted a “township application,” and by local code, this triggered an invitation for local comments. Yet again, White landowners organized and tried in various ways to object. And according to Selibo, many of the people handling housing-related issues in the area were still White and still sympathetic to the landowners, and this led to more delays. The process would be delayed and delayed and delayed. They didn’t realize we were becoming specialists. You do like that to a person you are empowering that person. So now we are able to articulate each and every aspect of development. We were able to do our homework to do deal with the landowners in the area and to defend ourselves in the process, but it took a long time. A “long time” is really an understatement. But the agreements were finally approved. Selibo and his community received the land, and the government agreed to build RDP houses on it. In April 2014, more than 120 houses were finally completed and the government handed them over to waiting residents. The national government news agency released a piece announcing the ceremony, in which a Mogale local government leader proclaimed, “Land is important to human settlements. We need land to build houses and when you have a house, your dignity is restored.”19 For all the endless stories about what has not worked in terms of housing and development in South Africa, I was surprised to find almost no coverage of the ceremony or the development itself in the news media.20 Selibo highlighted that more recently, another 133 houses had been approved for development. When I asked him why he thought that the final product appeared so different from other RDP communities, he emphasized that what made the community unique was that it had developed solidarity through the years, and they created their own informal zoning regulations, which reflected a desire to avoid what had gone wrong elsewhere. Now we have a code of conduct. You can extend, but you can’t have a shack, you can’t sell it. But now the issue is that … it is a beautiful safe village and no one wants to move. Everyone wants to get a space here. They realize we have a treasure here. Especially in that village, their lives have improved significantly and the way we have been doing the work in the area, we have assisted them to get job opportunities, because we have worked as a family for a long time. It’s not easy in the country with high unemployment rate, but in that village, close to 99 percent are working because we have instilled responsibility. Even if they go and work for you … they have instilled a sense of responsibility and built one another. You would be very happy if someone came to work for you given how they conduct themselves. Also discussing how can we build ourselves. Their lives have improved a lot. When I conducted my Historical Memories Survey in Mogale, I decided to “oversample” in Ethembalethu to see whether the assertions of success had any merit. In a typical survey, given the small size of the area relative to the rest of Mogale City, we might have wound up with zero or just a few of the residents. But I was interested to see if the area was “the real deal” from the perspective of the people who actually lived there. We interviewed fourteen owners of these RDP houses, which is still a very small sample—more illustrative than statistically representative—but enough to shed some light on what makes the community unique. For example, 79 percent said they “never” felt unsafe walking in their neighborhood, as compared with 52 percent of Blacks in other areas of the same ward, and compared with just 34 percent of Black RDP owners in Mogale City. It seemed discouraging to find that only 46 percent of Ethembalethu residents said that “most people in their neighborhood could be trusted,” but that’s still much better than 30 percent of RDP owners throughout the municipality. And I asked the survey enumerators to rate the respondent’s “level of cooperation,” and fully 100 percent of the Ethembalethu respondents were “fully cooperative,” as compared with just 82 percent of RDP owners municipality wide. The residents seemed to have higher levels of the “social capital”21 that helps make democracy work. As I spoke with Selibo, I reminded myself to consider the research conducted by one of my former students, Gwyneth McClendon, who wrote an acclaimed book on the topic of envy in politics.22 A central problem she raised was the enormous challenges of delivering public housing because, particularly in South Africa, those who have not yet received this benefit can become very envious of those who have. And that frustration can turn to destructive behavior, leaving everyone worse off. I asked Selibo if that was a problem here, and he said, unequivocally, yes. “It’s a major problem in this area. Especially in this ward. Because now we have this beautiful township and a lot of community members [those in his ward] are still in that poor status. Most of the time we can’t always speak of Ethembalethu because people are not staying there and they are envious.” He went on to mention future plans, and indeed perhaps the best antidote to envious behavior is a credible commitment that the same benefits will be extended to all. On the other hand, given the twenty-year process to get phase one completed, this could be a dangerous proposition if that timetable is not accelerated given the growing impatience with demands. And in fact, Leslie Gama, whom I met in Muldersdrift on the last weekend of voter registration and whose parents went off to vote while he stayed at home during the first election of the new democratic era, showed me his designs to replicate what had been achieved in Ethembalethu. On an individual level, Gama bears some striking similarities to Selibo. He also grew up in a rural area with few human comforts. He stayed in Muldersdrift with his grandparents in a house made of mud bricks, built on a cattle farm. Because the construction process involved smearing cow dung on the bricks, he said that even today when he smells cow dung, he is reminded of his childhood. Leslie and his family had no electricity, and they got their water from a neighboring farm, illegally tapping into an irrigation system. They dug their own pit latrines to use as toilets. And he even worked for a spell in a hair salon. He started his own organization, Umnotho, which for about seven years by the time I met him in 2019 had been collecting money from families who wanted to upgrade their lives from shacks to formal settlements. I was very impressed by the bountiful gardens the community had grown and the detailed plans—including architectural drawings and models—they had commissioned for an integrated community. But just like Selibo, Gama faced the hurdles of local opposition, zoning rules, and occasional theft from his offices, as well as the challenge of getting the right attention from the right officials. Nonetheless, given his tenacity, the cohesion and support of his community, the progress he has detailed to me since we met, and the example of Ethembalethu, I am cautiously optimistic that he’ll succeed in this or a related venture. FIGURE 7.4. Slabs awaiting RDP houses in Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Without active involvement from community leaders like Selibo and Gama, government policies can languish. Too frequently, housing projects get started but remain unfinished owing to lack of planning, funding, and/or oversight, let alone as the result of a stalemate between competing political interests. In Munsieville, I toured a site with a checkerboard of concrete slabs designed to support RDP houses but that, at least for the time being, were nothing but useless eyesores. The latter, of course, tend to capture the imagination of democracy skeptics all around the municipality. While important, my broader point is that such failures are not the whole story. Income, Security, and Equality Beyond shelter and basic services, citizens want jobs, income, and to not be on the wrong end of extreme inequality. In 2019, Ramaphosa and the ANC campaigned on the slogan “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a tacit acknowledgment of what was needed. Nonetheless, while the economic record is certainly not the basis for a victory lap, it is also not dispositive for the value of democracy in the country. Moreover, although unemployment and inequality remain staggeringly high, the government has also provided critical cash grants to provide social security for millions of the most vulnerable. It may not have been rapid economic development, but the record contributed to dignified development. As a liberation movement, the ANC had been on record, including quite explicitly in the Freedom Charter, calling for the nationalization of the mines and of large sections of the economy. Moreover, the organization and its alliance partners, COSATU and the SACP, all drew heavily on Marxist-Leninist thought as guiding principles. They envisioned a new democratically elected government having a very strong hand in all aspects of the economy. As they prepared to govern, and once in power, ANC elites engaged in far-ranging discussions with a variety of economists and others inside and outside the country concerning strategies that would thread the needle between achieving economic growth and attaining some level of adequate redistribution in the near term. They actively and openly debated various models and the lessons to be learned from other countries’ experiences. Like most planners at the time, they wondered how they could emulate the high-performing economies in East Asia. Prominently in the background of such debates and discussions was the collapse of the Soviet Union. The failed record of centrally planned economies provided leverage for White business leaders to strike bargains with the liberation party and its partners to avert nationalization. They made the familiar argument that the new government should not “kill the goose that lays the golden egg.” (White business was the goose here.) Neo-liberal economic principles had gained global prominence and if you didn’t play by those rules, it was clear that international financial institutions would restrict access to credit and investments. Mandela and other top ANC brass were ultimately persuaded against nationalizing and, for that matter, against massive land distribution. As early as 1996, they adopted an economic strategy that involved privatization of state assets, trade liberalization, and bureaucratic reform.23 The compromise solution was to combine a largely free market system, while actively promoting Black economic empowerment. Companies could remain private, but they would need to demonstrate active inclusion of those who had been disadvantaged under Apartheid. And the government would be tasked with providing social support to the poor and extending social benefits widely. In October 1997, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel delivered a keynote speech for a book launch hosted by the Budget Information Service at IDASA. I had just started my work there the previous week and the event immediately highlighted for me the emerging political fault lines on economic policy. Like many of the other government leaders, Manuel had spent several years of his adult life in jail protesting the old government; he had long been a champion of the poor and the working class. Now, he was already being accused of being a lackey for the well-heeled. Critics said that the government’s revised economic strategy, called Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), with its emphasis on fiscal discipline and low inflation, reflected an abandonment of a focus on jobs and development for the impoverished masses. Manuel resisted this characterization. He quoted phrases from the original RDP plan to remind critics that the party had always intended to proceed in a fiscally responsible manner. And he quoted from Capital, in which Karl Marx argued that the burden of budget deficits falls on the working class. He was sharp and persuasive. Given the scale of wants and needs, the challenge of building the economy was enormous. At the very least, most assumed that simply ending Apartheid would yield some important economic benefits. First, the government should attain some savings from the elimination of multiple and inflated homeland governments, which cost much more than they took in, and a reduction in military spending, as it would no longer be at war with much of the country and the region. They would also save on the resources wasted controlling the movement of Black people. International economic sanctions would end, and perhaps foreign investors would flock to South Africa. The most optimistic held out hope that the merging of these two wildly different segments of the economy would quickly lead to everyone living at the level of White South Africans.24 In practice, the period 1994–2007 actually produced solid economic growth, especially compared with the disastrous last decade of Apartheid that preceded it. And during this interval, the incomes, opportunities, and lifestyles for millions of Black South Africans improved, generating widespread expansion of the Black middle class. As in the United States, the term “middle class” means many things to many people—certainly in South Africa, it does not connote an average or the middle of the income distribution but a lifestyle associated with some degree of comfort with disposable income. In other words, millions of Black South Africans began to gain access to the lifestyles that had been enjoyed almost exclusively by Whites: university for their children, the ability to purchase goods at one of South Africa’s many shopping malls, perhaps the ability to own an automobile. By some estimates, in terms of “affluence,” the middle class grew from 2.2 million in 1993 to 4.9 million in 2008 (and by 2008, 20 percent of the 1 million “upper class” were now Black African).25 For many, this was exactly the dream of a post-Apartheid South Africa. On the other hand, growth in this segment of the population gave rise to a growing chasm between Black haves and Black have-nots. For many of the millions without the disposable income to take advantage of new shopping opportunities or to purchase the latest mobile phone, let alone to have a decent roof over their heads, patience began to wear thin. Many criticized the GEAR plan as an abandonment of the poor majority. And then the global financial crisis of 2007–8 ravaged South Africa’s economy. In 2009, the year Jacob Zuma became president, the economy contracted by 1.5 percent—almost 3 percent, when calculated on a per capita basis. After that, the economy failed to sustain a serious recovery throughout his term. Per capita GDP growth practically screeched to a halt at 0.3 percent during those years. All told, between 1994 and 2018, South Africa’s average annual economic growth on a per capita basis was a paltry 1.2 percent.26 There is no single definitive answer for why the South African economy grew at the pace it did. Political conflicts and news of corruption within the ANC surely scared off some potential investments and deprived citizens of resources that would otherwise have been used on public expenditures.27 Insufficient infrastructure investment to meet the demands of citizens and businesses has also surely constrained productivity and growth. It is certainly plausible that the strength of organized labor contributed to wage bills that made some companies uncompetitive. And foreign direct investment into Africa has always been extremely low, and despite the end of Apartheid, investment into South Africa remained modest relative to initial hopes. FIGURE 7.5. GDP per capita growth, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Moreover, it is hard to ignore the extent to which the previous decade was challenging for most Upper-middle-income countries.28 For example, during this period, Brazil chalked up an average annual growth rate of 1.3 percent, almost exactly the same as South Africa’s, and with peaks and valleys that are remarkably similar. If we evaluate South Africa’s economic performance relative to other Upper-middle-income countries29 and to the rest of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as presented in figure 7.5, the country’s lackluster economic performance still appears to lag. However, on average, those countries only grew about 1.2 and 0.8 percentage points faster than South Africa did, and even these comparisons are driven by a few high-growth countries rather than a consistent difference. And within these sets of countries for this period, there is really no discernible difference between democracies and non-democracies (despite some compelling research suggesting that democracies do tend to grow faster on average).30 For those who like to hold out the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to describe Black rule in South Africa, it’s important to dispel the myth that South Africa’s post-Apartheid economic performance has in any way resembled Zimbabwe’s. With respect to the latter, one of my favorite teaching props is a photo I took of a Zimbabwean one hundred trillion dollar note, along with a photo of ordinary Zimbabweans using this currency as wallpaper. With declining government revenues, Zimbabwe’s authoritarian government under Robert Mugabe simply printed more and more money to finance its expenditures amid the president’s lavish lifestyle. In turn, the country experienced hyperinflation and the collapse of its currency. Stores could not set consistent prices nor could they reliably stock goods. Increasingly, citizens were forced to barter with one another to get what they needed. By contrast, South Africans have experienced only minor devaluations of their currency, and their economy has been generally well managed with low rates of inflation, low debt, and small budget deficits. Notably, the post-Apartheid period was marked by steep declines in the mining industry. The country’s gold output decreased steadily since 1994, with some decline already underway between 1980 and 1994.31 The historical discovery of gold near Krugersdorp preceded Mandela’s election by more than a century. The mining went very deep into the Rand, and it simply became much less profitable relative to the degree it once was as the effort-to-yield ratio continually climbed, and it would no longer be a source of easy profits in the new democracy. The collapse of mining has hit Mogale hard. As one resident recounted, “We would grow up seeing [miners] with their hats going down into the mines, and then coming up. It used to be a very vibrant area. But now of late, there’s a lot of unemployment. You feel pity when you see them on the corners staying or sitting idle by the shops, and becoming drunk.” From multiple vantage points within the municipal borders, one can see the large, ugly West Rand Consolidated Mine hill. It’s a reminder of what made this city (gold) and what it is now (essentially without a mining sector). Thousands of able-bodied people are not gainfully employed. Instead, a few informal miners dangerously try to retrieve small treasures where they can, with little regard for personal safety. The failure to grow the economy deprived the country of a key weapon against the Apartheid legacies of high unemployment, high poverty, and high inequality. By any measure, South African unemployment levels have remained staggering—at least 25 percent—in the decades following the end of Apartheid, perhaps over 40 percent if applying a “strict” definition.32 And on surveys, in interviews, and on the radio and other media, lack of jobs was the most important issue that people indicated as a concern for them. In 2017–18, a full 44 percent of Mogale residents surveyed said they were “unemployed and looking for work”—and that figure is low for all of Gauteng Province, where 52 percent responded this way.33 Are democratic politics to blame? As figure 7.6 clearly shows, South African unemployment in 2018, as reported using International Labor Organization models, was very high in comparative perspective—measured as the worst among Upper-middle-income countries. But it was already high at the dawn of the democratic era, so the failure is one of being unable to solve an existing problem rather than creating a new one. The picture of inequality is similar: in the decade after 1995, already high levels of income inequality intensified. After 2005 this trend reversed somewhat, and by 2015 income inequality was at the approximate level it had been in the mid-1990s.34 The fact that a highly unequal society has remained highly unequal is nothing to celebrate. But again, in the current state of the world, in which wealthier people have much better work and investment opportunities,35 the South African story is clearly part of a global one. Even after the 2008 worldwide economic meltdown, increasing numbers of South Africans came to own major household assets—realizing a “middle-class” lifestyle. In 2009, just 15.1 percent owned a computer; by 2015 that number jumped to 22.1 percent. Similar gains were observed with respect to satellite television (13.0 to 35.1 percent), washing machines (27.5 to 35.9 percent), and refrigerators (64.7 to 79.7 percent).36 FIGURE 7.6. Unemployment in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1996–2018). Source: Author analysis of International Labor Organization estimates in WDI. As the United Nations has recently documented, during approximately the period considered here (1990–2015), two-thirds of the share of income going to the top 1 percent increased in 59 of 100 countries with available data.37 Cash Is King One of the most important ways in which the post-Apartheid government has assisted the poor—in the face of a weak economy, dismal employment prospects, and high inequality—has been through direct cash grants, fulfilling a constitutional right and Freedom Charter aspiration to social security. In 2018–19, in a country of 56 million people, 17.6 million were beneficiaries of social grants. The vast majority of these funds are allocated through a Child Support Grant (12.5 million children) and the Old-Age Grant (3.5 million people older than sixty). Other grants are given to people with disabilities, for care dependency, to war veterans, and to support the care of foster children.38 The system is far from perfect, and news stories occasionally pop up about fraud and delays. Yet, this does not go unchecked: for example, in 2012, the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) introduced a biometric scheme in the payout process that saved millions of rand in false claims. Even that was not foolproof, and the DA and others charged that fraud persisted. In 2018, the biometric system was scrapped in favor of a legacy system.39 While such stories and reports frequently contribute to claims and perceptions that the entire agency is corrupt and failing, by and large, most people are paid every month; and the incidence of grant relief has been extremely pro-poor—certainly relative to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and among most Upper-middle-income countries. In many other countries with generous social insurance schemes, particularly in Latin America, the wealthier segments of society manage to capture disproportionate gains, making the net distribution of resources even more unequal. By contrast, according to data from the World Bank ASPIRE database, for the period approximately 2008–16, South Africa provided the most generous transfers with the greatest impact for reducing income inequality by targeting the very poorest.40 Cash grants have contributed to decreasing poverty rates, especially extreme poverty,41 particularly after 2000.42 Although the amount transferred for each grant tends to be modest—about $30 per month for a child grant, for example—getting cash into the hands of the very poor allows individuals and caregivers to buy the essentials. This critical set of grants helped lower the share of the population living under an international poverty line43 from about 34 percent in the period 1993–96 to about 17.5 percent in the period 2010–14.44 Investments in Human Value Reflecting both global trends and the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, South Africa’s 1996 constitution identified access to health care and basic education as fundamental rights of citizenship. Health and education are often described as key components of “human capital,”45 in the sense that investments in these can generate returns in the form of economic productivity. I believe that is too limited a view: we also value better health and education because they are inextricably linked to human autonomy and well-being. Promoting health and education might be better understood simply as investments in and recognition of the value of humans. From the dawn of South Africa’s new democracy, activist critics, journalists, and academics have repeatedly highlighted government failures in meeting crucial needs in these sectors. For example, Section 27, an organization so named for the section of the constitution that details citizens’ social and economic rights, has routinely applied intense pressure to improve both outcomes, especially among the poor, through the media, organized protests, court cases, and direct presentations to government bodies. The LRC, Lawyers for Human Rights, and a host of sector-specific NGOs have developed or adapted their missions to hold the government accountable to make good on constitutional promises. And once again, the list of gaps such organizations have identified is real and observable—especially if one looks at persistent disparities between the haves and have-nots. For example, much like in the United States, the quality of everyday health-care access remains very much a function of ability to pay. The Netcare Krugersdorp Hospital and the Yusuf Dadoo Hospital are situated about a mile apart from one another, but the distance between the quality of facilities and care received is much, much greater. At the former, where people must pay for their care, the outside looks like the glossy Boston hospital buildings I see close to my home and work, and inside, the shelves are stocked and patients can expect to be seen relatively quickly and to receive excellent care. At the latter, citizens report that wait times are long, supplies are frequently unavailable, and the likelihood that the facilities will be clean is low. Similar gaps divide the educational sphere. Notably, there are three types of primary and secondary schools: public schools that are fully free; those in which fees are collected; and private or independent schools. For example, Monument High School, the site of the first polling station I visited on election day in 2019, is a former “Model C” school. These were once White-only public schools and tend to be located in historically White areas. During the early 1990s, as Apartheid was ending, they were afforded greater autonomy, and the government allowed them to collect fees. Today, these are generally the highest-quality public schools, and in Mogale City, both White and Black families who can afford the fees—but not the cost of private school—tend to send their children there. By contrast, most townships, like Munsieville and Kagiso, host public schools in which parents are not expected to pay fees, but the resulting resources and quality—for example, at Munsieville Primary School and Lodirile Secondary School in Rietvallei—tend to be much more modest. As one Mogale City teacher described to me, “These schools are often not that clean and do not look like conducive environments for productive teaching and learning.” And for those who can afford it or who attain scholarships, South Africa boasts many excellent private schools, including in Mogale City, where independent school franchises have come in to meet the growing demand from families—for example, Alma Mater International School and Curro Krugersdorp Independent School, where students can expect access to world-class media resources, relatively small student-to-teacher ratios, and outstanding athletic facilities. These schools also tend to prepare students for possible overseas university education and frequently follow British curricula. As of 2019, of the approximately 75,000 students in Mogale City schools, only about 5 percent attended private schools, and an additional 31 percent attended fee-collecting public schools. As in most things South African, the gulf between what a minority—even if increasingly multiracial—can access relative to the rest is so enormous as to make for frustrating comparisons. As just one important metric of school quality for which objective data are available, I calculated student-to-teacher ratios for Mogale City primary and secondary schools and found that at the 15 independent schools, the ratio was 12:1, at the 23 fee-collecting public schools it was 24:1, and at the 47 no-fee public schools it was 34:1. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, the neighborhoods (wards) for the fee-collecting public schools were 39 percent Black with just 7 percent of the residents living in informal settlements; the no-fee schools were, on average, 91 percent Black and 27 percent of residents in informal settlements.46 In turn, we should not be surprised when we see inequality reproduced across generations given this state of affairs. Even serious concerns about persistent inequities—wholly reminiscent of the American health and educational systems—should not obscure critical efforts and accomplishments or the challenging context that democratic governments have faced. In both sectors, the government has spent heavily, has vastly widened access, and has made some clear and observable inroads, especially in improving the quality of life and capacities of the very poor. In terms of education, in 2019 the South African government spent approximately 50 percent more as a share of GDP (6.5 percent) compared with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (4.3 percent) or the average of all Upper-middle-income (UMI) countries (4.1 percent).47 And with respect to health, government spending increased substantially over the period 2002–18 such that by the latter year South Africa was also vastly outspending peers from these reference groups (4.4 percent/GDP for South Africa compared with 3.2 percent for UMI countries and 1.9 percent for Africa).48 Moreover, in each sector, democratic processes have contributed to important gains and corrections. Health and Health Care Just a few months after his inauguration, Mandela’s government rolled out as a first signature project a new program offering free health care for all pregnant and nursing women as well as all children under six.49 The newly covered population was guaranteed treatment at all public hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. And to accommodate increased demand, the policy was coupled with the construction of new clinics.50 By 2003, free hospital care was extended to children older than six with disabilities.51 In turn, the share of births attended by professional staff grew from 82 percent in 1994 to 97 percent in 2016.52 And in 2017, South Africa had the highest numbers of physicians, nurses, and midwives relative to the size of the population of all non-island, sub-Saharan African countries.53 FIGURE 7.7. Average life expectancy at birth in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income and African countries (1995–2017). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Owing at least in part to the availability of these inputs and other policies, leading indicators suggest that health and well-being for the most vulnerable have improved. The under-5 mortality rate at the time of Mandela’s election in 1994 was 61 deaths per 1,000, and that dropped to a low of 37.1 by 2017. As depicted in figure 7.7, at the beginning of the democratic period the life expectancy rate in South Africa was the lowest of all Upper-middle-income countries but among the highest of all other African countries. However, it took a profound dip in the late 1990s owing to the rash of deaths from the staggering AIDS epidemic. Once the government finally adopted policies and practices of administering anti-retroviral drug therapy, extending the lives of those living with HIV—responding to political pressures as described in chapter 6—estimated life expectancy quickly returned to an upward trajectory, albeit diminished relative to its economic peers. Indeed, the mushrooming of extraordinarily large HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics at the tail end of the Apartheid era proved to be an overwhelming burden on other aspects of the health-care system. As early as the mid-1990s, more than 10 percent of the adult population aged 15–49 was living with HIV, and by 2000, the incidence (new cases) of tuberculosis was almost 800 per 100,000 people. Both disease burdens were much higher than the typical experience of most African and Upper-middle-income country cohorts or, frankly, countries anywhere in the world.54 While it’s true that the ongoing size of these epidemics in terms of numbers infected can be partially ascribed to early government failures in response, it is also important to point out that both HIV and tuberculosis have remained highly prevalent throughout the southern African region, even in countries like Botswana that responded much earlier and more aggressively (in part because successful treatment has kept people alive). Moreover, the South African government, despite its early flawed response under Mbeki, and after relentless democratic challenges from civil society, went on to embark on the world’s largest AIDS treatment program.55 Today, both its AIDS and tuberculosis government responses are far-reaching and world class—and various studies have identified South Africa as leading the way in best practices.56 Moreover, concerns about poor health and health disparities are not simply a matter of access to formal health care. Better infrastructure and living conditions in the form of clean water, sanitation, and shelter are themselves critically important for healthy outcomes, and progress in those areas contributes to better health outcomes for the very poor and is likely reflected in positive trends in life expectancy and infant mortality. On the other hand, the persistence of vast socioeconomic differences in South Africa will no doubt continue to reproduce inequalities in health outcomes for some time, and even the equalization of health-care resources would almost surely not be sufficient to equalize health outcomes in the near term. Along these lines, particularly in Mogale City, the legacy of the country’s mining economy contributes to widespread environmental risks. Despite the metaphorical status of “gold dust,” the reality is that mining dust is a major health hazard. First, for miners who have worked or continue to work deep in the mines, silicosis—also known as “black lung”—is a debilitating disease acquired from the inhalation of the very fine silica dust generated through the process of extraction. It causes shortness of breath and chest pain and makes individuals more vulnerable to tuberculosis, already widely prevalent in the country. Second, Krugersdorp and other mining towns are replete with mine dumps or tailings. When the wind blows, toxic dust fills the air and seeps into the local streams and canals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the brunt of such environmental degradation is again borne by poor and Black citizens, including in Mogale, especially in and around the mines of Kagiso, which are replete with acid mine drainage.57 One notoriously awful site is the Mintails mine I passed on election day. Within these tailings, scientists have detected arsenic, lead, and other chemicals, frequently radioactive. Nonetheless, children routinely play on toxic mining excavations as if they were sand dunes, as they are not sufficiently guarded from the general public.58 Although concerns about the safe cleanup of such sites rarely find their way into electoral politics, pressure from other democratic institutions has proven important to raise awareness and to apply pressure on businesses and government to take action. I became aware of these concerns through my own involvement with the LRC, as I was introduced to a partner of theirs, Mariette Liefferink, sometimes described as South Africa’s “Erin Brockovich” because of her passionate involvement in environmental issues. On our tour of the area, she pointed out the neglect and failings of various mining corporations to properly close the dormant mines, as well as the ways in which they have tried to avoid taking responsibility by selling off their assets to very small companies that could never afford to pay any claims for damages. She, the LRC, and others have been documenting the extent of environmental degradation and the harms caused and have sought justice for those most affected, especially through the courts. Undoubtedly, the democratic era ushered in the opportunities to pursue such work, first by putting an accent on the indignities leveled against those central and/or proximate to the mining economy; and second by actually securing some compensation for them. They highlight, of course, that much work remains, but they have had some important successes. Most notably, owing to a vast class action suit, in May 2018 the mining companies agreed to an unprecedented 5 billion rand (400 million USD) settlement for thousands of miners suffering from silicosis.59 Education As has been the case for health, in terms of equity of access to schooling, particularly to higher levels of education, we can document substantial progress. For example, I consider the distribution of the highest level of education attained by individuals in the Mogale area on two South African census rounds: 1991 and 2011, and just those individuals aged 19 to 29 in each. This restriction helps us isolate the educational opportunities created before and after 1994. In 1991, close to 70 percent of Whites had completed at least their “matric” year—named for the all-important standardized, national high school completion exam—which is viewed as the critical attainment of credentials for high-paying jobs that demand skills. At that time, not even 20 percent of Blacks had those credentials. And more than 50 percent of Blacks lacked even a completed primary education. By 2011, the gap had substantially narrowed: Blacks gained almost 30 percentage points, with just shy of 50 percent completing at least secondary school, and in this later round, less than 8 percent had not completed primary school. And this did not come at the “expense” of White enrollments: by 2011, secondary school rates among Whites had climbed to 76 percent. When considering the national level—and in comparative perspective—secondary school enrollment was already higher in 1990 than the average for Upper-middle-income countries (and much higher compared with African countries). And all the way until 2018, South Africa at least kept pace with growth in enrollment as compared with both of the reference groups.60 Such broad portraits clearly mask critical nuances with respect to the actual quality of education that students receive, let alone the attainment of education as an ultimate goal. The gaps are troubling, and some studies have even concluded that the quality of education overall has decreased during the post-Apartheid period.61 One often-cited indicator of government failure on education is the fact that South African students have generally performed poorly on international tests.62 This is true. On the other hand, South African students were already performing relatively poorly in 1995, and at least achieved some marginal gains, especially between 2001 and 2011 and particularly among the lowest-performing students. As one nuanced assessment of twenty years of South African education has highlighted, such benchmarks need to be viewed in context—especially the fact that most of the other countries that participate in such testing are far richer.63 While many countries around the world face legacies of uneven and unequal educational systems, few are burdened by a history comparable to that of the Apartheid system’s “Bantu Education,” which deliberately sought to limit the potential of a majority of learners with respect to curriculum and promotion of critical thinking skills, which also affected the training of teachers.64 Combine this with persistent de facto residential segregation, and it is not surprising that huge educational gaps remain across racial lines, as well as between students in free public schools, fee-paying public schools, and private schools, where parents also tend to be more educated.65 A particularly grave affront to human dignity lies with the horrific quality of public educational facilities and instruction in rural areas—outside the industrial Gauteng Province. Eighty or more students are routinely forced to crowd themselves into classrooms, and their schools frequently lack running water, functioning toilets, and well-trained teachers. In one tragic account, first documented in the New York Times66 and that subsequently went “viral” in the South African media, two children drowned in pit toilets in a dilapidated school in Mpumalanga Province. The story juxtaposed the greediness of government officials and the disappearance of millions of dollars of funding next to a tragic and truly unpleasant death of young people, providing powerful fodder for citizen anger. Ten days after the publication of the original article, and no doubt spurred on by the embarrassing revelations, President Ramaphosa announced the launch of a new program, the Sanitation Appropriate for Education Initiative. According to Ramaphosa, the initiative would “spare generations of young South Africans the indignity, discomfort and danger of using pit latrines and other unsafe facilities in our schools.”67 The good news? One NGO subsequently calculated that the initiative resulted in the upgrading of toilets in twenty thousand schools. The bad? The same NGO estimated that at this pace, it would take nineteen years to complete the job on a national scale.68 Did the news story cause the policy change? The proximity of the actions and the responses suggests that it certainly triggered the timing of the reactions, but it’s hard to imagine that the story would have come to light if there were not already so much political attention being paid to sanitary conditions and if civil society organizations and public interest lawyers were not already applying pressure through political campaigns and sometimes through appeals to constitutional law in the courts. Like many gains in a democratic polity, it was victory from a million cuts. For people in remote rural areas, democratic political pressures ultimately led to government actions that would bring visibility and material improvements to their lives. In a polity that valued economic growth above all else, rural schoolchildren might have been deliberately overlooked as a necessary casualty of “development.” In the context of democratic South Africa, at the very least, no one can publicly question the deservingness of these children to receive the same opportunities and services. Continuing to shine a light on deficiencies sometimes elicits action, even if rarely sufficient to close substantial gaps. Palpable Progress, if Incomplete For every material gain I’ve detailed here, one could add valid caveats and qualifications. Electrification? But what about rolling blackouts? Social grants? Those are too small to be meaningful! Housing? Too many people still waiting and the construction is shoddy! All of these are fair concerns and useful grist for the democratic mill. In no country in the world do people think that all of their material needs have been met, and by any objective standard, most South Africans still have much to wish for, not the least of which are better opportunities to work, to earn a steady income, and to gain access to high-quality education and health care. Nonetheless, I think it’s hard to deny that the overall gains have been quite substantial for millions of people who hoped for material comfort and a degree of economic security after Apartheid. When asked, people can document meaningful change. In fact, perhaps this entire book is motivated by the transformation I’ve observed with my own eyes over the past several decades: I have continued to return to the very places I first toured almost thirty years ago, including largely Black townships on the outskirts of the three largest South African cities: Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban. Observable conditions have improved substantially, sometimes dramatically. Back then, raw sewage ran through the streets, and electrical connections were rare. At night, in many areas, high-mast street lamps projected harsh, bright light over large areas, as if for an airport rather than a human settlement. During June and July—wintertime in the southern hemisphere—the putrid smell of burning garbage could sting your nose for miles around as people sought to keep warm. Today, Soweto is a city unto itself, one in which poverty persists, but alongside an increasingly thriving Black middle class with upscale amenities. In Khayelitsha, near Cape Town and Kwamashu, near Durban, and in townships and locations across the country, tarred roads have replaced dirt passageways; more people live in houses and flats (apartments) rather than shacks; and millions more enjoy electricity, lighting, piped water, and flush toilets. Since my first visit to South Africa, I have traveled to every one of the country’s nine provinces and have been to urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Now, having in mind the many other African contexts I have visited in the meantime, including rural and urban Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, it is hard to imagine many South Africans wanting to trade places with their counterparts on the respective socioeconomic ladders of any of the countries north of the Limpopo River. Only in the small (and also democratic) countries of Mauritius, Cape Verde, and Botswana and the small, oil-rich, but not democratic country of Gabon do measured overall levels of service provision consistently approximate what South Africans enjoy.69 And these accomplishments were set against the extremely challenging background of high inequality, a difficult global economic environment, an evaporating mineral economy, and substantial backlogs in the development of human capital. With respect to the latter point, we should not forget that the New South Africa was comprised of millions of Black South African adults who had been previously denied a decent education and yet were called on to run vast government agencies and fill the management ranks of businesses. Moreover, we can blame Jacob Zuma for many things, but not for the global economic meltdown that coincided with the start of his presidency. The social and economic legacies of South Africa’s past have not been easily overcome. Life in the still largely White suburbs around Krugersdorp remains far, far more comfortable than in the townships of Munsieville and Kagiso. Nonetheless, the conditions of the latter have measurably improved, with much greater parity in access to government services. This pattern is repeated in much of the country. Political competition, citizen pressure, and respect for the constitutional order have all contributed to such dignified development and reflect well on the value of democracy in South Africa.",

      "content": "7 Prosperity THERE SHALL BE HOUSES, SECURITY, AND COMFORT EVEN THE 1955 FREEDOM CHARTER clearly said that “freedom” must imply more than simply citizens being able to choose their leaders. Famously, the document declared, “There Shall be Houses, Security, and Comfort.” Almost forty years later, those dreams were still not realities for millions of South Africans. As such, during its first electoral campaign in 1994, the ANC’s party leaders promised to provide houses, health care, lighting, security, and other sources of material prosperity to those who went without. In fact, when he was speaking to prospective voters, Mandela could sometimes be mistaken for an ordinary politician, as he promised “a better life for all” if elected. Stanley Greenberg, a veteran American political strategist who assisted with the inaugural ANC campaign, recalled Mandela as being a fiercely competitive politician. The liberation stalwart was not satisfied with the idea of simply taking in the votes they would receive because of his organization’s role in the struggle or his own personal stature.1 Mandela wanted to win the election convincing citizens that an ANC government would actually deliver concrete improvements to their lives. Moreover, the 1996 constitution enshrined several material needs as rights, including with respect to health care, reproductive health, sufficient food and water, adequate housing, basic education, and social security for those unable to support themselves. By 2019, even in Mogale City, located in South Africa’s richest province and industrial heartland, citizens routinely asserted that the government had failed to deliver what people needed. The rhetoric surrounding persistent service delivery protests echoed what many residents—Black and White—said to me in interviews: the government has accomplished nothing. And throughout the 2019 election campaign, political opponents pointed to the realities of poverty, inequality, and obvious human want as evidence of the government’s disastrous performance over the previous quarter century. In turn, many suspect that democracy has not been a help but rather a hindrance to human development. To be sure, the record is littered with disappointments. The complaints and protests are rooted in actual instances of deprivation. And South Africa remains a profoundly unequal society. Yet, it is also the case that since the end of Apartheid, South Africa has chalked up some extraordinary accomplishments in terms of improving the material well-being of its citizens, especially the most vulnerable. And much of this can be directly linked to democratic practice—that is, the application of competitive political pressures to enact and to implement development-enhancing policies. Moreover, many of the disappointments and even the severe shortfalls of the post-Apartheid record reflect at least as much about the continued weight of the country’s historical legacies and global conditions as they do about the performance of democratic government. Various government critics have rightly highlighted how social and economic policies and practices could have been more thoroughgoing, implemented earlier and more efficiently. But if we take a step back to focus not just on the critiques but also on what has been accomplished during the first quarter century, we see that much of the record on material progress, especially for the poor, and in light of the country’s history, is quite remarkable. First, I consider the conditions of human settlement, including access to basic services, where the changes are most apparent especially at the local level. Second, I look at the challenge of growing and equalizing cash incomes. And third, I briefly describe the record of investing in human capital, including with respect to health and education. Once again, I try to highlight patterns in Mogale relative to the rest of South Africa, and South Africa in comparative context. Give Me Shelter From 1994, the idea of a “better life” for millions of South Africans largely connoted gaining access to formal housing and basic services—electricity, water, and sanitation. And to varying degrees, politicians from the ANC, and from competing parties, promised during all of the subsequent election campaigns that they would expand access to these.2 For millions of people, the results were life-changing. The most important signature project was the RDP house: RDP is the acronym for the first government’s economic and development strategy, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. In a country where millions of people lacked reliable shelter, the government proposed to build millions of homes. While the design has undergone some revision over the years, it has always been a very basic, rectangular concrete structure with a tin roof, designed to provide accommodation for a single family. The intentions and ambitions were noble: people deserve to live in a real, secure shelter, not in an overcrowded shack. If your household income fell below a certain level, and you were a South African citizen, you would be eligible to get one of these houses. But you had to get in line. Good data on the number of houses actually built are hard to come by. One reasonable estimate that echoes what various government officials have shared with me is that between 1994 and 2015, over 2.8 million houses were delivered, meaning that approximately one-third of all South African residences are fully subsidized by the government.3 Certainly nowhere else in Africa has such a scheme existed, and I have not been able to find anything comparable anywhere in the Global South, let alone in the richest countries. The most generous programs elsewhere involve low-cost loans or subsidies for housing, but not a title deed to a house free of charge. Due in large part to the RDP, in 2016, 79 percent of South Africans lived in formal housing—marking a 21-percentage-point gain since 1995.4 And beyond just houses, statistical data reveal an important and broader portrait of change, one in which democratic pressures have arguably been quite important. First, consider electrification. In 1996, 58 percent of households had electricity connections and by 2016, over 90 percent had access.5 To be sure, the country has in recent years faced long periods of rolling blackouts and sometimes-interrupted power supplies—all of which are the sources of daily frustration and anger. Yet, the transformation in access is both impressive and, to a degree, the cause of such shortages as so many more people now make demands on the system. Consider also basic water and sanitation services. In 1996, just 47 percent of Black Africans had piped water in their dwellings (compared with over 96 percent of Whites).6 By 2011, that figure had jumped to 67 percent for Black Africans (and 99 percent of Whites). By 2015, over 95 percent of all South Africans had direct access to piped water.7 In 1996, just 50 percent of households had access to flush toilets connected to sewerage systems or septic tanks. By 2016, coverage increased to 64 percent of households.8 And in an important related public health trend, in 2000, over 12 percent of the population practiced open defecation, but that was down to less than 2 percent by 2018.9 These are solid jumps in service coverage in the context of a growing population—but I don’t want to overstate the South African picture because in countries around the world, citizens have also enjoyed substantial improvements in recent decades. For example, across sub-Saharan Africa, the gains in electrification coverage were from 16 percent to 43 percent; among Low- and Middle-income countries, the number of households covered went from 65 percent to 85 percent. Nonetheless, South Africa still outperforms these group averages. South Africa also bested neighbors Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Mozambique in terms of gains in service coverage. Only in Botswana was the overall change more significant (17 percent had access to electricity in 1995; 64 percent had it in 2016) but, of course, from a much lower base.10 The fact that we’ve observed all of this progress during the era of democratic politics doesn’t necessarily imply that democracy caused these changes. It’s impossible to know how things would have been under a different type of political system. Looking at the timing and geographic distribution of who got what and when, there are good reasons to think that democratic pressures—starting from the Mandela campaign—did play a role. For example, one excellent study demonstrates that in areas where electricity was provided by the national parastatal (Eskom), during the 1996–2001 period, increased electrification of households was most profound in the areas with the largest numbers of newly enfranchised (i.e., non-White) voters.11 The authors interpret this to imply that since just about everywhere the new pivotal voters were Black and likely without electricity, this would lead the government to want to be responsive to voters in providing this service in order to improve the likelihood of a win in the next election. And they argue that those in power were acting to satisfy a large number of new voters who largely lacked services—a winning strategy if voters value them. Relatedly, for a later period (approximately 2001–11), Daniel de Kadt and I found that changes in levels of citizen support for the ANC across almost three thousand wards was inversely related to changes in the extent of basic service provision, especially of water access. Although initially counterintuitive, we concluded that this was a nuanced form of accountability and now potentially more forward-looking. For those areas that had not yet seen great improvements in service provision, citizens were more likely to continue to support the ANC in the hopes that they would be next, whereas the citizens in now-serviced areas were more likely to be looking to other parties to focus on policies beyond basic service provision.12 Together, these studies highlight the ways in which the links between service delivery and voting can incentivize action, especially when political competition is high. While electoral pressures may always loom large, the courts and appeals to constitutional rights have also proved to be extremely important sources of pressure for government to provide basic services for the poor, including with respect to housing, land rights, health, and education. For example, the legal case Government of the Republic of South Africa vs. Grootboom (2000) was particularly influential. Irene Grootboom and others had been evicted from their informal dwellings by the government, which was trying to build some low-cost housing on their site. In turn, drawing on the constitutional right to shelter, Grootboom went to court to force the government to provide at least temporary adequate housing, especially because children were involved. The court found that, indeed, the government had this obligation, which essentially breathed life into the aspirations of the constitution, saying that these rights were not simply platitudes but needed to be enforced. The ruling argued that the denial of shelter was tantamount to the denial of human dignity and the opportunity to enjoy other rights enshrined in the constitution.13 While that judgment had many positive long-term effects in helping to make the courts an effective vehicle for social transformation, and securing the right to housing, one cannot escape the unfortunate reality that Irene Grootboom herself never got housing and died poor and in a shack in 2008. Many South Africans have been frustrated and frequently engage in protest because supply has not kept up with demand. To put the size of the promise in perspective, each house costs approximately 10,000 USD to build, and South Africa’s per capita income is less than 7,000 USD. Nonetheless, these political pressures continue to keep further development and allocation of RDP houses on the political agenda, often to the dismay of local politicians, who face running lists of people waiting for theirs. Township Life Traveling up and down Mogale City’s rolling hills and around its sometimes narrow streets, I spoke with citizens, politicians, journalists, and civil society leaders. I tried to learn the extent to which the statistical portraits described above resonated with the lived realities in various neighborhoods, with a particular focus on the predominantly Black townships of Kagiso and Munsieville and the formal and informal settlements around the more rural Muldersdrift. I concluded in short order that the municipality is not a standout success story by any means, nor is it the opposite. In fact, Mogale’s record of development seems to reflect much of what has transpired in other midsized South African municipalities. Norman Sedumedi, a former teacher who serves as the councillor for Ward 24 in Munsieville, the township in which he was born and raised, provided some history. As an ANC politician with a record to defend, he wanted to highlight progress when I asked if there was any to report. Still, the facts of what he shared with me when I asked, “What’s changed?” were easily corroborated, including by my own site visits. He spoke of Munsieville’s relatively new sports complex and a regional park, as well as the fact that all the streets were tarred and that all the houses, except some small and newer informal settlements, had electricity. He described the high school and the primary schools built to accommodate additional children and to reduce the length of their walk to school. The government had built health clinics and early childhood development and youth centers. He conceded that many of them don’t work as they had hoped or intended. I passed the relatively new senior center on multiple occasions, and indeed, I could see throngs of older residents coming and going, and at least superficially, it appeared to play a vibrant role in the community. By contrast, the tennis courts without nets that stood barren next to a locked recreational center reminded me how public projects can sometimes become white elephants. FIGURE 7.1. Corane Street, Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. When it came to the subject of housing and service provision, Sedumedi shared both a record of pride and a concern for dependency on the state in the context of low growth and high unemployment. He also expressed a general sense of exasperation that “it is a moving target. You never get it right for as long as people are alive and for as long as we have not fixed the issue of changing the economic landscape. Because the more the economy remains as it is, all of the burden will be for the state.” He said that since 1994, between 3,000 and 4,000 RDP houses had been built in the area. He worried that free housing, health care, and education might be disincentivizing people to work. On the other hand, it’s also hard to imagine how productive people could be without these basic needs. In the larger Black township of Kagiso, I spoke with seventy-nine-year-old Lerato Dube. We met at the Kagiso Methodist Church on a Tuesday afternoon, the time she serves soup to local residents. Her hair was wrapped in a bright green ANC bandana, and it was just a day before the 2019 election. She insisted on being referred to as Gogo (Zulu for Granny) and on serving me as well, so I obliged with some embarrassment at being fed a meal meant for those who actually needed one. But there was more soup available than takers on that afternoon, and this was her preference. So while I ate, I asked her to tell me about her life, what had changed, what had stayed the same. Dube was born in KwaZulu-Natal a few years before Apartheid was implemented14 and recounted what amounted to local transformation. When I [came to] Kagiso [in] 1992, Kagiso wasn’t like this. They were making fires with coal and wood. There was no electricity. They were lighting candles and lamps. There was no road. The taxi was no taxi because there was no road. It looked like a field.15 … Times goes and comes until 1994, then we ask electric and got. Then we asked for water. Even the water, it was very, very slow. The old house, that’s the other side of our house, there was the water on the outside. They were not allowed to make a pipe to put the water inside. If you want to wash, in cold or raining or snowing, you stand outside and do your washing or maybe bathing. After 1994, things [were becoming] better and better because now … we got water everywhere. We got the right toilet everywhere. Then we got the proper houses. Older South Africans, like other South Africans, have many concerns and frustrations about what has not changed, and about the changes they see that are for the worse, including increased drug use and violence among young people. But like Dube, many highlight that the material circumstances of their lives are radically different today from what they previously experienced, particularly for those who moved from shacks and squatter camps to their own homes. Notable exceptions are those who worked as teachers or nurses during the Apartheid days, who tended to have access to simple but formal government houses and some basic services. As of 2018, approximately 20 percent of all Black Mogale residents lived in RDP houses.16 Moreover, basic service delivery has expanded widely. In my sample, of adults forty years of age and older who said they had always lived in the area of Mogale City, as shown in figure 7.2, the racial gap in service delivery closed quite dramatically during the democratic era. In 1994, just 24 percent of Blacks had access to electricity, while 79 percent of Whites had access; by 2019, both approached universal access: 84.5 percent of Blacks and 95.4 percent of Whites.17 For Black South Africans who received RDP houses, they were much more likely to have access to other basic services compared with all other Black South Africans. For instance, in Mogale City, 99 percent of those living in RDP houses in 2019 had access to electricity, flush toilets, and piped water. Among all other Black residents, 15 to 20 percent fewer Black households had access to those services.18 Again, the RDP houses are modest structures generally erected in neighborhoods that look nothing like the established suburbs of Krugersdorp North or Noordheuwel, which are still mostly populated by Whites. While the houses were meant to displace shacks, in many cases, homeowners have built shack “additions,” which they rent out, or they move into the additions themselves and rent out the house. In many cases, homeowners have sold their homes, sometimes to recently arrived foreign nationals, which has generated resentment and has tended to exacerbate the sense of a fundamental housing crisis, certainly in Mogale City. FIGURE 7.2. The Black-White gap in basic service delivery, Mogale City (1970–2019). Source: Author analysis of HMS_2019. Based on survey responses for year of access among respondents who always lived in Mogale City area. All of these patterns are frustrating but quite understandable responses to the basic condition of having an asset but little income. In turn, many RDP housing developments do not present as vibrant communities or the sources of local or national pride that planners once might have hoped. Nonetheless, even well-founded frustrations ought not obscure the fundamental accomplishment of providing formal shelter for so many. Ethembalethu: A Case Study of Possibility Most RDP housing communities are characterized by a somewhat harsh and uninviting design aesthetic, familiar among state-sponsored housing developments the world over. One notable and positive exception is virtually hidden amid the farmlands, light industry, and scenic wedding venues of Muldersdrift in northeast Mogale City. The area typifies “urban periphery,” in the sense that one is surrounded by agriculture and agro-industry, and yet, in just a few minutes you can be in a sizable town, and in less than an hour, a major urban metropolis. A community called Ethembalethu (“ours” in Zulu) proved to be one of the most extraordinary RDP housing developments I’ve seen anywhere in South Africa. I traveled to the area for the first time on the recommendation of a local activist who, having learned of my broader interests, suggested I check it out. The story of how this community came to be offers important reminders of the social and political hurdles that remain for human development even in the post-Apartheid era, as well as the ways in which wealthy White landowners still wield enormous power despite their relatively small numbers. It also highlights the opportunities for organized citizens to achieve their goals and to build robust and prosperous communities, including through democratic participation and engagement. Ethembalethu sits at the end of an unmarked road just off the M5, a few miles north of Krugersdorp. An unoccupied guard station serves as a gateway to the neighborhood. The area is comprised of more than one hundred houses, all with the same basic RDP “core” structure, but most of the owners have expanded their living spaces with sturdy additions. Residents had painted the outsides in bright colors with different finishes, and many owners planted small lawns out front. On the various days I visited, groups of people walked the streets, talking and visiting with neighbors. It was not a luxury development, but from the outside, it radiated a sense of security and comfort and amounted to not simply a set of houses but a coherent community. And unlike in Munsieville and Kagiso, in Ethembalethu, there were no shacks anywhere (a fact I verified with satellite images from Google Maps). To learn more, I was referred to Molefi Selibo. As councillor for Ward 23, Selibo had his champions and his detractors within Mogale City, as most ambitious political leaders do. But even his critics were willing to acknowledge that his efforts in building the Ethembalethu community were successful, and perhaps even exemplary. On a return visit, I contacted Selibo and he agreed to meet with me in his small ward office, situated in a converted shipping container off Clinic Road in Muldersdrift, just south of the RDP community. FIGURE 7.3. Row of RDP houses in Ethembalethu community, Muldersdrift, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Selibo was born near the largely Afrikaner city of Bloemfontein in 1958 and came to the Muldersdrift area in search of work in 1986. An entrepreneur, he built a hair salon business, which he maintained for twenty years, and like barbers and hairdressers the world over, people came to him with their concerns, looking for advice. He recalled his efforts with pride: “A lot of people were interested to come to my salon because of how I handled issues. They said, ‘I think you can assist us as a community leader.’ ” He took on this role and highlighted that Black people in Muldersdrift had long lived with housing insecurity. They tended to stay on the farms where they worked. And if your boss fired you, you also lost your home. Political change offered the promise of new opportunities, but absent any specific promises about how they would get houses, in 1994, Selibo decided to start an organization, mainly to mobilize the community to buy land. And by 1996, they formally established the Muldersdrift Home Trust Foundation. At the time, Selibo himself resided in a small structure built by a White landowner, lived without electricity, and used a pit toilet. The fundamental strategy of the nascent organization was to require members to contribute 100 rand per month in a saving scheme, in order to accumulate the capital needed to buy land and to form a partnership with government. Less than a year later, they identified an appropriate parcel and began negotiations with a landowner, who initially agreed, with a modestly revised counterproposal. However, when other White landowners learned about the deal that was being struck—which would bring a sizable group of Black neighbors to subdivide a plot for housing—they persuaded him to not sell and bought the land away from him. At the time, Selibo had about two hundred members and they persisted, identifying yet another piece of land. This time they were more careful about the negotiations and tried to ensure that White landowners would not get wind of the deal. They negotiated and signed an agreement in 1997. At that point, they began to engage town planners, environmentalists, and others to formalize the arrangement. Yet once again, the prospect of this new community rooting itself in Muldersdrift did not sit well with many White residents from the area. As Selibo explained, “The challenge was that those who were in charge at that time were very close to White landowners in the area. [Ours] was the first organization led by a Black community in the White area … and they were not comfortable with that.” Soon thereafter, Selibo received another cancellation letter, as the landowners had pressured the seller to renege on the agreement. Selibo pushed back and said they had a binding contract. Even in post-Apartheid South Africa, with Black-led local, provincial, and national governments, the system still seemed stacked against them. Selibo recounted, “When the community was visiting the site, the landowners called police who came and arrested the people who were visiting. ‘They are trespassing.’ And they obliged. We were arrested on the property that we bought.” Selibo continued on, and the White landowners tried another tack: they withdrew from their frivolous court case against Selibo’s group and approached him with the offer of an out-of-court settlement. They would pay Selibo’s group for all of their costs, including lawyers’ fees, and for the price of the land including interest, and on top of that, an additional 250,000 rand. The Whites were willing to pay a tidy sum to avoid having Black neighbors. Insulting, of course, but Selibo and his community decided to take the money in a 1999 settlement, and then they identified a new plot that was almost four times the size of the original. Once again, they negotiated with the landowner, but now they didn’t have enough to cover the full price of the larger plot. They wrote to the provincial government and the national government to share their story and to ask for assistance. During that time, it was not easy for a nongovernment organization—for a government to give it money. We were still new in the democracy and didn’t have all the legislation. [The government] was very interested and supportive of our approach in terms of dealing with the housing issue. They were very interested and said we will assist … but we will transfer money to the municipality, and then you and the municipality will enter into a land agreement to drive this forward. From that point, in 2002, Selibo said he continued to meet with members every two weeks to keep them informed. Along with the municipality, they submitted a “township application,” and by local code, this triggered an invitation for local comments. Yet again, White landowners organized and tried in various ways to object. And according to Selibo, many of the people handling housing-related issues in the area were still White and still sympathetic to the landowners, and this led to more delays. The process would be delayed and delayed and delayed. They didn’t realize we were becoming specialists. You do like that to a person you are empowering that person. So now we are able to articulate each and every aspect of development. We were able to do our homework to do deal with the landowners in the area and to defend ourselves in the process, but it took a long time. A “long time” is really an understatement. But the agreements were finally approved. Selibo and his community received the land, and the government agreed to build RDP houses on it. In April 2014, more than 120 houses were finally completed and the government handed them over to waiting residents. The national government news agency released a piece announcing the ceremony, in which a Mogale local government leader proclaimed, “Land is important to human settlements. We need land to build houses and when you have a house, your dignity is restored.”19 For all the endless stories about what has not worked in terms of housing and development in South Africa, I was surprised to find almost no coverage of the ceremony or the development itself in the news media.20 Selibo highlighted that more recently, another 133 houses had been approved for development. When I asked him why he thought that the final product appeared so different from other RDP communities, he emphasized that what made the community unique was that it had developed solidarity through the years, and they created their own informal zoning regulations, which reflected a desire to avoid what had gone wrong elsewhere. Now we have a code of conduct. You can extend, but you can’t have a shack, you can’t sell it. But now the issue is that … it is a beautiful safe village and no one wants to move. Everyone wants to get a space here. They realize we have a treasure here. Especially in that village, their lives have improved significantly and the way we have been doing the work in the area, we have assisted them to get job opportunities, because we have worked as a family for a long time. It’s not easy in the country with high unemployment rate, but in that village, close to 99 percent are working because we have instilled responsibility. Even if they go and work for you … they have instilled a sense of responsibility and built one another. You would be very happy if someone came to work for you given how they conduct themselves. Also discussing how can we build ourselves. Their lives have improved a lot. When I conducted my Historical Memories Survey in Mogale, I decided to “oversample” in Ethembalethu to see whether the assertions of success had any merit. In a typical survey, given the small size of the area relative to the rest of Mogale City, we might have wound up with zero or just a few of the residents. But I was interested to see if the area was “the real deal” from the perspective of the people who actually lived there. We interviewed fourteen owners of these RDP houses, which is still a very small sample—more illustrative than statistically representative—but enough to shed some light on what makes the community unique. For example, 79 percent said they “never” felt unsafe walking in their neighborhood, as compared with 52 percent of Blacks in other areas of the same ward, and compared with just 34 percent of Black RDP owners in Mogale City. It seemed discouraging to find that only 46 percent of Ethembalethu residents said that “most people in their neighborhood could be trusted,” but that’s still much better than 30 percent of RDP owners throughout the municipality. And I asked the survey enumerators to rate the respondent’s “level of cooperation,” and fully 100 percent of the Ethembalethu respondents were “fully cooperative,” as compared with just 82 percent of RDP owners municipality wide. The residents seemed to have higher levels of the “social capital”21 that helps make democracy work. As I spoke with Selibo, I reminded myself to consider the research conducted by one of my former students, Gwyneth McClendon, who wrote an acclaimed book on the topic of envy in politics.22 A central problem she raised was the enormous challenges of delivering public housing because, particularly in South Africa, those who have not yet received this benefit can become very envious of those who have. And that frustration can turn to destructive behavior, leaving everyone worse off. I asked Selibo if that was a problem here, and he said, unequivocally, yes. “It’s a major problem in this area. Especially in this ward. Because now we have this beautiful township and a lot of community members [those in his ward] are still in that poor status. Most of the time we can’t always speak of Ethembalethu because people are not staying there and they are envious.” He went on to mention future plans, and indeed perhaps the best antidote to envious behavior is a credible commitment that the same benefits will be extended to all. On the other hand, given the twenty-year process to get phase one completed, this could be a dangerous proposition if that timetable is not accelerated given the growing impatience with demands. And in fact, Leslie Gama, whom I met in Muldersdrift on the last weekend of voter registration and whose parents went off to vote while he stayed at home during the first election of the new democratic era, showed me his designs to replicate what had been achieved in Ethembalethu. On an individual level, Gama bears some striking similarities to Selibo. He also grew up in a rural area with few human comforts. He stayed in Muldersdrift with his grandparents in a house made of mud bricks, built on a cattle farm. Because the construction process involved smearing cow dung on the bricks, he said that even today when he smells cow dung, he is reminded of his childhood. Leslie and his family had no electricity, and they got their water from a neighboring farm, illegally tapping into an irrigation system. They dug their own pit latrines to use as toilets. And he even worked for a spell in a hair salon. He started his own organization, Umnotho, which for about seven years by the time I met him in 2019 had been collecting money from families who wanted to upgrade their lives from shacks to formal settlements. I was very impressed by the bountiful gardens the community had grown and the detailed plans—including architectural drawings and models—they had commissioned for an integrated community. But just like Selibo, Gama faced the hurdles of local opposition, zoning rules, and occasional theft from his offices, as well as the challenge of getting the right attention from the right officials. Nonetheless, given his tenacity, the cohesion and support of his community, the progress he has detailed to me since we met, and the example of Ethembalethu, I am cautiously optimistic that he’ll succeed in this or a related venture. FIGURE 7.4. Slabs awaiting RDP houses in Munsieville, February 2019. Credit: Evan Lieberman. Without active involvement from community leaders like Selibo and Gama, government policies can languish. Too frequently, housing projects get started but remain unfinished owing to lack of planning, funding, and/or oversight, let alone as the result of a stalemate between competing political interests. In Munsieville, I toured a site with a checkerboard of concrete slabs designed to support RDP houses but that, at least for the time being, were nothing but useless eyesores. The latter, of course, tend to capture the imagination of democracy skeptics all around the municipality. While important, my broader point is that such failures are not the whole story. Income, Security, and Equality Beyond shelter and basic services, citizens want jobs, income, and to not be on the wrong end of extreme inequality. In 2019, Ramaphosa and the ANC campaigned on the slogan “Let’s grow South Africa together,” a tacit acknowledgment of what was needed. Nonetheless, while the economic record is certainly not the basis for a victory lap, it is also not dispositive for the value of democracy in the country. Moreover, although unemployment and inequality remain staggeringly high, the government has also provided critical cash grants to provide social security for millions of the most vulnerable. It may not have been rapid economic development, but the record contributed to dignified development. As a liberation movement, the ANC had been on record, including quite explicitly in the Freedom Charter, calling for the nationalization of the mines and of large sections of the economy. Moreover, the organization and its alliance partners, COSATU and the SACP, all drew heavily on Marxist-Leninist thought as guiding principles. They envisioned a new democratically elected government having a very strong hand in all aspects of the economy. As they prepared to govern, and once in power, ANC elites engaged in far-ranging discussions with a variety of economists and others inside and outside the country concerning strategies that would thread the needle between achieving economic growth and attaining some level of adequate redistribution in the near term. They actively and openly debated various models and the lessons to be learned from other countries’ experiences. Like most planners at the time, they wondered how they could emulate the high-performing economies in East Asia. Prominently in the background of such debates and discussions was the collapse of the Soviet Union. The failed record of centrally planned economies provided leverage for White business leaders to strike bargains with the liberation party and its partners to avert nationalization. They made the familiar argument that the new government should not “kill the goose that lays the golden egg.” (White business was the goose here.) Neo-liberal economic principles had gained global prominence and if you didn’t play by those rules, it was clear that international financial institutions would restrict access to credit and investments. Mandela and other top ANC brass were ultimately persuaded against nationalizing and, for that matter, against massive land distribution. As early as 1996, they adopted an economic strategy that involved privatization of state assets, trade liberalization, and bureaucratic reform.23 The compromise solution was to combine a largely free market system, while actively promoting Black economic empowerment. Companies could remain private, but they would need to demonstrate active inclusion of those who had been disadvantaged under Apartheid. And the government would be tasked with providing social support to the poor and extending social benefits widely. In October 1997, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel delivered a keynote speech for a book launch hosted by the Budget Information Service at IDASA. I had just started my work there the previous week and the event immediately highlighted for me the emerging political fault lines on economic policy. Like many of the other government leaders, Manuel had spent several years of his adult life in jail protesting the old government; he had long been a champion of the poor and the working class. Now, he was already being accused of being a lackey for the well-heeled. Critics said that the government’s revised economic strategy, called Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), with its emphasis on fiscal discipline and low inflation, reflected an abandonment of a focus on jobs and development for the impoverished masses. Manuel resisted this characterization. He quoted phrases from the original RDP plan to remind critics that the party had always intended to proceed in a fiscally responsible manner. And he quoted from Capital, in which Karl Marx argued that the burden of budget deficits falls on the working class. He was sharp and persuasive. Given the scale of wants and needs, the challenge of building the economy was enormous. At the very least, most assumed that simply ending Apartheid would yield some important economic benefits. First, the government should attain some savings from the elimination of multiple and inflated homeland governments, which cost much more than they took in, and a reduction in military spending, as it would no longer be at war with much of the country and the region. They would also save on the resources wasted controlling the movement of Black people. International economic sanctions would end, and perhaps foreign investors would flock to South Africa. The most optimistic held out hope that the merging of these two wildly different segments of the economy would quickly lead to everyone living at the level of White South Africans.24 In practice, the period 1994–2007 actually produced solid economic growth, especially compared with the disastrous last decade of Apartheid that preceded it. And during this interval, the incomes, opportunities, and lifestyles for millions of Black South Africans improved, generating widespread expansion of the Black middle class. As in the United States, the term “middle class” means many things to many people—certainly in South Africa, it does not connote an average or the middle of the income distribution but a lifestyle associated with some degree of comfort with disposable income. In other words, millions of Black South Africans began to gain access to the lifestyles that had been enjoyed almost exclusively by Whites: university for their children, the ability to purchase goods at one of South Africa’s many shopping malls, perhaps the ability to own an automobile. By some estimates, in terms of “affluence,” the middle class grew from 2.2 million in 1993 to 4.9 million in 2008 (and by 2008, 20 percent of the 1 million “upper class” were now Black African).25 For many, this was exactly the dream of a post-Apartheid South Africa. On the other hand, growth in this segment of the population gave rise to a growing chasm between Black haves and Black have-nots. For many of the millions without the disposable income to take advantage of new shopping opportunities or to purchase the latest mobile phone, let alone to have a decent roof over their heads, patience began to wear thin. Many criticized the GEAR plan as an abandonment of the poor majority. And then the global financial crisis of 2007–8 ravaged South Africa’s economy. In 2009, the year Jacob Zuma became president, the economy contracted by 1.5 percent—almost 3 percent, when calculated on a per capita basis. After that, the economy failed to sustain a serious recovery throughout his term. Per capita GDP growth practically screeched to a halt at 0.3 percent during those years. All told, between 1994 and 2018, South Africa’s average annual economic growth on a per capita basis was a paltry 1.2 percent.26 There is no single definitive answer for why the South African economy grew at the pace it did. Political conflicts and news of corruption within the ANC surely scared off some potential investments and deprived citizens of resources that would otherwise have been used on public expenditures.27 Insufficient infrastructure investment to meet the demands of citizens and businesses has also surely constrained productivity and growth. It is certainly plausible that the strength of organized labor contributed to wage bills that made some companies uncompetitive. And foreign direct investment into Africa has always been extremely low, and despite the end of Apartheid, investment into South Africa remained modest relative to initial hopes. FIGURE 7.5. GDP per capita growth, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Moreover, it is hard to ignore the extent to which the previous decade was challenging for most Upper-middle-income countries.28 For example, during this period, Brazil chalked up an average annual growth rate of 1.3 percent, almost exactly the same as South Africa’s, and with peaks and valleys that are remarkably similar. If we evaluate South Africa’s economic performance relative to other Upper-middle-income countries29 and to the rest of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as presented in figure 7.5, the country’s lackluster economic performance still appears to lag. However, on average, those countries only grew about 1.2 and 0.8 percentage points faster than South Africa did, and even these comparisons are driven by a few high-growth countries rather than a consistent difference. And within these sets of countries for this period, there is really no discernible difference between democracies and non-democracies (despite some compelling research suggesting that democracies do tend to grow faster on average).30 For those who like to hold out the “Specter of Zimbabwe” theory to describe Black rule in South Africa, it’s important to dispel the myth that South Africa’s post-Apartheid economic performance has in any way resembled Zimbabwe’s. With respect to the latter, one of my favorite teaching props is a photo I took of a Zimbabwean one hundred trillion dollar note, along with a photo of ordinary Zimbabweans using this currency as wallpaper. With declining government revenues, Zimbabwe’s authoritarian government under Robert Mugabe simply printed more and more money to finance its expenditures amid the president’s lavish lifestyle. In turn, the country experienced hyperinflation and the collapse of its currency. Stores could not set consistent prices nor could they reliably stock goods. Increasingly, citizens were forced to barter with one another to get what they needed. By contrast, South Africans have experienced only minor devaluations of their currency, and their economy has been generally well managed with low rates of inflation, low debt, and small budget deficits. Notably, the post-Apartheid period was marked by steep declines in the mining industry. The country’s gold output decreased steadily since 1994, with some decline already underway between 1980 and 1994.31 The historical discovery of gold near Krugersdorp preceded Mandela’s election by more than a century. The mining went very deep into the Rand, and it simply became much less profitable relative to the degree it once was as the effort-to-yield ratio continually climbed, and it would no longer be a source of easy profits in the new democracy. The collapse of mining has hit Mogale hard. As one resident recounted, “We would grow up seeing [miners] with their hats going down into the mines, and then coming up. It used to be a very vibrant area. But now of late, there’s a lot of unemployment. You feel pity when you see them on the corners staying or sitting idle by the shops, and becoming drunk.” From multiple vantage points within the municipal borders, one can see the large, ugly West Rand Consolidated Mine hill. It’s a reminder of what made this city (gold) and what it is now (essentially without a mining sector). Thousands of able-bodied people are not gainfully employed. Instead, a few informal miners dangerously try to retrieve small treasures where they can, with little regard for personal safety. The failure to grow the economy deprived the country of a key weapon against the Apartheid legacies of high unemployment, high poverty, and high inequality. By any measure, South African unemployment levels have remained staggering—at least 25 percent—in the decades following the end of Apartheid, perhaps over 40 percent if applying a “strict” definition.32 And on surveys, in interviews, and on the radio and other media, lack of jobs was the most important issue that people indicated as a concern for them. In 2017–18, a full 44 percent of Mogale residents surveyed said they were “unemployed and looking for work”—and that figure is low for all of Gauteng Province, where 52 percent responded this way.33 Are democratic politics to blame? As figure 7.6 clearly shows, South African unemployment in 2018, as reported using International Labor Organization models, was very high in comparative perspective—measured as the worst among Upper-middle-income countries. But it was already high at the dawn of the democratic era, so the failure is one of being unable to solve an existing problem rather than creating a new one. The picture of inequality is similar: in the decade after 1995, already high levels of income inequality intensified. After 2005 this trend reversed somewhat, and by 2015 income inequality was at the approximate level it had been in the mid-1990s.34 The fact that a highly unequal society has remained highly unequal is nothing to celebrate. But again, in the current state of the world, in which wealthier people have much better work and investment opportunities,35 the South African story is clearly part of a global one. Even after the 2008 worldwide economic meltdown, increasing numbers of South Africans came to own major household assets—realizing a “middle-class” lifestyle. In 2009, just 15.1 percent owned a computer; by 2015 that number jumped to 22.1 percent. Similar gains were observed with respect to satellite television (13.0 to 35.1 percent), washing machines (27.5 to 35.9 percent), and refrigerators (64.7 to 79.7 percent).36 FIGURE 7.6. Unemployment in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1996–2018). Source: Author analysis of International Labor Organization estimates in WDI. As the United Nations has recently documented, during approximately the period considered here (1990–2015), two-thirds of the share of income going to the top 1 percent increased in 59 of 100 countries with available data.37 Cash Is King One of the most important ways in which the post-Apartheid government has assisted the poor—in the face of a weak economy, dismal employment prospects, and high inequality—has been through direct cash grants, fulfilling a constitutional right and Freedom Charter aspiration to social security. In 2018–19, in a country of 56 million people, 17.6 million were beneficiaries of social grants. The vast majority of these funds are allocated through a Child Support Grant (12.5 million children) and the Old-Age Grant (3.5 million people older than sixty). Other grants are given to people with disabilities, for care dependency, to war veterans, and to support the care of foster children.38 The system is far from perfect, and news stories occasionally pop up about fraud and delays. Yet, this does not go unchecked: for example, in 2012, the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) introduced a biometric scheme in the payout process that saved millions of rand in false claims. Even that was not foolproof, and the DA and others charged that fraud persisted. In 2018, the biometric system was scrapped in favor of a legacy system.39 While such stories and reports frequently contribute to claims and perceptions that the entire agency is corrupt and failing, by and large, most people are paid every month; and the incidence of grant relief has been extremely pro-poor—certainly relative to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and among most Upper-middle-income countries. In many other countries with generous social insurance schemes, particularly in Latin America, the wealthier segments of society manage to capture disproportionate gains, making the net distribution of resources even more unequal. By contrast, according to data from the World Bank ASPIRE database, for the period approximately 2008–16, South Africa provided the most generous transfers with the greatest impact for reducing income inequality by targeting the very poorest.40 Cash grants have contributed to decreasing poverty rates, especially extreme poverty,41 particularly after 2000.42 Although the amount transferred for each grant tends to be modest—about $30 per month for a child grant, for example—getting cash into the hands of the very poor allows individuals and caregivers to buy the essentials. This critical set of grants helped lower the share of the population living under an international poverty line43 from about 34 percent in the period 1993–96 to about 17.5 percent in the period 2010–14.44 Investments in Human Value Reflecting both global trends and the aspirations of the Freedom Charter, South Africa’s 1996 constitution identified access to health care and basic education as fundamental rights of citizenship. Health and education are often described as key components of “human capital,”45 in the sense that investments in these can generate returns in the form of economic productivity. I believe that is too limited a view: we also value better health and education because they are inextricably linked to human autonomy and well-being. Promoting health and education might be better understood simply as investments in and recognition of the value of humans. From the dawn of South Africa’s new democracy, activist critics, journalists, and academics have repeatedly highlighted government failures in meeting crucial needs in these sectors. For example, Section 27, an organization so named for the section of the constitution that details citizens’ social and economic rights, has routinely applied intense pressure to improve both outcomes, especially among the poor, through the media, organized protests, court cases, and direct presentations to government bodies. The LRC, Lawyers for Human Rights, and a host of sector-specific NGOs have developed or adapted their missions to hold the government accountable to make good on constitutional promises. And once again, the list of gaps such organizations have identified is real and observable—especially if one looks at persistent disparities between the haves and have-nots. For example, much like in the United States, the quality of everyday health-care access remains very much a function of ability to pay. The Netcare Krugersdorp Hospital and the Yusuf Dadoo Hospital are situated about a mile apart from one another, but the distance between the quality of facilities and care received is much, much greater. At the former, where people must pay for their care, the outside looks like the glossy Boston hospital buildings I see close to my home and work, and inside, the shelves are stocked and patients can expect to be seen relatively quickly and to receive excellent care. At the latter, citizens report that wait times are long, supplies are frequently unavailable, and the likelihood that the facilities will be clean is low. Similar gaps divide the educational sphere. Notably, there are three types of primary and secondary schools: public schools that are fully free; those in which fees are collected; and private or independent schools. For example, Monument High School, the site of the first polling station I visited on election day in 2019, is a former “Model C” school. These were once White-only public schools and tend to be located in historically White areas. During the early 1990s, as Apartheid was ending, they were afforded greater autonomy, and the government allowed them to collect fees. Today, these are generally the highest-quality public schools, and in Mogale City, both White and Black families who can afford the fees—but not the cost of private school—tend to send their children there. By contrast, most townships, like Munsieville and Kagiso, host public schools in which parents are not expected to pay fees, but the resulting resources and quality—for example, at Munsieville Primary School and Lodirile Secondary School in Rietvallei—tend to be much more modest. As one Mogale City teacher described to me, “These schools are often not that clean and do not look like conducive environments for productive teaching and learning.” And for those who can afford it or who attain scholarships, South Africa boasts many excellent private schools, including in Mogale City, where independent school franchises have come in to meet the growing demand from families—for example, Alma Mater International School and Curro Krugersdorp Independent School, where students can expect access to world-class media resources, relatively small student-to-teacher ratios, and outstanding athletic facilities. These schools also tend to prepare students for possible overseas university education and frequently follow British curricula. As of 2019, of the approximately 75,000 students in Mogale City schools, only about 5 percent attended private schools, and an additional 31 percent attended fee-collecting public schools. As in most things South African, the gulf between what a minority—even if increasingly multiracial—can access relative to the rest is so enormous as to make for frustrating comparisons. As just one important metric of school quality for which objective data are available, I calculated student-to-teacher ratios for Mogale City primary and secondary schools and found that at the 15 independent schools, the ratio was 12:1, at the 23 fee-collecting public schools it was 24:1, and at the 47 no-fee public schools it was 34:1. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, the neighborhoods (wards) for the fee-collecting public schools were 39 percent Black with just 7 percent of the residents living in informal settlements; the no-fee schools were, on average, 91 percent Black and 27 percent of residents in informal settlements.46 In turn, we should not be surprised when we see inequality reproduced across generations given this state of affairs. Even serious concerns about persistent inequities—wholly reminiscent of the American health and educational systems—should not obscure critical efforts and accomplishments or the challenging context that democratic governments have faced. In both sectors, the government has spent heavily, has vastly widened access, and has made some clear and observable inroads, especially in improving the quality of life and capacities of the very poor. In terms of education, in 2019 the South African government spent approximately 50 percent more as a share of GDP (6.5 percent) compared with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (4.3 percent) or the average of all Upper-middle-income (UMI) countries (4.1 percent).47 And with respect to health, government spending increased substantially over the period 2002–18 such that by the latter year South Africa was also vastly outspending peers from these reference groups (4.4 percent/GDP for South Africa compared with 3.2 percent for UMI countries and 1.9 percent for Africa).48 Moreover, in each sector, democratic processes have contributed to important gains and corrections. Health and Health Care Just a few months after his inauguration, Mandela’s government rolled out as a first signature project a new program offering free health care for all pregnant and nursing women as well as all children under six.49 The newly covered population was guaranteed treatment at all public hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. And to accommodate increased demand, the policy was coupled with the construction of new clinics.50 By 2003, free hospital care was extended to children older than six with disabilities.51 In turn, the share of births attended by professional staff grew from 82 percent in 1994 to 97 percent in 2016.52 And in 2017, South Africa had the highest numbers of physicians, nurses, and midwives relative to the size of the population of all non-island, sub-Saharan African countries.53 FIGURE 7.7. Average life expectancy at birth in South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income and African countries (1995–2017). Source: Author analysis of WDI. Owing at least in part to the availability of these inputs and other policies, leading indicators suggest that health and well-being for the most vulnerable have improved. The under-5 mortality rate at the time of Mandela’s election in 1994 was 61 deaths per 1,000, and that dropped to a low of 37.1 by 2017. As depicted in figure 7.7, at the beginning of the democratic period the life expectancy rate in South Africa was the lowest of all Upper-middle-income countries but among the highest of all other African countries. However, it took a profound dip in the late 1990s owing to the rash of deaths from the staggering AIDS epidemic. Once the government finally adopted policies and practices of administering anti-retroviral drug therapy, extending the lives of those living with HIV—responding to political pressures as described in chapter 6—estimated life expectancy quickly returned to an upward trajectory, albeit diminished relative to its economic peers. Indeed, the mushrooming of extraordinarily large HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics at the tail end of the Apartheid era proved to be an overwhelming burden on other aspects of the health-care system. As early as the mid-1990s, more than 10 percent of the adult population aged 15–49 was living with HIV, and by 2000, the incidence (new cases) of tuberculosis was almost 800 per 100,000 people. Both disease burdens were much higher than the typical experience of most African and Upper-middle-income country cohorts or, frankly, countries anywhere in the world.54 While it’s true that the ongoing size of these epidemics in terms of numbers infected can be partially ascribed to early government failures in response, it is also important to point out that both HIV and tuberculosis have remained highly prevalent throughout the southern African region, even in countries like Botswana that responded much earlier and more aggressively (in part because successful treatment has kept people alive). Moreover, the South African government, despite its early flawed response under Mbeki, and after relentless democratic challenges from civil society, went on to embark on the world’s largest AIDS treatment program.55 Today, both its AIDS and tuberculosis government responses are far-reaching and world class—and various studies have identified South Africa as leading the way in best practices.56 Moreover, concerns about poor health and health disparities are not simply a matter of access to formal health care. Better infrastructure and living conditions in the form of clean water, sanitation, and shelter are themselves critically important for healthy outcomes, and progress in those areas contributes to better health outcomes for the very poor and is likely reflected in positive trends in life expectancy and infant mortality. On the other hand, the persistence of vast socioeconomic differences in South Africa will no doubt continue to reproduce inequalities in health outcomes for some time, and even the equalization of health-care resources would almost surely not be sufficient to equalize health outcomes in the near term. Along these lines, particularly in Mogale City, the legacy of the country’s mining economy contributes to widespread environmental risks. Despite the metaphorical status of “gold dust,” the reality is that mining dust is a major health hazard. First, for miners who have worked or continue to work deep in the mines, silicosis—also known as “black lung”—is a debilitating disease acquired from the inhalation of the very fine silica dust generated through the process of extraction. It causes shortness of breath and chest pain and makes individuals more vulnerable to tuberculosis, already widely prevalent in the country. Second, Krugersdorp and other mining towns are replete with mine dumps or tailings. When the wind blows, toxic dust fills the air and seeps into the local streams and canals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the brunt of such environmental degradation is again borne by poor and Black citizens, including in Mogale, especially in and around the mines of Kagiso, which are replete with acid mine drainage.57 One notoriously awful site is the Mintails mine I passed on election day. Within these tailings, scientists have detected arsenic, lead, and other chemicals, frequently radioactive. Nonetheless, children routinely play on toxic mining excavations as if they were sand dunes, as they are not sufficiently guarded from the general public.58 Although concerns about the safe cleanup of such sites rarely find their way into electoral politics, pressure from other democratic institutions has proven important to raise awareness and to apply pressure on businesses and government to take action. I became aware of these concerns through my own involvement with the LRC, as I was introduced to a partner of theirs, Mariette Liefferink, sometimes described as South Africa’s “Erin Brockovich” because of her passionate involvement in environmental issues. On our tour of the area, she pointed out the neglect and failings of various mining corporations to properly close the dormant mines, as well as the ways in which they have tried to avoid taking responsibility by selling off their assets to very small companies that could never afford to pay any claims for damages. She, the LRC, and others have been documenting the extent of environmental degradation and the harms caused and have sought justice for those most affected, especially through the courts. Undoubtedly, the democratic era ushered in the opportunities to pursue such work, first by putting an accent on the indignities leveled against those central and/or proximate to the mining economy; and second by actually securing some compensation for them. They highlight, of course, that much work remains, but they have had some important successes. Most notably, owing to a vast class action suit, in May 2018 the mining companies agreed to an unprecedented 5 billion rand (400 million USD) settlement for thousands of miners suffering from silicosis.59 Education As has been the case for health, in terms of equity of access to schooling, particularly to higher levels of education, we can document substantial progress. For example, I consider the distribution of the highest level of education attained by individuals in the Mogale area on two South African census rounds: 1991 and 2011, and just those individuals aged 19 to 29 in each. This restriction helps us isolate the educational opportunities created before and after 1994. In 1991, close to 70 percent of Whites had completed at least their “matric” year—named for the all-important standardized, national high school completion exam—which is viewed as the critical attainment of credentials for high-paying jobs that demand skills. At that time, not even 20 percent of Blacks had those credentials. And more than 50 percent of Blacks lacked even a completed primary education. By 2011, the gap had substantially narrowed: Blacks gained almost 30 percentage points, with just shy of 50 percent completing at least secondary school, and in this later round, less than 8 percent had not completed primary school. And this did not come at the “expense” of White enrollments: by 2011, secondary school rates among Whites had climbed to 76 percent. When considering the national level—and in comparative perspective—secondary school enrollment was already higher in 1990 than the average for Upper-middle-income countries (and much higher compared with African countries). And all the way until 2018, South Africa at least kept pace with growth in enrollment as compared with both of the reference groups.60 Such broad portraits clearly mask critical nuances with respect to the actual quality of education that students receive, let alone the attainment of education as an ultimate goal. The gaps are troubling, and some studies have even concluded that the quality of education overall has decreased during the post-Apartheid period.61 One often-cited indicator of government failure on education is the fact that South African students have generally performed poorly on international tests.62 This is true. On the other hand, South African students were already performing relatively poorly in 1995, and at least achieved some marginal gains, especially between 2001 and 2011 and particularly among the lowest-performing students. As one nuanced assessment of twenty years of South African education has highlighted, such benchmarks need to be viewed in context—especially the fact that most of the other countries that participate in such testing are far richer.63 While many countries around the world face legacies of uneven and unequal educational systems, few are burdened by a history comparable to that of the Apartheid system’s “Bantu Education,” which deliberately sought to limit the potential of a majority of learners with respect to curriculum and promotion of critical thinking skills, which also affected the training of teachers.64 Combine this with persistent de facto residential segregation, and it is not surprising that huge educational gaps remain across racial lines, as well as between students in free public schools, fee-paying public schools, and private schools, where parents also tend to be more educated.65 A particularly grave affront to human dignity lies with the horrific quality of public educational facilities and instruction in rural areas—outside the industrial Gauteng Province. Eighty or more students are routinely forced to crowd themselves into classrooms, and their schools frequently lack running water, functioning toilets, and well-trained teachers. In one tragic account, first documented in the New York Times66 and that subsequently went “viral” in the South African media, two children drowned in pit toilets in a dilapidated school in Mpumalanga Province. The story juxtaposed the greediness of government officials and the disappearance of millions of dollars of funding next to a tragic and truly unpleasant death of young people, providing powerful fodder for citizen anger. Ten days after the publication of the original article, and no doubt spurred on by the embarrassing revelations, President Ramaphosa announced the launch of a new program, the Sanitation Appropriate for Education Initiative. According to Ramaphosa, the initiative would “spare generations of young South Africans the indignity, discomfort and danger of using pit latrines and other unsafe facilities in our schools.”67 The good news? One NGO subsequently calculated that the initiative resulted in the upgrading of toilets in twenty thousand schools. The bad? The same NGO estimated that at this pace, it would take nineteen years to complete the job on a national scale.68 Did the news story cause the policy change? The proximity of the actions and the responses suggests that it certainly triggered the timing of the reactions, but it’s hard to imagine that the story would have come to light if there were not already so much political attention being paid to sanitary conditions and if civil society organizations and public interest lawyers were not already applying pressure through political campaigns and sometimes through appeals to constitutional law in the courts. Like many gains in a democratic polity, it was victory from a million cuts. For people in remote rural areas, democratic political pressures ultimately led to government actions that would bring visibility and material improvements to their lives. In a polity that valued economic growth above all else, rural schoolchildren might have been deliberately overlooked as a necessary casualty of “development.” In the context of democratic South Africa, at the very least, no one can publicly question the deservingness of these children to receive the same opportunities and services. Continuing to shine a light on deficiencies sometimes elicits action, even if rarely sufficient to close substantial gaps. Palpable Progress, if Incomplete For every material gain I’ve detailed here, one could add valid caveats and qualifications. Electrification? But what about rolling blackouts? Social grants? Those are too small to be meaningful! Housing? Too many people still waiting and the construction is shoddy! All of these are fair concerns and useful grist for the democratic mill. In no country in the world do people think that all of their material needs have been met, and by any objective standard, most South Africans still have much to wish for, not the least of which are better opportunities to work, to earn a steady income, and to gain access to high-quality education and health care. Nonetheless, I think it’s hard to deny that the overall gains have been quite substantial for millions of people who hoped for material comfort and a degree of economic security after Apartheid. When asked, people can document meaningful change. In fact, perhaps this entire book is motivated by the transformation I’ve observed with my own eyes over the past several decades: I have continued to return to the very places I first toured almost thirty years ago, including largely Black townships on the outskirts of the three largest South African cities: Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban. Observable conditions have improved substantially, sometimes dramatically. Back then, raw sewage ran through the streets, and electrical connections were rare. At night, in many areas, high-mast street lamps projected harsh, bright light over large areas, as if for an airport rather than a human settlement. During June and July—wintertime in the southern hemisphere—the putrid smell of burning garbage could sting your nose for miles around as people sought to keep warm. Today, Soweto is a city unto itself, one in which poverty persists, but alongside an increasingly thriving Black middle class with upscale amenities. In Khayelitsha, near Cape Town and Kwamashu, near Durban, and in townships and locations across the country, tarred roads have replaced dirt passageways; more people live in houses and flats (apartments) rather than shacks; and millions more enjoy electricity, lighting, piped water, and flush toilets. Since my first visit to South Africa, I have traveled to every one of the country’s nine provinces and have been to urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Now, having in mind the many other African contexts I have visited in the meantime, including rural and urban Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, it is hard to imagine many South Africans wanting to trade places with their counterparts on the respective socioeconomic ladders of any of the countries north of the Limpopo River. Only in the small (and also democratic) countries of Mauritius, Cape Verde, and Botswana and the small, oil-rich, but not democratic country of Gabon do measured overall levels of service provision consistently approximate what South Africans enjoy.69 And these accomplishments were set against the extremely challenging background of high inequality, a difficult global economic environment, an evaporating mineral economy, and substantial backlogs in the development of human capital. With respect to the latter point, we should not forget that the New South Africa was comprised of millions of Black South African adults who had been previously denied a decent education and yet were called on to run vast government agencies and fill the management ranks of businesses. Moreover, we can blame Jacob Zuma for many things, but not for the global economic meltdown that coincided with the start of his presidency. The social and economic legacies of South Africa’s past have not been easily overcome. Life in the still largely White suburbs around Krugersdorp remains far, far more comfortable than in the townships of Munsieville and Kagiso. Nonetheless, the conditions of the latter have measurably improved, with much greater parity in access to government services. This pattern is repeated in much of the country. Political competition, citizen pressure, and respect for the constitutional order have all contributed to such dignified development and reflect well on the value of democracy in South Africa.",

      "content": "8 Respect, Belonging, and Recognition IN EARLY FEBRUARY, still a few months before the 2019 election, I prepared for a meeting with three of Mogale City’s local religious leaders. Questions about basic service delivery were still very much on my mind. To what extent was the gap between poverty and prosperity being closed in terms of concrete outcomes such as housing, water, electricity, and jobs? Given the importance of religion in the lives of South Africans (three-quarters of citizens say that religion is important to them, as compared with 20 percent or lower in most European countries, China, and Japan)1 and the fact that religious leaders like Tutu and Chikane played such key roles in local and national politics, I was optimistic they could shed valuable light on the political history I was studying. I had contacted Rev. Armando Sontange of the Kagiso Presbyterian Church requesting an interview, and he offered to invite a few colleagues from other churches to join us for a discussion. We agreed to meet around 11 a.m. at the Mugg and Bean, South Africa’s most ubiquitous coffee chain, this one in the bustling Presidential Square shopping center in downtown Krugersdorp.2 Once we placed our orders and exchanged introductions, I threw out a softball question in the hopes of generating some responses: “How have basic housing conditions changed for your congregants during the past twenty-five years?” They nodded that indeed they had seen substantial improvements over this period, and they described aspects of the record I detailed in the previous chapter. Lots of upgrades, but still room for improvement. And always new people moving in. However, as we continued to engage in conversation, they urged me to redirect my focus. “It’s not just about material things,” Sontange said, “but about Ubuntu. About a human being human.” He and his colleagues took turns reminding me of earlier times, when Black people, irrespective of education or occupation, were confined to townships, their lives heavily controlled. For men like them, in their fifties, sixties, and older, the legalized caste-like system of Apartheid South Africa and the everyday indignities it perpetuated were still etched in their memories. They wanted to emphasize the fact that the apparent “normalcy” of three Black men having coffee with a White man in Krugersdorp should still be cherished as a stark departure from the past.3 The term “ubuntu” roughly translates to “humanness,” “humanity,” or “personhood” in several languages spoken in South Africa (Zulu, Xhosa, and Ndebele) and is most commonly associated with the Zulu proverb umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, which translates to “a person is a person through other persons.”4 The concept of ubuntu has been particularly influential in South Africa and in Zimbabwe owing to efforts to promote indigenous philosophies in the aftermath of White rule.5 Much like the analogous term “dignity,” ubuntu is an articulation of a core human value, one that demands moral obligations in various ways, including respect for others, the promotion of harmony, and the reduction of discord. Perhaps unique in their abilities to see through the noise of everyday life, the pastors collectively made the case that post-Apartheid South Africa had come much closer to realizing this ideal at least compared with what they had experienced before. At one point in our conversation, Rev. Monwabisi Moses, from the Kagiso Methodist Church, suggested that I look outside. A line of people moved slowly in pursuit of cash from the automated teller facing the parking lot just outside the Mugg and Bean. He explained that the line was long because the government had deposited social grants into their accounts via electronic transfer that morning. In a Socratic engagement, he asked if I noticed anything “interesting” about the line. FIGURE 8.1. Location of the Mugg and Bean at the President Hyper, Krugersdorp. Slightly embarrassed to always be focusing on race, I nonetheless offered up my first impression, “There’s that one White guy on line, otherwise comprised of Black people.” He nodded with a smile. “During Apartheid, [the line] would only be White people. You see that White guy, even if there were a queue, he would have had a preference. But not today.” At the time we spoke, I still had very little sense of where we were sitting—an artefact of being relatively new to the area and doggedly following the instructions delivered to me by my phone-as-navigational assistant. Just beyond the parking lot lay two sets of conflicting historical legacies with diametrically opposite messages for the core concerns we were discussing. On the one hand, we were less than half a kilometer from the town council’s Centennial Hall, where only a few decades earlier White local councillors had, time and again, voted to maintain the most petty of Apartheid’s discriminatory policies. Layered on top of residential segregation, as late as the 1980s, Krugersdorp still maintained racially separate restrooms. As one Black councillor recounted to me, when she came into town during the Apartheid years she had to use the “Nie Blankes” (Non-Whites) bus stop. The message of profound disrespect was clear and mortally insulting. On the other hand, we were also just eight miles from a 50,000-hectare tract of land, the Cradle of Humankind, which UNESCO declared to be a world heritage site. In 1947, the year before the onset of Apartheid, Robert Broom discovered fossils of early human ancestors of approximately 2.5 million years in vintage—artefacts that changed the way scientists understand the pattern of human development. And in December 1998, far within the depths of the Sterkfontein Caves on this land, located less than ten miles north of the Paardekraal Monument, another research team from Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand unearthed what would amount to the nearly complete skull of a 3.5-million-year-old human ancestor.6 The stunning on-site visitor center—only a decade old—argues strongly in favor of ubuntu philosophy: there is more that unites us in our common ancestry as humans than the superficiality of the various traits that seem to divide us. The idea of “race” that was almost fanatically developed on South African soil, with significant help from Europe and the Americas, is just one of many sources of human diversity. The Cradle offers scientific evidence of shared human origins—the types of facts that undergird calls for universal human rights and the ideal that all humans have inherent dignity, or value, and deserve to be accorded with commensurate levels of respect. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the bitter irony that the immediate dangers and long-term health consequences of the early excavations were disproportionately borne by Black mine workers, let alone the multiple ways in which Black people have been treated with profound disrespect in the area around the Cradle. And to this day, many Black Africans squat and reside in informal settlements on its outskirts, a legacy of the state’s historical lack of appreciation for equal human worth. The existential question—of what our shared humanity ought to mean in practice—thus looms particularly large in Mogale City. The removal of segregated coffee shops, segregated bus stops, and legalized Apartheid was just a starting point. Starting in 1994, South Africans from all of their diverse backgrounds proved they could vote together and select leaders peacefully. And the government began to close some gaps in service delivery. Yet, the fight to end Apartheid was not just about getting the vote, electricity, a flush toilet, or a job. The Freedom Charter, Nelson Mandela’s fiery “I am prepared to die” speech, and the new constitution all explicitly aspired to realize the goal of restoring human dignity. What is dignity, after all? I wanted to make sure I understood what the South Africans had in mind. So I decided to ask around. After our meeting at the Mugg and Bean, I asked Rev. Moses if I could come to his church in Kagiso to pilot the very Historical Memories Survey that I’ve been describing in the chapters of this book, and I would use that opportunity to ask this sample of citizens how they might define the term (in addition to trying out lots of other questions). I hired a young woman from his congregation—a recent university graduate—to work as a research assistant and to conduct interviews in English and Tswana. We posed the following question: “The constitution says that the Republic of South Africa is founded on the value of HUMAN DIGNITY. What does the word DIGNITY mean to you?” We only interviewed twenty-five congregants, a mix of men and women, all over the age of forty, and with few exceptions, their answers were overwhelmingly consistent: dignity is about respect and being valued. “Simply means we need to respect one another and have faith in each other and not be against each other.” “Dignity I would say is to have value to yourself, be respectful, respected wherever you are and be treated equally.” “Dignity to me means respecting other human beings, conducting myself in a manner that doesn’t undermine, discriminate any other human being. Ascribing to values, to norms that are acceptable in the society without undermining anyone.” Given the importance of respectful treatment as a goal and value, in this chapter, I reflect on patterns and trends in human relations during the democratic era. Because race was such a fundamental basis for exclusion and indignity during the period before democracy, I focus here on what the post-Apartheid governments did to try to improve social cohesion, integration, and unity across racial lines, and with what consequences. There are many other dimensions along which citizens in South Africa and elsewhere are frequently made to feel devalued, and I consider a few of those here—in particular, discrimination on the basis of gender and being a foreign national. Once again, a contemporary snapshot of South African society reveals many gaps and shortcomings in the extent of dignified treatment: ongoing racial discrimination, sexism, gender-based violence, and homophobia. And yet, the persistence of everyday headlines and political movements within South Africa to address these shortcomings also reminds us of the value of democracy at work. Individuals, organizations, and even government actors have been steadfastly attempting to transform a society that infamously set standards for forcing people to suffer indignities along so many dimensions in the decades prior to the democratic transition. Without losing sight of the remaining needs, we can also recognize that South Africa has made enormous strides in extending respect for human dignity and, in many ways, has become a global leader in the defense of human rights—and this can be traced to the institutions of the democratic dispensation and the ethos they engendered. Putting Ideals into Actions The idea that an ANC-led government would pursue a nation-building and human-rights agenda to address the country’s racist history had deep roots. The ANC cofounder, Sol Plaatje, espoused such values in his writing and newspapers and in his opposition to the Native Lands Act during the first decades of the twentieth century.7 Like so many of the aspirations of the democratic era, the 1955 Freedom Charter provided a written blueprint to overcome the racial hierarchy and other dimensions of intolerance: “All national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride; The preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime.… All shall enjoy equal human rights!” Forceful appeals to such values would nonetheless leave open the question of how they would be realized in practice. Important answers were revealed in the first years of the Mandela presidency: the enshrining of those values in the new constitution, promoting a new nation-building myth, holding a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, distributing new symbols that would recognize the role of liberation leaders, and developing a set of democratic institutions that would facilitate a more inclusive sense of nationhood. In fact, the totality of government-led initiatives to generate a more inclusive South African society, particularly during the first few years after the 1994 election, was extraordinary. It is hard to identify a government anywhere in the world that has been more deliberate in trying to recognize and to accommodate such a diverse citizenry, with keen attention to rights and respectful treatment. Among its many virtues, the 1996 constitution enumerated various protections to recognize the ubuntu ideal. And although the term “ubuntu” was mentioned explicitly only in the interim 1993 constitution, legal scholars have highlighted that the notion of “dignity” essentially implies a similar norm of respect for the value of all humans and of humanity.8 Section 39 of the constitution would direct courts to “promote the values that underlie an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.”9 And in 1995, the government launched its constitutionally mandated South African Human Rights Commission to raise awareness of, monitor, and seek to protect various human rights. Beyond these written ideals and protections, Munsieville’s favorite son, Desmond Tutu, stepped up to play a pivotal role in the promotion of solidarity in two key nation-building projects designed to further the goal of mutual respect. First, in 1994, Tutu coined the term “rainbow nation” to evoke a positive image of the diverse cultures coming together as one imagined community.10 He had previously described demonstrators of various races participating in a 1989 defiance campaign as the “rainbow people of God.”11 Mandela and other leaders invoked the Rainbow Nation idea, and at least for the first few years of post-Apartheid South Africa, they did so frequently. People on the outside—this author included—ate up the idea that a shared sense of collective identity could be forged in short order, particularly under the tutelage of a small band of Nobel Peace Prize–winning leaders. In a place where national identity had been so important as a legitimating basis for oppression, a new narrative was clearly necessary. Second, Tutu chaired the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), along with Alex Boraine as deputy (he cofounded IDASA, the institute that had hosted peace-building missions during Apartheid). The idea for an amnesty process was already enshrined in the provisional 1993 constitution, justified in ubuntu philosophy: The adoption of this Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South Africa to transcend the divisions and strife of the past, which generated gross violations of human rights, the transgression of humanitarian principles in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear, guilt and revenge. These can now be addressed on the basis that there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for victimisation. In turn, Boraine helped draft the 1995 Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act establishing the TRC, which began its hearings in 1996. The TRC hearings continued on while Amy and I lived in South Africa in 1997 and 1998, and for us, the weekly “Truth Commission Special Report,” hosted by the progressive journalist Max du Preez, was just about the most gripping television we could have imagined. Each week, we sat in front of our small television watching recaps of testimony from a wide cast of characters; and on a few occasions, when hearings were in Cape Town, I sat in the gallery transfixed. The drama frequently involved heavily Afrikaans-accented former government operatives recalling their role in often brutal interrogation and even torture—and then watching them face the families of victims describing their pain and the lasting scars. These hearings often, but not always, concluded with scenes of Black African families—usually, a mother or a grandmother—tearfully hugging the killers of their kin in acts of forgiveness.12 It was an attempt to restore a sense of humanity to people who had been either victims or perpetrators of tragically dehumanizing acts. The commission received 7,127 applications for amnesty, and it listened to and recorded 21,298 statements over a two-year period.13 To be granted amnesty, the commission needed to be persuaded that the acts were politically motivated and directed (which generally meant that they were tied to a specific organizational mission) and that the applicants provided full disclosure for all relevant acts.14 It ultimately granted amnesty in 849 cases and refused it in 5,392,15 almost 70 percent of which were refused because the acts were deemed to have no political objective,16 highlighting that this was not simply a pro forma process. For example, a group of policemen petitioned for amnesty for killing four Black men from Cradock—the birthplace of Paul Kruger—in 1985. The commission was not impressed with the sincerity of the apology or the claim on the part of the White police officers that the murders were either ordered or necessary to achieve their political ends, and their application for amnesty was denied.17 The TRC proved controversial, including with respect to concerns that perpetrators ought to face harsher justice, that victims deserved more generous reparations, and that the whole enterprise would cost a lot and change little. There was no shortage of people involved with the process, or who looked on from the outside, describing it as having been unhelpful and/or unfair.18 Such valid concerns notwithstanding, what would have been better? No amnesty process? A different one—like the Gacaca courts used in post-genocide Rwanda? Those also met a very mixed reaction from the citizenry.19 Indeed, the TRC might have carried out aspects of its mission in different ways. However, it was a central component of the transition and it is hard to imagine—given the history—how a peaceful transition could have moved forward without such a process. Along the way, the commission documented the inner details of a horrific history, and while it certainly did not equate the Apartheid crimes with those committed in the struggle for liberation, it served to acknowledge that many human rights violations also occurred in the latter. It implied a degree of give-and-take in assigning blame that was consistent with the compromising and conciliatory spirit Mandela and Tutu had each advocated. Outside the commission hearings, more visible symbols and iconic imagery inherited from before 1994 would also literally stand out all around the country as reminders of past indignities. They were in tension with the new values and composition of an integrated South Africa, and over the years, many actors have demanded deliberate responses. One strategy has been to transform and to create novel symbols of what it means to be South African. As I mentioned earlier, the national flag and the national anthem were reworked in time for Mandela’s inauguration. And at the finals of the Rugby World Cup in 1995, Mandela reappropriated the old South Africa’s Springbok symbol to be acceptable for the New South Africa. Beyond that, the faces of nightly television news, especially on the South African Broadcasting Company, would always depict the country’s racial diversity. National government media and publications have marketed the ideal of diversity, a strategy that has mostly been mirrored in the private sector as well. A related strategy has been to use museums as a vehicle for telling a new story about nationhood—for consumption by the outside world, visiting school groups, and the general population.20 When Amy and I were living in Cape Town in 1997–98, she worked in the education department of the South African National Gallery and observed curators and staff actively trying to project a more nuanced and diverse portrait of the new nation within the confines of a building that was just steps away from the national parliament. For example, the museum prominently displayed the Butcher Boys, an anti-Apartheid sculpture depicting three gruesome part-human, part-animal figures sitting on a bench. It was intended to critically highlight the banality of dehumanization that transpired under that regime. Fabricated in 1986 by Jane Alexander, the artwork had previously been displayed at Johannesburg’s Market Theater, a venue that managed to welcome multiracial audiences and even perform anti-Apartheid plays for many years before the end of the regime. In 1991, the National Gallery obtained the sculpture, moving it from the sphere of private protest to national treasure, embracing rejection of Apartheid as part of the new national narrative. Cape Town and Johannesburg were rising cosmopolitan cities, within which there was more elite consensus concerning the future direction of the country—at least in terms of disavowing its past. In other parts of the country, however, such reengineering proved to be more fraught. For example, Carolyn Holmes tellingly describes a duo of war memorial museums located at opposite ends of a river near the small town of Dundee in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The first, dedicated in 1947, tells the Afrikaner side of an 1838 battle, and the second, financed and dedicated by the government in 1998, tells the Zulu side. As she explains, even the literal creation of a physical bridge to cross the river and facilitate collective recognition of these perspectives has failed to integrate the predictably distinct sets of patrons who visit each.21 Located on the urban periphery, Mogale City also offers a set of sometimes contradictory messages in its museums. On the one hand, the national visitor’s center to the Cradle of Humankind is thoroughly modern in appearance and hews closely to the inclusive vision of the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Meanwhile, just a few doors away from the downtown Krugersdorp Chicken Licken and facing the Mogale City Hall is the municipality’s local museum, which appeared neglected and run-down when I visited. On display were multiple layers of national stories: one, constructed more recently and hastily, in which Black Africans rose up after a long period of victimhood; and one that was previously understood by Krugersdorpers as the only relevant history, that of White English and Afrikaners forging unity after a period of bitter conflict.22 Presented next to one another, these layers remained separate, as if two distinct histories—much like in Dundee. More frequently viewed than museum exhibitions is the everyday iconography of statues, monuments, and street and place names. In recent years, some White residents have decried the efforts to change names as a waste of time and money. Yet, it is worth recalling that even after the Boer War, at the start of the twentieth century, the victorious British similarly sought to alter the local symbology. For example, they anglicized some of the road and place names from the quintessentially Afrikaner—Kemp and Viljoen—to British ones, such as Tindall, Philips, and Tominson.23 The British also made efforts not to antagonize the previously defeated Afrikaners, and when Lord Chamberlain visited Krugersdorp, he offered to repair the war-time damage to the Paardekraal Monument, and town planning was increasingly implemented with an eye toward balance and fairness across the two White groups—for example, locating a sports ground in between Paardekraal and Coronation Park, respective symbols of Boer and British pride.24 The post-Apartheid government sought to more explicitly recognize iconic resistance leaders and other notable Black individuals, whose contribution to history had been made invisible under Apartheid. Very soon, Black South Africans would see themselves and their leaders in the form of statues and symbols, with their names and languages inscribed on the walls of buildings used in the business of government and on various street signs. A statue of the town’s namesake, the Batswana chief Mogale wa Mogale, stands between city hall and the local museum. Given the regime change, the question had to be raised concerning what to do about the White symbols, especially those closely associated with committing atrocities against Black people throughout the twentieth century and earlier. The approach to this sensitive task has varied to a degree across the country, no doubt a function of the demographics, sentiment, and organization of local populations. For example, Krugersdorp, within Mogale City, is still called Krugersdorp, named after Paul Kruger, whose very resentment of Black people and British abolition of slavery led him to take actions that set South Africa on its path toward extreme racial exclusion. Nationally, and in recent years, the figure most squarely in protesters’ crosshairs has been Cecil Rhodes. For university students in countries around the world, including South Africa, Rhodes’s name has long been associated with academic excellence: it is synonymous with the prestigious fellowship that allows students to study at Oxford. And one of South Africa’s leading universities also bears his name. Just as in the case of America’s Woodrow Wilson, Rhodes’s own history of racism turned out to be too profound to ignore, and owing to his involvement in education, his likeness has literally stared politically active students in the face throughout the post-Apartheid period. Starting in 2015, students at the University of Cape Town forcefully argued for removal of a prominent Rhodes statue. Some protesters flung human excrement at it.25 And it was eventually removed. The effort sparked protests around the country, loosely coordinated on social media with the slogan #Rhodesmustfall. It articulated the idea that respect for the dignity of Black South Africans means not having to look at his figure, literally elevated onto a pedestal. Not surprisingly, such protests have not been without controversy. Just as many American southerners have clung to symbols of the Confederate South, despite the clear offense to African Americans, many White South Africans still value symbols and figures of White icons as sources of pride. Within Mogale City, statues of Kruger and Rhodes can be viewed via a short trip on Voortrekker Drive or on roads named after Afrikaner leaders, Potgieter or Pretorius. Though gated to visitors, Paardekraal remains as a shrine to Afrikanerdom. Representatives from political parties such as the Freedom Front Plus say that these are a part of history and should be viewed as part of a cultural, not political, landscape. Perhaps given the greater numbers and influence of Whites in Mogale, and especially of Afrikaners—and their demonstrated commitment to this symbology—Rhodes and Kruger remained standing as of 2019. And while the efforts described above might be understood as consequences of the give-and-take of democratic practice, democracy itself has provided a powerful recognition of South Africa’s diverse society. In particular, the proportional representation electoral institutions have facilitated a strong degree of “descriptive” representation26—that is, where the racial (and gender) composition of legislatures resembles that of their constituents—at all levels of government. For example, after the 2016 election, approximately 18 percent of Mogale’s councillors were White, 4 percent Indian, and 78 percent Black African; and approximately one-third were women, which came much closer to the actual population demographics than any represented body ever in the history of the country. While it’s true that when Ramaphosa took office in 2017 he was the fifth Black African man from the ANC in a row to be president—a pattern that is likely to continue—the office has been held by individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds: Mandela and Mbeki were Xhosa, Motlanthe a Pedi, Zuma a Zulu, and Ramaphosa a Venda. Overcoming the Racial Divide? Such initiatives, policies, and practices could only encourage, not determine, how people in this divided society would treat one another and, in turn, whether they would feel respected and valued. Could deliberate efforts to reverse three and a half centuries of institutionalized racism create a respectful and unified nation within the span of twenty-five years? In a word, no.27 It is impossible to ignore the obvious: race is still the basis for huge social, political, and economic divides in South Africa, particularly in cities and on the urban periphery, which are racially diverse (as compared with many rural municipalities which are 99 percent Black African). In prior chapters I’ve described the substantial leveling of political rights across racial boundaries and the partial but very far from complete effort to reduce the material gaps in racial inequality. In each case, legacies still overshadow modern efforts. And not surprisingly, all of this, alongside awareness of the country’s political history, contributes to suspicion and lack of trust across groups, and between citizens and the state. For Americans, the story will sound eerily familiar, especially since we have a longer history of anti-discrimination policy, and yet racial inequalities and evidence of the pernicious effects of discrimination remain powerful and everyday features of life in our society. Nonetheless, given the starting point of the late 1980s and early 1990s, there’s been measurable progress in race relations and even nation-building under democratic government. Consider first the situation of Mogale City: for my Historical Memories Survey, one criterion for inclusion in the study was that the respondents had to have actually lived through at least a few years of Apartheid and its aftermath. I asked them to compare their present life (in 2019) to what it was like under Apartheid, specifically in terms of how they were treated by people from other race groups. A full 47 percent of Black respondents said they were treated better now, while 23 percent said worse now, and 24 percent said things had not changed.28 Of those who said everyday life had improved on this dimension, many adopted a stance similar to the one advanced by the three pastors: Don’t lose sight of how things once were. I asked about their hopes pre-1994 and their reflections on the period 1994–99, and unprompted, a great many referred to their optimism and subsequent happiness about not having to carry a “dompas” or pass. “When Mr. Nelson was out of jail he made sure that there was no violence, we stopped carrying dompas, our identity documents changed, and we were allowed to vote.” “We could all walk around free without carrying any dompas.” “We are not slaves, we have a choice not to be slaves or work as domestic workers. We walk free in our streets without carrying a dompas and we can enter any restaurants.” Understandably, for many others, merely being “free from slavery” in the sense of the end of draconian Apartheid legislation was too low a bar to celebrate. Many expected more, and received less, especially in the early years of the transition. For example, in an extended interview, Pamela Esso, who in her activist youth and participation in the Soweto uprising was hopeful for change, recalled that she continued to experience harsh discrimination in the area even into the 1990s, as the country underwent its transition. After years of hard work as a government-employed nurse, she wanted her family to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle. In 1992, about a year after the removal of the Group Areas Act that restricted where Blacks could live and own property, Esso decided to build a house from scratch in a Krugersdorp suburb. She could afford a place with all of the modern amenities and wanted to live in an area that was fully serviced by the municipality and among neighbors. Esso knew that they would be living around White people, mostly Afrikaners—in fact, they would be the very first Black family in the neighborhood—but she was not deterred. When the Essos finally moved in, the neighbors didn’t show up with welcoming meals. And she did not receive any invitations to visit anyone in their homes. Instead, her house was repeatedly robbed and vandalized, and neighbors called her and her family names. Local kids harassed her children on the way to school, once they arrived at school, and on their way back home. Esso told me this story while sitting beside her adult daughter, who nodded and grimaced as she was reminded of this painful past. By the late 1990s, some of the hostility seemed to subside. But her family never felt welcome. Esso told me she could not recall instances of White South Africans being kind to her. Her account was by no means unique: various Black political leaders, activists, and ordinary citizens, particularly around Mogale City, highlighted to me how at every turn, their intelligence and integrity were questioned by Whites, including work colleagues. In my survey, many Black residents said they perceived enduring resentment from Whites, and that Whites did not view them as being fully human: “Fear divides Black and White because most White people fear that Black people are monkeys and we are full of ourselves.”—42-year-old woman in Ward 4 “We are divided because of color of skin. White people have better jobs and even if we have the same position at work they earn more money than Blacks.”—44-year-old woman in Ward 27 “Life between Black and White is different because of culture they have and they hate the Black people’s culture.”—63-year-old man in Ward 4 “Apartheid has played a role in a division of South Africans—for example, you can’t eat with a White person in the same table because they are disgusted by Black people, they call Black people pigs.”—49-year-old man in Ward 26 For the most part, Black South Africans recalled the period before democracy as one filled with painful and fraught memories, disrespect and discrimination. But there were exceptions, and Black South Africans who lived through Apartheid recalled a wide range of experiences. For example, Bobie Tlapu, a fiery Black EFF councillor in his sixties, spoke of being treated like a family member on a White farm. And some, like the Black DA councillor Margaret Mohube, described frustration with the violent nature of the anti-Apartheid struggle even as she supported the goals of the political activists. Whites described their frustrations with the state of race relations, but from a very different perspective. If there were ever a spirit of White regret for Apartheid and hopeful reconciliation around Mogale City, it was not palpable to me in 2019. In interviews and more casual conversations, many bristled at the very premise that racial prejudice directed at Blacks was a concern worth exploring further; and if anything, the tables had turned. Younger (White) adults were quick to point out, “This was not our fault. Why are we being blamed?” In terms of older adults, it is so difficult to find anyone willing to admit they ever supported Apartheid that one might conclude that this whole set of institutions was forced on them by an out-of-touch, alien government. Amanda de Lange, a Freedom Front Plus councillor, described in an interview with me her recollection of the past with memories distinct from the ones Black citizens shared: From the mid-1970s, I grew up in the countryside. We were very innocent and naive. We were still friends on the farms with the Black children. My best friends were Black boys and girls; when I visited my grandparents’ farm, we had fun, we did naughty things and we were all over the farm. I didn’t have White friends at that stage … I didn’t understand where all of these political issues came from. I didn’t get this Apartheid thing and “you guys are oppressing us.” Then this thing came up, and people were spending a lot of time on it, and there was a lot of upheaval in those years. Then we got blamed … for this Up until this day, I feel like we are blamed for things, we were dead good country folks … we don’t all understand this. I heard similar sentiments time and again from Whites. Jacqueline Pannall, a DA councillor, said that her father’s workers “were like our family. We never saw color. We weren’t raised to see color.” Most White South Africans conceded that Blacks were once treated unfairly, but they also argued that the time had come to stop demanding apologies or for their privileged position in the present. And they routinely recounted, “We were not racist.” Such views echoed the White responses to a nationwide survey fielded in late 2016, asking, “Which one of the following categories best describes you when thinking about the injustices of South Africa’s past?” Among Whites born in 1970 or earlier (and thus aged twenty or older at the time De Klerk released Mandela), less than one-third accepted the notion of racial privilege, which included 5 percent who described themselves as “Perpetrators,” 22 percent as “Bystanders,” and 6 percent as “Beneficiaries.” As for the rest, 15 percent said they were “Victims,” 10 percent were “Resisters,” and 41 percent said they could not be described by any of those terms.29 In a survey the previous year, a full 31 percent of Whites said they felt racially discriminated against “often” or “always”—as compared with 12 percent of Black Africans who reported discrimination in the current dispensation.30 In Mogale, the White respondents amplified this point:31 “Race is the biggest divide. The government forces racial hatred on the public.”—54-year-old man in Ward 22 “The biggest divide is the BEE policy [affirmative action] because it excludes other races in the country.”—53-year-old man in Ward 32 “Black people want to exterminate White people.”—46-year-old woman in Ward 17 “Black people cannot tolerate White people.”—63-year-old woman in Ward 22 White South Africans continue to command more power and more external attention than their size in the population would warrant, and I recognize that I may be perpetuating this pattern by the extent of attention they receive in the pages of this book. However, like in other countries with economically dominant minorities,32 the advent of democracy invited theoretical and quite practical questions of whether they would be ruthlessly targeted in a post-Apartheid dispensation and/or act as spoilers. Indeed, as I discussed earlier, many Whites in Mogale City actually expected some form of coordinated revenge for the past and/or worried about total political domination under multiracial democracy. More recently, survey responses, interviews, and reports in the media all point to a common refrain: a large share of Whites feel aggrieved in the New South Africa. Many, and certainly in Mogale City, prefer what was to what is. This is not entirely surprising given that 1994 marked a stark reversal of political fortune in terms of relative power and influence. To be sure, the post-Apartheid government has implemented a number of policies to favor Black Africans. Like the young man I met on his way to the voting booth in May 2019, many others say that were it not for their skin color, they would have much greater opportunities in terms of university acceptance, jobs, and other areas. But is that unfair? Of course, fairness, like success, is in the eye of the beholder. In Mogale City, and in most other parts of the country, many White South Africans complain that they pay high taxes and yet must also pay for private security and sometimes for essentially private provision of other services, such as personal generators. Moreover, they point to being unfairly targeted as victims of violence and generally ignored by government. Like several other relatively privileged minorities in the world—including Catalans in Spain and certain sections of the White population in the United States—they too are essentially making claims for greater respect for their dignity. Representing the most conservative and largely Afrikaner segment of the population, Afriforum is an organization that has tried to raise such concerns, as well as related issues of Afrikaner dignity. It has argued against changing place-names (for example, from Pretoria to Tshwane) and removing Afrikaner statues. Their complaints have sometimes gained the sympathies of White nationalists in other countries, including the prize of a coveted tweet from President Donald Trump in August 2018. He expressed concern that large-scale killings of White farmers and takeovers of their farms needed to be investigated.33 Afriforum’s active media campaigns have helped to reinforce a conventional wisdom among a broader White population that they have been unduly victimized since the end of Apartheid, and especially in recent years. Undoubtedly, there have been some brutal and tragic murders of White farmers, and there have been several notable land invasions.34 Yet, it’s also hard to ignore the bigger picture that by and large, White South Africans have been extremely fortunate in the post-Apartheid dispensation, and their collective complaints are vastly disproportionate to realities. They continue to enjoy an enormously high quality of life and have paid a relatively minimal price in terms of net material transfers. Despite the grave atrocities committed by the White government and many within society, they were offered a truth and reconciliation process, not large-scale revenge. And compared with the extent of crime and violence that Black Africans face, the reality for White South Africans is one of relative security. Of the 20,000 murders recorded in the year prior to Trump’s tweet, just 46 were White people killed on farms.35 One study highlights the ways in which Afriforum managed to gain outsized domestic attention to a statistically very rarely occurring phenomenon by effectively rebroadcasting brutal imagery.36 Post-Apartheid governments have actually protected Whites in various ways. Several instances of anti-White and anti-Afrikaner hate speech have received enormous media attention, have been condemned by the SA Human Rights Commission and other bodies, and, in a few rare occasions, have been sanctioned or punished.37 In Mogale City, where a disproportionately large share of the country’s otherwise very small poor White population resides, the government has provided the same social protections, including RDP houses, that Black South Africans receive. In short, it would be very hard to maintain the argument that the dignity of White South Africans has been substantially disrespected during the era of multiracial democracy. Moreover, notwithstanding these sentiments, we still must ask, has there been change in terms of intergroup relations? Both in terms of attitudes and behaviors, I think the answer, unequivocally, is yes. For example, Gauteng residents were asked in a survey whether “interracial dating/marriage is acceptable.” In Mogale City, 66 percent of Whites agreed, while a sizable, but much smaller 18 percent disagreed with the proposition. The very foundations of Apartheid were built on the notion that Whites and Blacks were so different, they were almost different species. Now, about two-thirds of Whites were rejecting this premise. Meanwhile, 79 percent of Blacks agreed and 12 percent disagreed that interracial marriage was acceptable.38 By comparison, in the United States in 2009, just 63 percent of all Americans, and 61 percent of Whites, said they would be “fine if a family member were married to someone of a different race/ethnicity.”39 Relatedly, for over three decades, the World Values Survey has been asking citizens around the world to identify “who would you not like to have as a neighbor.” And when they were interviewed in 1982, as shown in figure 8.2, more than 40 percent of a representative sample of South African Whites said “someone from a different race group.” That statistic dropped dramatically to 13 percent in 1996 and has gone up and down since, but it has certainly remained well below the Apartheid-era level of widespread animosity. While just over 10 percent of Black South Africans mentioned someone of another race in 1982, that figure increased somewhat, peaking at 28 percent of Blacks mentioning this bigoted preference in 2001, but by 2006, this dropped to a historic low of 8 percent, and then went back up to 19 percent in 2013. While Black intolerance has increased markedly, and should not be ignored, it is also not nearly as widespread as White racial intolerance twenty-five years earlier. Even among people from whom one might have expected resentment, contemporary attitudes can be surprisingly embracing of the other. Eunice Sagathle was an activist with the anti-Apartheid UDF and detained in 1986 at the age of fourteen at Krugersdorp Prison for a year and a half. By the mid-1980s, thousands of young people under the age of eighteen, some as young as ten years old, were similarly imprisoned and treated like adults.40 Nonetheless, she went on to get an education, including as a student at the University of Bophuthatswana, and took advantage of an opportunity to participate in a student exchange program in Norway. When I spoke with her in 2019, she was working in the Mogale administration after many years serving as a local councillor. As an ANC member, she described the challenges her party faces, but I was surprised by her response when I asked her about the (White) opposition: “I must say I like them, they are not like [at the national level]. They are very passionate about the development of the city. As the Speaker, I had a good working relationship with them. Even now I have a good working relationship with them.” FIGURE 8.2. Aversion to having a neighbor of a different race in South Africa (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi and Afrob_2015. In practice, intergroup tolerance and acceptance is largely practiced at arm’s length, and multiracial families are still very much the exception. For example, analyzing the composition of households included in a nationally representative survey from 2016, I found that just under 4 percent included at least one pair of related individuals from different race groups; and of that, most mixed households only included people of color (i.e., Black Africans, Coloureds, or Indian/Asians).41 What about national sentiment? Do South Africans increasingly see themselves as part of one nation? A “rainbow nation”? That is, a political community tied to the South African state in which diversity of background and culture is shared and mutually respected among its members. If Apartheid implied the separation of race and (Black) language groups, has there been a coming together at least in terms of a shared attachment to the larger nation? It wasn’t completely crazy to think that this was possible—recall that English and Afrikaners fought a bloody and bitter war at the turn of the twentieth century, and despite lingering cultural chauvinism, most Whites came to see themselves as part of a shared (White) nation within a few decades. FIGURE 8.3. Pride in being South African (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi. Note: 4-point response scale recoded to 0–1, with 1 representing “very proud.” Lines depict average scores by race group. Over the course of six waves of the World Values Survey, respondents were asked, “Are you proud to be South African?” As shown in figure 8.3, White and Black South Africans trended in exactly opposite directions for the history of the survey. As one might expect,42 very few Black South Africans reported feeling proud in the first survey in 1982 (just 36 percent saying “very proud” as compared with 75 percent of Whites). In 1990, similar proportions of both groups said they were very proud. More Blacks tended to increase to a peak of 81 percent in 2006, falling to 68 percent in 2013. By 2013, over 80 percent of Whites and over 90 percent of Black Africans said they were “proud” or “very proud.” Notwithstanding some ups and downs, that might seem to be quite a strong showing for the nation-building project. To be fair, when asked this way, the question allows citizens to think about the South African nation however they want—and not necessarily as the multiracial nation envisioned in the constitution, let alone by Desmond Tutu. Twenty-five years after Mandela’s election, in my survey of Mogale residents, I asked respondents to reflect on this question: “Let’s talk about what it means to be a South African. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once talked about the idea of a Rainbow Nation in South Africa. For some people, this meant a coming together and unity of people from different languages and races. Which of the following statements BEST approximates your view?” The answer was clear: the most ambitious ideals of multiracial nation-building had not yet been realized. Only 28 percent of those interviewed said that Tutu’s ideal had been realized or might be relatively soon. By contrast, “I am not convinced that South Africans can ever come together to be a rainbow nation” was the preferred response for 31 percent of the sample. Nevertheless, there were more doubters and fewer optimists in a national sample of South African public opinion in 1994, when 36 percent said the country would continue to be comprised of different nations. Although Black Africans were much more optimistic than Whites in the earlier, national sample, in the 2019 survey of Mogale residents, the distribution of answers was extremely similar across race groups.43 South African citizens seem to feel attached to the country—and perhaps it is this very attachment that has made political contests such high-stakes endeavors. For example, one survey asked, “Do you agree or disagree with the following—‘I would rather be a citizen of South Africa than of any other country in the world.’ ” Reference to “country” is clearly different from reference to a “people” or “nation” but still reflects a commentary on the collective, and 85 percent of those surveyed agreed, including 69 percent of Whites, who have been most likely to leave South Africa for other shores.44 Respect for the Dignity of Women? While I have mostly focused on concerns about racial and income/class inequalities, I think most observers would agree that South Africa has long been a male-dominated society. The country’s extreme brand of institutionalized White supremacy involved the explicit control of sexuality and gender relations, which contributed to a more thoroughgoing form of patriarchy. This was most obvious in various laws prohibiting marriage and sexual relations across the color bar throughout the twentieth century. Different laws and penalties for men and women who violated those laws were also reflected in different social norms and expectations across gender lines. Income, power, status, and wealth all accrued disproportionately to men. Even comparatively, White South Africa was a laggard compared to some of its peers: White women were only granted the right to vote in 1930—well after suffrage was achieved by women in the settler societies of New Zealand (1893), Australia (1901), Canada (1918; but only for federal elections), and the United States (1920). The first woman, Leila Reitz, was elected to the House of Assembly in 1933, and Helen Suzman,45 who served as a Member of Parliament for thirty-six years, was an outspoken voice against Apartheid. In both cases, those women spent several years as the only women in an otherwise all-male assembly. The liberation movement arguably made some significant gains with respect to female empowerment. Various women’s organizations were founded throughout the decades of Apartheid, some multiracial, some not. For example, the Black Women’s Federation was created with inspiration from the Black Consciousness movement in 1975, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela served as an executive member. Women across racial groups and socioeconomic classes played pivotal roles in the struggle against racial inequality, dating back to struggles against the pass system in the early 1910s, and these were recognized by key liberation leaders.46 Nonetheless, Apartheid left a gendered legacy of poverty in South Africa,47 and the fight for gender equality was consistently subordinated to that for racial equality until the late 1980s.48 Women were only granted full membership in the ANC at the time the organization’s Women’s League (ANCWL) was founded in 1943. And although a multiracial coalition of women helped draft an initial Women’s Charter that called for the removal of all laws and customs denying equal rights to women in anticipation of the Congress of the People in 1955,49 they were often relegated to secondary roles within movements.50 The political transition ushered in during the early 1990s provided a clear opening to make needed change. And once again channeling language from the Freedom Charter, the authors of the 1996 constitution declared the republic to be founded on not just the values of human dignity and non-racialism but also non-sexism. In turn, various institutions were established with the explicit goal of “mainstreaming” gender issues into South Africa’s legislation and public policies.51 Reflecting today on the record, the results are similar to what I’ve described along the racial dimension: progress has been significant, clearly more rapid and thoroughgoing than during any other period in South African history. Perhaps most notably, after almost a century of virtually all-male legislatures, following the 1994 election, 111 (of 400) women were seated in Parliament. Many went on to have a considerable impact on substantive policy issues and legislation.52 As the ANC was the only political party with a gender quota at the time, it accounted for 90 (81.1 percent) of these seats.53 Women’s representation in Parliament has been amplified in the form of parliamentary committees including, for example, the establishment of the Women’s Budget Initiative, which pushed for government ministries to consider gender issues in the formulation of their budgets.54 By 2019, South Africa ranked tenth among all countries in the world in terms of the number of women in Parliament.55 As shown in figure 8.4, under Apartheid, South Africa truly lagged in terms of rates of female political empowerment, particularly compared with other Upper-middle-income countries. When considering female political empowerment—measured in terms of women’s civil liberties, civil society participation, and descriptive representation in political positions—the South African record shot up in 1994 and stayed very high relative to the rest of the countries. Similarly, in terms of gender-based exclusion—denial of access to services or participation based on gender identity—again, South Africa compares particularly favorably relative to other countries, but only beginning in 1994. In 2019, South Africa ranked 66th out of 167 countries on the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security overall empowerment index, virtually tied with Namibia, Mauritius, and Rwanda as the overall leaders for Africa, a region that otherwise populates most of the bottom rankings internationally.56 FIGURE 8.4. Female political empowerment scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. These broad patterns belie important caveats and remaining concerns. Scholars have frequently found that because of lack of resources and/or insufficient commitment within government agencies, the impact of gender oversight commissions is often limited.57 And the country’s electoral system ensures that parliamentarians are vulnerable to party discipline, which limits the substantive ability of female parliamentarians to strike out on their own without the blessing of generally male-dominated party leadership. And following South Africa’s democratic transition, the women’s movement became increasingly fragmented and demobilized due both to the recruitment of its most competent leaders to the political system and to the ANC Women’s League’s declining prominence.58 And while it is true that at least a few female politicians can be found in the upper rungs in all of the leading parties, nationally and in Mogale City, top leadership remains a very male-dominated club, and the country has yet to seriously consider a woman for the position of state president. These facts are not lost on the female politicians in Mogale City, including Noluthando Mangole, the Black ANC Speaker; Eunice Segatlhe, the Black former ANC Speaker and current government bureaucrat; Amanda de Lange, the White Afrikaans-speaking FF+ councillor; or Sharon Govindasamy, an Indian DA councillor. In so many ways, these women could not be more different in terms of their personal backgrounds and policy preferences. But in my separate conversations with them, they each had remarkably similar responses to my line of inquiry on at least one question: that is, on the issue of how they are treated as women within their parties and in South African society. Mangole was born and raised in Munsieville. At council meetings, she is responsible for keeping meetings in order and councillors in line, following rules of debate, and so forth and has a commanding presence in the chamber. Despite being in the number two position in council, she worried about what she saw as reversing trends in gender parity: Remember that the gender issue was brought by the ANC Women’s League into government.… But that discussion is also now fading away. The ANC took a decision that said in the deployment you can have 50–50 or can have 60–40 in favor of women. But that is fading away. For example, [look at] the ANC outcomes of elections in 2017, you see one female and five males. When you would have expected at least three females, three males. It’s about power relations. Segatlhe, also from Munsieville, decried the problem of men sidelining outspoken women. In politics, nowadays when you are vocal, when you can stand your ground, if you are principled, they put her aside, “she talks too much,” they just put you there, “she thinks she is educated,” they just put you there, and it is such a pity, because even those women who are in leadership positions today here, you’ll find that they are there, but not there, because their male counterparts are telling them when to speak and when to raise issues which is so unfortunate.… Lots and lots of female leaders that are unemployed with degrees and because they are independent thinkers they are sidelined. De Lange similarly told a story of unfinished business. Despite representing a small, minority party, she cast a strong presence in local politics, speaking often in meetings and writing to the Krugersdorp News on a regular basis. Nonetheless, she highlighted a male-dominated culture within the party that creates a “glass ceiling” for competent female leaders. The FF+, being the conservative party that it is, stemmed mainly from the male fraternity and I think it’s always been like that. There have always been good and competent women, but they never wound up in the structures or the senior positions, leadership positions. Only of late, since the rest of the country and the opposition parties started to push women forward, that the awareness was created, that we needed to move with it, because we were still seen as a men’s party, or a party where men featured and men ruled. Before me, there were many women who were very good and they sort of just dwindled away … I do find still that some of the very senior leadership is still not acceptable to the fact, that I am not just a woman, but outspoken and decisive, and I come with my ideas and it should be incorporated because of the merits, and not declined because it’s a woman who brings it to the table. It is still difficult, yes. She argued for a greater representation of women in the seats of power toward better ends. I certainly feel that if we had more women in senior positions in this country, matters would have been much more stabilized because women just bring a sense of stability in any community and any organization. It’s just because, and I don’t want to generalize, but I think history has taught us that men are more inclined to go for war, whereas women are more level-headed. Again I don’t want to generalize, I just think women bring more stability. I’ve seen it in places where I’ve worked. I’ve seen it everywhere. I do believe if we could have more women and stronger women in power we could definitely see a lot of changes in this country. And as for Govindasamy, another woman who described for me a very full daily agenda in her work as a PR councillor and was active in her home ward of Azaadville, she largely echoed the views of her councillor colleagues from rival parties. In some ways, this was most surprising, as the DA has had a woman as its national leader (Helen Zille), and the Mogale City local leadership of her party is also largely female. But she said that when it comes time to make decisions around advancement, male perspectives dominate: “I think we are being downplayed in South Africa. [There are] more women as councillors, but more men are promoted to status positions. It’s tough being a woman in politics.” Beyond questions of political leadership, in recent years, concerns for the dignity of women have come to the fore as various activists have tried to shine a light on gender-based violence. As just one example, the 2019 rape and murder of a university student set off a wave of protest marches and demonstrations across the country. In turn, more perpetrators of such violence are being held accountable, and the critical issue has attracted unprecedented attention from government and society. Both the ANC and the DA included mention of gender-based violence in their respective 2019 election manifestoes. But the problem of this highly prevalent and grave indignity is very far from being solved. (Lack of) Respect for the Dignity of Foreigners While the post-Apartheid South African governments have clearly and deliberately pursued far more inclusionary approaches than any of their predecessors, almost any nation-building process inevitably bumps up against a difficult problem: the task of defining who is South African, entitled to the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and who is not. And just as countries around the world have, in recent years, been forced to reconsider how open or closed they would like to be with respect to people traveling across borders in search of new opportunities, so too have the South Africans. In practice, the country has not been regarded as very welcoming, to say the least. Throughout South Africa’s history, various attempts to build harmony, solidarity, or nationhood among some have accompanied the harsh exclusion of others. When Paul Kruger and his Voortrekkers arrived in the area around what would become Mogale City, to build their Afrikaner community, they used force to relegate a group of Black Africans—the Ndebele—to an area that would later become Zimbabwe. When Kruger tried to build the South African Republic as a sovereign state for Afrikaners, he despaired of the British, American, and other foreigners who came in search of gold. And sustained interest in that gold was at the root of a war that generated concentration camps and graves, again, a short walk from where I was sitting having coffee with the three pastors. The new Union of South Africa, born in 1909, bridged intra-White divides alongside the near total exclusion of Black Africans, despite the fact that the latter constituted the overwhelming numerical majority in the region. And just as when foreigners flocked to the area in search of gold in the late nineteenth century, the end of Apartheid came to resemble another gold rush. Particularly given all of the advantages I have described with respect to the benefits of being South African relative to other countries, it is not surprising that so many Africans would come to their southern neighbor in search of better opportunities. Whatever challenges South Africans face, the situation in almost all of the rest of Africa is worse. This is most evident with respect to the Ndebele people in modern Zimbabwe. In fact, the founding king of the Matabele Kingdom (of the Zimbabwean Ndebele, also known as Northern Ndebele), Chief Mzilikazi, was himself from South Africa’s Zululand. Through conquest, he had settled in the area around modern Mogale City, especially in the Magaliesberg mountains. When the Afrikaners arrived during the Great Trek, they defeated Mzilikazi in military conflicts, forcing him and his Ndebele followers to retreat to the north. As far as I know, the modern South African state affords no special path for citizenship for these descendants, despite the fact that approximately one million culturally similar Ndebele live as South Africans today. Zimbabweans, and other Africans for that matter, came to be recognized as foreigners. Reports of violence targeted at foreign nationals emerged almost immediately after the country’s transition to democracy in 1994.59 The first, most notable outbreak was almost fourteen years later, on May 11, 2008, in Alexandra township, a place primarily known for its history of anti-Apartheid activism.60 Over the course of approximately two weeks, violence spread to other urban areas in the country61 and led to approximately 60 deaths—in addition to over 700 seriously injured and 100,000 displaced residents.62 Then-president Thabo Mbeki was widely criticized for his initial characterization of these attacks as random acts of criminality.63 The prevalence of xenophobic attitudes in South Africa was acknowledged as early as the late 1990s in government policy documents,64 and research carried out two decades later suggests that such violence became normalized.65 As in other places where anti-immigrant violence is rife, many theories have been advanced as to why, and there is no single answer, especially as the migrants themselves are quite varied in their origins and activities, as are the local contexts where they settle. Some migrants are perceived to be economic threats in competing for jobs and/or are resented for their success in building new businesses. Some are resented for their cultural differences, some for antisocial behavior. On a national survey conducted in 2015, 63 percent of South Africans said immigrants cause increases in crime; 44 percent said they bring disease; and 64 percent said they use up the country’s resources, again with little difference in the distribution of responses across race groups.66 Nationally, and certainly in Mogale City, citizens blame many of the long-standing challenges of the country on these foreigners—a blanket act of scapegoating. Along these lines, a few comments recorded on the Historical Memories Survey were quite typical of widespread sentiment: “Foreigners are a threat to us. All South Africans must stick together to keep them out.”—63-year-old White man from Ward 26 “Foreigners are selling drugs while Pakistanis are raping our kids, they take all our jobs and bring rotten food in South Africa.”—52-year-old Black woman from Ward 23 The editor of the Krugersdorp News said to me with respect to border security, “So many South Africans agree with Donald Trump … what he’s trying to do.” I gasped. A wall? The idea had not been seriously raised by any South African politicians. But on my survey of Mogale residents, I asked whether they agreed with this statement: “The Government must urgently secure the borders to keep out foreigners.” More than 70 percent of Whites and more than 70 percent of Blacks selected 10—fully agreed.67 The South African story resonates widely with other postcolonial accounts of growing intolerance of “others,” including in Rwanda and Ivory Coast. Tragically, the development of a sense of membership and belonging frequently goes hand in hand with efforts to exclude. Reconciliation: A Dream Deferred It would be easy to focus on a snapshot of human relations in South Africa and find much that is wanting relative to an ideal benchmark of universal respect for human dignity. Relatedly, South Africans in all their diversity have not yet cohered into a strong and inclusive nation. Nonetheless, a fair assessment of human relations and government-citizen relations during the democratic era reveals a profound set of transformations that ought not be taken for granted in a country that literally was at civil war along several dimensions in the years just prior to the 1994 election. Social boundaries that once appeared impenetrable are breaking down. Relative to generations of South Africans, frankly for the whole of modern history, those who have faced indignities because of who they are—for example, along the lines of race or gender—now have recourse in ways that were previously never available. South African government policy is also remarkably inclusive of members of the LGBTQ community, those with disabilities, and other groups. To a degree, these trends mirror those in other countries at approximately the same time, but it is worth noting that in many African countries, state leaders have strongly resisted greater tolerance and acceptance, particularly with respect to gender and sexual orientation. In South Africa’s democratic context, it became the first on the continent to legalize same-sex civil unions. And in no African country has there been more deliberate progress toward protecting respect for human dignity than in South Africa of the past quarter century. The end of Apartheid did not preordain that the country would become the leader it now is in the promotion of human rights in Africa, with unparalleled domestic capacity to monitor and to protect those rights on the part of government and nongovernment organizations. The ongoing quest to extend respect for human dignity and to raise the bar for what that implies has been enabled and fueled by democratic government and competitive politics.",

      "content": "8 Respect, Belonging, and Recognition IN EARLY FEBRUARY, still a few months before the 2019 election, I prepared for a meeting with three of Mogale City’s local religious leaders. Questions about basic service delivery were still very much on my mind. To what extent was the gap between poverty and prosperity being closed in terms of concrete outcomes such as housing, water, electricity, and jobs? Given the importance of religion in the lives of South Africans (three-quarters of citizens say that religion is important to them, as compared with 20 percent or lower in most European countries, China, and Japan)1 and the fact that religious leaders like Tutu and Chikane played such key roles in local and national politics, I was optimistic they could shed valuable light on the political history I was studying. I had contacted Rev. Armando Sontange of the Kagiso Presbyterian Church requesting an interview, and he offered to invite a few colleagues from other churches to join us for a discussion. We agreed to meet around 11 a.m. at the Mugg and Bean, South Africa’s most ubiquitous coffee chain, this one in the bustling Presidential Square shopping center in downtown Krugersdorp.2 Once we placed our orders and exchanged introductions, I threw out a softball question in the hopes of generating some responses: “How have basic housing conditions changed for your congregants during the past twenty-five years?” They nodded that indeed they had seen substantial improvements over this period, and they described aspects of the record I detailed in the previous chapter. Lots of upgrades, but still room for improvement. And always new people moving in. However, as we continued to engage in conversation, they urged me to redirect my focus. “It’s not just about material things,” Sontange said, “but about Ubuntu. About a human being human.” He and his colleagues took turns reminding me of earlier times, when Black people, irrespective of education or occupation, were confined to townships, their lives heavily controlled. For men like them, in their fifties, sixties, and older, the legalized caste-like system of Apartheid South Africa and the everyday indignities it perpetuated were still etched in their memories. They wanted to emphasize the fact that the apparent “normalcy” of three Black men having coffee with a White man in Krugersdorp should still be cherished as a stark departure from the past.3 The term “ubuntu” roughly translates to “humanness,” “humanity,” or “personhood” in several languages spoken in South Africa (Zulu, Xhosa, and Ndebele) and is most commonly associated with the Zulu proverb umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, which translates to “a person is a person through other persons.”4 The concept of ubuntu has been particularly influential in South Africa and in Zimbabwe owing to efforts to promote indigenous philosophies in the aftermath of White rule.5 Much like the analogous term “dignity,” ubuntu is an articulation of a core human value, one that demands moral obligations in various ways, including respect for others, the promotion of harmony, and the reduction of discord. Perhaps unique in their abilities to see through the noise of everyday life, the pastors collectively made the case that post-Apartheid South Africa had come much closer to realizing this ideal at least compared with what they had experienced before. At one point in our conversation, Rev. Monwabisi Moses, from the Kagiso Methodist Church, suggested that I look outside. A line of people moved slowly in pursuit of cash from the automated teller facing the parking lot just outside the Mugg and Bean. He explained that the line was long because the government had deposited social grants into their accounts via electronic transfer that morning. In a Socratic engagement, he asked if I noticed anything “interesting” about the line. FIGURE 8.1. Location of the Mugg and Bean at the President Hyper, Krugersdorp. Slightly embarrassed to always be focusing on race, I nonetheless offered up my first impression, “There’s that one White guy on line, otherwise comprised of Black people.” He nodded with a smile. “During Apartheid, [the line] would only be White people. You see that White guy, even if there were a queue, he would have had a preference. But not today.” At the time we spoke, I still had very little sense of where we were sitting—an artefact of being relatively new to the area and doggedly following the instructions delivered to me by my phone-as-navigational assistant. Just beyond the parking lot lay two sets of conflicting historical legacies with diametrically opposite messages for the core concerns we were discussing. On the one hand, we were less than half a kilometer from the town council’s Centennial Hall, where only a few decades earlier White local councillors had, time and again, voted to maintain the most petty of Apartheid’s discriminatory policies. Layered on top of residential segregation, as late as the 1980s, Krugersdorp still maintained racially separate restrooms. As one Black councillor recounted to me, when she came into town during the Apartheid years she had to use the “Nie Blankes” (Non-Whites) bus stop. The message of profound disrespect was clear and mortally insulting. On the other hand, we were also just eight miles from a 50,000-hectare tract of land, the Cradle of Humankind, which UNESCO declared to be a world heritage site. In 1947, the year before the onset of Apartheid, Robert Broom discovered fossils of early human ancestors of approximately 2.5 million years in vintage—artefacts that changed the way scientists understand the pattern of human development. And in December 1998, far within the depths of the Sterkfontein Caves on this land, located less than ten miles north of the Paardekraal Monument, another research team from Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand unearthed what would amount to the nearly complete skull of a 3.5-million-year-old human ancestor.6 The stunning on-site visitor center—only a decade old—argues strongly in favor of ubuntu philosophy: there is more that unites us in our common ancestry as humans than the superficiality of the various traits that seem to divide us. The idea of “race” that was almost fanatically developed on South African soil, with significant help from Europe and the Americas, is just one of many sources of human diversity. The Cradle offers scientific evidence of shared human origins—the types of facts that undergird calls for universal human rights and the ideal that all humans have inherent dignity, or value, and deserve to be accorded with commensurate levels of respect. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the bitter irony that the immediate dangers and long-term health consequences of the early excavations were disproportionately borne by Black mine workers, let alone the multiple ways in which Black people have been treated with profound disrespect in the area around the Cradle. And to this day, many Black Africans squat and reside in informal settlements on its outskirts, a legacy of the state’s historical lack of appreciation for equal human worth. The existential question—of what our shared humanity ought to mean in practice—thus looms particularly large in Mogale City. The removal of segregated coffee shops, segregated bus stops, and legalized Apartheid was just a starting point. Starting in 1994, South Africans from all of their diverse backgrounds proved they could vote together and select leaders peacefully. And the government began to close some gaps in service delivery. Yet, the fight to end Apartheid was not just about getting the vote, electricity, a flush toilet, or a job. The Freedom Charter, Nelson Mandela’s fiery “I am prepared to die” speech, and the new constitution all explicitly aspired to realize the goal of restoring human dignity. What is dignity, after all? I wanted to make sure I understood what the South Africans had in mind. So I decided to ask around. After our meeting at the Mugg and Bean, I asked Rev. Moses if I could come to his church in Kagiso to pilot the very Historical Memories Survey that I’ve been describing in the chapters of this book, and I would use that opportunity to ask this sample of citizens how they might define the term (in addition to trying out lots of other questions). I hired a young woman from his congregation—a recent university graduate—to work as a research assistant and to conduct interviews in English and Tswana. We posed the following question: “The constitution says that the Republic of South Africa is founded on the value of HUMAN DIGNITY. What does the word DIGNITY mean to you?” We only interviewed twenty-five congregants, a mix of men and women, all over the age of forty, and with few exceptions, their answers were overwhelmingly consistent: dignity is about respect and being valued. “Simply means we need to respect one another and have faith in each other and not be against each other.” “Dignity I would say is to have value to yourself, be respectful, respected wherever you are and be treated equally.” “Dignity to me means respecting other human beings, conducting myself in a manner that doesn’t undermine, discriminate any other human being. Ascribing to values, to norms that are acceptable in the society without undermining anyone.” Given the importance of respectful treatment as a goal and value, in this chapter, I reflect on patterns and trends in human relations during the democratic era. Because race was such a fundamental basis for exclusion and indignity during the period before democracy, I focus here on what the post-Apartheid governments did to try to improve social cohesion, integration, and unity across racial lines, and with what consequences. There are many other dimensions along which citizens in South Africa and elsewhere are frequently made to feel devalued, and I consider a few of those here—in particular, discrimination on the basis of gender and being a foreign national. Once again, a contemporary snapshot of South African society reveals many gaps and shortcomings in the extent of dignified treatment: ongoing racial discrimination, sexism, gender-based violence, and homophobia. And yet, the persistence of everyday headlines and political movements within South Africa to address these shortcomings also reminds us of the value of democracy at work. Individuals, organizations, and even government actors have been steadfastly attempting to transform a society that infamously set standards for forcing people to suffer indignities along so many dimensions in the decades prior to the democratic transition. Without losing sight of the remaining needs, we can also recognize that South Africa has made enormous strides in extending respect for human dignity and, in many ways, has become a global leader in the defense of human rights—and this can be traced to the institutions of the democratic dispensation and the ethos they engendered. Putting Ideals into Actions The idea that an ANC-led government would pursue a nation-building and human-rights agenda to address the country’s racist history had deep roots. The ANC cofounder, Sol Plaatje, espoused such values in his writing and newspapers and in his opposition to the Native Lands Act during the first decades of the twentieth century.7 Like so many of the aspirations of the democratic era, the 1955 Freedom Charter provided a written blueprint to overcome the racial hierarchy and other dimensions of intolerance: “All national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride; The preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime.… All shall enjoy equal human rights!” Forceful appeals to such values would nonetheless leave open the question of how they would be realized in practice. Important answers were revealed in the first years of the Mandela presidency: the enshrining of those values in the new constitution, promoting a new nation-building myth, holding a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, distributing new symbols that would recognize the role of liberation leaders, and developing a set of democratic institutions that would facilitate a more inclusive sense of nationhood. In fact, the totality of government-led initiatives to generate a more inclusive South African society, particularly during the first few years after the 1994 election, was extraordinary. It is hard to identify a government anywhere in the world that has been more deliberate in trying to recognize and to accommodate such a diverse citizenry, with keen attention to rights and respectful treatment. Among its many virtues, the 1996 constitution enumerated various protections to recognize the ubuntu ideal. And although the term “ubuntu” was mentioned explicitly only in the interim 1993 constitution, legal scholars have highlighted that the notion of “dignity” essentially implies a similar norm of respect for the value of all humans and of humanity.8 Section 39 of the constitution would direct courts to “promote the values that underlie an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.”9 And in 1995, the government launched its constitutionally mandated South African Human Rights Commission to raise awareness of, monitor, and seek to protect various human rights. Beyond these written ideals and protections, Munsieville’s favorite son, Desmond Tutu, stepped up to play a pivotal role in the promotion of solidarity in two key nation-building projects designed to further the goal of mutual respect. First, in 1994, Tutu coined the term “rainbow nation” to evoke a positive image of the diverse cultures coming together as one imagined community.10 He had previously described demonstrators of various races participating in a 1989 defiance campaign as the “rainbow people of God.”11 Mandela and other leaders invoked the Rainbow Nation idea, and at least for the first few years of post-Apartheid South Africa, they did so frequently. People on the outside—this author included—ate up the idea that a shared sense of collective identity could be forged in short order, particularly under the tutelage of a small band of Nobel Peace Prize–winning leaders. In a place where national identity had been so important as a legitimating basis for oppression, a new narrative was clearly necessary. Second, Tutu chaired the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), along with Alex Boraine as deputy (he cofounded IDASA, the institute that had hosted peace-building missions during Apartheid). The idea for an amnesty process was already enshrined in the provisional 1993 constitution, justified in ubuntu philosophy: The adoption of this Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South Africa to transcend the divisions and strife of the past, which generated gross violations of human rights, the transgression of humanitarian principles in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear, guilt and revenge. These can now be addressed on the basis that there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for victimisation. In turn, Boraine helped draft the 1995 Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act establishing the TRC, which began its hearings in 1996. The TRC hearings continued on while Amy and I lived in South Africa in 1997 and 1998, and for us, the weekly “Truth Commission Special Report,” hosted by the progressive journalist Max du Preez, was just about the most gripping television we could have imagined. Each week, we sat in front of our small television watching recaps of testimony from a wide cast of characters; and on a few occasions, when hearings were in Cape Town, I sat in the gallery transfixed. The drama frequently involved heavily Afrikaans-accented former government operatives recalling their role in often brutal interrogation and even torture—and then watching them face the families of victims describing their pain and the lasting scars. These hearings often, but not always, concluded with scenes of Black African families—usually, a mother or a grandmother—tearfully hugging the killers of their kin in acts of forgiveness.12 It was an attempt to restore a sense of humanity to people who had been either victims or perpetrators of tragically dehumanizing acts. The commission received 7,127 applications for amnesty, and it listened to and recorded 21,298 statements over a two-year period.13 To be granted amnesty, the commission needed to be persuaded that the acts were politically motivated and directed (which generally meant that they were tied to a specific organizational mission) and that the applicants provided full disclosure for all relevant acts.14 It ultimately granted amnesty in 849 cases and refused it in 5,392,15 almost 70 percent of which were refused because the acts were deemed to have no political objective,16 highlighting that this was not simply a pro forma process. For example, a group of policemen petitioned for amnesty for killing four Black men from Cradock—the birthplace of Paul Kruger—in 1985. The commission was not impressed with the sincerity of the apology or the claim on the part of the White police officers that the murders were either ordered or necessary to achieve their political ends, and their application for amnesty was denied.17 The TRC proved controversial, including with respect to concerns that perpetrators ought to face harsher justice, that victims deserved more generous reparations, and that the whole enterprise would cost a lot and change little. There was no shortage of people involved with the process, or who looked on from the outside, describing it as having been unhelpful and/or unfair.18 Such valid concerns notwithstanding, what would have been better? No amnesty process? A different one—like the Gacaca courts used in post-genocide Rwanda? Those also met a very mixed reaction from the citizenry.19 Indeed, the TRC might have carried out aspects of its mission in different ways. However, it was a central component of the transition and it is hard to imagine—given the history—how a peaceful transition could have moved forward without such a process. Along the way, the commission documented the inner details of a horrific history, and while it certainly did not equate the Apartheid crimes with those committed in the struggle for liberation, it served to acknowledge that many human rights violations also occurred in the latter. It implied a degree of give-and-take in assigning blame that was consistent with the compromising and conciliatory spirit Mandela and Tutu had each advocated. Outside the commission hearings, more visible symbols and iconic imagery inherited from before 1994 would also literally stand out all around the country as reminders of past indignities. They were in tension with the new values and composition of an integrated South Africa, and over the years, many actors have demanded deliberate responses. One strategy has been to transform and to create novel symbols of what it means to be South African. As I mentioned earlier, the national flag and the national anthem were reworked in time for Mandela’s inauguration. And at the finals of the Rugby World Cup in 1995, Mandela reappropriated the old South Africa’s Springbok symbol to be acceptable for the New South Africa. Beyond that, the faces of nightly television news, especially on the South African Broadcasting Company, would always depict the country’s racial diversity. National government media and publications have marketed the ideal of diversity, a strategy that has mostly been mirrored in the private sector as well. A related strategy has been to use museums as a vehicle for telling a new story about nationhood—for consumption by the outside world, visiting school groups, and the general population.20 When Amy and I were living in Cape Town in 1997–98, she worked in the education department of the South African National Gallery and observed curators and staff actively trying to project a more nuanced and diverse portrait of the new nation within the confines of a building that was just steps away from the national parliament. For example, the museum prominently displayed the Butcher Boys, an anti-Apartheid sculpture depicting three gruesome part-human, part-animal figures sitting on a bench. It was intended to critically highlight the banality of dehumanization that transpired under that regime. Fabricated in 1986 by Jane Alexander, the artwork had previously been displayed at Johannesburg’s Market Theater, a venue that managed to welcome multiracial audiences and even perform anti-Apartheid plays for many years before the end of the regime. In 1991, the National Gallery obtained the sculpture, moving it from the sphere of private protest to national treasure, embracing rejection of Apartheid as part of the new national narrative. Cape Town and Johannesburg were rising cosmopolitan cities, within which there was more elite consensus concerning the future direction of the country—at least in terms of disavowing its past. In other parts of the country, however, such reengineering proved to be more fraught. For example, Carolyn Holmes tellingly describes a duo of war memorial museums located at opposite ends of a river near the small town of Dundee in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The first, dedicated in 1947, tells the Afrikaner side of an 1838 battle, and the second, financed and dedicated by the government in 1998, tells the Zulu side. As she explains, even the literal creation of a physical bridge to cross the river and facilitate collective recognition of these perspectives has failed to integrate the predictably distinct sets of patrons who visit each.21 Located on the urban periphery, Mogale City also offers a set of sometimes contradictory messages in its museums. On the one hand, the national visitor’s center to the Cradle of Humankind is thoroughly modern in appearance and hews closely to the inclusive vision of the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Meanwhile, just a few doors away from the downtown Krugersdorp Chicken Licken and facing the Mogale City Hall is the municipality’s local museum, which appeared neglected and run-down when I visited. On display were multiple layers of national stories: one, constructed more recently and hastily, in which Black Africans rose up after a long period of victimhood; and one that was previously understood by Krugersdorpers as the only relevant history, that of White English and Afrikaners forging unity after a period of bitter conflict.22 Presented next to one another, these layers remained separate, as if two distinct histories—much like in Dundee. More frequently viewed than museum exhibitions is the everyday iconography of statues, monuments, and street and place names. In recent years, some White residents have decried the efforts to change names as a waste of time and money. Yet, it is worth recalling that even after the Boer War, at the start of the twentieth century, the victorious British similarly sought to alter the local symbology. For example, they anglicized some of the road and place names from the quintessentially Afrikaner—Kemp and Viljoen—to British ones, such as Tindall, Philips, and Tominson.23 The British also made efforts not to antagonize the previously defeated Afrikaners, and when Lord Chamberlain visited Krugersdorp, he offered to repair the war-time damage to the Paardekraal Monument, and town planning was increasingly implemented with an eye toward balance and fairness across the two White groups—for example, locating a sports ground in between Paardekraal and Coronation Park, respective symbols of Boer and British pride.24 The post-Apartheid government sought to more explicitly recognize iconic resistance leaders and other notable Black individuals, whose contribution to history had been made invisible under Apartheid. Very soon, Black South Africans would see themselves and their leaders in the form of statues and symbols, with their names and languages inscribed on the walls of buildings used in the business of government and on various street signs. A statue of the town’s namesake, the Batswana chief Mogale wa Mogale, stands between city hall and the local museum. Given the regime change, the question had to be raised concerning what to do about the White symbols, especially those closely associated with committing atrocities against Black people throughout the twentieth century and earlier. The approach to this sensitive task has varied to a degree across the country, no doubt a function of the demographics, sentiment, and organization of local populations. For example, Krugersdorp, within Mogale City, is still called Krugersdorp, named after Paul Kruger, whose very resentment of Black people and British abolition of slavery led him to take actions that set South Africa on its path toward extreme racial exclusion. Nationally, and in recent years, the figure most squarely in protesters’ crosshairs has been Cecil Rhodes. For university students in countries around the world, including South Africa, Rhodes’s name has long been associated with academic excellence: it is synonymous with the prestigious fellowship that allows students to study at Oxford. And one of South Africa’s leading universities also bears his name. Just as in the case of America’s Woodrow Wilson, Rhodes’s own history of racism turned out to be too profound to ignore, and owing to his involvement in education, his likeness has literally stared politically active students in the face throughout the post-Apartheid period. Starting in 2015, students at the University of Cape Town forcefully argued for removal of a prominent Rhodes statue. Some protesters flung human excrement at it.25 And it was eventually removed. The effort sparked protests around the country, loosely coordinated on social media with the slogan #Rhodesmustfall. It articulated the idea that respect for the dignity of Black South Africans means not having to look at his figure, literally elevated onto a pedestal. Not surprisingly, such protests have not been without controversy. Just as many American southerners have clung to symbols of the Confederate South, despite the clear offense to African Americans, many White South Africans still value symbols and figures of White icons as sources of pride. Within Mogale City, statues of Kruger and Rhodes can be viewed via a short trip on Voortrekker Drive or on roads named after Afrikaner leaders, Potgieter or Pretorius. Though gated to visitors, Paardekraal remains as a shrine to Afrikanerdom. Representatives from political parties such as the Freedom Front Plus say that these are a part of history and should be viewed as part of a cultural, not political, landscape. Perhaps given the greater numbers and influence of Whites in Mogale, and especially of Afrikaners—and their demonstrated commitment to this symbology—Rhodes and Kruger remained standing as of 2019. And while the efforts described above might be understood as consequences of the give-and-take of democratic practice, democracy itself has provided a powerful recognition of South Africa’s diverse society. In particular, the proportional representation electoral institutions have facilitated a strong degree of “descriptive” representation26—that is, where the racial (and gender) composition of legislatures resembles that of their constituents—at all levels of government. For example, after the 2016 election, approximately 18 percent of Mogale’s councillors were White, 4 percent Indian, and 78 percent Black African; and approximately one-third were women, which came much closer to the actual population demographics than any represented body ever in the history of the country. While it’s true that when Ramaphosa took office in 2017 he was the fifth Black African man from the ANC in a row to be president—a pattern that is likely to continue—the office has been held by individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds: Mandela and Mbeki were Xhosa, Motlanthe a Pedi, Zuma a Zulu, and Ramaphosa a Venda. Overcoming the Racial Divide? Such initiatives, policies, and practices could only encourage, not determine, how people in this divided society would treat one another and, in turn, whether they would feel respected and valued. Could deliberate efforts to reverse three and a half centuries of institutionalized racism create a respectful and unified nation within the span of twenty-five years? In a word, no.27 It is impossible to ignore the obvious: race is still the basis for huge social, political, and economic divides in South Africa, particularly in cities and on the urban periphery, which are racially diverse (as compared with many rural municipalities which are 99 percent Black African). In prior chapters I’ve described the substantial leveling of political rights across racial boundaries and the partial but very far from complete effort to reduce the material gaps in racial inequality. In each case, legacies still overshadow modern efforts. And not surprisingly, all of this, alongside awareness of the country’s political history, contributes to suspicion and lack of trust across groups, and between citizens and the state. For Americans, the story will sound eerily familiar, especially since we have a longer history of anti-discrimination policy, and yet racial inequalities and evidence of the pernicious effects of discrimination remain powerful and everyday features of life in our society. Nonetheless, given the starting point of the late 1980s and early 1990s, there’s been measurable progress in race relations and even nation-building under democratic government. Consider first the situation of Mogale City: for my Historical Memories Survey, one criterion for inclusion in the study was that the respondents had to have actually lived through at least a few years of Apartheid and its aftermath. I asked them to compare their present life (in 2019) to what it was like under Apartheid, specifically in terms of how they were treated by people from other race groups. A full 47 percent of Black respondents said they were treated better now, while 23 percent said worse now, and 24 percent said things had not changed.28 Of those who said everyday life had improved on this dimension, many adopted a stance similar to the one advanced by the three pastors: Don’t lose sight of how things once were. I asked about their hopes pre-1994 and their reflections on the period 1994–99, and unprompted, a great many referred to their optimism and subsequent happiness about not having to carry a “dompas” or pass. “When Mr. Nelson was out of jail he made sure that there was no violence, we stopped carrying dompas, our identity documents changed, and we were allowed to vote.” “We could all walk around free without carrying any dompas.” “We are not slaves, we have a choice not to be slaves or work as domestic workers. We walk free in our streets without carrying a dompas and we can enter any restaurants.” Understandably, for many others, merely being “free from slavery” in the sense of the end of draconian Apartheid legislation was too low a bar to celebrate. Many expected more, and received less, especially in the early years of the transition. For example, in an extended interview, Pamela Esso, who in her activist youth and participation in the Soweto uprising was hopeful for change, recalled that she continued to experience harsh discrimination in the area even into the 1990s, as the country underwent its transition. After years of hard work as a government-employed nurse, she wanted her family to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle. In 1992, about a year after the removal of the Group Areas Act that restricted where Blacks could live and own property, Esso decided to build a house from scratch in a Krugersdorp suburb. She could afford a place with all of the modern amenities and wanted to live in an area that was fully serviced by the municipality and among neighbors. Esso knew that they would be living around White people, mostly Afrikaners—in fact, they would be the very first Black family in the neighborhood—but she was not deterred. When the Essos finally moved in, the neighbors didn’t show up with welcoming meals. And she did not receive any invitations to visit anyone in their homes. Instead, her house was repeatedly robbed and vandalized, and neighbors called her and her family names. Local kids harassed her children on the way to school, once they arrived at school, and on their way back home. Esso told me this story while sitting beside her adult daughter, who nodded and grimaced as she was reminded of this painful past. By the late 1990s, some of the hostility seemed to subside. But her family never felt welcome. Esso told me she could not recall instances of White South Africans being kind to her. Her account was by no means unique: various Black political leaders, activists, and ordinary citizens, particularly around Mogale City, highlighted to me how at every turn, their intelligence and integrity were questioned by Whites, including work colleagues. In my survey, many Black residents said they perceived enduring resentment from Whites, and that Whites did not view them as being fully human: “Fear divides Black and White because most White people fear that Black people are monkeys and we are full of ourselves.”—42-year-old woman in Ward 4 “We are divided because of color of skin. White people have better jobs and even if we have the same position at work they earn more money than Blacks.”—44-year-old woman in Ward 27 “Life between Black and White is different because of culture they have and they hate the Black people’s culture.”—63-year-old man in Ward 4 “Apartheid has played a role in a division of South Africans—for example, you can’t eat with a White person in the same table because they are disgusted by Black people, they call Black people pigs.”—49-year-old man in Ward 26 For the most part, Black South Africans recalled the period before democracy as one filled with painful and fraught memories, disrespect and discrimination. But there were exceptions, and Black South Africans who lived through Apartheid recalled a wide range of experiences. For example, Bobie Tlapu, a fiery Black EFF councillor in his sixties, spoke of being treated like a family member on a White farm. And some, like the Black DA councillor Margaret Mohube, described frustration with the violent nature of the anti-Apartheid struggle even as she supported the goals of the political activists. Whites described their frustrations with the state of race relations, but from a very different perspective. If there were ever a spirit of White regret for Apartheid and hopeful reconciliation around Mogale City, it was not palpable to me in 2019. In interviews and more casual conversations, many bristled at the very premise that racial prejudice directed at Blacks was a concern worth exploring further; and if anything, the tables had turned. Younger (White) adults were quick to point out, “This was not our fault. Why are we being blamed?” In terms of older adults, it is so difficult to find anyone willing to admit they ever supported Apartheid that one might conclude that this whole set of institutions was forced on them by an out-of-touch, alien government. Amanda de Lange, a Freedom Front Plus councillor, described in an interview with me her recollection of the past with memories distinct from the ones Black citizens shared: From the mid-1970s, I grew up in the countryside. We were very innocent and naive. We were still friends on the farms with the Black children. My best friends were Black boys and girls; when I visited my grandparents’ farm, we had fun, we did naughty things and we were all over the farm. I didn’t have White friends at that stage … I didn’t understand where all of these political issues came from. I didn’t get this Apartheid thing and “you guys are oppressing us.” Then this thing came up, and people were spending a lot of time on it, and there was a lot of upheaval in those years. Then we got blamed … for this Up until this day, I feel like we are blamed for things, we were dead good country folks … we don’t all understand this. I heard similar sentiments time and again from Whites. Jacqueline Pannall, a DA councillor, said that her father’s workers “were like our family. We never saw color. We weren’t raised to see color.” Most White South Africans conceded that Blacks were once treated unfairly, but they also argued that the time had come to stop demanding apologies or for their privileged position in the present. And they routinely recounted, “We were not racist.” Such views echoed the White responses to a nationwide survey fielded in late 2016, asking, “Which one of the following categories best describes you when thinking about the injustices of South Africa’s past?” Among Whites born in 1970 or earlier (and thus aged twenty or older at the time De Klerk released Mandela), less than one-third accepted the notion of racial privilege, which included 5 percent who described themselves as “Perpetrators,” 22 percent as “Bystanders,” and 6 percent as “Beneficiaries.” As for the rest, 15 percent said they were “Victims,” 10 percent were “Resisters,” and 41 percent said they could not be described by any of those terms.29 In a survey the previous year, a full 31 percent of Whites said they felt racially discriminated against “often” or “always”—as compared with 12 percent of Black Africans who reported discrimination in the current dispensation.30 In Mogale, the White respondents amplified this point:31 “Race is the biggest divide. The government forces racial hatred on the public.”—54-year-old man in Ward 22 “The biggest divide is the BEE policy [affirmative action] because it excludes other races in the country.”—53-year-old man in Ward 32 “Black people want to exterminate White people.”—46-year-old woman in Ward 17 “Black people cannot tolerate White people.”—63-year-old woman in Ward 22 White South Africans continue to command more power and more external attention than their size in the population would warrant, and I recognize that I may be perpetuating this pattern by the extent of attention they receive in the pages of this book. However, like in other countries with economically dominant minorities,32 the advent of democracy invited theoretical and quite practical questions of whether they would be ruthlessly targeted in a post-Apartheid dispensation and/or act as spoilers. Indeed, as I discussed earlier, many Whites in Mogale City actually expected some form of coordinated revenge for the past and/or worried about total political domination under multiracial democracy. More recently, survey responses, interviews, and reports in the media all point to a common refrain: a large share of Whites feel aggrieved in the New South Africa. Many, and certainly in Mogale City, prefer what was to what is. This is not entirely surprising given that 1994 marked a stark reversal of political fortune in terms of relative power and influence. To be sure, the post-Apartheid government has implemented a number of policies to favor Black Africans. Like the young man I met on his way to the voting booth in May 2019, many others say that were it not for their skin color, they would have much greater opportunities in terms of university acceptance, jobs, and other areas. But is that unfair? Of course, fairness, like success, is in the eye of the beholder. In Mogale City, and in most other parts of the country, many White South Africans complain that they pay high taxes and yet must also pay for private security and sometimes for essentially private provision of other services, such as personal generators. Moreover, they point to being unfairly targeted as victims of violence and generally ignored by government. Like several other relatively privileged minorities in the world—including Catalans in Spain and certain sections of the White population in the United States—they too are essentially making claims for greater respect for their dignity. Representing the most conservative and largely Afrikaner segment of the population, Afriforum is an organization that has tried to raise such concerns, as well as related issues of Afrikaner dignity. It has argued against changing place-names (for example, from Pretoria to Tshwane) and removing Afrikaner statues. Their complaints have sometimes gained the sympathies of White nationalists in other countries, including the prize of a coveted tweet from President Donald Trump in August 2018. He expressed concern that large-scale killings of White farmers and takeovers of their farms needed to be investigated.33 Afriforum’s active media campaigns have helped to reinforce a conventional wisdom among a broader White population that they have been unduly victimized since the end of Apartheid, and especially in recent years. Undoubtedly, there have been some brutal and tragic murders of White farmers, and there have been several notable land invasions.34 Yet, it’s also hard to ignore the bigger picture that by and large, White South Africans have been extremely fortunate in the post-Apartheid dispensation, and their collective complaints are vastly disproportionate to realities. They continue to enjoy an enormously high quality of life and have paid a relatively minimal price in terms of net material transfers. Despite the grave atrocities committed by the White government and many within society, they were offered a truth and reconciliation process, not large-scale revenge. And compared with the extent of crime and violence that Black Africans face, the reality for White South Africans is one of relative security. Of the 20,000 murders recorded in the year prior to Trump’s tweet, just 46 were White people killed on farms.35 One study highlights the ways in which Afriforum managed to gain outsized domestic attention to a statistically very rarely occurring phenomenon by effectively rebroadcasting brutal imagery.36 Post-Apartheid governments have actually protected Whites in various ways. Several instances of anti-White and anti-Afrikaner hate speech have received enormous media attention, have been condemned by the SA Human Rights Commission and other bodies, and, in a few rare occasions, have been sanctioned or punished.37 In Mogale City, where a disproportionately large share of the country’s otherwise very small poor White population resides, the government has provided the same social protections, including RDP houses, that Black South Africans receive. In short, it would be very hard to maintain the argument that the dignity of White South Africans has been substantially disrespected during the era of multiracial democracy. Moreover, notwithstanding these sentiments, we still must ask, has there been change in terms of intergroup relations? Both in terms of attitudes and behaviors, I think the answer, unequivocally, is yes. For example, Gauteng residents were asked in a survey whether “interracial dating/marriage is acceptable.” In Mogale City, 66 percent of Whites agreed, while a sizable, but much smaller 18 percent disagreed with the proposition. The very foundations of Apartheid were built on the notion that Whites and Blacks were so different, they were almost different species. Now, about two-thirds of Whites were rejecting this premise. Meanwhile, 79 percent of Blacks agreed and 12 percent disagreed that interracial marriage was acceptable.38 By comparison, in the United States in 2009, just 63 percent of all Americans, and 61 percent of Whites, said they would be “fine if a family member were married to someone of a different race/ethnicity.”39 Relatedly, for over three decades, the World Values Survey has been asking citizens around the world to identify “who would you not like to have as a neighbor.” And when they were interviewed in 1982, as shown in figure 8.2, more than 40 percent of a representative sample of South African Whites said “someone from a different race group.” That statistic dropped dramatically to 13 percent in 1996 and has gone up and down since, but it has certainly remained well below the Apartheid-era level of widespread animosity. While just over 10 percent of Black South Africans mentioned someone of another race in 1982, that figure increased somewhat, peaking at 28 percent of Blacks mentioning this bigoted preference in 2001, but by 2006, this dropped to a historic low of 8 percent, and then went back up to 19 percent in 2013. While Black intolerance has increased markedly, and should not be ignored, it is also not nearly as widespread as White racial intolerance twenty-five years earlier. Even among people from whom one might have expected resentment, contemporary attitudes can be surprisingly embracing of the other. Eunice Sagathle was an activist with the anti-Apartheid UDF and detained in 1986 at the age of fourteen at Krugersdorp Prison for a year and a half. By the mid-1980s, thousands of young people under the age of eighteen, some as young as ten years old, were similarly imprisoned and treated like adults.40 Nonetheless, she went on to get an education, including as a student at the University of Bophuthatswana, and took advantage of an opportunity to participate in a student exchange program in Norway. When I spoke with her in 2019, she was working in the Mogale administration after many years serving as a local councillor. As an ANC member, she described the challenges her party faces, but I was surprised by her response when I asked her about the (White) opposition: “I must say I like them, they are not like [at the national level]. They are very passionate about the development of the city. As the Speaker, I had a good working relationship with them. Even now I have a good working relationship with them.” FIGURE 8.2. Aversion to having a neighbor of a different race in South Africa (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi and Afrob_2015. In practice, intergroup tolerance and acceptance is largely practiced at arm’s length, and multiracial families are still very much the exception. For example, analyzing the composition of households included in a nationally representative survey from 2016, I found that just under 4 percent included at least one pair of related individuals from different race groups; and of that, most mixed households only included people of color (i.e., Black Africans, Coloureds, or Indian/Asians).41 What about national sentiment? Do South Africans increasingly see themselves as part of one nation? A “rainbow nation”? That is, a political community tied to the South African state in which diversity of background and culture is shared and mutually respected among its members. If Apartheid implied the separation of race and (Black) language groups, has there been a coming together at least in terms of a shared attachment to the larger nation? It wasn’t completely crazy to think that this was possible—recall that English and Afrikaners fought a bloody and bitter war at the turn of the twentieth century, and despite lingering cultural chauvinism, most Whites came to see themselves as part of a shared (White) nation within a few decades. FIGURE 8.3. Pride in being South African (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi. Note: 4-point response scale recoded to 0–1, with 1 representing “very proud.” Lines depict average scores by race group. Over the course of six waves of the World Values Survey, respondents were asked, “Are you proud to be South African?” As shown in figure 8.3, White and Black South Africans trended in exactly opposite directions for the history of the survey. As one might expect,42 very few Black South Africans reported feeling proud in the first survey in 1982 (just 36 percent saying “very proud” as compared with 75 percent of Whites). In 1990, similar proportions of both groups said they were very proud. More Blacks tended to increase to a peak of 81 percent in 2006, falling to 68 percent in 2013. By 2013, over 80 percent of Whites and over 90 percent of Black Africans said they were “proud” or “very proud.” Notwithstanding some ups and downs, that might seem to be quite a strong showing for the nation-building project. To be fair, when asked this way, the question allows citizens to think about the South African nation however they want—and not necessarily as the multiracial nation envisioned in the constitution, let alone by Desmond Tutu. Twenty-five years after Mandela’s election, in my survey of Mogale residents, I asked respondents to reflect on this question: “Let’s talk about what it means to be a South African. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once talked about the idea of a Rainbow Nation in South Africa. For some people, this meant a coming together and unity of people from different languages and races. Which of the following statements BEST approximates your view?” The answer was clear: the most ambitious ideals of multiracial nation-building had not yet been realized. Only 28 percent of those interviewed said that Tutu’s ideal had been realized or might be relatively soon. By contrast, “I am not convinced that South Africans can ever come together to be a rainbow nation” was the preferred response for 31 percent of the sample. Nevertheless, there were more doubters and fewer optimists in a national sample of South African public opinion in 1994, when 36 percent said the country would continue to be comprised of different nations. Although Black Africans were much more optimistic than Whites in the earlier, national sample, in the 2019 survey of Mogale residents, the distribution of answers was extremely similar across race groups.43 South African citizens seem to feel attached to the country—and perhaps it is this very attachment that has made political contests such high-stakes endeavors. For example, one survey asked, “Do you agree or disagree with the following—‘I would rather be a citizen of South Africa than of any other country in the world.’ ” Reference to “country” is clearly different from reference to a “people” or “nation” but still reflects a commentary on the collective, and 85 percent of those surveyed agreed, including 69 percent of Whites, who have been most likely to leave South Africa for other shores.44 Respect for the Dignity of Women? While I have mostly focused on concerns about racial and income/class inequalities, I think most observers would agree that South Africa has long been a male-dominated society. The country’s extreme brand of institutionalized White supremacy involved the explicit control of sexuality and gender relations, which contributed to a more thoroughgoing form of patriarchy. This was most obvious in various laws prohibiting marriage and sexual relations across the color bar throughout the twentieth century. Different laws and penalties for men and women who violated those laws were also reflected in different social norms and expectations across gender lines. Income, power, status, and wealth all accrued disproportionately to men. Even comparatively, White South Africa was a laggard compared to some of its peers: White women were only granted the right to vote in 1930—well after suffrage was achieved by women in the settler societies of New Zealand (1893), Australia (1901), Canada (1918; but only for federal elections), and the United States (1920). The first woman, Leila Reitz, was elected to the House of Assembly in 1933, and Helen Suzman,45 who served as a Member of Parliament for thirty-six years, was an outspoken voice against Apartheid. In both cases, those women spent several years as the only women in an otherwise all-male assembly. The liberation movement arguably made some significant gains with respect to female empowerment. Various women’s organizations were founded throughout the decades of Apartheid, some multiracial, some not. For example, the Black Women’s Federation was created with inspiration from the Black Consciousness movement in 1975, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela served as an executive member. Women across racial groups and socioeconomic classes played pivotal roles in the struggle against racial inequality, dating back to struggles against the pass system in the early 1910s, and these were recognized by key liberation leaders.46 Nonetheless, Apartheid left a gendered legacy of poverty in South Africa,47 and the fight for gender equality was consistently subordinated to that for racial equality until the late 1980s.48 Women were only granted full membership in the ANC at the time the organization’s Women’s League (ANCWL) was founded in 1943. And although a multiracial coalition of women helped draft an initial Women’s Charter that called for the removal of all laws and customs denying equal rights to women in anticipation of the Congress of the People in 1955,49 they were often relegated to secondary roles within movements.50 The political transition ushered in during the early 1990s provided a clear opening to make needed change. And once again channeling language from the Freedom Charter, the authors of the 1996 constitution declared the republic to be founded on not just the values of human dignity and non-racialism but also non-sexism. In turn, various institutions were established with the explicit goal of “mainstreaming” gender issues into South Africa’s legislation and public policies.51 Reflecting today on the record, the results are similar to what I’ve described along the racial dimension: progress has been significant, clearly more rapid and thoroughgoing than during any other period in South African history. Perhaps most notably, after almost a century of virtually all-male legislatures, following the 1994 election, 111 (of 400) women were seated in Parliament. Many went on to have a considerable impact on substantive policy issues and legislation.52 As the ANC was the only political party with a gender quota at the time, it accounted for 90 (81.1 percent) of these seats.53 Women’s representation in Parliament has been amplified in the form of parliamentary committees including, for example, the establishment of the Women’s Budget Initiative, which pushed for government ministries to consider gender issues in the formulation of their budgets.54 By 2019, South Africa ranked tenth among all countries in the world in terms of the number of women in Parliament.55 As shown in figure 8.4, under Apartheid, South Africa truly lagged in terms of rates of female political empowerment, particularly compared with other Upper-middle-income countries. When considering female political empowerment—measured in terms of women’s civil liberties, civil society participation, and descriptive representation in political positions—the South African record shot up in 1994 and stayed very high relative to the rest of the countries. Similarly, in terms of gender-based exclusion—denial of access to services or participation based on gender identity—again, South Africa compares particularly favorably relative to other countries, but only beginning in 1994. In 2019, South Africa ranked 66th out of 167 countries on the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security overall empowerment index, virtually tied with Namibia, Mauritius, and Rwanda as the overall leaders for Africa, a region that otherwise populates most of the bottom rankings internationally.56 FIGURE 8.4. Female political empowerment scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. These broad patterns belie important caveats and remaining concerns. Scholars have frequently found that because of lack of resources and/or insufficient commitment within government agencies, the impact of gender oversight commissions is often limited.57 And the country’s electoral system ensures that parliamentarians are vulnerable to party discipline, which limits the substantive ability of female parliamentarians to strike out on their own without the blessing of generally male-dominated party leadership. And following South Africa’s democratic transition, the women’s movement became increasingly fragmented and demobilized due both to the recruitment of its most competent leaders to the political system and to the ANC Women’s League’s declining prominence.58 And while it is true that at least a few female politicians can be found in the upper rungs in all of the leading parties, nationally and in Mogale City, top leadership remains a very male-dominated club, and the country has yet to seriously consider a woman for the position of state president. These facts are not lost on the female politicians in Mogale City, including Noluthando Mangole, the Black ANC Speaker; Eunice Segatlhe, the Black former ANC Speaker and current government bureaucrat; Amanda de Lange, the White Afrikaans-speaking FF+ councillor; or Sharon Govindasamy, an Indian DA councillor. In so many ways, these women could not be more different in terms of their personal backgrounds and policy preferences. But in my separate conversations with them, they each had remarkably similar responses to my line of inquiry on at least one question: that is, on the issue of how they are treated as women within their parties and in South African society. Mangole was born and raised in Munsieville. At council meetings, she is responsible for keeping meetings in order and councillors in line, following rules of debate, and so forth and has a commanding presence in the chamber. Despite being in the number two position in council, she worried about what she saw as reversing trends in gender parity: Remember that the gender issue was brought by the ANC Women’s League into government.… But that discussion is also now fading away. The ANC took a decision that said in the deployment you can have 50–50 or can have 60–40 in favor of women. But that is fading away. For example, [look at] the ANC outcomes of elections in 2017, you see one female and five males. When you would have expected at least three females, three males. It’s about power relations. Segatlhe, also from Munsieville, decried the problem of men sidelining outspoken women. In politics, nowadays when you are vocal, when you can stand your ground, if you are principled, they put her aside, “she talks too much,” they just put you there, “she thinks she is educated,” they just put you there, and it is such a pity, because even those women who are in leadership positions today here, you’ll find that they are there, but not there, because their male counterparts are telling them when to speak and when to raise issues which is so unfortunate.… Lots and lots of female leaders that are unemployed with degrees and because they are independent thinkers they are sidelined. De Lange similarly told a story of unfinished business. Despite representing a small, minority party, she cast a strong presence in local politics, speaking often in meetings and writing to the Krugersdorp News on a regular basis. Nonetheless, she highlighted a male-dominated culture within the party that creates a “glass ceiling” for competent female leaders. The FF+, being the conservative party that it is, stemmed mainly from the male fraternity and I think it’s always been like that. There have always been good and competent women, but they never wound up in the structures or the senior positions, leadership positions. Only of late, since the rest of the country and the opposition parties started to push women forward, that the awareness was created, that we needed to move with it, because we were still seen as a men’s party, or a party where men featured and men ruled. Before me, there were many women who were very good and they sort of just dwindled away … I do find still that some of the very senior leadership is still not acceptable to the fact, that I am not just a woman, but outspoken and decisive, and I come with my ideas and it should be incorporated because of the merits, and not declined because it’s a woman who brings it to the table. It is still difficult, yes. She argued for a greater representation of women in the seats of power toward better ends. I certainly feel that if we had more women in senior positions in this country, matters would have been much more stabilized because women just bring a sense of stability in any community and any organization. It’s just because, and I don’t want to generalize, but I think history has taught us that men are more inclined to go for war, whereas women are more level-headed. Again I don’t want to generalize, I just think women bring more stability. I’ve seen it in places where I’ve worked. I’ve seen it everywhere. I do believe if we could have more women and stronger women in power we could definitely see a lot of changes in this country. And as for Govindasamy, another woman who described for me a very full daily agenda in her work as a PR councillor and was active in her home ward of Azaadville, she largely echoed the views of her councillor colleagues from rival parties. In some ways, this was most surprising, as the DA has had a woman as its national leader (Helen Zille), and the Mogale City local leadership of her party is also largely female. But she said that when it comes time to make decisions around advancement, male perspectives dominate: “I think we are being downplayed in South Africa. [There are] more women as councillors, but more men are promoted to status positions. It’s tough being a woman in politics.” Beyond questions of political leadership, in recent years, concerns for the dignity of women have come to the fore as various activists have tried to shine a light on gender-based violence. As just one example, the 2019 rape and murder of a university student set off a wave of protest marches and demonstrations across the country. In turn, more perpetrators of such violence are being held accountable, and the critical issue has attracted unprecedented attention from government and society. Both the ANC and the DA included mention of gender-based violence in their respective 2019 election manifestoes. But the problem of this highly prevalent and grave indignity is very far from being solved. (Lack of) Respect for the Dignity of Foreigners While the post-Apartheid South African governments have clearly and deliberately pursued far more inclusionary approaches than any of their predecessors, almost any nation-building process inevitably bumps up against a difficult problem: the task of defining who is South African, entitled to the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and who is not. And just as countries around the world have, in recent years, been forced to reconsider how open or closed they would like to be with respect to people traveling across borders in search of new opportunities, so too have the South Africans. In practice, the country has not been regarded as very welcoming, to say the least. Throughout South Africa’s history, various attempts to build harmony, solidarity, or nationhood among some have accompanied the harsh exclusion of others. When Paul Kruger and his Voortrekkers arrived in the area around what would become Mogale City, to build their Afrikaner community, they used force to relegate a group of Black Africans—the Ndebele—to an area that would later become Zimbabwe. When Kruger tried to build the South African Republic as a sovereign state for Afrikaners, he despaired of the British, American, and other foreigners who came in search of gold. And sustained interest in that gold was at the root of a war that generated concentration camps and graves, again, a short walk from where I was sitting having coffee with the three pastors. The new Union of South Africa, born in 1909, bridged intra-White divides alongside the near total exclusion of Black Africans, despite the fact that the latter constituted the overwhelming numerical majority in the region. And just as when foreigners flocked to the area in search of gold in the late nineteenth century, the end of Apartheid came to resemble another gold rush. Particularly given all of the advantages I have described with respect to the benefits of being South African relative to other countries, it is not surprising that so many Africans would come to their southern neighbor in search of better opportunities. Whatever challenges South Africans face, the situation in almost all of the rest of Africa is worse. This is most evident with respect to the Ndebele people in modern Zimbabwe. In fact, the founding king of the Matabele Kingdom (of the Zimbabwean Ndebele, also known as Northern Ndebele), Chief Mzilikazi, was himself from South Africa’s Zululand. Through conquest, he had settled in the area around modern Mogale City, especially in the Magaliesberg mountains. When the Afrikaners arrived during the Great Trek, they defeated Mzilikazi in military conflicts, forcing him and his Ndebele followers to retreat to the north. As far as I know, the modern South African state affords no special path for citizenship for these descendants, despite the fact that approximately one million culturally similar Ndebele live as South Africans today. Zimbabweans, and other Africans for that matter, came to be recognized as foreigners. Reports of violence targeted at foreign nationals emerged almost immediately after the country’s transition to democracy in 1994.59 The first, most notable outbreak was almost fourteen years later, on May 11, 2008, in Alexandra township, a place primarily known for its history of anti-Apartheid activism.60 Over the course of approximately two weeks, violence spread to other urban areas in the country61 and led to approximately 60 deaths—in addition to over 700 seriously injured and 100,000 displaced residents.62 Then-president Thabo Mbeki was widely criticized for his initial characterization of these attacks as random acts of criminality.63 The prevalence of xenophobic attitudes in South Africa was acknowledged as early as the late 1990s in government policy documents,64 and research carried out two decades later suggests that such violence became normalized.65 As in other places where anti-immigrant violence is rife, many theories have been advanced as to why, and there is no single answer, especially as the migrants themselves are quite varied in their origins and activities, as are the local contexts where they settle. Some migrants are perceived to be economic threats in competing for jobs and/or are resented for their success in building new businesses. Some are resented for their cultural differences, some for antisocial behavior. On a national survey conducted in 2015, 63 percent of South Africans said immigrants cause increases in crime; 44 percent said they bring disease; and 64 percent said they use up the country’s resources, again with little difference in the distribution of responses across race groups.66 Nationally, and certainly in Mogale City, citizens blame many of the long-standing challenges of the country on these foreigners—a blanket act of scapegoating. Along these lines, a few comments recorded on the Historical Memories Survey were quite typical of widespread sentiment: “Foreigners are a threat to us. All South Africans must stick together to keep them out.”—63-year-old White man from Ward 26 “Foreigners are selling drugs while Pakistanis are raping our kids, they take all our jobs and bring rotten food in South Africa.”—52-year-old Black woman from Ward 23 The editor of the Krugersdorp News said to me with respect to border security, “So many South Africans agree with Donald Trump … what he’s trying to do.” I gasped. A wall? The idea had not been seriously raised by any South African politicians. But on my survey of Mogale residents, I asked whether they agreed with this statement: “The Government must urgently secure the borders to keep out foreigners.” More than 70 percent of Whites and more than 70 percent of Blacks selected 10—fully agreed.67 The South African story resonates widely with other postcolonial accounts of growing intolerance of “others,” including in Rwanda and Ivory Coast. Tragically, the development of a sense of membership and belonging frequently goes hand in hand with efforts to exclude. Reconciliation: A Dream Deferred It would be easy to focus on a snapshot of human relations in South Africa and find much that is wanting relative to an ideal benchmark of universal respect for human dignity. Relatedly, South Africans in all their diversity have not yet cohered into a strong and inclusive nation. Nonetheless, a fair assessment of human relations and government-citizen relations during the democratic era reveals a profound set of transformations that ought not be taken for granted in a country that literally was at civil war along several dimensions in the years just prior to the 1994 election. Social boundaries that once appeared impenetrable are breaking down. Relative to generations of South Africans, frankly for the whole of modern history, those who have faced indignities because of who they are—for example, along the lines of race or gender—now have recourse in ways that were previously never available. South African government policy is also remarkably inclusive of members of the LGBTQ community, those with disabilities, and other groups. To a degree, these trends mirror those in other countries at approximately the same time, but it is worth noting that in many African countries, state leaders have strongly resisted greater tolerance and acceptance, particularly with respect to gender and sexual orientation. In South Africa’s democratic context, it became the first on the continent to legalize same-sex civil unions. And in no African country has there been more deliberate progress toward protecting respect for human dignity than in South Africa of the past quarter century. The end of Apartheid did not preordain that the country would become the leader it now is in the promotion of human rights in Africa, with unparalleled domestic capacity to monitor and to protect those rights on the part of government and nongovernment organizations. The ongoing quest to extend respect for human dignity and to raise the bar for what that implies has been enabled and fueled by democratic government and competitive politics.",

      "content": "8 Respect, Belonging, and Recognition IN EARLY FEBRUARY, still a few months before the 2019 election, I prepared for a meeting with three of Mogale City’s local religious leaders. Questions about basic service delivery were still very much on my mind. To what extent was the gap between poverty and prosperity being closed in terms of concrete outcomes such as housing, water, electricity, and jobs? Given the importance of religion in the lives of South Africans (three-quarters of citizens say that religion is important to them, as compared with 20 percent or lower in most European countries, China, and Japan)1 and the fact that religious leaders like Tutu and Chikane played such key roles in local and national politics, I was optimistic they could shed valuable light on the political history I was studying. I had contacted Rev. Armando Sontange of the Kagiso Presbyterian Church requesting an interview, and he offered to invite a few colleagues from other churches to join us for a discussion. We agreed to meet around 11 a.m. at the Mugg and Bean, South Africa’s most ubiquitous coffee chain, this one in the bustling Presidential Square shopping center in downtown Krugersdorp.2 Once we placed our orders and exchanged introductions, I threw out a softball question in the hopes of generating some responses: “How have basic housing conditions changed for your congregants during the past twenty-five years?” They nodded that indeed they had seen substantial improvements over this period, and they described aspects of the record I detailed in the previous chapter. Lots of upgrades, but still room for improvement. And always new people moving in. However, as we continued to engage in conversation, they urged me to redirect my focus. “It’s not just about material things,” Sontange said, “but about Ubuntu. About a human being human.” He and his colleagues took turns reminding me of earlier times, when Black people, irrespective of education or occupation, were confined to townships, their lives heavily controlled. For men like them, in their fifties, sixties, and older, the legalized caste-like system of Apartheid South Africa and the everyday indignities it perpetuated were still etched in their memories. They wanted to emphasize the fact that the apparent “normalcy” of three Black men having coffee with a White man in Krugersdorp should still be cherished as a stark departure from the past.3 The term “ubuntu” roughly translates to “humanness,” “humanity,” or “personhood” in several languages spoken in South Africa (Zulu, Xhosa, and Ndebele) and is most commonly associated with the Zulu proverb umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, which translates to “a person is a person through other persons.”4 The concept of ubuntu has been particularly influential in South Africa and in Zimbabwe owing to efforts to promote indigenous philosophies in the aftermath of White rule.5 Much like the analogous term “dignity,” ubuntu is an articulation of a core human value, one that demands moral obligations in various ways, including respect for others, the promotion of harmony, and the reduction of discord. Perhaps unique in their abilities to see through the noise of everyday life, the pastors collectively made the case that post-Apartheid South Africa had come much closer to realizing this ideal at least compared with what they had experienced before. At one point in our conversation, Rev. Monwabisi Moses, from the Kagiso Methodist Church, suggested that I look outside. A line of people moved slowly in pursuit of cash from the automated teller facing the parking lot just outside the Mugg and Bean. He explained that the line was long because the government had deposited social grants into their accounts via electronic transfer that morning. In a Socratic engagement, he asked if I noticed anything “interesting” about the line. FIGURE 8.1. Location of the Mugg and Bean at the President Hyper, Krugersdorp. Slightly embarrassed to always be focusing on race, I nonetheless offered up my first impression, “There’s that one White guy on line, otherwise comprised of Black people.” He nodded with a smile. “During Apartheid, [the line] would only be White people. You see that White guy, even if there were a queue, he would have had a preference. But not today.” At the time we spoke, I still had very little sense of where we were sitting—an artefact of being relatively new to the area and doggedly following the instructions delivered to me by my phone-as-navigational assistant. Just beyond the parking lot lay two sets of conflicting historical legacies with diametrically opposite messages for the core concerns we were discussing. On the one hand, we were less than half a kilometer from the town council’s Centennial Hall, where only a few decades earlier White local councillors had, time and again, voted to maintain the most petty of Apartheid’s discriminatory policies. Layered on top of residential segregation, as late as the 1980s, Krugersdorp still maintained racially separate restrooms. As one Black councillor recounted to me, when she came into town during the Apartheid years she had to use the “Nie Blankes” (Non-Whites) bus stop. The message of profound disrespect was clear and mortally insulting. On the other hand, we were also just eight miles from a 50,000-hectare tract of land, the Cradle of Humankind, which UNESCO declared to be a world heritage site. In 1947, the year before the onset of Apartheid, Robert Broom discovered fossils of early human ancestors of approximately 2.5 million years in vintage—artefacts that changed the way scientists understand the pattern of human development. And in December 1998, far within the depths of the Sterkfontein Caves on this land, located less than ten miles north of the Paardekraal Monument, another research team from Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand unearthed what would amount to the nearly complete skull of a 3.5-million-year-old human ancestor.6 The stunning on-site visitor center—only a decade old—argues strongly in favor of ubuntu philosophy: there is more that unites us in our common ancestry as humans than the superficiality of the various traits that seem to divide us. The idea of “race” that was almost fanatically developed on South African soil, with significant help from Europe and the Americas, is just one of many sources of human diversity. The Cradle offers scientific evidence of shared human origins—the types of facts that undergird calls for universal human rights and the ideal that all humans have inherent dignity, or value, and deserve to be accorded with commensurate levels of respect. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the bitter irony that the immediate dangers and long-term health consequences of the early excavations were disproportionately borne by Black mine workers, let alone the multiple ways in which Black people have been treated with profound disrespect in the area around the Cradle. And to this day, many Black Africans squat and reside in informal settlements on its outskirts, a legacy of the state’s historical lack of appreciation for equal human worth. The existential question—of what our shared humanity ought to mean in practice—thus looms particularly large in Mogale City. The removal of segregated coffee shops, segregated bus stops, and legalized Apartheid was just a starting point. Starting in 1994, South Africans from all of their diverse backgrounds proved they could vote together and select leaders peacefully. And the government began to close some gaps in service delivery. Yet, the fight to end Apartheid was not just about getting the vote, electricity, a flush toilet, or a job. The Freedom Charter, Nelson Mandela’s fiery “I am prepared to die” speech, and the new constitution all explicitly aspired to realize the goal of restoring human dignity. What is dignity, after all? I wanted to make sure I understood what the South Africans had in mind. So I decided to ask around. After our meeting at the Mugg and Bean, I asked Rev. Moses if I could come to his church in Kagiso to pilot the very Historical Memories Survey that I’ve been describing in the chapters of this book, and I would use that opportunity to ask this sample of citizens how they might define the term (in addition to trying out lots of other questions). I hired a young woman from his congregation—a recent university graduate—to work as a research assistant and to conduct interviews in English and Tswana. We posed the following question: “The constitution says that the Republic of South Africa is founded on the value of HUMAN DIGNITY. What does the word DIGNITY mean to you?” We only interviewed twenty-five congregants, a mix of men and women, all over the age of forty, and with few exceptions, their answers were overwhelmingly consistent: dignity is about respect and being valued. “Simply means we need to respect one another and have faith in each other and not be against each other.” “Dignity I would say is to have value to yourself, be respectful, respected wherever you are and be treated equally.” “Dignity to me means respecting other human beings, conducting myself in a manner that doesn’t undermine, discriminate any other human being. Ascribing to values, to norms that are acceptable in the society without undermining anyone.” Given the importance of respectful treatment as a goal and value, in this chapter, I reflect on patterns and trends in human relations during the democratic era. Because race was such a fundamental basis for exclusion and indignity during the period before democracy, I focus here on what the post-Apartheid governments did to try to improve social cohesion, integration, and unity across racial lines, and with what consequences. There are many other dimensions along which citizens in South Africa and elsewhere are frequently made to feel devalued, and I consider a few of those here—in particular, discrimination on the basis of gender and being a foreign national. Once again, a contemporary snapshot of South African society reveals many gaps and shortcomings in the extent of dignified treatment: ongoing racial discrimination, sexism, gender-based violence, and homophobia. And yet, the persistence of everyday headlines and political movements within South Africa to address these shortcomings also reminds us of the value of democracy at work. Individuals, organizations, and even government actors have been steadfastly attempting to transform a society that infamously set standards for forcing people to suffer indignities along so many dimensions in the decades prior to the democratic transition. Without losing sight of the remaining needs, we can also recognize that South Africa has made enormous strides in extending respect for human dignity and, in many ways, has become a global leader in the defense of human rights—and this can be traced to the institutions of the democratic dispensation and the ethos they engendered. Putting Ideals into Actions The idea that an ANC-led government would pursue a nation-building and human-rights agenda to address the country’s racist history had deep roots. The ANC cofounder, Sol Plaatje, espoused such values in his writing and newspapers and in his opposition to the Native Lands Act during the first decades of the twentieth century.7 Like so many of the aspirations of the democratic era, the 1955 Freedom Charter provided a written blueprint to overcome the racial hierarchy and other dimensions of intolerance: “All national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride; The preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime.… All shall enjoy equal human rights!” Forceful appeals to such values would nonetheless leave open the question of how they would be realized in practice. Important answers were revealed in the first years of the Mandela presidency: the enshrining of those values in the new constitution, promoting a new nation-building myth, holding a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, distributing new symbols that would recognize the role of liberation leaders, and developing a set of democratic institutions that would facilitate a more inclusive sense of nationhood. In fact, the totality of government-led initiatives to generate a more inclusive South African society, particularly during the first few years after the 1994 election, was extraordinary. It is hard to identify a government anywhere in the world that has been more deliberate in trying to recognize and to accommodate such a diverse citizenry, with keen attention to rights and respectful treatment. Among its many virtues, the 1996 constitution enumerated various protections to recognize the ubuntu ideal. And although the term “ubuntu” was mentioned explicitly only in the interim 1993 constitution, legal scholars have highlighted that the notion of “dignity” essentially implies a similar norm of respect for the value of all humans and of humanity.8 Section 39 of the constitution would direct courts to “promote the values that underlie an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.”9 And in 1995, the government launched its constitutionally mandated South African Human Rights Commission to raise awareness of, monitor, and seek to protect various human rights. Beyond these written ideals and protections, Munsieville’s favorite son, Desmond Tutu, stepped up to play a pivotal role in the promotion of solidarity in two key nation-building projects designed to further the goal of mutual respect. First, in 1994, Tutu coined the term “rainbow nation” to evoke a positive image of the diverse cultures coming together as one imagined community.10 He had previously described demonstrators of various races participating in a 1989 defiance campaign as the “rainbow people of God.”11 Mandela and other leaders invoked the Rainbow Nation idea, and at least for the first few years of post-Apartheid South Africa, they did so frequently. People on the outside—this author included—ate up the idea that a shared sense of collective identity could be forged in short order, particularly under the tutelage of a small band of Nobel Peace Prize–winning leaders. In a place where national identity had been so important as a legitimating basis for oppression, a new narrative was clearly necessary. Second, Tutu chaired the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), along with Alex Boraine as deputy (he cofounded IDASA, the institute that had hosted peace-building missions during Apartheid). The idea for an amnesty process was already enshrined in the provisional 1993 constitution, justified in ubuntu philosophy: The adoption of this Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South Africa to transcend the divisions and strife of the past, which generated gross violations of human rights, the transgression of humanitarian principles in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear, guilt and revenge. These can now be addressed on the basis that there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for victimisation. In turn, Boraine helped draft the 1995 Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act establishing the TRC, which began its hearings in 1996. The TRC hearings continued on while Amy and I lived in South Africa in 1997 and 1998, and for us, the weekly “Truth Commission Special Report,” hosted by the progressive journalist Max du Preez, was just about the most gripping television we could have imagined. Each week, we sat in front of our small television watching recaps of testimony from a wide cast of characters; and on a few occasions, when hearings were in Cape Town, I sat in the gallery transfixed. The drama frequently involved heavily Afrikaans-accented former government operatives recalling their role in often brutal interrogation and even torture—and then watching them face the families of victims describing their pain and the lasting scars. These hearings often, but not always, concluded with scenes of Black African families—usually, a mother or a grandmother—tearfully hugging the killers of their kin in acts of forgiveness.12 It was an attempt to restore a sense of humanity to people who had been either victims or perpetrators of tragically dehumanizing acts. The commission received 7,127 applications for amnesty, and it listened to and recorded 21,298 statements over a two-year period.13 To be granted amnesty, the commission needed to be persuaded that the acts were politically motivated and directed (which generally meant that they were tied to a specific organizational mission) and that the applicants provided full disclosure for all relevant acts.14 It ultimately granted amnesty in 849 cases and refused it in 5,392,15 almost 70 percent of which were refused because the acts were deemed to have no political objective,16 highlighting that this was not simply a pro forma process. For example, a group of policemen petitioned for amnesty for killing four Black men from Cradock—the birthplace of Paul Kruger—in 1985. The commission was not impressed with the sincerity of the apology or the claim on the part of the White police officers that the murders were either ordered or necessary to achieve their political ends, and their application for amnesty was denied.17 The TRC proved controversial, including with respect to concerns that perpetrators ought to face harsher justice, that victims deserved more generous reparations, and that the whole enterprise would cost a lot and change little. There was no shortage of people involved with the process, or who looked on from the outside, describing it as having been unhelpful and/or unfair.18 Such valid concerns notwithstanding, what would have been better? No amnesty process? A different one—like the Gacaca courts used in post-genocide Rwanda? Those also met a very mixed reaction from the citizenry.19 Indeed, the TRC might have carried out aspects of its mission in different ways. However, it was a central component of the transition and it is hard to imagine—given the history—how a peaceful transition could have moved forward without such a process. Along the way, the commission documented the inner details of a horrific history, and while it certainly did not equate the Apartheid crimes with those committed in the struggle for liberation, it served to acknowledge that many human rights violations also occurred in the latter. It implied a degree of give-and-take in assigning blame that was consistent with the compromising and conciliatory spirit Mandela and Tutu had each advocated. Outside the commission hearings, more visible symbols and iconic imagery inherited from before 1994 would also literally stand out all around the country as reminders of past indignities. They were in tension with the new values and composition of an integrated South Africa, and over the years, many actors have demanded deliberate responses. One strategy has been to transform and to create novel symbols of what it means to be South African. As I mentioned earlier, the national flag and the national anthem were reworked in time for Mandela’s inauguration. And at the finals of the Rugby World Cup in 1995, Mandela reappropriated the old South Africa’s Springbok symbol to be acceptable for the New South Africa. Beyond that, the faces of nightly television news, especially on the South African Broadcasting Company, would always depict the country’s racial diversity. National government media and publications have marketed the ideal of diversity, a strategy that has mostly been mirrored in the private sector as well. A related strategy has been to use museums as a vehicle for telling a new story about nationhood—for consumption by the outside world, visiting school groups, and the general population.20 When Amy and I were living in Cape Town in 1997–98, she worked in the education department of the South African National Gallery and observed curators and staff actively trying to project a more nuanced and diverse portrait of the new nation within the confines of a building that was just steps away from the national parliament. For example, the museum prominently displayed the Butcher Boys, an anti-Apartheid sculpture depicting three gruesome part-human, part-animal figures sitting on a bench. It was intended to critically highlight the banality of dehumanization that transpired under that regime. Fabricated in 1986 by Jane Alexander, the artwork had previously been displayed at Johannesburg’s Market Theater, a venue that managed to welcome multiracial audiences and even perform anti-Apartheid plays for many years before the end of the regime. In 1991, the National Gallery obtained the sculpture, moving it from the sphere of private protest to national treasure, embracing rejection of Apartheid as part of the new national narrative. Cape Town and Johannesburg were rising cosmopolitan cities, within which there was more elite consensus concerning the future direction of the country—at least in terms of disavowing its past. In other parts of the country, however, such reengineering proved to be more fraught. For example, Carolyn Holmes tellingly describes a duo of war memorial museums located at opposite ends of a river near the small town of Dundee in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The first, dedicated in 1947, tells the Afrikaner side of an 1838 battle, and the second, financed and dedicated by the government in 1998, tells the Zulu side. As she explains, even the literal creation of a physical bridge to cross the river and facilitate collective recognition of these perspectives has failed to integrate the predictably distinct sets of patrons who visit each.21 Located on the urban periphery, Mogale City also offers a set of sometimes contradictory messages in its museums. On the one hand, the national visitor’s center to the Cradle of Humankind is thoroughly modern in appearance and hews closely to the inclusive vision of the Freedom Charter and the constitution. Meanwhile, just a few doors away from the downtown Krugersdorp Chicken Licken and facing the Mogale City Hall is the municipality’s local museum, which appeared neglected and run-down when I visited. On display were multiple layers of national stories: one, constructed more recently and hastily, in which Black Africans rose up after a long period of victimhood; and one that was previously understood by Krugersdorpers as the only relevant history, that of White English and Afrikaners forging unity after a period of bitter conflict.22 Presented next to one another, these layers remained separate, as if two distinct histories—much like in Dundee. More frequently viewed than museum exhibitions is the everyday iconography of statues, monuments, and street and place names. In recent years, some White residents have decried the efforts to change names as a waste of time and money. Yet, it is worth recalling that even after the Boer War, at the start of the twentieth century, the victorious British similarly sought to alter the local symbology. For example, they anglicized some of the road and place names from the quintessentially Afrikaner—Kemp and Viljoen—to British ones, such as Tindall, Philips, and Tominson.23 The British also made efforts not to antagonize the previously defeated Afrikaners, and when Lord Chamberlain visited Krugersdorp, he offered to repair the war-time damage to the Paardekraal Monument, and town planning was increasingly implemented with an eye toward balance and fairness across the two White groups—for example, locating a sports ground in between Paardekraal and Coronation Park, respective symbols of Boer and British pride.24 The post-Apartheid government sought to more explicitly recognize iconic resistance leaders and other notable Black individuals, whose contribution to history had been made invisible under Apartheid. Very soon, Black South Africans would see themselves and their leaders in the form of statues and symbols, with their names and languages inscribed on the walls of buildings used in the business of government and on various street signs. A statue of the town’s namesake, the Batswana chief Mogale wa Mogale, stands between city hall and the local museum. Given the regime change, the question had to be raised concerning what to do about the White symbols, especially those closely associated with committing atrocities against Black people throughout the twentieth century and earlier. The approach to this sensitive task has varied to a degree across the country, no doubt a function of the demographics, sentiment, and organization of local populations. For example, Krugersdorp, within Mogale City, is still called Krugersdorp, named after Paul Kruger, whose very resentment of Black people and British abolition of slavery led him to take actions that set South Africa on its path toward extreme racial exclusion. Nationally, and in recent years, the figure most squarely in protesters’ crosshairs has been Cecil Rhodes. For university students in countries around the world, including South Africa, Rhodes’s name has long been associated with academic excellence: it is synonymous with the prestigious fellowship that allows students to study at Oxford. And one of South Africa’s leading universities also bears his name. Just as in the case of America’s Woodrow Wilson, Rhodes’s own history of racism turned out to be too profound to ignore, and owing to his involvement in education, his likeness has literally stared politically active students in the face throughout the post-Apartheid period. Starting in 2015, students at the University of Cape Town forcefully argued for removal of a prominent Rhodes statue. Some protesters flung human excrement at it.25 And it was eventually removed. The effort sparked protests around the country, loosely coordinated on social media with the slogan #Rhodesmustfall. It articulated the idea that respect for the dignity of Black South Africans means not having to look at his figure, literally elevated onto a pedestal. Not surprisingly, such protests have not been without controversy. Just as many American southerners have clung to symbols of the Confederate South, despite the clear offense to African Americans, many White South Africans still value symbols and figures of White icons as sources of pride. Within Mogale City, statues of Kruger and Rhodes can be viewed via a short trip on Voortrekker Drive or on roads named after Afrikaner leaders, Potgieter or Pretorius. Though gated to visitors, Paardekraal remains as a shrine to Afrikanerdom. Representatives from political parties such as the Freedom Front Plus say that these are a part of history and should be viewed as part of a cultural, not political, landscape. Perhaps given the greater numbers and influence of Whites in Mogale, and especially of Afrikaners—and their demonstrated commitment to this symbology—Rhodes and Kruger remained standing as of 2019. And while the efforts described above might be understood as consequences of the give-and-take of democratic practice, democracy itself has provided a powerful recognition of South Africa’s diverse society. In particular, the proportional representation electoral institutions have facilitated a strong degree of “descriptive” representation26—that is, where the racial (and gender) composition of legislatures resembles that of their constituents—at all levels of government. For example, after the 2016 election, approximately 18 percent of Mogale’s councillors were White, 4 percent Indian, and 78 percent Black African; and approximately one-third were women, which came much closer to the actual population demographics than any represented body ever in the history of the country. While it’s true that when Ramaphosa took office in 2017 he was the fifth Black African man from the ANC in a row to be president—a pattern that is likely to continue—the office has been held by individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds: Mandela and Mbeki were Xhosa, Motlanthe a Pedi, Zuma a Zulu, and Ramaphosa a Venda. Overcoming the Racial Divide? Such initiatives, policies, and practices could only encourage, not determine, how people in this divided society would treat one another and, in turn, whether they would feel respected and valued. Could deliberate efforts to reverse three and a half centuries of institutionalized racism create a respectful and unified nation within the span of twenty-five years? In a word, no.27 It is impossible to ignore the obvious: race is still the basis for huge social, political, and economic divides in South Africa, particularly in cities and on the urban periphery, which are racially diverse (as compared with many rural municipalities which are 99 percent Black African). In prior chapters I’ve described the substantial leveling of political rights across racial boundaries and the partial but very far from complete effort to reduce the material gaps in racial inequality. In each case, legacies still overshadow modern efforts. And not surprisingly, all of this, alongside awareness of the country’s political history, contributes to suspicion and lack of trust across groups, and between citizens and the state. For Americans, the story will sound eerily familiar, especially since we have a longer history of anti-discrimination policy, and yet racial inequalities and evidence of the pernicious effects of discrimination remain powerful and everyday features of life in our society. Nonetheless, given the starting point of the late 1980s and early 1990s, there’s been measurable progress in race relations and even nation-building under democratic government. Consider first the situation of Mogale City: for my Historical Memories Survey, one criterion for inclusion in the study was that the respondents had to have actually lived through at least a few years of Apartheid and its aftermath. I asked them to compare their present life (in 2019) to what it was like under Apartheid, specifically in terms of how they were treated by people from other race groups. A full 47 percent of Black respondents said they were treated better now, while 23 percent said worse now, and 24 percent said things had not changed.28 Of those who said everyday life had improved on this dimension, many adopted a stance similar to the one advanced by the three pastors: Don’t lose sight of how things once were. I asked about their hopes pre-1994 and their reflections on the period 1994–99, and unprompted, a great many referred to their optimism and subsequent happiness about not having to carry a “dompas” or pass. “When Mr. Nelson was out of jail he made sure that there was no violence, we stopped carrying dompas, our identity documents changed, and we were allowed to vote.” “We could all walk around free without carrying any dompas.” “We are not slaves, we have a choice not to be slaves or work as domestic workers. We walk free in our streets without carrying a dompas and we can enter any restaurants.” Understandably, for many others, merely being “free from slavery” in the sense of the end of draconian Apartheid legislation was too low a bar to celebrate. Many expected more, and received less, especially in the early years of the transition. For example, in an extended interview, Pamela Esso, who in her activist youth and participation in the Soweto uprising was hopeful for change, recalled that she continued to experience harsh discrimination in the area even into the 1990s, as the country underwent its transition. After years of hard work as a government-employed nurse, she wanted her family to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle. In 1992, about a year after the removal of the Group Areas Act that restricted where Blacks could live and own property, Esso decided to build a house from scratch in a Krugersdorp suburb. She could afford a place with all of the modern amenities and wanted to live in an area that was fully serviced by the municipality and among neighbors. Esso knew that they would be living around White people, mostly Afrikaners—in fact, they would be the very first Black family in the neighborhood—but she was not deterred. When the Essos finally moved in, the neighbors didn’t show up with welcoming meals. And she did not receive any invitations to visit anyone in their homes. Instead, her house was repeatedly robbed and vandalized, and neighbors called her and her family names. Local kids harassed her children on the way to school, once they arrived at school, and on their way back home. Esso told me this story while sitting beside her adult daughter, who nodded and grimaced as she was reminded of this painful past. By the late 1990s, some of the hostility seemed to subside. But her family never felt welcome. Esso told me she could not recall instances of White South Africans being kind to her. Her account was by no means unique: various Black political leaders, activists, and ordinary citizens, particularly around Mogale City, highlighted to me how at every turn, their intelligence and integrity were questioned by Whites, including work colleagues. In my survey, many Black residents said they perceived enduring resentment from Whites, and that Whites did not view them as being fully human: “Fear divides Black and White because most White people fear that Black people are monkeys and we are full of ourselves.”—42-year-old woman in Ward 4 “We are divided because of color of skin. White people have better jobs and even if we have the same position at work they earn more money than Blacks.”—44-year-old woman in Ward 27 “Life between Black and White is different because of culture they have and they hate the Black people’s culture.”—63-year-old man in Ward 4 “Apartheid has played a role in a division of South Africans—for example, you can’t eat with a White person in the same table because they are disgusted by Black people, they call Black people pigs.”—49-year-old man in Ward 26 For the most part, Black South Africans recalled the period before democracy as one filled with painful and fraught memories, disrespect and discrimination. But there were exceptions, and Black South Africans who lived through Apartheid recalled a wide range of experiences. For example, Bobie Tlapu, a fiery Black EFF councillor in his sixties, spoke of being treated like a family member on a White farm. And some, like the Black DA councillor Margaret Mohube, described frustration with the violent nature of the anti-Apartheid struggle even as she supported the goals of the political activists. Whites described their frustrations with the state of race relations, but from a very different perspective. If there were ever a spirit of White regret for Apartheid and hopeful reconciliation around Mogale City, it was not palpable to me in 2019. In interviews and more casual conversations, many bristled at the very premise that racial prejudice directed at Blacks was a concern worth exploring further; and if anything, the tables had turned. Younger (White) adults were quick to point out, “This was not our fault. Why are we being blamed?” In terms of older adults, it is so difficult to find anyone willing to admit they ever supported Apartheid that one might conclude that this whole set of institutions was forced on them by an out-of-touch, alien government. Amanda de Lange, a Freedom Front Plus councillor, described in an interview with me her recollection of the past with memories distinct from the ones Black citizens shared: From the mid-1970s, I grew up in the countryside. We were very innocent and naive. We were still friends on the farms with the Black children. My best friends were Black boys and girls; when I visited my grandparents’ farm, we had fun, we did naughty things and we were all over the farm. I didn’t have White friends at that stage … I didn’t understand where all of these political issues came from. I didn’t get this Apartheid thing and “you guys are oppressing us.” Then this thing came up, and people were spending a lot of time on it, and there was a lot of upheaval in those years. Then we got blamed … for this Up until this day, I feel like we are blamed for things, we were dead good country folks … we don’t all understand this. I heard similar sentiments time and again from Whites. Jacqueline Pannall, a DA councillor, said that her father’s workers “were like our family. We never saw color. We weren’t raised to see color.” Most White South Africans conceded that Blacks were once treated unfairly, but they also argued that the time had come to stop demanding apologies or for their privileged position in the present. And they routinely recounted, “We were not racist.” Such views echoed the White responses to a nationwide survey fielded in late 2016, asking, “Which one of the following categories best describes you when thinking about the injustices of South Africa’s past?” Among Whites born in 1970 or earlier (and thus aged twenty or older at the time De Klerk released Mandela), less than one-third accepted the notion of racial privilege, which included 5 percent who described themselves as “Perpetrators,” 22 percent as “Bystanders,” and 6 percent as “Beneficiaries.” As for the rest, 15 percent said they were “Victims,” 10 percent were “Resisters,” and 41 percent said they could not be described by any of those terms.29 In a survey the previous year, a full 31 percent of Whites said they felt racially discriminated against “often” or “always”—as compared with 12 percent of Black Africans who reported discrimination in the current dispensation.30 In Mogale, the White respondents amplified this point:31 “Race is the biggest divide. The government forces racial hatred on the public.”—54-year-old man in Ward 22 “The biggest divide is the BEE policy [affirmative action] because it excludes other races in the country.”—53-year-old man in Ward 32 “Black people want to exterminate White people.”—46-year-old woman in Ward 17 “Black people cannot tolerate White people.”—63-year-old woman in Ward 22 White South Africans continue to command more power and more external attention than their size in the population would warrant, and I recognize that I may be perpetuating this pattern by the extent of attention they receive in the pages of this book. However, like in other countries with economically dominant minorities,32 the advent of democracy invited theoretical and quite practical questions of whether they would be ruthlessly targeted in a post-Apartheid dispensation and/or act as spoilers. Indeed, as I discussed earlier, many Whites in Mogale City actually expected some form of coordinated revenge for the past and/or worried about total political domination under multiracial democracy. More recently, survey responses, interviews, and reports in the media all point to a common refrain: a large share of Whites feel aggrieved in the New South Africa. Many, and certainly in Mogale City, prefer what was to what is. This is not entirely surprising given that 1994 marked a stark reversal of political fortune in terms of relative power and influence. To be sure, the post-Apartheid government has implemented a number of policies to favor Black Africans. Like the young man I met on his way to the voting booth in May 2019, many others say that were it not for their skin color, they would have much greater opportunities in terms of university acceptance, jobs, and other areas. But is that unfair? Of course, fairness, like success, is in the eye of the beholder. In Mogale City, and in most other parts of the country, many White South Africans complain that they pay high taxes and yet must also pay for private security and sometimes for essentially private provision of other services, such as personal generators. Moreover, they point to being unfairly targeted as victims of violence and generally ignored by government. Like several other relatively privileged minorities in the world—including Catalans in Spain and certain sections of the White population in the United States—they too are essentially making claims for greater respect for their dignity. Representing the most conservative and largely Afrikaner segment of the population, Afriforum is an organization that has tried to raise such concerns, as well as related issues of Afrikaner dignity. It has argued against changing place-names (for example, from Pretoria to Tshwane) and removing Afrikaner statues. Their complaints have sometimes gained the sympathies of White nationalists in other countries, including the prize of a coveted tweet from President Donald Trump in August 2018. He expressed concern that large-scale killings of White farmers and takeovers of their farms needed to be investigated.33 Afriforum’s active media campaigns have helped to reinforce a conventional wisdom among a broader White population that they have been unduly victimized since the end of Apartheid, and especially in recent years. Undoubtedly, there have been some brutal and tragic murders of White farmers, and there have been several notable land invasions.34 Yet, it’s also hard to ignore the bigger picture that by and large, White South Africans have been extremely fortunate in the post-Apartheid dispensation, and their collective complaints are vastly disproportionate to realities. They continue to enjoy an enormously high quality of life and have paid a relatively minimal price in terms of net material transfers. Despite the grave atrocities committed by the White government and many within society, they were offered a truth and reconciliation process, not large-scale revenge. And compared with the extent of crime and violence that Black Africans face, the reality for White South Africans is one of relative security. Of the 20,000 murders recorded in the year prior to Trump’s tweet, just 46 were White people killed on farms.35 One study highlights the ways in which Afriforum managed to gain outsized domestic attention to a statistically very rarely occurring phenomenon by effectively rebroadcasting brutal imagery.36 Post-Apartheid governments have actually protected Whites in various ways. Several instances of anti-White and anti-Afrikaner hate speech have received enormous media attention, have been condemned by the SA Human Rights Commission and other bodies, and, in a few rare occasions, have been sanctioned or punished.37 In Mogale City, where a disproportionately large share of the country’s otherwise very small poor White population resides, the government has provided the same social protections, including RDP houses, that Black South Africans receive. In short, it would be very hard to maintain the argument that the dignity of White South Africans has been substantially disrespected during the era of multiracial democracy. Moreover, notwithstanding these sentiments, we still must ask, has there been change in terms of intergroup relations? Both in terms of attitudes and behaviors, I think the answer, unequivocally, is yes. For example, Gauteng residents were asked in a survey whether “interracial dating/marriage is acceptable.” In Mogale City, 66 percent of Whites agreed, while a sizable, but much smaller 18 percent disagreed with the proposition. The very foundations of Apartheid were built on the notion that Whites and Blacks were so different, they were almost different species. Now, about two-thirds of Whites were rejecting this premise. Meanwhile, 79 percent of Blacks agreed and 12 percent disagreed that interracial marriage was acceptable.38 By comparison, in the United States in 2009, just 63 percent of all Americans, and 61 percent of Whites, said they would be “fine if a family member were married to someone of a different race/ethnicity.”39 Relatedly, for over three decades, the World Values Survey has been asking citizens around the world to identify “who would you not like to have as a neighbor.” And when they were interviewed in 1982, as shown in figure 8.2, more than 40 percent of a representative sample of South African Whites said “someone from a different race group.” That statistic dropped dramatically to 13 percent in 1996 and has gone up and down since, but it has certainly remained well below the Apartheid-era level of widespread animosity. While just over 10 percent of Black South Africans mentioned someone of another race in 1982, that figure increased somewhat, peaking at 28 percent of Blacks mentioning this bigoted preference in 2001, but by 2006, this dropped to a historic low of 8 percent, and then went back up to 19 percent in 2013. While Black intolerance has increased markedly, and should not be ignored, it is also not nearly as widespread as White racial intolerance twenty-five years earlier. Even among people from whom one might have expected resentment, contemporary attitudes can be surprisingly embracing of the other. Eunice Sagathle was an activist with the anti-Apartheid UDF and detained in 1986 at the age of fourteen at Krugersdorp Prison for a year and a half. By the mid-1980s, thousands of young people under the age of eighteen, some as young as ten years old, were similarly imprisoned and treated like adults.40 Nonetheless, she went on to get an education, including as a student at the University of Bophuthatswana, and took advantage of an opportunity to participate in a student exchange program in Norway. When I spoke with her in 2019, she was working in the Mogale administration after many years serving as a local councillor. As an ANC member, she described the challenges her party faces, but I was surprised by her response when I asked her about the (White) opposition: “I must say I like them, they are not like [at the national level]. They are very passionate about the development of the city. As the Speaker, I had a good working relationship with them. Even now I have a good working relationship with them.” FIGURE 8.2. Aversion to having a neighbor of a different race in South Africa (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi and Afrob_2015. In practice, intergroup tolerance and acceptance is largely practiced at arm’s length, and multiracial families are still very much the exception. For example, analyzing the composition of households included in a nationally representative survey from 2016, I found that just under 4 percent included at least one pair of related individuals from different race groups; and of that, most mixed households only included people of color (i.e., Black Africans, Coloureds, or Indian/Asians).41 What about national sentiment? Do South Africans increasingly see themselves as part of one nation? A “rainbow nation”? That is, a political community tied to the South African state in which diversity of background and culture is shared and mutually respected among its members. If Apartheid implied the separation of race and (Black) language groups, has there been a coming together at least in terms of a shared attachment to the larger nation? It wasn’t completely crazy to think that this was possible—recall that English and Afrikaners fought a bloody and bitter war at the turn of the twentieth century, and despite lingering cultural chauvinism, most Whites came to see themselves as part of a shared (White) nation within a few decades. FIGURE 8.3. Pride in being South African (1982–2015). Source: Author analyses of WVS_multi. Note: 4-point response scale recoded to 0–1, with 1 representing “very proud.” Lines depict average scores by race group. Over the course of six waves of the World Values Survey, respondents were asked, “Are you proud to be South African?” As shown in figure 8.3, White and Black South Africans trended in exactly opposite directions for the history of the survey. As one might expect,42 very few Black South Africans reported feeling proud in the first survey in 1982 (just 36 percent saying “very proud” as compared with 75 percent of Whites). In 1990, similar proportions of both groups said they were very proud. More Blacks tended to increase to a peak of 81 percent in 2006, falling to 68 percent in 2013. By 2013, over 80 percent of Whites and over 90 percent of Black Africans said they were “proud” or “very proud.” Notwithstanding some ups and downs, that might seem to be quite a strong showing for the nation-building project. To be fair, when asked this way, the question allows citizens to think about the South African nation however they want—and not necessarily as the multiracial nation envisioned in the constitution, let alone by Desmond Tutu. Twenty-five years after Mandela’s election, in my survey of Mogale residents, I asked respondents to reflect on this question: “Let’s talk about what it means to be a South African. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once talked about the idea of a Rainbow Nation in South Africa. For some people, this meant a coming together and unity of people from different languages and races. Which of the following statements BEST approximates your view?” The answer was clear: the most ambitious ideals of multiracial nation-building had not yet been realized. Only 28 percent of those interviewed said that Tutu’s ideal had been realized or might be relatively soon. By contrast, “I am not convinced that South Africans can ever come together to be a rainbow nation” was the preferred response for 31 percent of the sample. Nevertheless, there were more doubters and fewer optimists in a national sample of South African public opinion in 1994, when 36 percent said the country would continue to be comprised of different nations. Although Black Africans were much more optimistic than Whites in the earlier, national sample, in the 2019 survey of Mogale residents, the distribution of answers was extremely similar across race groups.43 South African citizens seem to feel attached to the country—and perhaps it is this very attachment that has made political contests such high-stakes endeavors. For example, one survey asked, “Do you agree or disagree with the following—‘I would rather be a citizen of South Africa than of any other country in the world.’ ” Reference to “country” is clearly different from reference to a “people” or “nation” but still reflects a commentary on the collective, and 85 percent of those surveyed agreed, including 69 percent of Whites, who have been most likely to leave South Africa for other shores.44 Respect for the Dignity of Women? While I have mostly focused on concerns about racial and income/class inequalities, I think most observers would agree that South Africa has long been a male-dominated society. The country’s extreme brand of institutionalized White supremacy involved the explicit control of sexuality and gender relations, which contributed to a more thoroughgoing form of patriarchy. This was most obvious in various laws prohibiting marriage and sexual relations across the color bar throughout the twentieth century. Different laws and penalties for men and women who violated those laws were also reflected in different social norms and expectations across gender lines. Income, power, status, and wealth all accrued disproportionately to men. Even comparatively, White South Africa was a laggard compared to some of its peers: White women were only granted the right to vote in 1930—well after suffrage was achieved by women in the settler societies of New Zealand (1893), Australia (1901), Canada (1918; but only for federal elections), and the United States (1920). The first woman, Leila Reitz, was elected to the House of Assembly in 1933, and Helen Suzman,45 who served as a Member of Parliament for thirty-six years, was an outspoken voice against Apartheid. In both cases, those women spent several years as the only women in an otherwise all-male assembly. The liberation movement arguably made some significant gains with respect to female empowerment. Various women’s organizations were founded throughout the decades of Apartheid, some multiracial, some not. For example, the Black Women’s Federation was created with inspiration from the Black Consciousness movement in 1975, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela served as an executive member. Women across racial groups and socioeconomic classes played pivotal roles in the struggle against racial inequality, dating back to struggles against the pass system in the early 1910s, and these were recognized by key liberation leaders.46 Nonetheless, Apartheid left a gendered legacy of poverty in South Africa,47 and the fight for gender equality was consistently subordinated to that for racial equality until the late 1980s.48 Women were only granted full membership in the ANC at the time the organization’s Women’s League (ANCWL) was founded in 1943. And although a multiracial coalition of women helped draft an initial Women’s Charter that called for the removal of all laws and customs denying equal rights to women in anticipation of the Congress of the People in 1955,49 they were often relegated to secondary roles within movements.50 The political transition ushered in during the early 1990s provided a clear opening to make needed change. And once again channeling language from the Freedom Charter, the authors of the 1996 constitution declared the republic to be founded on not just the values of human dignity and non-racialism but also non-sexism. In turn, various institutions were established with the explicit goal of “mainstreaming” gender issues into South Africa’s legislation and public policies.51 Reflecting today on the record, the results are similar to what I’ve described along the racial dimension: progress has been significant, clearly more rapid and thoroughgoing than during any other period in South African history. Perhaps most notably, after almost a century of virtually all-male legislatures, following the 1994 election, 111 (of 400) women were seated in Parliament. Many went on to have a considerable impact on substantive policy issues and legislation.52 As the ANC was the only political party with a gender quota at the time, it accounted for 90 (81.1 percent) of these seats.53 Women’s representation in Parliament has been amplified in the form of parliamentary committees including, for example, the establishment of the Women’s Budget Initiative, which pushed for government ministries to consider gender issues in the formulation of their budgets.54 By 2019, South Africa ranked tenth among all countries in the world in terms of the number of women in Parliament.55 As shown in figure 8.4, under Apartheid, South Africa truly lagged in terms of rates of female political empowerment, particularly compared with other Upper-middle-income countries. When considering female political empowerment—measured in terms of women’s civil liberties, civil society participation, and descriptive representation in political positions—the South African record shot up in 1994 and stayed very high relative to the rest of the countries. Similarly, in terms of gender-based exclusion—denial of access to services or participation based on gender identity—again, South Africa compares particularly favorably relative to other countries, but only beginning in 1994. In 2019, South Africa ranked 66th out of 167 countries on the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security overall empowerment index, virtually tied with Namibia, Mauritius, and Rwanda as the overall leaders for Africa, a region that otherwise populates most of the bottom rankings internationally.56 FIGURE 8.4. Female political empowerment scores, South Africa compared to other Upper-middle-income countries (1985–2018). Source: Author analysis of VDEM_2019. These broad patterns belie important caveats and remaining concerns. Scholars have frequently found that because of lack of resources and/or insufficient commitment within government agencies, the impact of gender oversight commissions is often limited.57 And the country’s electoral system ensures that parliamentarians are vulnerable to party discipline, which limits the substantive ability of female parliamentarians to strike out on their own without the blessing of generally male-dominated party leadership. And following South Africa’s democratic transition, the women’s movement became increasingly fragmented and demobilized due both to the recruitment of its most competent leaders to the political system and to the ANC Women’s League’s declining prominence.58 And while it is true that at least a few female politicians can be found in the upper rungs in all of the leading parties, nationally and in Mogale City, top leadership remains a very male-dominated club, and the country has yet to seriously consider a woman for the position of state president. These facts are not lost on the female politicians in Mogale City, including Noluthando Mangole, the Black ANC Speaker; Eunice Segatlhe, the Black former ANC Speaker and current government bureaucrat; Amanda de Lange, the White Afrikaans-speaking FF+ councillor; or Sharon Govindasamy, an Indian DA councillor. In so many ways, these women could not be more different in terms of their personal backgrounds and policy preferences. But in my separate conversations with them, they each had remarkably similar responses to my line of inquiry on at least one question: that is, on the issue of how they are treated as women within their parties and in South African society. Mangole was born and raised in Munsieville. At council meetings, she is responsible for keeping meetings in order and councillors in line, following rules of debate, and so forth and has a commanding presence in the chamber. Despite being in the number two position in council, she worried about what she saw as reversing trends in gender parity: Remember that the gender issue was brought by the ANC Women’s League into government.… But that discussion is also now fading away. The ANC took a decision that said in the deployment you can have 50–50 or can have 60–40 in favor of women. But that is fading away. For example, [look at] the ANC outcomes of elections in 2017, you see one female and five males. When you would have expected at least three females, three males. It’s about power relations. Segatlhe, also from Munsieville, decried the problem of men sidelining outspoken women. In politics, nowadays when you are vocal, when you can stand your ground, if you are principled, they put her aside, “she talks too much,” they just put you there, “she thinks she is educated,” they just put you there, and it is such a pity, because even those women who are in leadership positions today here, you’ll find that they are there, but not there, because their male counterparts are telling them when to speak and when to raise issues which is so unfortunate.… Lots and lots of female leaders that are unemployed with degrees and because they are independent thinkers they are sidelined. De Lange similarly told a story of unfinished business. Despite representing a small, minority party, she cast a strong presence in local politics, speaking often in meetings and writing to the Krugersdorp News on a regular basis. Nonetheless, she highlighted a male-dominated culture within the party that creates a “glass ceiling” for competent female leaders. The FF+, being the conservative party that it is, stemmed mainly from the male fraternity and I think it’s always been like that. There have always been good and competent women, but they never wound up in the structures or the senior positions, leadership positions. Only of late, since the rest of the country and the opposition parties started to push women forward, that the awareness was created, that we needed to move with it, because we were still seen as a men’s party, or a party where men featured and men ruled. Before me, there were many women who were very good and they sort of just dwindled away … I do find still that some of the very senior leadership is still not acceptable to the fact, that I am not just a woman, but outspoken and decisive, and I come with my ideas and it should be incorporated because of the merits, and not declined because it’s a woman who brings it to the table. It is still difficult, yes. She argued for a greater representation of women in the seats of power toward better ends. I certainly feel that if we had more women in senior positions in this country, matters would have been much more stabilized because women just bring a sense of stability in any community and any organization. It’s just because, and I don’t want to generalize, but I think history has taught us that men are more inclined to go for war, whereas women are more level-headed. Again I don’t want to generalize, I just think women bring more stability. I’ve seen it in places where I’ve worked. I’ve seen it everywhere. I do believe if we could have more women and stronger women in power we could definitely see a lot of changes in this country. And as for Govindasamy, another woman who described for me a very full daily agenda in her work as a PR councillor and was active in her home ward of Azaadville, she largely echoed the views of her councillor colleagues from rival parties. In some ways, this was most surprising, as the DA has had a woman as its national leader (Helen Zille), and the Mogale City local leadership of her party is also largely female. But she said that when it comes time to make decisions around advancement, male perspectives dominate: “I think we are being downplayed in South Africa. [There are] more women as councillors, but more men are promoted to status positions. It’s tough being a woman in politics.” Beyond questions of political leadership, in recent years, concerns for the dignity of women have come to the fore as various activists have tried to shine a light on gender-based violence. As just one example, the 2019 rape and murder of a university student set off a wave of protest marches and demonstrations across the country. In turn, more perpetrators of such violence are being held accountable, and the critical issue has attracted unprecedented attention from government and society. Both the ANC and the DA included mention of gender-based violence in their respective 2019 election manifestoes. But the problem of this highly prevalent and grave indignity is very far from being solved. (Lack of) Respect for the Dignity of Foreigners While the post-Apartheid South African governments have clearly and deliberately pursued far more inclusionary approaches than any of their predecessors, almost any nation-building process inevitably bumps up against a difficult problem: the task of defining who is South African, entitled to the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and who is not. And just as countries around the world have, in recent years, been forced to reconsider how open or closed they would like to be with respect to people traveling across borders in search of new opportunities, so too have the South Africans. In practice, the country has not been regarded as very welcoming, to say the least. Throughout South Africa’s history, various attempts to build harmony, solidarity, or nationhood among some have accompanied the harsh exclusion of others. When Paul Kruger and his Voortrekkers arrived in the area around what would become Mogale City, to build their Afrikaner community, they used force to relegate a group of Black Africans—the Ndebele—to an area that would later become Zimbabwe. When Kruger tried to build the South African Republic as a sovereign state for Afrikaners, he despaired of the British, American, and other foreigners who came in search of gold. And sustained interest in that gold was at the root of a war that generated concentration camps and graves, again, a short walk from where I was sitting having coffee with the three pastors. The new Union of South Africa, born in 1909, bridged intra-White divides alongside the near total exclusion of Black Africans, despite the fact that the latter constituted the overwhelming numerical majority in the region. And just as when foreigners flocked to the area in search of gold in the late nineteenth century, the end of Apartheid came to resemble another gold rush. Particularly given all of the advantages I have described with respect to the benefits of being South African relative to other countries, it is not surprising that so many Africans would come to their southern neighbor in search of better opportunities. Whatever challenges South Africans face, the situation in almost all of the rest of Africa is worse. This is most evident with respect to the Ndebele people in modern Zimbabwe. In fact, the founding king of the Matabele Kingdom (of the Zimbabwean Ndebele, also known as Northern Ndebele), Chief Mzilikazi, was himself from South Africa’s Zululand. Through conquest, he had settled in the area around modern Mogale City, especially in the Magaliesberg mountains. When the Afrikaners arrived during the Great Trek, they defeated Mzilikazi in military conflicts, forcing him and his Ndebele followers to retreat to the north. As far as I know, the modern South African state affords no special path for citizenship for these descendants, despite the fact that approximately one million culturally similar Ndebele live as South Africans today. Zimbabweans, and other Africans for that matter, came to be recognized as foreigners. Reports of violence targeted at foreign nationals emerged almost immediately after the country’s transition to democracy in 1994.59 The first, most notable outbreak was almost fourteen years later, on May 11, 2008, in Alexandra township, a place primarily known for its history of anti-Apartheid activism.60 Over the course of approximately two weeks, violence spread to other urban areas in the country61 and led to approximately 60 deaths—in addition to over 700 seriously injured and 100,000 displaced residents.62 Then-president Thabo Mbeki was widely criticized for his initial characterization of these attacks as random acts of criminality.63 The prevalence of xenophobic attitudes in South Africa was acknowledged as early as the late 1990s in government policy documents,64 and research carried out two decades later suggests that such violence became normalized.65 As in other places where anti-immigrant violence is rife, many theories have been advanced as to why, and there is no single answer, especially as the migrants themselves are quite varied in their origins and activities, as are the local contexts where they settle. Some migrants are perceived to be economic threats in competing for jobs and/or are resented for their success in building new businesses. Some are resented for their cultural differences, some for antisocial behavior. On a national survey conducted in 2015, 63 percent of South Africans said immigrants cause increases in crime; 44 percent said they bring disease; and 64 percent said they use up the country’s resources, again with little difference in the distribution of responses across race groups.66 Nationally, and certainly in Mogale City, citizens blame many of the long-standing challenges of the country on these foreigners—a blanket act of scapegoating. Along these lines, a few comments recorded on the Historical Memories Survey were quite typical of widespread sentiment: “Foreigners are a threat to us. All South Africans must stick together to keep them out.”—63-year-old White man from Ward 26 “Foreigners are selling drugs while Pakistanis are raping our kids, they take all our jobs and bring rotten food in South Africa.”—52-year-old Black woman from Ward 23 The editor of the Krugersdorp News said to me with respect to border security, “So many South Africans agree with Donald Trump … what he’s trying to do.” I gasped. A wall? The idea had not been seriously raised by any South African politicians. But on my survey of Mogale residents, I asked whether they agreed with this statement: “The Government must urgently secure the borders to keep out foreigners.” More than 70 percent of Whites and more than 70 percent of Blacks selected 10—fully agreed.67 The South African story resonates widely with other postcolonial accounts of growing intolerance of “others,” including in Rwanda and Ivory Coast. Tragically, the development of a sense of membership and belonging frequently goes hand in hand with efforts to exclude. Reconciliation: A Dream Deferred It would be easy to focus on a snapshot of human relations in South Africa and find much that is wanting relative to an ideal benchmark of universal respect for human dignity. Relatedly, South Africans in all their diversity have not yet cohered into a strong and inclusive nation. Nonetheless, a fair assessment of human relations and government-citizen relations during the democratic era reveals a profound set of transformations that ought not be taken for granted in a country that literally was at civil war along several dimensions in the years just prior to the 1994 election. Social boundaries that once appeared impenetrable are breaking down. Relative to generations of South Africans, frankly for the whole of modern history, those who have faced indignities because of who they are—for example, along the lines of race or gender—now have recourse in ways that were previously never available. South African government policy is also remarkably inclusive of members of the LGBTQ community, those with disabilities, and other groups. To a degree, these trends mirror those in other countries at approximately the same time, but it is worth noting that in many African countries, state leaders have strongly resisted greater tolerance and acceptance, particularly with respect to gender and sexual orientation. In South Africa’s democratic context, it became the first on the continent to legalize same-sex civil unions. And in no African country has there been more deliberate progress toward protecting respect for human dignity than in South Africa of the past quarter century. The end of Apartheid did not preordain that the country would become the leader it now is in the promotion of human rights in Africa, with unparalleled domestic capacity to monitor and to protect those rights on the part of government and nongovernment organizations. The ongoing quest to extend respect for human dignity and to raise the bar for what that implies has been enabled and fueled by democratic government and competitive politics.",

      "content": "9 The Final Tallies SOUTH AFRICA’S WINTER sun was already setting by the time I arrived back at my Krugersdorp guesthouse, the Rabbit Hole, a little after 5 p.m. on May 8. The polls for the 2019 election would officially close in less than four hours. I parked my car in one of the covered spots, a late attempt to shield it from further aviary attack. When I returned to my room, I kept my jacket on and fired up the electric space heater, as a cool day had turned into a cold night. And now it was time to learn what the South Africans had collectively decided about this election and to reflect on the broader democratic experiment in this divided society. The television was filled with scenes much like the ones I had witnessed earlier: people waiting in lines, usually short ones, and emerging from voting booths more or less happy to have done their civic duty. Various commentators, election commission officials, and police officers addressed concerns that had been raised throughout the day. One video of a lone man in Limpopo Province carrying a voting box, presumably with nefarious intent, had gone viral. A few polling stations never opened, and a few others ran out of ballots. In response, the officials credibly assured the public that these had been isolated incidents, and in their estimation, it had been a valid election. Some of the smaller parties nonetheless raised charges of unfair electoral procedures and threatened legal action against the state. I was immediately skeptical of the veracity of these challenges because in order to appear on the ballot, each party had to put up 200,000 rand for the national election, and/or 45,000 for the provincial one, and if they didn’t win at least one seat, the money was not returned. Such policies were designed to discourage extremely low-support organizations from overwhelming the ballot list. The IEC might not have liked all the headaches associated with the 48 parties in the national contest, but at least they got to keep over 16 million rand (at the time, about a million U.S. dollars) worth of deposits from the losers.1 The IEC promised the results would be available no later than Saturday, and counting began immediately on that Wednesday evening. By the middle of the day after the election, the numbers were showing that the ANC was in strong shape to win the national election, albeit with the universally predicted diminished majority. Gauteng Province, however, was a nail-biter. One interim count had the ruling party at 49.5 percent, and I imagined emotions at various party headquarters were running high: if the ANC just barely failed to get a majority, at least one small party might realize its dream of becoming a “king-maker” in a coalition government. Meanwhile, confirming preelection polls, the DA was already looking like the big loser relative to their high hopes following years of upward growth. While the country was still in electoral purgatory awaiting final results, I went to follow up with several of the people I had gotten to know around Mogale City over the previous five months to get their take. I had spent a lot of time over at the Krugersdorp News, talking to reporters and looking through their old bound volumes. I emailed the editor and asked if I could chat with her and a few of the reporters about what everyone had observed and heard, and I would share my impressions as well. She kindly accepted, and I went to the newsroom in the morning with a bag of baked goods, my own form of enticement in exchange for their time. When I arrived, the newsroom was full—she had invited all of the reporters and a bunch from their sister newspaper, the Roodepoort Record, owned by the same company, to participate. As I sat down at the head of a long table, I faced several cameras atop tripods: in a world of social media all the time, they broadcast the meeting live on Facebook. I learned that on election day, the reporters had divided up the municipality; and as I had done, they interviewed voters as they exited the polling stations. Their stories and impressions of a largely smooth election confirmed what I had heard. Unlike me, the staff members also participated in the vote and could share their personal experiences. “For me, this election was kind of big,” said one reporter. “I thought this was going to be a watershed election.” Another said, “People were optimistic for change. People wanted change.… I think they wanted the change … [but] it doesn’t look like anything big will happen.” When it came to the role of race in politics, the reporters were not of one mind and clearly varied according to their own racial identities. Most of the Krugersdorp News reporters were White, and one said she wondered if this was the election in which the country could finally “get past” race. A Black reporter who had visited the upscale and largely White neighborhood of Ruimsig said, “I noticed that the racial tension was there … maybe they didn’t want to talk with a Black journalist.” I asked the reporters whether they felt they cover enough good news in Mogale City. Did the fact that they tend to write about what fails leave citizens more skeptical than the reality warranted? What about Ethembalethu? I initially faced a room of blank stares, as most were unaware of the place that was on my mind. One Black reporter confirmed he had been there, described it, and agreed that it was a successful community. Another reporter mentioned that the News did cover a more recent story of the handover of 100 RDP houses, but yet another asked if it was right to give a pat on the back to government for delivering 100 houses after twenty-five years. The editor added that they do cover some good news stories, including of people reaching out in positive ways to members of other communities, which was true. I thanked them for their time, knowing they had a newspaper to put out, and headed over to the Mogale City Council Speaker’s office to discuss her views about the election. I had met with Noluthando Mangole a few times on prior trips, and I knew she’d be working hard on this election. Though slight in stature, she was usually big on energy and presence. On this day, she seemed tired and down, even as she was fully decked out in ANC regalia, with her hair covered in a green and gold ANC scarf. “It was hectic,” she uttered a common South African expression. “To a large extent, Mogale City seemed not to have performed quite well in Gauteng and the results seem to be so low.” She complained of the problem of factions within the party, which affect daily governance in the municipality and the coordination of the campaign. She said she was surprised and a bit disappointed that there had not been any rallies in Mogale City. “In previous years, we used to have rallies around here. But resources were a bit of a challenge this time around.” Despite Mangole’s pessimistic tone, by midday Saturday, it was official: the election was declared “free and fair,” and for all the excitement, the talk of political change, the effective balance of power remained exactly as it had been: Ramaphosa would continue on as president of the country, as the ANC secured 57.5 percent of the national proportional representation vote. Eight of the nine provinces, including Gauteng with its just barely enough 50.1 percent of the votes, went to the ANC. Considering the results in Mogale City, the municipality proved, once again, to be broadly reflective of trends in Gauteng, and in South Africa more generally, albeit weighted toward its proportionally larger White and Afrikaans-speaking population. And in fact, the ANC did better than the Speaker lamented to me when we met in her office that Friday afternoon, receiving 52.1 percent of the votes cast in the municipality. Although ANC leaders were disappointed to be shedding seats in national and provincial legislatures, implying fewer key jobs for party insiders and evidence of the erosion of their electoral dominance, they had to be relieved. Like any election, at least in the near term, it was a success for the winners and viewed as the opposite for the losers. The question for the longer term is whether such competitive practice and the other trappings of democracy benefit the larger whole, particularly with respect to dignified development. I address such questions in the remainder of this conclusory chapter. First, I consider what we can learn from this particular election with respect to the hopes and concerns of prior decades and as documented in earlier chapters. Second, I discuss the South African case in relation to the analogous American experiment with post–civil rights desegregation, drawing many key parallels. And finally, I try to extract some lessons about democratic practice amid diversity from all that we’ve learned in this investigation, for South Africa and other divided societies. Done and Dusted: Another Election in the Books The May 2019 election was a fitting bookend to the first quarter century of democratic government. Electoral performance is shaped by many factors, and no vote tally can offer a fully clear or complete mandate concerning the “will of the people.” Nonetheless, the election conveyed a great deal of information about citizens’ wants and needs, it reflected the further routinization of liberal democracy, and it offered a feedback mechanism for reinforcing gains in dignified development. First of all, it does appear that the contest was indeed free and fair, and its legitimacy was essentially unchallenged. It’s impossible to know for sure the extent of irregularities, but few were reported, and those that were brought to light could not have materially affected the results. Back in Mogale City, the election mostly went well, though not perfectly. A non-trivial 8.5 percent of Black Africans said that they had been threatened with violence in the weeks leading up to the election. And it was almost double that in Munsieville’s Ward 27. Almost no one reported having been offered money for their votes. But about 10 percent of Black Africans said that in the weeks prior to the election, representatives from a political party had bought groceries for them. Threats of violence were clearly undemocratic, but grocery parcels struck me as fair game in a democratic polity so long as there was no explicit or enforceable quid pro quo in the form of votes.2 However, as expected, especially with the chilly and rainy weather I experienced on election day—and which blanketed much of the country—turnout was disappointing. Just 66.1 percent of the registered voters cast their ballots, and only about 3 of 4 citizens eligible to vote were registered. The turnout metric according to voting age population was under 47 percent, which is low by international standards, particularly as compared with 1999 when more than 70 percent of eligible voters actually voted.3 It was a middling performance compared to other African countries’ turnout in recent years.4 Second, the election reflected that South African politics was becoming more competitive. The ANC was still strong, but the results offered more evidence that the country had not become the one-party state that some feared as an inevitable fate. It was the ANC’s worst showing in a national election, while several small parties enjoyed substantial gains. Despite its several-year rise, the DA was not the prime beneficiary of the ANC’s losses. The party would remain as official opposition with 20.8 percent of the national vote and 24.6 percent of the Mogale vote, but this was a substantial drop-off from 2014, when they received 22.2 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The DA’s support in the Western Cape was also diminished, but they still received enough votes to remain in charge of that province. By contrast, the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+ enjoyed the biggest gains nationally, albeit from much smaller bases. Only six years old, the EFF took in 10.8 percent of the national vote and was massively successful in Mogale, with 12 percent. Next was the IFP with 3.4 percent, which also marked an increase from the prior election. And the FF+ made big gains from less than 1 percent to 2.4 percent nationally, while in Mogale their vote share was a substantial 7.1 percent. Increased representation of several parties implied more inclusion and pluralism. Yet, the implications of growing support for these particular parties—the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+—was double-edged, because each had advocated ethnic autonomy or even exclusion during the campaign. They might not have said so explicitly in their party manifestoes, but these parties had defined themselves in terms of particular racial or ethnic groups, and together, they doubled their combined 8.3 percent vote share from the 2014 national election to 16.6 percent in 2019. While the ANC’s decline was notable, the election could also be seen in a slightly different light: given widespread perceptions of poor performance and reports of corruption filling the airwaves in the months prior, as well as some polls showing that they might not win a majority of votes, the ANC also exceeded many expectations. One plausible interpretation is that Ramaphosa’s appeal stemmed from a credible commitment to resist the “state capture” of the Zuma years.5 In other words, despite a shared party brand, Ramaphosa managed to shed some of the ANC’s accumulated baggage by distancing himself from the Zuma faction. It would be an overstatement to suggest that the election was itself a referendum on the previous twenty-five years. On the other hand, the likelihood that citizens voted for the ANC was clearly associated with their views of the past, even if not in a strictly causal manner. For example, in my survey of Mogale City residents, 81 percent of Black Africans who said life was better now were also likely to say they supported the ANC. A smaller share of those who said that life was worse now also said they were supporting the ANC—but it was still 66 percent. Although far fewer Whites supported the ANC, positive views about post-Apartheid life were associated with an 11-percentage-point jump in the proportion of those reporting ANC support.6 Not surprisingly, racial dynamics were clearly at play in the election, although race and ethnicity were much less determinative of voters’ choices than many democratic theorists had once feared. For example, while both of the “big-tent” parties in terms of geographic, ethnic, and racial reach may have shed vote share, virtually all of government would remain in these parties’ respective hands after the election. Combined, the ANC and the DA took in 78.3 percent of the national vote. The ANC was no longer espousing the type of “non-racialism” it once did, but it was also still fairly moderate in its approach and certainly did not employ racially exclusionary rhetoric to attract supporters. In a country that is about 80 percent Black African, the fact that just over 50 percent of the vote went to the ANC meant that many Black voters opted for other parties. Moreover, many Whites I spoke with in and outside of Mogale said they voted for the ANC, even if it was not the party they most favored, because they preferred to see an ANC government to a coalition that might include the EFF. Indeed many Black voters went for the EFF, some for the IFP, and others for the DA. Presumably, many Zulu voters who had gone with the ANC under Zuma now returned to the IFP fold—a full 95 percent of the IFP’s votes came from the Zulu-dominant KwaZulu-Natal Province. And its only significant support in Mogale City was in Ward 15, with its substantial Zulu minority. However, the party did not perform well in other wards with sizable Zulu shares. The EFF most likely gained its support from a combination of ANC defectors and young new voters angry with the ANC for various reasons. Beyond Zulu-based support for the IFP, however, there is very little evidence supporting the idea that African language was a good predictor of party support in Mogale, Gauteng Province, or nationwide. Among Whites, the DA was still the most popular choice, but in this election, many voted for the FF+. The FF+ took in at least one-third of the White vote in the municipality.7 In seven wards, they attained 19 percent or more of the vote, including in Ward 22, where I had seen the FF+ councillor expressing confidence on election day. With Mmusi Maimane, a Black man, at the head of the DA ticket, and with other policy changes intended to attract a broader constituency, many Whites no longer felt represented by this self-avowed “non-racial” party. Moreover, FF+ support was not simply White but Afrikaner-based, reflecting the fact that the old inter-White cleavage never fully disappeared.8 Citizens had real choices, and changes in vote shares within voting districts across the country made clear that citizens were using their votes to send signals to politicians about what they did and didn’t like.9 In fact, one of the most profound findings from analysis of voting returns is the degree to which extreme levels of party support as measured at individual voting stations and at the ward level were reversed from the 2016 election. That is, both the ANC and the DA each tended to shed the most votes in the areas where they had done best and gained the most votes in the areas where they had done worst. Several other factors, discussed in the three prior chapters, also helped to predict vote choices, citizen views about how life compared now to under Apartheid, or both.10 For example, engagement in democratic practice and perceptions of quality of governance were important predictors of positive views: Black Africans were substantially more likely to say they viewed post-Apartheid life favorably if they had attended a ward committee meeting in the past month or if they said they felt a ward councillor listened to “someone like them.” Views about the post-Apartheid era and vote choices were also predicted by the material conditions in which people reported living, but the patterns were not particularly strong or even in the direction many might predict. For example, 54 percent of Black respondents who lived in a formal dwelling and had a job said life was better now; by contrast only 31 percent of those Blacks with neither a formal house nor a job said that life was better today. Among the Black Africans surveyed in Ethembalethu—the successful, subsidized housing development in Muldersdrift described in chapter 7—72 percent said life was better now. And in qualitative responses, overwhelmingly, citizens pointed to a lack of jobs and the fact that jobs were easier to get under Apartheid as reasons for selecting life was better “then.” Higher-income Blacks looked at the present more favorably than those with lower incomes. And those with an electric connection, a flush toilet in their home, and/or piped water were more likely to report that life was better now than before. The more service delivery problems people experienced, and the more they felt unsafe in their neighborhood, the more likely they were to reflect favorably on the past. While the South African government had made enormous progress in delivering basic services to millions more people than under Apartheid, millions were still waiting, and were clearly frustrated. Nonetheless, material conditions were not good predictors of ANC support among Blacks in Mogale City. For example, the same proportion of those with jobs and formal houses supported the ANC as was the case for those who lacked both (about 68 percent). Looking at actual levels of and shifts in voter support for the ANC, the picture was more mixed when considering levels of service provision and the degree of expressed concerns about service problems. In short, it was not necessarily the case that those whose lives materially improved under ANC government were the ones rewarding them with their votes relative to the rest.11 Far and away, the strongest predictor of citizen responses to the question about quality of life was how individuals reported being treated by others: by members of other race groups and by government, as well as their optimism about the viability of a rainbow nation. For Blacks who said they were treated better now by Whites compared to under Apartheid, 63 percent said life was better now. By contrast, among those who said they have been treated the same or worse by Whites, less than 19 percent said their lives were better now. (And a similar pattern holds among Whites.) Moreover, I found that Blacks were much more likely to support the ANC when they reported being treated better by members of other race groups (81 percent versus 57 percent for those who said they were treated worse). Indeed, in their more open-ended responses in which I asked respondents to elaborate on their quality-of-life concerns, many talked about the very types of race relations that the three pastors emphasized in our conversation over coffee, which I described in chapter 8. For example, a forty-four-year-old Black man talked about the present relative to the past: “Before, there were two doors in one shop for Whites and Blacks and my uncle once got beaten up for using a White door. We were not allowed to walk in the street after 19h00 [7 p.m.]. If found in the street I would be asked three questions like why aren’t you at school, work, [or] jail.” A seventy-six-year-old Black woman reflected on the question in terms of greater equality of opportunity: “Today’s life is good, we are free, we can do business freely without White people taking our stuff. We have freedom of education and we can attend school with White people.” It is not obvious why some respondents feel more respected by people from other race groups within the same geographic location. Self-reports of interracial contact or interracial friendships were themselves not predictive of how citizens described treatment by members of other race groups, nor were factors such as education, wealth, or the demographics of one’s ward. Nonetheless, it is clear that how people view the “big picture” of post-Apartheid democracy and reconciliation is very much colored by or at least predicted by their own sense of everyday treatment by government authorities and by other citizens, especially across the racial divide. The likelihood that citizens in diverse societies will experience democratic government as successful may be strongly affected by empathy for, respectful treatment by, and fellow-feeling with the “other.”12 This ought to serve as a strong reminder for political leaders of the value citizens place on dignified treatment. Of the Same Cloth: South Africa and the United States For Americans reflecting on our own elections and the factors that drive vote choices, it’s hard to avoid seeing parallels with the 2019 South African contest. Race, material conditions, and the role of views of the other are all similarly highly predictive of vote choices.13 I decided to write this book about South Africa, but admittedly, the contemporary and historical United States has loomed large as a basis for comparison. While South Africa’s Apartheid system of race relations and its precursors were more thoroughgoing, America’s long history of slavery, segregation, and other formal and informal systems of race-based discrimination is also quite profound. And although formal discriminatory structures were dismantled in both countries, informal forms of racism persist, and their legacies remain strong and almost ubiquitous. Any attempt at comparison bumps up against certain key differences between the countries, including in terms of racial demographics: throughout its history until the present, the United States has been a majority White country (even Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana are all majority White, and less than 40 percent of residents are African American). In the years after the U.S. Civil War and the end of slavery, the treatment of African Americans varied by region to a greater extent than regional variation in the implementation of Apartheid: in the American South, where most Blacks live, a form of segregation that is frequently compared with South African Apartheid persisted. The dawn of America’s multiracial experiment came thirty years earlier than South Africa’s, with the promulgation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed race-based segregation and promoted various forms of integration. As in South Africa, the civil rights era was met with a mixed response from within society, and the mere imperative to change did not translate into transformation. This is apparent today, more than fifty years later, and certainly was true in the twenty to twenty-five years after the Civil Rights Act.14 In fact, a 1985 New York Times article titled “The Races in Mississippi: Old Order and New” might just as well have been a story about present-day Mogale City. It highlighted that a local Black newspaper, the Jackson Advocate, printed an article announcing that the state had sworn in the first Black member of the state supreme court next to an article titled “Cross Burned—Youth Abducted and Beaten in Strife-Torn Durant.” The Times article juxtaposed substantial political gains against slow progress in terms of relationships and contact between the races. The fact that many people, Blacks and Whites, died so that Blacks could use a restroom in a public place or walk through the front door of a restaurant and be served is somewhat lost, or at least blurred, by the amount of change. “It’s so different from what it was that for people who’ve never experienced the other, it’s just hard to realize what has changed,” observed Frank E. Smith, who represented Mississippi in Congress for 11 years.15 Similarly, Whites and Blacks offered divergent recollections of the past: The lynchings of Blacks and denials of basic rights are part of the legacy of the state that, by far, was considered by almost all Blacks as the very toughest in the South, racism at its worst. But to many White Southerners at the time, there was nothing wrong with segregation of the races; as a matter of fact, they believed it was wrong, even immoral, for Blacks and Whites to live together, go to the same schools, socialize and marry. On politics, race remained a critical predictor of how individuals would vote: “Whites won’t vote for a Black candidate,” one politician observed. And on frustration among Blacks with not being able to lead a better life even two decades after the legal end of segregation: Many Blacks live in two- to four-room wooden shacks with tin roofs and cardboard or plastic nailed up to windows that have no panes. Only 14 percent of Tunica’s Blacks over the age of 25 have high school educations: the first high school for Blacks was not opened until 1952. Sugar Ditch Alley, a Black settlement, takes its name from a one-and-a-half-mile ditch running behind the shacks. It is there that the residents dump their human waste, for there are no indoor toilets. They may also have to walk several houses away to obtain water from an outdoor hydrant. When Americans elected the country’s first Black president, Barack Obama, in 2008, that marked a truly significant step toward redressing this history of indignities. Yet just eight years later, although more Americans voted for his opponent, Donald Trump won the election for the White House. It was eerily reminiscent of the 1948 election in South Africa, when the National Party got to take power, despite failing to win the most votes. Trump’s diatribes against people of color, foreigners, and even Africans bore more than a passing resemblance to the Nats’ fear-mongering around a “Black Peril,” and even to Paul Kruger’s White nativist orientation. The 2016 election in the United States reflected a deep lack of consensus among White Americans about our own journey toward racial integration. Moreover, despite its symbolic importance, Obama’s presidency, let alone several decades of post–civil rights politics, did not erase the racial disparities remaining in just about every dimension of American life: in terms of job opportunities, educational opportunities and attainment, life expectancies, health care and health outcomes, where people live, and who has political and economic power. As is now well known, African American men face a disturbingly high rate of incarceration and are routinely unfairly treated by the police throughout the country. Repeated indignities have fueled a movement, Black Lives Matter, whose core claim centers around a lack of equal respect for the dignity of Black people. Not surprisingly, the movement resonated in South Africa as well. Both in America and in South Africa, political resistance and democratic politics have marked many important advances for greater social justice. Looking at the present from the perspective of the segregationist American South circa 1960 or Apartheid South Africa in 1980, there’s no denying that much has changed for the better. And yet, when seen together, the history of these two countries demonstrates that institutionalized White supremacy dies hard, and their respective economies and societies continue to be defined by race-based disparities, high levels of prejudice, and conflict. Unfortunately, cycles of reproducing inequality in the form of various intergenerational transfers are extraordinarily difficult to break. Healthy, wealthy, and well-educated parents routinely transfer all of these outcomes to their children through their home environments, passing on not just assets but also human capital and social networks. The material and social-psychological legacies of past indignities are both strong and self-reinforcing, presenting perpetual new challenges in the quest for dignified development through democratic practice. We can and should acknowledge serious and persistent shortcomings and aspire for democracy to work better in both places. It is also important to consider the alternatives. As just a few examples, the catastrophic and recent plight of the Uighurs in China,16 the Rohingya in Myanmar,17 and perpetual repression in Rwanda18 all reflect what can happen to ethnic minorities and competitors in the absence of the light and protections associated with well-institutionalized democratic rule. The government assault on human rights in the non-democracies of China and Russia, including in the form of violent repression of critics,19 has been without parallel in contemporary America or South Africa. Lessons for and about Democracy and Dignified Development Are there lessons to be learned—even if more modest ones—from South Africa’s bold political experiment to launch democracy? The challenges the country faced in the early 1990s, of a racially divided and highly unequal society, were extreme but not entirely unique. Countries around the world are simultaneously becoming more diverse and more unequal, and those conditions have frequently given rise to exclusionary and populist authoritarian tendencies. How might such polities fare under more robust democratic rules? Focusing on the history of one country, it’s hard to know whether democratic practice actually caused the outcomes that followed. Was it any particular democratic institution or episode? Or a combination? Would such results hold in a different context? A case study like the one I’ve carried out here is not well designed to answer any of those questions adequately because so many changes have unfolded simultaneously. Rather, the value of the story I’ve told here—about the development of multiracial democracy in South Africa for twenty-five years after Apartheid—is more heuristic: it helps to demonstrate what is possible and plausible, including to challenge the notion that some groups simply can’t coexist or co-govern—that “ancient hatreds” will always stand in the way. And it affords the opportunity to discuss what is valuable and desirable for the good life. Others will surely disagree with my particular calculations of what went right and what wrong, and the relative import of both—but my goal has been simply to consider the record more deliberately. Looking at this past quarter century in light of South Africa’s history, patterns in other countries, and in Mogale City in particular suggests further reflection about three key areas: democratic practice, the forging of political communities, and the role government should play in helping people fulfill their aspirations for a better life. I cannot, from this study, say that the introduction or consolidation of democracy will lead to dignified development with any particular likelihood. Democratic institutions are certainly not sufficient for this outcome. Rather, I do think they are necessary. To feel truly empowered and autonomous, citizens require robust opportunities to participate in the selection of leaders and to influence policy without fear of repression. For example, Israel is one of many divided societies that continues to face existential dilemmas around who should be included, who excluded, and on what basis, and the South African experience is surely relevant. Israel had a “Mandela–De Klerk” dynamic in the form of Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, Nobel Prize winners, who signed an accord for Palestinian self-rule just days after Mandela’s election in 1994. Their negotiations were toward a “two-state” solution, but the settlement was undone by aggressions and pullbacks on both sides and, notably, the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by an Israeli extremist who resented the peace accords. While reminiscent of Chris Hani’s assassination, in the Israeli case, the murder derailed the negotiations, and after many years of repeated attempts, one noted scholar of Israeli politics concluded that the “two-state solution” appeared largely untenable.20 Maps of the Middle East, which carve out strangely shaped Palestinian territories with restrictive borders in the middle of Israel, are powerfully reminiscent of South Africa’s homeland structures, especially as the conditions within them are largely deplorable relative to the largely prosperous country that surrounds. Indeed, the term “Apartheid” has often been used to describe the nature of power and authority in Israel, even though it is met by many with grave consternation given the connotations. For many White South Africans who observe the Israeli situation, and speak despairingly of what befell their own country, they describe the South African case more as a warning rather than as a model for emulation. And such difference of interpretation is one of the main reasons I wrote this book: we need to understand what South Africa is a “case of.” Perfect? No. Nonetheless, quite successful given the conditions and the very possible alternatives, especially if one focuses on the most vulnerable segments of society. For Jews and Arabs who find it difficult to fathom a peaceful solution in which they coexist in a single democratic order, South Africa offers one critical lesson: former enemies can, in fact, live and govern relatively peacefully and productively, within the span of a generation. While it is difficult to parse out which of South Africa’s democratic institutions had what particular effects on politics and society, two general principles stand out: multiple opportunities for participation and the norm of proportionality. With respect to the first, I am reminded that on election day, many repeated the incantation, “You can’t complain if you don’t vote.” That might imply that voters are the biggest complainers. In fact, political participation was associated with more positive views of life in South Africa—and it’s hard to know whether contentedness causes political participation or the reverse. As it is in other countries, political participation is important. Because of the staggered approach to national/provincial elections and local elections, the longest period that South Africans wait between elections is three years. Moreover, high-density local governments that blanket municipalities with ward councillors and ward committees alongside a still strong and active civil society offer robust opportunities to participate, at least in urban areas. Where people participate and where political competition is high, political parties have been more responsive. While it has not been a focus of this book, democratic practice in rural areas, especially those co-governed by traditional leaders, remains underdeveloped, and with little in the way of interparty competition.21 I am also largely persuaded that the norm of proportionality, including the specific electoral institution of proportional representation—rather than a “winner-take-all” system like we have in the United States—was the right choice for South Africa. In a diverse and divided society, proportionality has offered important recognition to a wide range of people according to their identities and ideas about how government should be run. The system has also kept minority elites engaged in politics in a meaningful way, realistically keeping their hopes alive of influencing policies and key outcomes, even without large numbers of supporters. Proportionality has allowed citizens to see themselves represented in and thus to become more attached to the government. And it has opened up space for new parties, born of new ideas, to emerge, and this has contributed to a more dynamic democratic environment. Soon enough, such a system may reveal its limits. If and when the ANC is no longer able to capture a majority of the voters, and if the country is governed through coalitions, frustrations could ensue, just as they did in Mogale City following the 2016 local election. Optimistically, disparate elites could engage in workable compromise to the benefit of all. However, frustrating polarization could breed paralysis and/or potentially induce the type of opaque manipulation the ANC used to wrest control of the municipality. The ability to weather such political storms may depend on the degree to which political elites and ordinary citizens can find common ground in joint projects and a sense of shared purpose and not view the political arena as a zero-sum game. In short, formal institutions will never be enough to hold South Africa together—there must also be elite and citizen goodwill. Along these lines, the post-Apartheid “experiment” was not just about the practice of democratic politics but also about reinventing a society that had been divided by deliberate design. As in the contemporary United States, a key challenge is how to address the indignities of the past without reinforcing and reproducing the sense of deep division and difference that bred such practices in the first place. The “rainbow nation” was one solution for overcoming racial divide. Perhaps it was too hokey, too contrived to be fully embraced in a lasting manner, especially when intergroup inequalities remain so stark. Yet, all national myths are aspirational and, by design, unnuanced. Moreover, it’s difficult to discount the value that this particular idea played during the period of political transition in the mid-1990s. Echoing that early period, in November 2019, South Africa’s rugby team claimed a World Cup victory; and on that occasion, the team was more racially diverse and, for the first time, led by a Black man—Siya Kolisi—who was also outspoken in promoting an optimistic, “keep dreaming” message. The win garnered lots of favorable news coverage and offered a symbolic reminder of what the country was becoming and still could be. Could the idea stick? Not everyone was convinced. As a columnist for the largest Black newspaper, the Sowetan, argued, “Winning [the] rugby world cup doesn’t mean we’re together.”22 Nonetheless, the expressed sentiments surrounding the 2019 World Cup revealed that there remains an appetite and possibility for nation-building and the politically useful notion that “we are in this together.” Unfortunately, the development of a sense of “us” is too often built upon exclusionary and intolerant perspectives concerning who is not, or who is “them.” While it would be naive on a number of levels to suggest that fully open borders are the solution, like the United States, South Africa must square the desire to enforce such boundaries with an approach that also recognizes the dignity of foreign nationals. A cursory glance at history reminds us that many of those today seen as “foreigners” are deeply rooted in the country’s history, including having jointly suffered from the indignities of White supremacy. Relatedly, it’s worth asking whether a recently liberated people, facing significant disparities in income, wealth, and services, should really focus their attention on issues of symbolic recognition. Do statues and street and place names really matter? The color and gender of political representatives? In a recent book and related writing, Francis Fukuyama has argued that the quest for recognition can displace the more “important” political project of material advance and equitable development.23 I think Fukuyama’s argument underappreciates the quest for such recognition not simply as an end in itself but as a means for fostering efficacious and involved citizens. A sense of identity and pride are important foundations for the types of deliberate actions that breed prosperity. When people feel devalued, they are not likely to be contributing members of the community. I am not suggesting that every form of recognition is valuable or consequential, but following centuries of indignities, these are more than simply hollow symbols. They provide daily reminders of who and what are valued by their democratic society. The analyses presented throughout this book also raise the question of what role government ought to play in the economy and society in the future. To the extent that South African citizens still have a large reservoir of unmet wants and needs, they must decide whether those are best addressed through direct government action, privately, or in some combination. The global record of state-planned economies is simply too dismal to contemplate as a comprehensive solution, and the South African government has already demonstrated its limited capacity even in delivering basic services. Nonetheless, the rights orientation of the constitution has usefully enshrined a role for government to protect a fundamental respect for human dignity, both in terms of minimum standards for material living conditions and for treatment by government itself and other citizens. I admit that, like many, I was initially skeptical of the heavy rights orientation of the South African constitution when I first learned of all that was protected. How could you “guarantee” all of these social and economic benefits? I imagined that it would amount to a plethora of unfulfilled promises. And yet in practice, the language and ethos of rights have proven quite central in changing the politics of inequality in South Africa, highlighting that the previously invisible ways in which people were excluded from full participation in society were no longer acceptable. A rights orientation opened up a critical discussion of what it means to be fully human: Should free health care be a right? Free primary education? Free university education? Quality education? Access to the internet? While there is no universally accepted bundle of goods that constitutes a human minimum, and clearly, context matters, a rights orientation offers a platform for the least well-off in unequal societies, and their allies, to make strong claims to direct public resources their way in search of a more just distribution. Overcoming Cynicism There’s no denying that democracy remains fragile and messy in Mogale City and in South Africa. If the political order were to go up in flames, I would be crestfallen but not wholly surprised. From the vantage point of just over a quarter century since the end of Apartheid, it would be sheer hubris to assume that a relatively peaceful multiparty democracy will last forever. The multitude of challenges the country still faces could ultimately overwhelm the still emerging political order. However, if it does come apart, it will be one of the great tragedies of the early twenty-first century, because South Africa’s democratic order is surely one of the great accomplishments of the late twentieth. That so much is left to be done to achieve a just and prosperous society does not mean that democratic government is to blame or that much would be better under a different system, tempting as it is to wonder aloud about such options. In many ways, South Africa is just muddling along, but that in and of itself is pretty remarkable in the wake of the legacies it inherited. Moreover, in just twenty-five years the country went from laggard to leader on multiple dimensions. So much that was once thought impossible is now taken for granted. As I highlighted in chapter 3, and have shown throughout this book, one of the hallmark traits of democratic practice is the public and vociferous airing of grievances about the status quo. This is healthy and drives change. And yet when we combine this behavior with a tendency toward negativity bias, sentiment can turn cynical. I have tried to offer a reality check. Proponents of democracy’s virtues have never enjoyed a period of unwavering support for their theories. History has always generated cases of democracies gone bad and of authoritarian regimes that managed to succeed in various ways. The present period is a particularly difficult one for democracies around the world. When protesters took to the streets in countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa during the 2010s, marking a period that came to be known as the “Arab Spring,” they appeared to be paving the way for a more democratic order in the world’s most autocratic region. Among their many concerns were government corruption, lack of jobs, and economic inequality. And yet, a decade later, liberal democracy has completely failed to take root. Established democracies in every world region have come under pressure from those seeking to gain or to hold onto power through illiberal tactics, circumventing democratic procedures. In this context, South Africa needs to be understood as the largely successful case that it is, and it is fair to say that democracy saved South Africa from a fate that could have been quite disastrous given where the country was headed. The fact that it can be largely successful here does not tell us that it will work the same way everywhere, but it provides an important heuristic for what’s possible and lessons for plural societies. Was this just a fluke of history? To be certain, following the wave of multiparty elections endeavored mostly during the decade of the 1990s, very few African countries developed robust democratic institutions and practices.24 And yet, those that did offer analogous lessons to what I found in South Africa. Citizens of Cape Verde, Ghana, Botswana, Benin, Senegal, Namibia, and others have benefited from democratic practice relative to the largely disastrous experience of authoritarian rule in neighboring countries on the continent. The politics and policies of these other African democracies are similarly imperfect, and their domestic critics similarly numerous and vociferous. Nonetheless, they also have much to share in terms of the virtues of political freedom, including with respect to dignified treatment, that were previously available only to small minorities. Progress requires the constant readjustment and ratcheting of hopes and dreams. In practice, especially within democratic systems, this means never accepting the status quo as fully satisfactory, and at least rhetorically dismissing the past and the present as unacceptable. But sometimes progress must be measured and appreciated. For generations, Black South Africans, from Sol Plaatje to Desmond Tutu to Chris Hani to Nelson Mandela, as well as the freedom fighters in Munsieville, Kagiso, and beyond, all labored to free themselves and their society from the shackles of institutionalized White supremacy and Apartheid. And they succeeded. When the Congress of the People gathered to read the Freedom Charter in 1955, few South Africans or outside observers would have predicted a day when so many of their aspirations would be largely fulfilled: irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability, South Africans of 2019 were all clearly citizens, not subjects. Political leaders had to come to them asking for their votes, appealing to their sense of what was right and fair. Democracy in South Africa is working: it is becoming more competitive; people are living better lives with more dignity; citizens are advancing their interests in a range of democratic channels—through the vote, in the media, in citizen campaigns, in the courts, and in their growing confidence of what it means to be a democratic citizen. Their story leaves me hopeful.",

      "content": "9 The Final Tallies SOUTH AFRICA’S WINTER sun was already setting by the time I arrived back at my Krugersdorp guesthouse, the Rabbit Hole, a little after 5 p.m. on May 8. The polls for the 2019 election would officially close in less than four hours. I parked my car in one of the covered spots, a late attempt to shield it from further aviary attack. When I returned to my room, I kept my jacket on and fired up the electric space heater, as a cool day had turned into a cold night. And now it was time to learn what the South Africans had collectively decided about this election and to reflect on the broader democratic experiment in this divided society. The television was filled with scenes much like the ones I had witnessed earlier: people waiting in lines, usually short ones, and emerging from voting booths more or less happy to have done their civic duty. Various commentators, election commission officials, and police officers addressed concerns that had been raised throughout the day. One video of a lone man in Limpopo Province carrying a voting box, presumably with nefarious intent, had gone viral. A few polling stations never opened, and a few others ran out of ballots. In response, the officials credibly assured the public that these had been isolated incidents, and in their estimation, it had been a valid election. Some of the smaller parties nonetheless raised charges of unfair electoral procedures and threatened legal action against the state. I was immediately skeptical of the veracity of these challenges because in order to appear on the ballot, each party had to put up 200,000 rand for the national election, and/or 45,000 for the provincial one, and if they didn’t win at least one seat, the money was not returned. Such policies were designed to discourage extremely low-support organizations from overwhelming the ballot list. The IEC might not have liked all the headaches associated with the 48 parties in the national contest, but at least they got to keep over 16 million rand (at the time, about a million U.S. dollars) worth of deposits from the losers.1 The IEC promised the results would be available no later than Saturday, and counting began immediately on that Wednesday evening. By the middle of the day after the election, the numbers were showing that the ANC was in strong shape to win the national election, albeit with the universally predicted diminished majority. Gauteng Province, however, was a nail-biter. One interim count had the ruling party at 49.5 percent, and I imagined emotions at various party headquarters were running high: if the ANC just barely failed to get a majority, at least one small party might realize its dream of becoming a “king-maker” in a coalition government. Meanwhile, confirming preelection polls, the DA was already looking like the big loser relative to their high hopes following years of upward growth. While the country was still in electoral purgatory awaiting final results, I went to follow up with several of the people I had gotten to know around Mogale City over the previous five months to get their take. I had spent a lot of time over at the Krugersdorp News, talking to reporters and looking through their old bound volumes. I emailed the editor and asked if I could chat with her and a few of the reporters about what everyone had observed and heard, and I would share my impressions as well. She kindly accepted, and I went to the newsroom in the morning with a bag of baked goods, my own form of enticement in exchange for their time. When I arrived, the newsroom was full—she had invited all of the reporters and a bunch from their sister newspaper, the Roodepoort Record, owned by the same company, to participate. As I sat down at the head of a long table, I faced several cameras atop tripods: in a world of social media all the time, they broadcast the meeting live on Facebook. I learned that on election day, the reporters had divided up the municipality; and as I had done, they interviewed voters as they exited the polling stations. Their stories and impressions of a largely smooth election confirmed what I had heard. Unlike me, the staff members also participated in the vote and could share their personal experiences. “For me, this election was kind of big,” said one reporter. “I thought this was going to be a watershed election.” Another said, “People were optimistic for change. People wanted change.… I think they wanted the change … [but] it doesn’t look like anything big will happen.” When it came to the role of race in politics, the reporters were not of one mind and clearly varied according to their own racial identities. Most of the Krugersdorp News reporters were White, and one said she wondered if this was the election in which the country could finally “get past” race. A Black reporter who had visited the upscale and largely White neighborhood of Ruimsig said, “I noticed that the racial tension was there … maybe they didn’t want to talk with a Black journalist.” I asked the reporters whether they felt they cover enough good news in Mogale City. Did the fact that they tend to write about what fails leave citizens more skeptical than the reality warranted? What about Ethembalethu? I initially faced a room of blank stares, as most were unaware of the place that was on my mind. One Black reporter confirmed he had been there, described it, and agreed that it was a successful community. Another reporter mentioned that the News did cover a more recent story of the handover of 100 RDP houses, but yet another asked if it was right to give a pat on the back to government for delivering 100 houses after twenty-five years. The editor added that they do cover some good news stories, including of people reaching out in positive ways to members of other communities, which was true. I thanked them for their time, knowing they had a newspaper to put out, and headed over to the Mogale City Council Speaker’s office to discuss her views about the election. I had met with Noluthando Mangole a few times on prior trips, and I knew she’d be working hard on this election. Though slight in stature, she was usually big on energy and presence. On this day, she seemed tired and down, even as she was fully decked out in ANC regalia, with her hair covered in a green and gold ANC scarf. “It was hectic,” she uttered a common South African expression. “To a large extent, Mogale City seemed not to have performed quite well in Gauteng and the results seem to be so low.” She complained of the problem of factions within the party, which affect daily governance in the municipality and the coordination of the campaign. She said she was surprised and a bit disappointed that there had not been any rallies in Mogale City. “In previous years, we used to have rallies around here. But resources were a bit of a challenge this time around.” Despite Mangole’s pessimistic tone, by midday Saturday, it was official: the election was declared “free and fair,” and for all the excitement, the talk of political change, the effective balance of power remained exactly as it had been: Ramaphosa would continue on as president of the country, as the ANC secured 57.5 percent of the national proportional representation vote. Eight of the nine provinces, including Gauteng with its just barely enough 50.1 percent of the votes, went to the ANC. Considering the results in Mogale City, the municipality proved, once again, to be broadly reflective of trends in Gauteng, and in South Africa more generally, albeit weighted toward its proportionally larger White and Afrikaans-speaking population. And in fact, the ANC did better than the Speaker lamented to me when we met in her office that Friday afternoon, receiving 52.1 percent of the votes cast in the municipality. Although ANC leaders were disappointed to be shedding seats in national and provincial legislatures, implying fewer key jobs for party insiders and evidence of the erosion of their electoral dominance, they had to be relieved. Like any election, at least in the near term, it was a success for the winners and viewed as the opposite for the losers. The question for the longer term is whether such competitive practice and the other trappings of democracy benefit the larger whole, particularly with respect to dignified development. I address such questions in the remainder of this conclusory chapter. First, I consider what we can learn from this particular election with respect to the hopes and concerns of prior decades and as documented in earlier chapters. Second, I discuss the South African case in relation to the analogous American experiment with post–civil rights desegregation, drawing many key parallels. And finally, I try to extract some lessons about democratic practice amid diversity from all that we’ve learned in this investigation, for South Africa and other divided societies. Done and Dusted: Another Election in the Books The May 2019 election was a fitting bookend to the first quarter century of democratic government. Electoral performance is shaped by many factors, and no vote tally can offer a fully clear or complete mandate concerning the “will of the people.” Nonetheless, the election conveyed a great deal of information about citizens’ wants and needs, it reflected the further routinization of liberal democracy, and it offered a feedback mechanism for reinforcing gains in dignified development. First of all, it does appear that the contest was indeed free and fair, and its legitimacy was essentially unchallenged. It’s impossible to know for sure the extent of irregularities, but few were reported, and those that were brought to light could not have materially affected the results. Back in Mogale City, the election mostly went well, though not perfectly. A non-trivial 8.5 percent of Black Africans said that they had been threatened with violence in the weeks leading up to the election. And it was almost double that in Munsieville’s Ward 27. Almost no one reported having been offered money for their votes. But about 10 percent of Black Africans said that in the weeks prior to the election, representatives from a political party had bought groceries for them. Threats of violence were clearly undemocratic, but grocery parcels struck me as fair game in a democratic polity so long as there was no explicit or enforceable quid pro quo in the form of votes.2 However, as expected, especially with the chilly and rainy weather I experienced on election day—and which blanketed much of the country—turnout was disappointing. Just 66.1 percent of the registered voters cast their ballots, and only about 3 of 4 citizens eligible to vote were registered. The turnout metric according to voting age population was under 47 percent, which is low by international standards, particularly as compared with 1999 when more than 70 percent of eligible voters actually voted.3 It was a middling performance compared to other African countries’ turnout in recent years.4 Second, the election reflected that South African politics was becoming more competitive. The ANC was still strong, but the results offered more evidence that the country had not become the one-party state that some feared as an inevitable fate. It was the ANC’s worst showing in a national election, while several small parties enjoyed substantial gains. Despite its several-year rise, the DA was not the prime beneficiary of the ANC’s losses. The party would remain as official opposition with 20.8 percent of the national vote and 24.6 percent of the Mogale vote, but this was a substantial drop-off from 2014, when they received 22.2 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The DA’s support in the Western Cape was also diminished, but they still received enough votes to remain in charge of that province. By contrast, the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+ enjoyed the biggest gains nationally, albeit from much smaller bases. Only six years old, the EFF took in 10.8 percent of the national vote and was massively successful in Mogale, with 12 percent. Next was the IFP with 3.4 percent, which also marked an increase from the prior election. And the FF+ made big gains from less than 1 percent to 2.4 percent nationally, while in Mogale their vote share was a substantial 7.1 percent. Increased representation of several parties implied more inclusion and pluralism. Yet, the implications of growing support for these particular parties—the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+—was double-edged, because each had advocated ethnic autonomy or even exclusion during the campaign. They might not have said so explicitly in their party manifestoes, but these parties had defined themselves in terms of particular racial or ethnic groups, and together, they doubled their combined 8.3 percent vote share from the 2014 national election to 16.6 percent in 2019. While the ANC’s decline was notable, the election could also be seen in a slightly different light: given widespread perceptions of poor performance and reports of corruption filling the airwaves in the months prior, as well as some polls showing that they might not win a majority of votes, the ANC also exceeded many expectations. One plausible interpretation is that Ramaphosa’s appeal stemmed from a credible commitment to resist the “state capture” of the Zuma years.5 In other words, despite a shared party brand, Ramaphosa managed to shed some of the ANC’s accumulated baggage by distancing himself from the Zuma faction. It would be an overstatement to suggest that the election was itself a referendum on the previous twenty-five years. On the other hand, the likelihood that citizens voted for the ANC was clearly associated with their views of the past, even if not in a strictly causal manner. For example, in my survey of Mogale City residents, 81 percent of Black Africans who said life was better now were also likely to say they supported the ANC. A smaller share of those who said that life was worse now also said they were supporting the ANC—but it was still 66 percent. Although far fewer Whites supported the ANC, positive views about post-Apartheid life were associated with an 11-percentage-point jump in the proportion of those reporting ANC support.6 Not surprisingly, racial dynamics were clearly at play in the election, although race and ethnicity were much less determinative of voters’ choices than many democratic theorists had once feared. For example, while both of the “big-tent” parties in terms of geographic, ethnic, and racial reach may have shed vote share, virtually all of government would remain in these parties’ respective hands after the election. Combined, the ANC and the DA took in 78.3 percent of the national vote. The ANC was no longer espousing the type of “non-racialism” it once did, but it was also still fairly moderate in its approach and certainly did not employ racially exclusionary rhetoric to attract supporters. In a country that is about 80 percent Black African, the fact that just over 50 percent of the vote went to the ANC meant that many Black voters opted for other parties. Moreover, many Whites I spoke with in and outside of Mogale said they voted for the ANC, even if it was not the party they most favored, because they preferred to see an ANC government to a coalition that might include the EFF. Indeed many Black voters went for the EFF, some for the IFP, and others for the DA. Presumably, many Zulu voters who had gone with the ANC under Zuma now returned to the IFP fold—a full 95 percent of the IFP’s votes came from the Zulu-dominant KwaZulu-Natal Province. And its only significant support in Mogale City was in Ward 15, with its substantial Zulu minority. However, the party did not perform well in other wards with sizable Zulu shares. The EFF most likely gained its support from a combination of ANC defectors and young new voters angry with the ANC for various reasons. Beyond Zulu-based support for the IFP, however, there is very little evidence supporting the idea that African language was a good predictor of party support in Mogale, Gauteng Province, or nationwide. Among Whites, the DA was still the most popular choice, but in this election, many voted for the FF+. The FF+ took in at least one-third of the White vote in the municipality.7 In seven wards, they attained 19 percent or more of the vote, including in Ward 22, where I had seen the FF+ councillor expressing confidence on election day. With Mmusi Maimane, a Black man, at the head of the DA ticket, and with other policy changes intended to attract a broader constituency, many Whites no longer felt represented by this self-avowed “non-racial” party. Moreover, FF+ support was not simply White but Afrikaner-based, reflecting the fact that the old inter-White cleavage never fully disappeared.8 Citizens had real choices, and changes in vote shares within voting districts across the country made clear that citizens were using their votes to send signals to politicians about what they did and didn’t like.9 In fact, one of the most profound findings from analysis of voting returns is the degree to which extreme levels of party support as measured at individual voting stations and at the ward level were reversed from the 2016 election. That is, both the ANC and the DA each tended to shed the most votes in the areas where they had done best and gained the most votes in the areas where they had done worst. Several other factors, discussed in the three prior chapters, also helped to predict vote choices, citizen views about how life compared now to under Apartheid, or both.10 For example, engagement in democratic practice and perceptions of quality of governance were important predictors of positive views: Black Africans were substantially more likely to say they viewed post-Apartheid life favorably if they had attended a ward committee meeting in the past month or if they said they felt a ward councillor listened to “someone like them.” Views about the post-Apartheid era and vote choices were also predicted by the material conditions in which people reported living, but the patterns were not particularly strong or even in the direction many might predict. For example, 54 percent of Black respondents who lived in a formal dwelling and had a job said life was better now; by contrast only 31 percent of those Blacks with neither a formal house nor a job said that life was better today. Among the Black Africans surveyed in Ethembalethu—the successful, subsidized housing development in Muldersdrift described in chapter 7—72 percent said life was better now. And in qualitative responses, overwhelmingly, citizens pointed to a lack of jobs and the fact that jobs were easier to get under Apartheid as reasons for selecting life was better “then.” Higher-income Blacks looked at the present more favorably than those with lower incomes. And those with an electric connection, a flush toilet in their home, and/or piped water were more likely to report that life was better now than before. The more service delivery problems people experienced, and the more they felt unsafe in their neighborhood, the more likely they were to reflect favorably on the past. While the South African government had made enormous progress in delivering basic services to millions more people than under Apartheid, millions were still waiting, and were clearly frustrated. Nonetheless, material conditions were not good predictors of ANC support among Blacks in Mogale City. For example, the same proportion of those with jobs and formal houses supported the ANC as was the case for those who lacked both (about 68 percent). Looking at actual levels of and shifts in voter support for the ANC, the picture was more mixed when considering levels of service provision and the degree of expressed concerns about service problems. In short, it was not necessarily the case that those whose lives materially improved under ANC government were the ones rewarding them with their votes relative to the rest.11 Far and away, the strongest predictor of citizen responses to the question about quality of life was how individuals reported being treated by others: by members of other race groups and by government, as well as their optimism about the viability of a rainbow nation. For Blacks who said they were treated better now by Whites compared to under Apartheid, 63 percent said life was better now. By contrast, among those who said they have been treated the same or worse by Whites, less than 19 percent said their lives were better now. (And a similar pattern holds among Whites.) Moreover, I found that Blacks were much more likely to support the ANC when they reported being treated better by members of other race groups (81 percent versus 57 percent for those who said they were treated worse). Indeed, in their more open-ended responses in which I asked respondents to elaborate on their quality-of-life concerns, many talked about the very types of race relations that the three pastors emphasized in our conversation over coffee, which I described in chapter 8. For example, a forty-four-year-old Black man talked about the present relative to the past: “Before, there were two doors in one shop for Whites and Blacks and my uncle once got beaten up for using a White door. We were not allowed to walk in the street after 19h00 [7 p.m.]. If found in the street I would be asked three questions like why aren’t you at school, work, [or] jail.” A seventy-six-year-old Black woman reflected on the question in terms of greater equality of opportunity: “Today’s life is good, we are free, we can do business freely without White people taking our stuff. We have freedom of education and we can attend school with White people.” It is not obvious why some respondents feel more respected by people from other race groups within the same geographic location. Self-reports of interracial contact or interracial friendships were themselves not predictive of how citizens described treatment by members of other race groups, nor were factors such as education, wealth, or the demographics of one’s ward. Nonetheless, it is clear that how people view the “big picture” of post-Apartheid democracy and reconciliation is very much colored by or at least predicted by their own sense of everyday treatment by government authorities and by other citizens, especially across the racial divide. The likelihood that citizens in diverse societies will experience democratic government as successful may be strongly affected by empathy for, respectful treatment by, and fellow-feeling with the “other.”12 This ought to serve as a strong reminder for political leaders of the value citizens place on dignified treatment. Of the Same Cloth: South Africa and the United States For Americans reflecting on our own elections and the factors that drive vote choices, it’s hard to avoid seeing parallels with the 2019 South African contest. Race, material conditions, and the role of views of the other are all similarly highly predictive of vote choices.13 I decided to write this book about South Africa, but admittedly, the contemporary and historical United States has loomed large as a basis for comparison. While South Africa’s Apartheid system of race relations and its precursors were more thoroughgoing, America’s long history of slavery, segregation, and other formal and informal systems of race-based discrimination is also quite profound. And although formal discriminatory structures were dismantled in both countries, informal forms of racism persist, and their legacies remain strong and almost ubiquitous. Any attempt at comparison bumps up against certain key differences between the countries, including in terms of racial demographics: throughout its history until the present, the United States has been a majority White country (even Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana are all majority White, and less than 40 percent of residents are African American). In the years after the U.S. Civil War and the end of slavery, the treatment of African Americans varied by region to a greater extent than regional variation in the implementation of Apartheid: in the American South, where most Blacks live, a form of segregation that is frequently compared with South African Apartheid persisted. The dawn of America’s multiracial experiment came thirty years earlier than South Africa’s, with the promulgation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed race-based segregation and promoted various forms of integration. As in South Africa, the civil rights era was met with a mixed response from within society, and the mere imperative to change did not translate into transformation. This is apparent today, more than fifty years later, and certainly was true in the twenty to twenty-five years after the Civil Rights Act.14 In fact, a 1985 New York Times article titled “The Races in Mississippi: Old Order and New” might just as well have been a story about present-day Mogale City. It highlighted that a local Black newspaper, the Jackson Advocate, printed an article announcing that the state had sworn in the first Black member of the state supreme court next to an article titled “Cross Burned—Youth Abducted and Beaten in Strife-Torn Durant.” The Times article juxtaposed substantial political gains against slow progress in terms of relationships and contact between the races. The fact that many people, Blacks and Whites, died so that Blacks could use a restroom in a public place or walk through the front door of a restaurant and be served is somewhat lost, or at least blurred, by the amount of change. “It’s so different from what it was that for people who’ve never experienced the other, it’s just hard to realize what has changed,” observed Frank E. Smith, who represented Mississippi in Congress for 11 years.15 Similarly, Whites and Blacks offered divergent recollections of the past: The lynchings of Blacks and denials of basic rights are part of the legacy of the state that, by far, was considered by almost all Blacks as the very toughest in the South, racism at its worst. But to many White Southerners at the time, there was nothing wrong with segregation of the races; as a matter of fact, they believed it was wrong, even immoral, for Blacks and Whites to live together, go to the same schools, socialize and marry. On politics, race remained a critical predictor of how individuals would vote: “Whites won’t vote for a Black candidate,” one politician observed. And on frustration among Blacks with not being able to lead a better life even two decades after the legal end of segregation: Many Blacks live in two- to four-room wooden shacks with tin roofs and cardboard or plastic nailed up to windows that have no panes. Only 14 percent of Tunica’s Blacks over the age of 25 have high school educations: the first high school for Blacks was not opened until 1952. Sugar Ditch Alley, a Black settlement, takes its name from a one-and-a-half-mile ditch running behind the shacks. It is there that the residents dump their human waste, for there are no indoor toilets. They may also have to walk several houses away to obtain water from an outdoor hydrant. When Americans elected the country’s first Black president, Barack Obama, in 2008, that marked a truly significant step toward redressing this history of indignities. Yet just eight years later, although more Americans voted for his opponent, Donald Trump won the election for the White House. It was eerily reminiscent of the 1948 election in South Africa, when the National Party got to take power, despite failing to win the most votes. Trump’s diatribes against people of color, foreigners, and even Africans bore more than a passing resemblance to the Nats’ fear-mongering around a “Black Peril,” and even to Paul Kruger’s White nativist orientation. The 2016 election in the United States reflected a deep lack of consensus among White Americans about our own journey toward racial integration. Moreover, despite its symbolic importance, Obama’s presidency, let alone several decades of post–civil rights politics, did not erase the racial disparities remaining in just about every dimension of American life: in terms of job opportunities, educational opportunities and attainment, life expectancies, health care and health outcomes, where people live, and who has political and economic power. As is now well known, African American men face a disturbingly high rate of incarceration and are routinely unfairly treated by the police throughout the country. Repeated indignities have fueled a movement, Black Lives Matter, whose core claim centers around a lack of equal respect for the dignity of Black people. Not surprisingly, the movement resonated in South Africa as well. Both in America and in South Africa, political resistance and democratic politics have marked many important advances for greater social justice. Looking at the present from the perspective of the segregationist American South circa 1960 or Apartheid South Africa in 1980, there’s no denying that much has changed for the better. And yet, when seen together, the history of these two countries demonstrates that institutionalized White supremacy dies hard, and their respective economies and societies continue to be defined by race-based disparities, high levels of prejudice, and conflict. Unfortunately, cycles of reproducing inequality in the form of various intergenerational transfers are extraordinarily difficult to break. Healthy, wealthy, and well-educated parents routinely transfer all of these outcomes to their children through their home environments, passing on not just assets but also human capital and social networks. The material and social-psychological legacies of past indignities are both strong and self-reinforcing, presenting perpetual new challenges in the quest for dignified development through democratic practice. We can and should acknowledge serious and persistent shortcomings and aspire for democracy to work better in both places. It is also important to consider the alternatives. As just a few examples, the catastrophic and recent plight of the Uighurs in China,16 the Rohingya in Myanmar,17 and perpetual repression in Rwanda18 all reflect what can happen to ethnic minorities and competitors in the absence of the light and protections associated with well-institutionalized democratic rule. The government assault on human rights in the non-democracies of China and Russia, including in the form of violent repression of critics,19 has been without parallel in contemporary America or South Africa. Lessons for and about Democracy and Dignified Development Are there lessons to be learned—even if more modest ones—from South Africa’s bold political experiment to launch democracy? The challenges the country faced in the early 1990s, of a racially divided and highly unequal society, were extreme but not entirely unique. Countries around the world are simultaneously becoming more diverse and more unequal, and those conditions have frequently given rise to exclusionary and populist authoritarian tendencies. How might such polities fare under more robust democratic rules? Focusing on the history of one country, it’s hard to know whether democratic practice actually caused the outcomes that followed. Was it any particular democratic institution or episode? Or a combination? Would such results hold in a different context? A case study like the one I’ve carried out here is not well designed to answer any of those questions adequately because so many changes have unfolded simultaneously. Rather, the value of the story I’ve told here—about the development of multiracial democracy in South Africa for twenty-five years after Apartheid—is more heuristic: it helps to demonstrate what is possible and plausible, including to challenge the notion that some groups simply can’t coexist or co-govern—that “ancient hatreds” will always stand in the way. And it affords the opportunity to discuss what is valuable and desirable for the good life. Others will surely disagree with my particular calculations of what went right and what wrong, and the relative import of both—but my goal has been simply to consider the record more deliberately. Looking at this past quarter century in light of South Africa’s history, patterns in other countries, and in Mogale City in particular suggests further reflection about three key areas: democratic practice, the forging of political communities, and the role government should play in helping people fulfill their aspirations for a better life. I cannot, from this study, say that the introduction or consolidation of democracy will lead to dignified development with any particular likelihood. Democratic institutions are certainly not sufficient for this outcome. Rather, I do think they are necessary. To feel truly empowered and autonomous, citizens require robust opportunities to participate in the selection of leaders and to influence policy without fear of repression. For example, Israel is one of many divided societies that continues to face existential dilemmas around who should be included, who excluded, and on what basis, and the South African experience is surely relevant. Israel had a “Mandela–De Klerk” dynamic in the form of Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, Nobel Prize winners, who signed an accord for Palestinian self-rule just days after Mandela’s election in 1994. Their negotiations were toward a “two-state” solution, but the settlement was undone by aggressions and pullbacks on both sides and, notably, the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by an Israeli extremist who resented the peace accords. While reminiscent of Chris Hani’s assassination, in the Israeli case, the murder derailed the negotiations, and after many years of repeated attempts, one noted scholar of Israeli politics concluded that the “two-state solution” appeared largely untenable.20 Maps of the Middle East, which carve out strangely shaped Palestinian territories with restrictive borders in the middle of Israel, are powerfully reminiscent of South Africa’s homeland structures, especially as the conditions within them are largely deplorable relative to the largely prosperous country that surrounds. Indeed, the term “Apartheid” has often been used to describe the nature of power and authority in Israel, even though it is met by many with grave consternation given the connotations. For many White South Africans who observe the Israeli situation, and speak despairingly of what befell their own country, they describe the South African case more as a warning rather than as a model for emulation. And such difference of interpretation is one of the main reasons I wrote this book: we need to understand what South Africa is a “case of.” Perfect? No. Nonetheless, quite successful given the conditions and the very possible alternatives, especially if one focuses on the most vulnerable segments of society. For Jews and Arabs who find it difficult to fathom a peaceful solution in which they coexist in a single democratic order, South Africa offers one critical lesson: former enemies can, in fact, live and govern relatively peacefully and productively, within the span of a generation. While it is difficult to parse out which of South Africa’s democratic institutions had what particular effects on politics and society, two general principles stand out: multiple opportunities for participation and the norm of proportionality. With respect to the first, I am reminded that on election day, many repeated the incantation, “You can’t complain if you don’t vote.” That might imply that voters are the biggest complainers. In fact, political participation was associated with more positive views of life in South Africa—and it’s hard to know whether contentedness causes political participation or the reverse. As it is in other countries, political participation is important. Because of the staggered approach to national/provincial elections and local elections, the longest period that South Africans wait between elections is three years. Moreover, high-density local governments that blanket municipalities with ward councillors and ward committees alongside a still strong and active civil society offer robust opportunities to participate, at least in urban areas. Where people participate and where political competition is high, political parties have been more responsive. While it has not been a focus of this book, democratic practice in rural areas, especially those co-governed by traditional leaders, remains underdeveloped, and with little in the way of interparty competition.21 I am also largely persuaded that the norm of proportionality, including the specific electoral institution of proportional representation—rather than a “winner-take-all” system like we have in the United States—was the right choice for South Africa. In a diverse and divided society, proportionality has offered important recognition to a wide range of people according to their identities and ideas about how government should be run. The system has also kept minority elites engaged in politics in a meaningful way, realistically keeping their hopes alive of influencing policies and key outcomes, even without large numbers of supporters. Proportionality has allowed citizens to see themselves represented in and thus to become more attached to the government. And it has opened up space for new parties, born of new ideas, to emerge, and this has contributed to a more dynamic democratic environment. Soon enough, such a system may reveal its limits. If and when the ANC is no longer able to capture a majority of the voters, and if the country is governed through coalitions, frustrations could ensue, just as they did in Mogale City following the 2016 local election. Optimistically, disparate elites could engage in workable compromise to the benefit of all. However, frustrating polarization could breed paralysis and/or potentially induce the type of opaque manipulation the ANC used to wrest control of the municipality. The ability to weather such political storms may depend on the degree to which political elites and ordinary citizens can find common ground in joint projects and a sense of shared purpose and not view the political arena as a zero-sum game. In short, formal institutions will never be enough to hold South Africa together—there must also be elite and citizen goodwill. Along these lines, the post-Apartheid “experiment” was not just about the practice of democratic politics but also about reinventing a society that had been divided by deliberate design. As in the contemporary United States, a key challenge is how to address the indignities of the past without reinforcing and reproducing the sense of deep division and difference that bred such practices in the first place. The “rainbow nation” was one solution for overcoming racial divide. Perhaps it was too hokey, too contrived to be fully embraced in a lasting manner, especially when intergroup inequalities remain so stark. Yet, all national myths are aspirational and, by design, unnuanced. Moreover, it’s difficult to discount the value that this particular idea played during the period of political transition in the mid-1990s. Echoing that early period, in November 2019, South Africa’s rugby team claimed a World Cup victory; and on that occasion, the team was more racially diverse and, for the first time, led by a Black man—Siya Kolisi—who was also outspoken in promoting an optimistic, “keep dreaming” message. The win garnered lots of favorable news coverage and offered a symbolic reminder of what the country was becoming and still could be. Could the idea stick? Not everyone was convinced. As a columnist for the largest Black newspaper, the Sowetan, argued, “Winning [the] rugby world cup doesn’t mean we’re together.”22 Nonetheless, the expressed sentiments surrounding the 2019 World Cup revealed that there remains an appetite and possibility for nation-building and the politically useful notion that “we are in this together.” Unfortunately, the development of a sense of “us” is too often built upon exclusionary and intolerant perspectives concerning who is not, or who is “them.” While it would be naive on a number of levels to suggest that fully open borders are the solution, like the United States, South Africa must square the desire to enforce such boundaries with an approach that also recognizes the dignity of foreign nationals. A cursory glance at history reminds us that many of those today seen as “foreigners” are deeply rooted in the country’s history, including having jointly suffered from the indignities of White supremacy. Relatedly, it’s worth asking whether a recently liberated people, facing significant disparities in income, wealth, and services, should really focus their attention on issues of symbolic recognition. Do statues and street and place names really matter? The color and gender of political representatives? In a recent book and related writing, Francis Fukuyama has argued that the quest for recognition can displace the more “important” political project of material advance and equitable development.23 I think Fukuyama’s argument underappreciates the quest for such recognition not simply as an end in itself but as a means for fostering efficacious and involved citizens. A sense of identity and pride are important foundations for the types of deliberate actions that breed prosperity. When people feel devalued, they are not likely to be contributing members of the community. I am not suggesting that every form of recognition is valuable or consequential, but following centuries of indignities, these are more than simply hollow symbols. They provide daily reminders of who and what are valued by their democratic society. The analyses presented throughout this book also raise the question of what role government ought to play in the economy and society in the future. To the extent that South African citizens still have a large reservoir of unmet wants and needs, they must decide whether those are best addressed through direct government action, privately, or in some combination. The global record of state-planned economies is simply too dismal to contemplate as a comprehensive solution, and the South African government has already demonstrated its limited capacity even in delivering basic services. Nonetheless, the rights orientation of the constitution has usefully enshrined a role for government to protect a fundamental respect for human dignity, both in terms of minimum standards for material living conditions and for treatment by government itself and other citizens. I admit that, like many, I was initially skeptical of the heavy rights orientation of the South African constitution when I first learned of all that was protected. How could you “guarantee” all of these social and economic benefits? I imagined that it would amount to a plethora of unfulfilled promises. And yet in practice, the language and ethos of rights have proven quite central in changing the politics of inequality in South Africa, highlighting that the previously invisible ways in which people were excluded from full participation in society were no longer acceptable. A rights orientation opened up a critical discussion of what it means to be fully human: Should free health care be a right? Free primary education? Free university education? Quality education? Access to the internet? While there is no universally accepted bundle of goods that constitutes a human minimum, and clearly, context matters, a rights orientation offers a platform for the least well-off in unequal societies, and their allies, to make strong claims to direct public resources their way in search of a more just distribution. Overcoming Cynicism There’s no denying that democracy remains fragile and messy in Mogale City and in South Africa. If the political order were to go up in flames, I would be crestfallen but not wholly surprised. From the vantage point of just over a quarter century since the end of Apartheid, it would be sheer hubris to assume that a relatively peaceful multiparty democracy will last forever. The multitude of challenges the country still faces could ultimately overwhelm the still emerging political order. However, if it does come apart, it will be one of the great tragedies of the early twenty-first century, because South Africa’s democratic order is surely one of the great accomplishments of the late twentieth. That so much is left to be done to achieve a just and prosperous society does not mean that democratic government is to blame or that much would be better under a different system, tempting as it is to wonder aloud about such options. In many ways, South Africa is just muddling along, but that in and of itself is pretty remarkable in the wake of the legacies it inherited. Moreover, in just twenty-five years the country went from laggard to leader on multiple dimensions. So much that was once thought impossible is now taken for granted. As I highlighted in chapter 3, and have shown throughout this book, one of the hallmark traits of democratic practice is the public and vociferous airing of grievances about the status quo. This is healthy and drives change. And yet when we combine this behavior with a tendency toward negativity bias, sentiment can turn cynical. I have tried to offer a reality check. Proponents of democracy’s virtues have never enjoyed a period of unwavering support for their theories. History has always generated cases of democracies gone bad and of authoritarian regimes that managed to succeed in various ways. The present period is a particularly difficult one for democracies around the world. When protesters took to the streets in countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa during the 2010s, marking a period that came to be known as the “Arab Spring,” they appeared to be paving the way for a more democratic order in the world’s most autocratic region. Among their many concerns were government corruption, lack of jobs, and economic inequality. And yet, a decade later, liberal democracy has completely failed to take root. Established democracies in every world region have come under pressure from those seeking to gain or to hold onto power through illiberal tactics, circumventing democratic procedures. In this context, South Africa needs to be understood as the largely successful case that it is, and it is fair to say that democracy saved South Africa from a fate that could have been quite disastrous given where the country was headed. The fact that it can be largely successful here does not tell us that it will work the same way everywhere, but it provides an important heuristic for what’s possible and lessons for plural societies. Was this just a fluke of history? To be certain, following the wave of multiparty elections endeavored mostly during the decade of the 1990s, very few African countries developed robust democratic institutions and practices.24 And yet, those that did offer analogous lessons to what I found in South Africa. Citizens of Cape Verde, Ghana, Botswana, Benin, Senegal, Namibia, and others have benefited from democratic practice relative to the largely disastrous experience of authoritarian rule in neighboring countries on the continent. The politics and policies of these other African democracies are similarly imperfect, and their domestic critics similarly numerous and vociferous. Nonetheless, they also have much to share in terms of the virtues of political freedom, including with respect to dignified treatment, that were previously available only to small minorities. Progress requires the constant readjustment and ratcheting of hopes and dreams. In practice, especially within democratic systems, this means never accepting the status quo as fully satisfactory, and at least rhetorically dismissing the past and the present as unacceptable. But sometimes progress must be measured and appreciated. For generations, Black South Africans, from Sol Plaatje to Desmond Tutu to Chris Hani to Nelson Mandela, as well as the freedom fighters in Munsieville, Kagiso, and beyond, all labored to free themselves and their society from the shackles of institutionalized White supremacy and Apartheid. And they succeeded. When the Congress of the People gathered to read the Freedom Charter in 1955, few South Africans or outside observers would have predicted a day when so many of their aspirations would be largely fulfilled: irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability, South Africans of 2019 were all clearly citizens, not subjects. Political leaders had to come to them asking for their votes, appealing to their sense of what was right and fair. Democracy in South Africa is working: it is becoming more competitive; people are living better lives with more dignity; citizens are advancing their interests in a range of democratic channels—through the vote, in the media, in citizen campaigns, in the courts, and in their growing confidence of what it means to be a democratic citizen. Their story leaves me hopeful.",

      "content": "9 The Final Tallies SOUTH AFRICA’S WINTER sun was already setting by the time I arrived back at my Krugersdorp guesthouse, the Rabbit Hole, a little after 5 p.m. on May 8. The polls for the 2019 election would officially close in less than four hours. I parked my car in one of the covered spots, a late attempt to shield it from further aviary attack. When I returned to my room, I kept my jacket on and fired up the electric space heater, as a cool day had turned into a cold night. And now it was time to learn what the South Africans had collectively decided about this election and to reflect on the broader democratic experiment in this divided society. The television was filled with scenes much like the ones I had witnessed earlier: people waiting in lines, usually short ones, and emerging from voting booths more or less happy to have done their civic duty. Various commentators, election commission officials, and police officers addressed concerns that had been raised throughout the day. One video of a lone man in Limpopo Province carrying a voting box, presumably with nefarious intent, had gone viral. A few polling stations never opened, and a few others ran out of ballots. In response, the officials credibly assured the public that these had been isolated incidents, and in their estimation, it had been a valid election. Some of the smaller parties nonetheless raised charges of unfair electoral procedures and threatened legal action against the state. I was immediately skeptical of the veracity of these challenges because in order to appear on the ballot, each party had to put up 200,000 rand for the national election, and/or 45,000 for the provincial one, and if they didn’t win at least one seat, the money was not returned. Such policies were designed to discourage extremely low-support organizations from overwhelming the ballot list. The IEC might not have liked all the headaches associated with the 48 parties in the national contest, but at least they got to keep over 16 million rand (at the time, about a million U.S. dollars) worth of deposits from the losers.1 The IEC promised the results would be available no later than Saturday, and counting began immediately on that Wednesday evening. By the middle of the day after the election, the numbers were showing that the ANC was in strong shape to win the national election, albeit with the universally predicted diminished majority. Gauteng Province, however, was a nail-biter. One interim count had the ruling party at 49.5 percent, and I imagined emotions at various party headquarters were running high: if the ANC just barely failed to get a majority, at least one small party might realize its dream of becoming a “king-maker” in a coalition government. Meanwhile, confirming preelection polls, the DA was already looking like the big loser relative to their high hopes following years of upward growth. While the country was still in electoral purgatory awaiting final results, I went to follow up with several of the people I had gotten to know around Mogale City over the previous five months to get their take. I had spent a lot of time over at the Krugersdorp News, talking to reporters and looking through their old bound volumes. I emailed the editor and asked if I could chat with her and a few of the reporters about what everyone had observed and heard, and I would share my impressions as well. She kindly accepted, and I went to the newsroom in the morning with a bag of baked goods, my own form of enticement in exchange for their time. When I arrived, the newsroom was full—she had invited all of the reporters and a bunch from their sister newspaper, the Roodepoort Record, owned by the same company, to participate. As I sat down at the head of a long table, I faced several cameras atop tripods: in a world of social media all the time, they broadcast the meeting live on Facebook. I learned that on election day, the reporters had divided up the municipality; and as I had done, they interviewed voters as they exited the polling stations. Their stories and impressions of a largely smooth election confirmed what I had heard. Unlike me, the staff members also participated in the vote and could share their personal experiences. “For me, this election was kind of big,” said one reporter. “I thought this was going to be a watershed election.” Another said, “People were optimistic for change. People wanted change.… I think they wanted the change … [but] it doesn’t look like anything big will happen.” When it came to the role of race in politics, the reporters were not of one mind and clearly varied according to their own racial identities. Most of the Krugersdorp News reporters were White, and one said she wondered if this was the election in which the country could finally “get past” race. A Black reporter who had visited the upscale and largely White neighborhood of Ruimsig said, “I noticed that the racial tension was there … maybe they didn’t want to talk with a Black journalist.” I asked the reporters whether they felt they cover enough good news in Mogale City. Did the fact that they tend to write about what fails leave citizens more skeptical than the reality warranted? What about Ethembalethu? I initially faced a room of blank stares, as most were unaware of the place that was on my mind. One Black reporter confirmed he had been there, described it, and agreed that it was a successful community. Another reporter mentioned that the News did cover a more recent story of the handover of 100 RDP houses, but yet another asked if it was right to give a pat on the back to government for delivering 100 houses after twenty-five years. The editor added that they do cover some good news stories, including of people reaching out in positive ways to members of other communities, which was true. I thanked them for their time, knowing they had a newspaper to put out, and headed over to the Mogale City Council Speaker’s office to discuss her views about the election. I had met with Noluthando Mangole a few times on prior trips, and I knew she’d be working hard on this election. Though slight in stature, she was usually big on energy and presence. On this day, she seemed tired and down, even as she was fully decked out in ANC regalia, with her hair covered in a green and gold ANC scarf. “It was hectic,” she uttered a common South African expression. “To a large extent, Mogale City seemed not to have performed quite well in Gauteng and the results seem to be so low.” She complained of the problem of factions within the party, which affect daily governance in the municipality and the coordination of the campaign. She said she was surprised and a bit disappointed that there had not been any rallies in Mogale City. “In previous years, we used to have rallies around here. But resources were a bit of a challenge this time around.” Despite Mangole’s pessimistic tone, by midday Saturday, it was official: the election was declared “free and fair,” and for all the excitement, the talk of political change, the effective balance of power remained exactly as it had been: Ramaphosa would continue on as president of the country, as the ANC secured 57.5 percent of the national proportional representation vote. Eight of the nine provinces, including Gauteng with its just barely enough 50.1 percent of the votes, went to the ANC. Considering the results in Mogale City, the municipality proved, once again, to be broadly reflective of trends in Gauteng, and in South Africa more generally, albeit weighted toward its proportionally larger White and Afrikaans-speaking population. And in fact, the ANC did better than the Speaker lamented to me when we met in her office that Friday afternoon, receiving 52.1 percent of the votes cast in the municipality. Although ANC leaders were disappointed to be shedding seats in national and provincial legislatures, implying fewer key jobs for party insiders and evidence of the erosion of their electoral dominance, they had to be relieved. Like any election, at least in the near term, it was a success for the winners and viewed as the opposite for the losers. The question for the longer term is whether such competitive practice and the other trappings of democracy benefit the larger whole, particularly with respect to dignified development. I address such questions in the remainder of this conclusory chapter. First, I consider what we can learn from this particular election with respect to the hopes and concerns of prior decades and as documented in earlier chapters. Second, I discuss the South African case in relation to the analogous American experiment with post–civil rights desegregation, drawing many key parallels. And finally, I try to extract some lessons about democratic practice amid diversity from all that we’ve learned in this investigation, for South Africa and other divided societies. Done and Dusted: Another Election in the Books The May 2019 election was a fitting bookend to the first quarter century of democratic government. Electoral performance is shaped by many factors, and no vote tally can offer a fully clear or complete mandate concerning the “will of the people.” Nonetheless, the election conveyed a great deal of information about citizens’ wants and needs, it reflected the further routinization of liberal democracy, and it offered a feedback mechanism for reinforcing gains in dignified development. First of all, it does appear that the contest was indeed free and fair, and its legitimacy was essentially unchallenged. It’s impossible to know for sure the extent of irregularities, but few were reported, and those that were brought to light could not have materially affected the results. Back in Mogale City, the election mostly went well, though not perfectly. A non-trivial 8.5 percent of Black Africans said that they had been threatened with violence in the weeks leading up to the election. And it was almost double that in Munsieville’s Ward 27. Almost no one reported having been offered money for their votes. But about 10 percent of Black Africans said that in the weeks prior to the election, representatives from a political party had bought groceries for them. Threats of violence were clearly undemocratic, but grocery parcels struck me as fair game in a democratic polity so long as there was no explicit or enforceable quid pro quo in the form of votes.2 However, as expected, especially with the chilly and rainy weather I experienced on election day—and which blanketed much of the country—turnout was disappointing. Just 66.1 percent of the registered voters cast their ballots, and only about 3 of 4 citizens eligible to vote were registered. The turnout metric according to voting age population was under 47 percent, which is low by international standards, particularly as compared with 1999 when more than 70 percent of eligible voters actually voted.3 It was a middling performance compared to other African countries’ turnout in recent years.4 Second, the election reflected that South African politics was becoming more competitive. The ANC was still strong, but the results offered more evidence that the country had not become the one-party state that some feared as an inevitable fate. It was the ANC’s worst showing in a national election, while several small parties enjoyed substantial gains. Despite its several-year rise, the DA was not the prime beneficiary of the ANC’s losses. The party would remain as official opposition with 20.8 percent of the national vote and 24.6 percent of the Mogale vote, but this was a substantial drop-off from 2014, when they received 22.2 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The DA’s support in the Western Cape was also diminished, but they still received enough votes to remain in charge of that province. By contrast, the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+ enjoyed the biggest gains nationally, albeit from much smaller bases. Only six years old, the EFF took in 10.8 percent of the national vote and was massively successful in Mogale, with 12 percent. Next was the IFP with 3.4 percent, which also marked an increase from the prior election. And the FF+ made big gains from less than 1 percent to 2.4 percent nationally, while in Mogale their vote share was a substantial 7.1 percent. Increased representation of several parties implied more inclusion and pluralism. Yet, the implications of growing support for these particular parties—the EFF, the IFP, and the FF+—was double-edged, because each had advocated ethnic autonomy or even exclusion during the campaign. They might not have said so explicitly in their party manifestoes, but these parties had defined themselves in terms of particular racial or ethnic groups, and together, they doubled their combined 8.3 percent vote share from the 2014 national election to 16.6 percent in 2019. While the ANC’s decline was notable, the election could also be seen in a slightly different light: given widespread perceptions of poor performance and reports of corruption filling the airwaves in the months prior, as well as some polls showing that they might not win a majority of votes, the ANC also exceeded many expectations. One plausible interpretation is that Ramaphosa’s appeal stemmed from a credible commitment to resist the “state capture” of the Zuma years.5 In other words, despite a shared party brand, Ramaphosa managed to shed some of the ANC’s accumulated baggage by distancing himself from the Zuma faction. It would be an overstatement to suggest that the election was itself a referendum on the previous twenty-five years. On the other hand, the likelihood that citizens voted for the ANC was clearly associated with their views of the past, even if not in a strictly causal manner. For example, in my survey of Mogale City residents, 81 percent of Black Africans who said life was better now were also likely to say they supported the ANC. A smaller share of those who said that life was worse now also said they were supporting the ANC—but it was still 66 percent. Although far fewer Whites supported the ANC, positive views about post-Apartheid life were associated with an 11-percentage-point jump in the proportion of those reporting ANC support.6 Not surprisingly, racial dynamics were clearly at play in the election, although race and ethnicity were much less determinative of voters’ choices than many democratic theorists had once feared. For example, while both of the “big-tent” parties in terms of geographic, ethnic, and racial reach may have shed vote share, virtually all of government would remain in these parties’ respective hands after the election. Combined, the ANC and the DA took in 78.3 percent of the national vote. The ANC was no longer espousing the type of “non-racialism” it once did, but it was also still fairly moderate in its approach and certainly did not employ racially exclusionary rhetoric to attract supporters. In a country that is about 80 percent Black African, the fact that just over 50 percent of the vote went to the ANC meant that many Black voters opted for other parties. Moreover, many Whites I spoke with in and outside of Mogale said they voted for the ANC, even if it was not the party they most favored, because they preferred to see an ANC government to a coalition that might include the EFF. Indeed many Black voters went for the EFF, some for the IFP, and others for the DA. Presumably, many Zulu voters who had gone with the ANC under Zuma now returned to the IFP fold—a full 95 percent of the IFP’s votes came from the Zulu-dominant KwaZulu-Natal Province. And its only significant support in Mogale City was in Ward 15, with its substantial Zulu minority. However, the party did not perform well in other wards with sizable Zulu shares. The EFF most likely gained its support from a combination of ANC defectors and young new voters angry with the ANC for various reasons. Beyond Zulu-based support for the IFP, however, there is very little evidence supporting the idea that African language was a good predictor of party support in Mogale, Gauteng Province, or nationwide. Among Whites, the DA was still the most popular choice, but in this election, many voted for the FF+. The FF+ took in at least one-third of the White vote in the municipality.7 In seven wards, they attained 19 percent or more of the vote, including in Ward 22, where I had seen the FF+ councillor expressing confidence on election day. With Mmusi Maimane, a Black man, at the head of the DA ticket, and with other policy changes intended to attract a broader constituency, many Whites no longer felt represented by this self-avowed “non-racial” party. Moreover, FF+ support was not simply White but Afrikaner-based, reflecting the fact that the old inter-White cleavage never fully disappeared.8 Citizens had real choices, and changes in vote shares within voting districts across the country made clear that citizens were using their votes to send signals to politicians about what they did and didn’t like.9 In fact, one of the most profound findings from analysis of voting returns is the degree to which extreme levels of party support as measured at individual voting stations and at the ward level were reversed from the 2016 election. That is, both the ANC and the DA each tended to shed the most votes in the areas where they had done best and gained the most votes in the areas where they had done worst. Several other factors, discussed in the three prior chapters, also helped to predict vote choices, citizen views about how life compared now to under Apartheid, or both.10 For example, engagement in democratic practice and perceptions of quality of governance were important predictors of positive views: Black Africans were substantially more likely to say they viewed post-Apartheid life favorably if they had attended a ward committee meeting in the past month or if they said they felt a ward councillor listened to “someone like them.” Views about the post-Apartheid era and vote choices were also predicted by the material conditions in which people reported living, but the patterns were not particularly strong or even in the direction many might predict. For example, 54 percent of Black respondents who lived in a formal dwelling and had a job said life was better now; by contrast only 31 percent of those Blacks with neither a formal house nor a job said that life was better today. Among the Black Africans surveyed in Ethembalethu—the successful, subsidized housing development in Muldersdrift described in chapter 7—72 percent said life was better now. And in qualitative responses, overwhelmingly, citizens pointed to a lack of jobs and the fact that jobs were easier to get under Apartheid as reasons for selecting life was better “then.” Higher-income Blacks looked at the present more favorably than those with lower incomes. And those with an electric connection, a flush toilet in their home, and/or piped water were more likely to report that life was better now than before. The more service delivery problems people experienced, and the more they felt unsafe in their neighborhood, the more likely they were to reflect favorably on the past. While the South African government had made enormous progress in delivering basic services to millions more people than under Apartheid, millions were still waiting, and were clearly frustrated. Nonetheless, material conditions were not good predictors of ANC support among Blacks in Mogale City. For example, the same proportion of those with jobs and formal houses supported the ANC as was the case for those who lacked both (about 68 percent). Looking at actual levels of and shifts in voter support for the ANC, the picture was more mixed when considering levels of service provision and the degree of expressed concerns about service problems. In short, it was not necessarily the case that those whose lives materially improved under ANC government were the ones rewarding them with their votes relative to the rest.11 Far and away, the strongest predictor of citizen responses to the question about quality of life was how individuals reported being treated by others: by members of other race groups and by government, as well as their optimism about the viability of a rainbow nation. For Blacks who said they were treated better now by Whites compared to under Apartheid, 63 percent said life was better now. By contrast, among those who said they have been treated the same or worse by Whites, less than 19 percent said their lives were better now. (And a similar pattern holds among Whites.) Moreover, I found that Blacks were much more likely to support the ANC when they reported being treated better by members of other race groups (81 percent versus 57 percent for those who said they were treated worse). Indeed, in their more open-ended responses in which I asked respondents to elaborate on their quality-of-life concerns, many talked about the very types of race relations that the three pastors emphasized in our conversation over coffee, which I described in chapter 8. For example, a forty-four-year-old Black man talked about the present relative to the past: “Before, there were two doors in one shop for Whites and Blacks and my uncle once got beaten up for using a White door. We were not allowed to walk in the street after 19h00 [7 p.m.]. If found in the street I would be asked three questions like why aren’t you at school, work, [or] jail.” A seventy-six-year-old Black woman reflected on the question in terms of greater equality of opportunity: “Today’s life is good, we are free, we can do business freely without White people taking our stuff. We have freedom of education and we can attend school with White people.” It is not obvious why some respondents feel more respected by people from other race groups within the same geographic location. Self-reports of interracial contact or interracial friendships were themselves not predictive of how citizens described treatment by members of other race groups, nor were factors such as education, wealth, or the demographics of one’s ward. Nonetheless, it is clear that how people view the “big picture” of post-Apartheid democracy and reconciliation is very much colored by or at least predicted by their own sense of everyday treatment by government authorities and by other citizens, especially across the racial divide. The likelihood that citizens in diverse societies will experience democratic government as successful may be strongly affected by empathy for, respectful treatment by, and fellow-feeling with the “other.”12 This ought to serve as a strong reminder for political leaders of the value citizens place on dignified treatment. Of the Same Cloth: South Africa and the United States For Americans reflecting on our own elections and the factors that drive vote choices, it’s hard to avoid seeing parallels with the 2019 South African contest. Race, material conditions, and the role of views of the other are all similarly highly predictive of vote choices.13 I decided to write this book about South Africa, but admittedly, the contemporary and historical United States has loomed large as a basis for comparison. While South Africa’s Apartheid system of race relations and its precursors were more thoroughgoing, America’s long history of slavery, segregation, and other formal and informal systems of race-based discrimination is also quite profound. And although formal discriminatory structures were dismantled in both countries, informal forms of racism persist, and their legacies remain strong and almost ubiquitous. Any attempt at comparison bumps up against certain key differences between the countries, including in terms of racial demographics: throughout its history until the present, the United States has been a majority White country (even Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana are all majority White, and less than 40 percent of residents are African American). In the years after the U.S. Civil War and the end of slavery, the treatment of African Americans varied by region to a greater extent than regional variation in the implementation of Apartheid: in the American South, where most Blacks live, a form of segregation that is frequently compared with South African Apartheid persisted. The dawn of America’s multiracial experiment came thirty years earlier than South Africa’s, with the promulgation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed race-based segregation and promoted various forms of integration. As in South Africa, the civil rights era was met with a mixed response from within society, and the mere imperative to change did not translate into transformation. This is apparent today, more than fifty years later, and certainly was true in the twenty to twenty-five years after the Civil Rights Act.14 In fact, a 1985 New York Times article titled “The Races in Mississippi: Old Order and New” might just as well have been a story about present-day Mogale City. It highlighted that a local Black newspaper, the Jackson Advocate, printed an article announcing that the state had sworn in the first Black member of the state supreme court next to an article titled “Cross Burned—Youth Abducted and Beaten in Strife-Torn Durant.” The Times article juxtaposed substantial political gains against slow progress in terms of relationships and contact between the races. The fact that many people, Blacks and Whites, died so that Blacks could use a restroom in a public place or walk through the front door of a restaurant and be served is somewhat lost, or at least blurred, by the amount of change. “It’s so different from what it was that for people who’ve never experienced the other, it’s just hard to realize what has changed,” observed Frank E. Smith, who represented Mississippi in Congress for 11 years.15 Similarly, Whites and Blacks offered divergent recollections of the past: The lynchings of Blacks and denials of basic rights are part of the legacy of the state that, by far, was considered by almost all Blacks as the very toughest in the South, racism at its worst. But to many White Southerners at the time, there was nothing wrong with segregation of the races; as a matter of fact, they believed it was wrong, even immoral, for Blacks and Whites to live together, go to the same schools, socialize and marry. On politics, race remained a critical predictor of how individuals would vote: “Whites won’t vote for a Black candidate,” one politician observed. And on frustration among Blacks with not being able to lead a better life even two decades after the legal end of segregation: Many Blacks live in two- to four-room wooden shacks with tin roofs and cardboard or plastic nailed up to windows that have no panes. Only 14 percent of Tunica’s Blacks over the age of 25 have high school educations: the first high school for Blacks was not opened until 1952. Sugar Ditch Alley, a Black settlement, takes its name from a one-and-a-half-mile ditch running behind the shacks. It is there that the residents dump their human waste, for there are no indoor toilets. They may also have to walk several houses away to obtain water from an outdoor hydrant. When Americans elected the country’s first Black president, Barack Obama, in 2008, that marked a truly significant step toward redressing this history of indignities. Yet just eight years later, although more Americans voted for his opponent, Donald Trump won the election for the White House. It was eerily reminiscent of the 1948 election in South Africa, when the National Party got to take power, despite failing to win the most votes. Trump’s diatribes against people of color, foreigners, and even Africans bore more than a passing resemblance to the Nats’ fear-mongering around a “Black Peril,” and even to Paul Kruger’s White nativist orientation. The 2016 election in the United States reflected a deep lack of consensus among White Americans about our own journey toward racial integration. Moreover, despite its symbolic importance, Obama’s presidency, let alone several decades of post–civil rights politics, did not erase the racial disparities remaining in just about every dimension of American life: in terms of job opportunities, educational opportunities and attainment, life expectancies, health care and health outcomes, where people live, and who has political and economic power. As is now well known, African American men face a disturbingly high rate of incarceration and are routinely unfairly treated by the police throughout the country. Repeated indignities have fueled a movement, Black Lives Matter, whose core claim centers around a lack of equal respect for the dignity of Black people. Not surprisingly, the movement resonated in South Africa as well. Both in America and in South Africa, political resistance and democratic politics have marked many important advances for greater social justice. Looking at the present from the perspective of the segregationist American South circa 1960 or Apartheid South Africa in 1980, there’s no denying that much has changed for the better. And yet, when seen together, the history of these two countries demonstrates that institutionalized White supremacy dies hard, and their respective economies and societies continue to be defined by race-based disparities, high levels of prejudice, and conflict. Unfortunately, cycles of reproducing inequality in the form of various intergenerational transfers are extraordinarily difficult to break. Healthy, wealthy, and well-educated parents routinely transfer all of these outcomes to their children through their home environments, passing on not just assets but also human capital and social networks. The material and social-psychological legacies of past indignities are both strong and self-reinforcing, presenting perpetual new challenges in the quest for dignified development through democratic practice. We can and should acknowledge serious and persistent shortcomings and aspire for democracy to work better in both places. It is also important to consider the alternatives. As just a few examples, the catastrophic and recent plight of the Uighurs in China,16 the Rohingya in Myanmar,17 and perpetual repression in Rwanda18 all reflect what can happen to ethnic minorities and competitors in the absence of the light and protections associated with well-institutionalized democratic rule. The government assault on human rights in the non-democracies of China and Russia, including in the form of violent repression of critics,19 has been without parallel in contemporary America or South Africa. Lessons for and about Democracy and Dignified Development Are there lessons to be learned—even if more modest ones—from South Africa’s bold political experiment to launch democracy? The challenges the country faced in the early 1990s, of a racially divided and highly unequal society, were extreme but not entirely unique. Countries around the world are simultaneously becoming more diverse and more unequal, and those conditions have frequently given rise to exclusionary and populist authoritarian tendencies. How might such polities fare under more robust democratic rules? Focusing on the history of one country, it’s hard to know whether democratic practice actually caused the outcomes that followed. Was it any particular democratic institution or episode? Or a combination? Would such results hold in a different context? A case study like the one I’ve carried out here is not well designed to answer any of those questions adequately because so many changes have unfolded simultaneously. Rather, the value of the story I’ve told here—about the development of multiracial democracy in South Africa for twenty-five years after Apartheid—is more heuristic: it helps to demonstrate what is possible and plausible, including to challenge the notion that some groups simply can’t coexist or co-govern—that “ancient hatreds” will always stand in the way. And it affords the opportunity to discuss what is valuable and desirable for the good life. Others will surely disagree with my particular calculations of what went right and what wrong, and the relative import of both—but my goal has been simply to consider the record more deliberately. Looking at this past quarter century in light of South Africa’s history, patterns in other countries, and in Mogale City in particular suggests further reflection about three key areas: democratic practice, the forging of political communities, and the role government should play in helping people fulfill their aspirations for a better life. I cannot, from this study, say that the introduction or consolidation of democracy will lead to dignified development with any particular likelihood. Democratic institutions are certainly not sufficient for this outcome. Rather, I do think they are necessary. To feel truly empowered and autonomous, citizens require robust opportunities to participate in the selection of leaders and to influence policy without fear of repression. For example, Israel is one of many divided societies that continues to face existential dilemmas around who should be included, who excluded, and on what basis, and the South African experience is surely relevant. Israel had a “Mandela–De Klerk” dynamic in the form of Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, Nobel Prize winners, who signed an accord for Palestinian self-rule just days after Mandela’s election in 1994. Their negotiations were toward a “two-state” solution, but the settlement was undone by aggressions and pullbacks on both sides and, notably, the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by an Israeli extremist who resented the peace accords. While reminiscent of Chris Hani’s assassination, in the Israeli case, the murder derailed the negotiations, and after many years of repeated attempts, one noted scholar of Israeli politics concluded that the “two-state solution” appeared largely untenable.20 Maps of the Middle East, which carve out strangely shaped Palestinian territories with restrictive borders in the middle of Israel, are powerfully reminiscent of South Africa’s homeland structures, especially as the conditions within them are largely deplorable relative to the largely prosperous country that surrounds. Indeed, the term “Apartheid” has often been used to describe the nature of power and authority in Israel, even though it is met by many with grave consternation given the connotations. For many White South Africans who observe the Israeli situation, and speak despairingly of what befell their own country, they describe the South African case more as a warning rather than as a model for emulation. And such difference of interpretation is one of the main reasons I wrote this book: we need to understand what South Africa is a “case of.” Perfect? No. Nonetheless, quite successful given the conditions and the very possible alternatives, especially if one focuses on the most vulnerable segments of society. For Jews and Arabs who find it difficult to fathom a peaceful solution in which they coexist in a single democratic order, South Africa offers one critical lesson: former enemies can, in fact, live and govern relatively peacefully and productively, within the span of a generation. While it is difficult to parse out which of South Africa’s democratic institutions had what particular effects on politics and society, two general principles stand out: multiple opportunities for participation and the norm of proportionality. With respect to the first, I am reminded that on election day, many repeated the incantation, “You can’t complain if you don’t vote.” That might imply that voters are the biggest complainers. In fact, political participation was associated with more positive views of life in South Africa—and it’s hard to know whether contentedness causes political participation or the reverse. As it is in other countries, political participation is important. Because of the staggered approach to national/provincial elections and local elections, the longest period that South Africans wait between elections is three years. Moreover, high-density local governments that blanket municipalities with ward councillors and ward committees alongside a still strong and active civil society offer robust opportunities to participate, at least in urban areas. Where people participate and where political competition is high, political parties have been more responsive. While it has not been a focus of this book, democratic practice in rural areas, especially those co-governed by traditional leaders, remains underdeveloped, and with little in the way of interparty competition.21 I am also largely persuaded that the norm of proportionality, including the specific electoral institution of proportional representation—rather than a “winner-take-all” system like we have in the United States—was the right choice for South Africa. In a diverse and divided society, proportionality has offered important recognition to a wide range of people according to their identities and ideas about how government should be run. The system has also kept minority elites engaged in politics in a meaningful way, realistically keeping their hopes alive of influencing policies and key outcomes, even without large numbers of supporters. Proportionality has allowed citizens to see themselves represented in and thus to become more attached to the government. And it has opened up space for new parties, born of new ideas, to emerge, and this has contributed to a more dynamic democratic environment. Soon enough, such a system may reveal its limits. If and when the ANC is no longer able to capture a majority of the voters, and if the country is governed through coalitions, frustrations could ensue, just as they did in Mogale City following the 2016 local election. Optimistically, disparate elites could engage in workable compromise to the benefit of all. However, frustrating polarization could breed paralysis and/or potentially induce the type of opaque manipulation the ANC used to wrest control of the municipality. The ability to weather such political storms may depend on the degree to which political elites and ordinary citizens can find common ground in joint projects and a sense of shared purpose and not view the political arena as a zero-sum game. In short, formal institutions will never be enough to hold South Africa together—there must also be elite and citizen goodwill. Along these lines, the post-Apartheid “experiment” was not just about the practice of democratic politics but also about reinventing a society that had been divided by deliberate design. As in the contemporary United States, a key challenge is how to address the indignities of the past without reinforcing and reproducing the sense of deep division and difference that bred such practices in the first place. The “rainbow nation” was one solution for overcoming racial divide. Perhaps it was too hokey, too contrived to be fully embraced in a lasting manner, especially when intergroup inequalities remain so stark. Yet, all national myths are aspirational and, by design, unnuanced. Moreover, it’s difficult to discount the value that this particular idea played during the period of political transition in the mid-1990s. Echoing that early period, in November 2019, South Africa’s rugby team claimed a World Cup victory; and on that occasion, the team was more racially diverse and, for the first time, led by a Black man—Siya Kolisi—who was also outspoken in promoting an optimistic, “keep dreaming” message. The win garnered lots of favorable news coverage and offered a symbolic reminder of what the country was becoming and still could be. Could the idea stick? Not everyone was convinced. As a columnist for the largest Black newspaper, the Sowetan, argued, “Winning [the] rugby world cup doesn’t mean we’re together.”22 Nonetheless, the expressed sentiments surrounding the 2019 World Cup revealed that there remains an appetite and possibility for nation-building and the politically useful notion that “we are in this together.” Unfortunately, the development of a sense of “us” is too often built upon exclusionary and intolerant perspectives concerning who is not, or who is “them.” While it would be naive on a number of levels to suggest that fully open borders are the solution, like the United States, South Africa must square the desire to enforce such boundaries with an approach that also recognizes the dignity of foreign nationals. A cursory glance at history reminds us that many of those today seen as “foreigners” are deeply rooted in the country’s history, including having jointly suffered from the indignities of White supremacy. Relatedly, it’s worth asking whether a recently liberated people, facing significant disparities in income, wealth, and services, should really focus their attention on issues of symbolic recognition. Do statues and street and place names really matter? The color and gender of political representatives? In a recent book and related writing, Francis Fukuyama has argued that the quest for recognition can displace the more “important” political project of material advance and equitable development.23 I think Fukuyama’s argument underappreciates the quest for such recognition not simply as an end in itself but as a means for fostering efficacious and involved citizens. A sense of identity and pride are important foundations for the types of deliberate actions that breed prosperity. When people feel devalued, they are not likely to be contributing members of the community. I am not suggesting that every form of recognition is valuable or consequential, but following centuries of indignities, these are more than simply hollow symbols. They provide daily reminders of who and what are valued by their democratic society. The analyses presented throughout this book also raise the question of what role government ought to play in the economy and society in the future. To the extent that South African citizens still have a large reservoir of unmet wants and needs, they must decide whether those are best addressed through direct government action, privately, or in some combination. The global record of state-planned economies is simply too dismal to contemplate as a comprehensive solution, and the South African government has already demonstrated its limited capacity even in delivering basic services. Nonetheless, the rights orientation of the constitution has usefully enshrined a role for government to protect a fundamental respect for human dignity, both in terms of minimum standards for material living conditions and for treatment by government itself and other citizens. I admit that, like many, I was initially skeptical of the heavy rights orientation of the South African constitution when I first learned of all that was protected. How could you “guarantee” all of these social and economic benefits? I imagined that it would amount to a plethora of unfulfilled promises. And yet in practice, the language and ethos of rights have proven quite central in changing the politics of inequality in South Africa, highlighting that the previously invisible ways in which people were excluded from full participation in society were no longer acceptable. A rights orientation opened up a critical discussion of what it means to be fully human: Should free health care be a right? Free primary education? Free university education? Quality education? Access to the internet? While there is no universally accepted bundle of goods that constitutes a human minimum, and clearly, context matters, a rights orientation offers a platform for the least well-off in unequal societies, and their allies, to make strong claims to direct public resources their way in search of a more just distribution. Overcoming Cynicism There’s no denying that democracy remains fragile and messy in Mogale City and in South Africa. If the political order were to go up in flames, I would be crestfallen but not wholly surprised. From the vantage point of just over a quarter century since the end of Apartheid, it would be sheer hubris to assume that a relatively peaceful multiparty democracy will last forever. The multitude of challenges the country still faces could ultimately overwhelm the still emerging political order. However, if it does come apart, it will be one of the great tragedies of the early twenty-first century, because South Africa’s democratic order is surely one of the great accomplishments of the late twentieth. That so much is left to be done to achieve a just and prosperous society does not mean that democratic government is to blame or that much would be better under a different system, tempting as it is to wonder aloud about such options. In many ways, South Africa is just muddling along, but that in and of itself is pretty remarkable in the wake of the legacies it inherited. Moreover, in just twenty-five years the country went from laggard to leader on multiple dimensions. So much that was once thought impossible is now taken for granted. As I highlighted in chapter 3, and have shown throughout this book, one of the hallmark traits of democratic practice is the public and vociferous airing of grievances about the status quo. This is healthy and drives change. And yet when we combine this behavior with a tendency toward negativity bias, sentiment can turn cynical. I have tried to offer a reality check. Proponents of democracy’s virtues have never enjoyed a period of unwavering support for their theories. History has always generated cases of democracies gone bad and of authoritarian regimes that managed to succeed in various ways. The present period is a particularly difficult one for democracies around the world. When protesters took to the streets in countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa during the 2010s, marking a period that came to be known as the “Arab Spring,” they appeared to be paving the way for a more democratic order in the world’s most autocratic region. Among their many concerns were government corruption, lack of jobs, and economic inequality. And yet, a decade later, liberal democracy has completely failed to take root. Established democracies in every world region have come under pressure from those seeking to gain or to hold onto power through illiberal tactics, circumventing democratic procedures. In this context, South Africa needs to be understood as the largely successful case that it is, and it is fair to say that democracy saved South Africa from a fate that could have been quite disastrous given where the country was headed. The fact that it can be largely successful here does not tell us that it will work the same way everywhere, but it provides an important heuristic for what’s possible and lessons for plural societies. Was this just a fluke of history? To be certain, following the wave of multiparty elections endeavored mostly during the decade of the 1990s, very few African countries developed robust democratic institutions and practices.24 And yet, those that did offer analogous lessons to what I found in South Africa. Citizens of Cape Verde, Ghana, Botswana, Benin, Senegal, Namibia, and others have benefited from democratic practice relative to the largely disastrous experience of authoritarian rule in neighboring countries on the continent. The politics and policies of these other African democracies are similarly imperfect, and their domestic critics similarly numerous and vociferous. Nonetheless, they also have much to share in terms of the virtues of political freedom, including with respect to dignified treatment, that were previously available only to small minorities. Progress requires the constant readjustment and ratcheting of hopes and dreams. In practice, especially within democratic systems, this means never accepting the status quo as fully satisfactory, and at least rhetorically dismissing the past and the present as unacceptable. But sometimes progress must be measured and appreciated. For generations, Black South Africans, from Sol Plaatje to Desmond Tutu to Chris Hani to Nelson Mandela, as well as the freedom fighters in Munsieville, Kagiso, and beyond, all labored to free themselves and their society from the shackles of institutionalized White supremacy and Apartheid. And they succeeded. When the Congress of the People gathered to read the Freedom Charter in 1955, few South Africans or outside observers would have predicted a day when so many of their aspirations would be largely fulfilled: irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability, South Africans of 2019 were all clearly citizens, not subjects. Political leaders had to come to them asking for their votes, appealing to their sense of what was right and fair. Democracy in South Africa is working: it is becoming more competitive; people are living better lives with more dignity; citizens are advancing their interests in a range of democratic channels—through the vote, in the media, in citizen campaigns, in the courts, and in their growing confidence of what it means to be a democratic citizen. Their story leaves me hopeful.",

      "content": "EPILOGUE LESS THAN A YEAR following the May 2019 election, South Africa’s democratic government—like governments all around the world—faced an unprecedented new burden when it was forced to confront the deadly coronavirus pandemic. In fact, one particularly contagious strain came to be known as the “South African variant,” and its prevalence intensified the challenge to keep citizens healthy and alive under already difficult conditions. The human toll has been devastating: as of December 2021, the country was home to the largest number of documented cases on the African continent (3.2 million), and over 90,000 Covid-related deaths.1 These deaths came over multiple waves of rapidly accelerating case counts. The first confirmed case of Covid-19 in South Africa was diagnosed on March 5, 2020, the first death on March 25, and the first death in Gauteng Province was a seventy-nine-year-old man in Krugersdorp.2 As of early July 2021, there were at least 500 confirmed deaths in Mogale City, and at least one of the people I interviewed for this book (Pamela Esso) was included in this tragic statistic.3 Moreover, the pandemic seems to have slowed already slow economic growth and to have increased already high levels of unemployment. Once again, reminiscent of so much I have written in this book, it might be tempting to blame the government for these tragic outcomes—one more deadly mishap in a string of failures. For the history of modern epidemics, long-predating Covid-19, observers have wondered whether democracy is well suited for controlling outbreaks of contagious disease. Would it be better to have a government that insisted on conformity without dissent in order to ensure compliance with demands for contagion-reducing behaviors?4 Among other things, the pandemic put an accent on the severe inequalities between and within countries in terms of capacities to adapt and the needs of the most vulnerable. As such, it put questions about the value of democracy for dignity and development squarely on the global agenda. In the South African case, even as we must recognize the enormity of what citizens have been forced to endure, we should not conclude that outcomes would have been better if government leaders could have operated without democratic oversight. In fact, much of the response was impressive, though not perfect; and democratic feedback helped push the government toward a more just and human-centered approach. In short order, Cyril Ramaphosa’s government announced a deliberate and aggressive response plan. From the very start, government leaders tried to demonstrate that they would not repeat the Mbeki fiasco with respect to AIDS. In facing Covid, the government would adopt science-based strategies in line with emerging global best practices.5 It also drew heavily on the administrative resources developed in combatting HIV and tuberculosis in order to try to stem the tide of infections. Covid quickly became a priority for all levels of government. On April 1, 2020, the Krugersdorp News reported on local councillors checking in on local retail outlets to make sure citizens were practicing social distancing and that stores were prioritizing the needs of the elderly.6 On April 3, the BBC reported on South Africa’s “ruthlessly efficient fight against coronavirus,” highlighting that the country already had drive-through testing centers and that the political leadership was acting urgently to prepare for what might come but that police were harshly enforcing lockdown rules.7 And on April 9, the president announced that he and cabinet ministers and deputy ministers would take a 33 percent pay cut for three months, donating the proceeds to a national solidarity fund; he encouraged private business leaders to do the same.8 At the time, President Donald Trump was still proclaiming that the pandemic was no big deal, the stance he would largely maintain throughout the remainder of his term in office. As in the United States, as restrictions on movement and activities were put into place, it soon became clear how much more difficult this would prove to be for the large, poor, and mostly Black majority, living cheek by jowl in smaller domiciles and crowded townships and often relying on publicly shared water sources and toilets. For middle-class and wealthier families, living in larger homes with high-speed internet access, quarantine was more of an inconvenience than great sacrifice. The government initially failed to address the needs of the most vulnerable in many important ways, opting for a strict and uniform approach. It faced a barrage of criticism, from the press, academics, and civil society organizations, and reports mounted of corruption and mismanagement. Government security officers were frequently too quick to use force to maintain order in the name of social distancing, and the police made a shocking number of arrests—over 200,000 during the initial lockdown.9 And in turn, political opponents took aim at perceived shortcomings; for example, the EFF’s Julius Malema proclaimed, “Our government loves … to keep white people happy and safe, even at the expense of Africans.”10 Nonetheless, in a vein reminiscent of much of the rest of the book, I would highlight that the South African national government readily acknowledged the Covid threat early on and attempted to tackle it using the best available public health policies. A main source of concern has been that the government was too aggressive and not sufficiently respectful of people’s autonomy and individual needs. And true to the democratic form I have described throughout, challenges to government Covid policy frequently resulted in procedural and practical adjustments. These included even more expansive social protections—for example, cash transfers.11 On May 18, 2020, President Ramaphosa shared his weekly letter from the desk of the president, “The government welcomes dissenting viewpoints around our Coronavirus response,” in which he sought to explain the government’s approach while also celebrating citizen engagement.12 One could counter that talk is cheap, but when we consider both the actions and the rhetoric of so many other government leaders around the world, and again, especially the words from the office of President Donald Trump, it is hard not to admire aspects of the emerging South African response at least in relative terms. Similarly, when compared with the persistent denialism and lack of respect for the poor and vulnerable ethnic and racial groups observed in countries such as Brazil and India—and observing the horrendous ways in which those epidemics progressed—the South African political and government response during the first eighteen months of the pandemic appears far more impressive than many critical commentators have acknowledged. In the case of Brazil, where President Bolsonaro took a “hands-off” approach, the poor suffered far worse than their South African counterparts.13 India’s populist prime minister, Narendra Modi, did impose some early lockdowns, but again, several accounts link his brand of autocratic populism to the unfolding of a disastrous response with a staggering human death toll.14 In many authoritarian governments, we have little accurate picture of how the epidemic unfolded because information has been so tightly controlled. Along these lines, in November 2021, South African scientists and government officials openly shared their findings about the Omicron variant, a contribution to global public health that might not have been forthcoming from a closed society. Compared to many other countries, including those with greater financial and administrative resources, South Africa’s liberal democratic order fared admirably in terms of initial process and outcomes. Whether such efforts will have been in vain given the spread of new variants and the challenge of obtaining and dispensing vaccines remains to be seen. Just as South Africa was facing a painful third wave of Covid infections, the country also suffered an outbreak of violence, looting, and arson. This unrest was an almost immediate response to the incarceration of former president Jacob Zuma, who began a fifteen-month jail term for contempt of court in early July 2021. For many, although Zuma’s imprisonment was hardly compensation for the harms he wrought on the country, it offered a bit of public reassurance during a particularly trying time that even heads of state must be held accountable under democratic government. For Zuma loyalists, they supported his innocence and rejected his incarceration as unjust. Most of the unrest occurred in Zuma’s home province of KwaZulu-Natal, where throngs of looters, not necessarily politically motivated, ransacked shopping malls. Much of the same transpired in parts of Gauteng, and it is still not entirely clear why it occurred there but not in other parts of the country. It amounted to the most violent episode of the post-Apartheid era, with more than 350 dead, many more injured.15 While the motivations for all large-scale episodes of such nature are multifaceted, it seems clear that a combination of political rivalry, long-standing frustration, and more recent exhaustion from Covid all contributed. Facing the twin challenges of Covid and unrest, many South African commentators resuscitated some of the very questions that motivated this book: Was South Africa a “failed state”? On the verge of collapse? Once again, news of the demise of South Africa’s democracy landed as premature. As I write, the country remains under enormous stress, and its future is uncertain. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that citizens were quite resilient and a wide range of civil society groups, the news media, churches, and government officials all stepped up to try to stamp out intolerant attitudes and behaviors and to restore order with a minimal amount of force, and the spate of violence was largely contained to a less than two-week period. South Africans are frustrated and angry, and understandably wonder about how to achieve systemic change. The notion of abandoning liberal democratic government will continue to be a tempting option. However, the alternatives are unlikely to solve the extraordinary challenges before this diverse society, and democratic government still holds the greatest promise for dignified development.",

      "content": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I HAVE ACCUMULATED A mountain of intellectual and personal debts during several decades studying South African politics and society. And while I can’t possibly acknowledge them all here, I am enormously grateful to an amazing assortment of individuals and organizations, including my extended family, friends, and mentors, for their generosity and support. Most important, I want to thank the hundreds of people in Mogale City who recounted the histories of their lives and took time to help me understand the politics of this extraordinary place. Several individuals met with me on multiple occasions, including Nomfezeko “Fezi” Mgilane and the staff of the Krugersdorp library, the speaker of the Mogale council, Noluthando Mangole, Councillor Tshepo Nzwane, Councillor Amanda de Lange, Councillor Jacqueline Pannall, Bianca Grossett, and Leslie Gama. Rev. Monwabisi Moses hosted me at his Kagiso Methodist Church and kindly introduced me to several of his parishioners. Mariette Liefferink provided a jaw-dropping tour of the environmental damage associated with mining excavations. Janine Viljoen and the staff of the Krugersdorp News welcomed me to their offices on multiple occasions. A small army of research assistants helped out with various aspects of the project and I couldn’t be more appreciative of their diligence and feedback. In South Africa, Sinoxolo Hashe interviewed dozens of residents and provided feedback on the pilot of the Historical Memories Survey in addition to carrying out other research. The research firm Plus94 did an excellent job fielding the survey. I am also grateful to Tshegofatso Shibuyi and Gabo Kgomongwe, who helped me organize and conduct interviews my first weeks in Mogale; and to Gillian Jena for help with library research based in Johannesburg. At MIT, several doctoral students contributed to various aspects of the research and analysis of troves of data: thanks to Jasmine English, Nicole Wilson, Paige Bollen, and Blair Read; and in particular to Rorisang Lekalake and Gabriel Nahmias—South Africanists in their own right who each provided terrific research and feedback. Thanks also to key members of the research support staff, Eliza Riley, Danny Tobin, and Nico Studen. I was lucky to collaborate with Daniel de Kadt, Philip Martin, and Nina McMurry while they were graduate students on various papers that helped inform my thinking about accountability, and those works are cited in the pages above. I am grateful to Julia de Kadt—a former student who went on to do great work at the Gauteng City Regional Observatory—for making various introductions and helping me gain access to the terrific data they have collected. I started my research while a fellow in the democracy program of the Ash Center for Democratic Governance at Harvard’s Kennedy School. I am particularly appreciative of Archon Fung’s generosity in allowing me to be part of this group and for his friendship and advice along the way, as well as for the feedback and encouragement from the other fellows in my cohort. I am also grateful to MIT, my home Department of Political Science, and the School for the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences for financial and other support. In particular, thanks are due to Maria DiMauro, Susan Twarog, and Paula Kreutzer for helping me sort out various administrative issues that make such work possible. I value the encouraging and constructive feedback from several readers and audiences, especially the two anonymous reviewers from Princeton University Press, Gwyneth McClendon, Richard Goldstone, and Joel Motley. I presented a few chapters at the Oxford University Comparative Politics Series (via Zoom) and am particularly grateful for comments from Giovanni Capoccia and Rosie Pinnington. I also received terrific feedback from my colleagues in the Boundaries, Membership and Belonging working group sponsored by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Thanks to Greg Bates, who provided helpful early editing on a few chapters; Rachel Schultz, who created the GIS-based maps; and Jocelyn Capshaw, who created the illustrated maps based on my (far less attractive) sketches. The manuscript benefited from the helpful comments of several good friends. Marc Favreau and Melani Cammett both offered sage advice when I was just getting started and several times along the way. I was inspired by the message and impact of Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt’s terrific book, How Democracies Die. They each provided characteristically smart feedback—Ziblatt did so on many masked walks during the height of the Covid pandemic. I am lucky to have started my long South African journey with Michael Goldberg, and I am grateful for his willingness to again share memories with me for this book. I am also eternally grateful for the friendships that began during my years at IDASA in Cape Town, particularly with Helen Macdonald and Albert Van Zyl, which have persisted and extended to their wonderful families. It is always a joy to see them and to learn from them about South Africa; both provided helpful feedback on the research and the manuscript. Albert’s great work at the International Budget Project, including his more recent efforts with Asivikelane, is emblematic of what I have admired about South African democratic practice. Several colleagues, including Gcobani Qambela, Nicoli Nattrass, Jeremy Seekings, Vinothan Naidoo, and Bob Mattes, have guided me sufficiently along the way that I want to acknowledge them here as well. I continue to admire the great work of the LRC and have learned a great deal from my interactions with staff and attorneys there. Various members of the Spira family have housed or fed me in South Africa; I have really appreciated their hospitality and engagement. Princeton University Press has been a terrific partner in this endeavor. It is no secret that Bridget Flannery-McCoy is an outstanding editor and offered a wealth of helpful suggestions, including the title of the book, and I thank her for believing in this project from the start. I am also very grateful to Eric Crahan, Alena Chekanov, and the whole Princeton University Press staff for their efforts, and to Jenn Backer for copyediting. I am very grateful to my family, including parents, siblings, and cousins, who have supported me along this journey. Both of my sons, Gideon Lieberman and Jonah Lieberman, read and provided comments on sections of the manuscript, and I appreciated their willingness to discuss related issues around the dinner table on many evenings, especially during our long quarantine together. As always, Amy Lieberman has been my best friend and biggest cheerleader, and she read every chapter, sometimes more than once. I love and appreciate her every day. Despite all the great help and support I have received, I am sure several errors of fact and/or interpretation remain; and for those, I take full responsibility. Like all democracies, no book is perfect.",

Specifically, I am referring here to the conquests of Mzilikazi—the warrior who conquered much of the region during the period known as the Mfecane but was subsequently vanquished by a group of Voortrekkers that included Paul Kruger as a child. See Peter Becker, Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matabele (London: Panther, 1966). Note that an important source of politically motivated intellectual debate in South Africa concerned the timing of the arrival of various groups to the Witwatersrand area, with many White authors propagating the “empty land” notion—that when the Whites arrived, the area was largely unpopulated and the timing of the arrival of White and Black was approximately the same. This myth has long been debunked; one leading scholar details compelling evidence that the Tswana resided in the area for several centuries prior to the arrival of White settlers. See Fred Morton, “Settlements, Landscapes and Identities among the Tswana of the Western Transvaal and Eastern Kalahari before 1820,” South African Archaeological Bulletin 68, no. 197 (2013): 15–26. 5.

In the early part of the twentieth century, White South Africa did indeed develop a “social welfare state” that in many ways was comparable to that of many advanced industrialized countries, and it did so on the basis of a sense of cross-class White solidarity. See, e.g., Lieberman, Race and Regionalism. However, it is important to recognize that this was a contested process that proceeded in fits and starts. See, e.g., Jeremy Seekings, “The Carnegie Commission and the Backlash against Welfare State-Building in South Africa, 1931–1937,” Journal of Southern African Studies 34, no. 3 (2008): 515–37. 25.

More generally, South Africa may be victim to what has been described as the “middle-income trap,” which prevents them from upgrading to high-income status. See Indermit S.

Specifically, I am referring here to the conquests of Mzilikazi—the warrior who conquered much of the region during the period known as the Mfecane but was subsequently vanquished by a group of Voortrekkers that included Paul Kruger as a child. See Peter Becker, Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matabele (London: Panther, 1966). Note that an important source of politically motivated intellectual debate in South Africa concerned the timing of the arrival of various groups to the Witwatersrand area, with many White authors propagating the “empty land” notion—that when the Whites arrived, the area was largely unpopulated and the timing of the arrival of White and Black was approximately the same. This myth has long been debunked; one leading scholar details compelling evidence that the Tswana resided in the area for several centuries prior to the arrival of White settlers. See Fred Morton, “Settlements, Landscapes and Identities among the Tswana of the Western Transvaal and Eastern Kalahari before 1820,” South African Archaeological Bulletin 68, no. 197 (2013): 15–26. 5. Also known as the Republic of South Africa, but I use the term “Transvaal Republic” to avoid confusion with the future Union of South Africa and Republic of South Africa, which I describe as “modern” South Africa. 6.

In the early part of the twentieth century, White South Africa did indeed develop a “social welfare state” that in many ways was comparable to that of many advanced industrialized countries, and it did so on the basis of a sense of cross-class White solidarity. See, e.g., Lieberman, Race and Regionalism. However, it is important to recognize that this was a contested process that proceeded in fits and starts. See, e.g., Jeremy Seekings, “The Carnegie Commission and the Backlash against Welfare State-Building in South Africa, 1931–1937,” Journal of Southern African Studies 34, no. 3 (2008): 515–37. 25.

More generally, South Africa may be victim to what has been described as the “middle-income trap,” which prevents them from upgrading to high-income status. See Indermit S.

Specifically, I am referring here to the conquests of Mzilikazi—the warrior who conquered much of the region during the period known as the Mfecane but was subsequently vanquished by a group of Voortrekkers that included Paul Kruger as a child. See Peter Becker, Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matabele (London: Panther, 1966). Note that an important source of politically motivated intellectual debate in South Africa concerned the timing of the arrival of various groups to the Witwatersrand area, with many White authors propagating the “empty land” notion—that when the Whites arrived, the area was largely unpopulated and the timing of the arrival of White and Black was approximately the same. This myth has long been debunked; one leading scholar details compelling evidence that the Tswana resided in the area for several centuries prior to the arrival of White settlers. See Fred Morton, “Settlements, Landscapes and Identities among the Tswana of the Western Transvaal and Eastern Kalahari before 1820,” South African Archaeological Bulletin 68, no. 197 (2013): 15–26. 5.

In the early part of the twentieth century, White South Africa did indeed develop a “social welfare state” that in many ways was comparable to that of many advanced industrialized countries, and it did so on the basis of a sense of cross-class White solidarity. See, e.g., Lieberman, Race and Regionalism. However, it is important to recognize that this was a contested process that proceeded in fits and starts. See, e.g., Jeremy Seekings, “The Carnegie Commission and the Backlash against Welfare State-Building in South Africa, 1931–1937,” Journal of Southern African Studies 34, no. 3 (2008): 515–37. 25.

More generally, South Africa may be victim to what has been described as the “middle-income trap,” which prevents them from upgrading to high-income status. See Indermit S. Gill and Homi Kharas, “The Middle-Income Trap Turns Ten” (World Bank, 2015), http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/291521468179640202/The-middle-income-trap-turns-ten. Extreme inequality can entrench various perverse conditions including the consolidation of economic power and impede the formation of needed social coalitions. See Richard F.
