      "content": "PROLOGUE Carnival and Empire WHO WILL survive America? Sound and smells and manic lights draw us in. Maybe we will see something forbidden? The curtain desires a hand to open it. A skull bathed in a nauseating red glow invites us to take the haunted ride. But what happens if we go to the dark carnival and wander the grounds while barkers call us to see their sideshows and the faces around us turn ghastly in the sodium-pale light? It seems a place of banal cruelties. The soda pop toss, the baseball throw, the shooting range are all rigged. The sideshows transform human beings into abominations for our pleasure, freaks conscripted to help us feel normal. The rides are assembled with haste and indifference, and anyone who wants a whirligig or to take a plunge on the roller coaster bets on bad odds. The clowns sweat through their face paint. They are trying so hard to make us do something, to make us laugh. We cringe because they look like they’re hurting one another in their perverse play, wielding giant hammers and what we hope are only plastic pistols rigged to explode into a little flag . . . BANG! Their brutal campaign leaves us with the deep unease that we have been abused but are unable to articulate how or why. The dark carnival incites and titillates. The sawdust of the carnival has dried up and blown away in the winds of modernity. State fairs are perhaps the closest we come anymore to the sights, the sounds, and the fetid smells of those strange, compelling spaces. Even in the age of colossal theme parks run by Warner Bros., Disney, and Universal Studios, the carnival seems more enticing precisely because it’s not a safe place—you might get hurt, you might see something you can’t unsee. There lives, somewhere in our psyches where it has crouched on its haunches since the earliest human experience, a yearning for the taboo and the terrible. Our dark carnivals are, then, a place to visit, an experience desired only because we can leave it behind. But, in truth, we cannot. If you live in the United States, you are a denizen of the dark carnival. Horror is the lingua franca. Horror defined the American century. Horror provided the legitimacy, the justifications, and the bread and circuses of American empire. Yet, over the last few decades, horror has attempted to shake us out of our sleep, to understand the kind of world we have made, to discover that something wicked isn’t coming . . . it’s already here. The United States briefly resisted the subtle temptations of monsters from the dark after the very real carnage of World War I (1914–1918). Just as the once-great powers of Europe began to recognize the influence the United States would now have in global affairs, their cultures produced unnerving tales of revivified corpses, hallucinatory fever dreams, and crime lords with hypnotic powers of manipulation. Americans watched slapstick comedies and westerns. One of the most popular films of 1919 starred Lon Chaney in The Miracle Man, a romantic drama. By the late 1920s, frightening fictions startled the American public like a relentless, unexpected pounding on the door at three in the morning. Master of makeup effects Lon Chaney, no longer connected to romance and uplifting drama, terrified audiences in The Phantom of the Opera (1925), his cadaverous head unveiled in a moment that, to this day, makes the viewer feel they’ve been forced to hear a hideous secret about the world. Chaney’s villains—deluded masterminds, vampires, and violent sadists—delivered a skittering chill up the collective spine of what was becoming the most powerful country on earth. His extraordinary skill with makeup effects made him the master of mutilation, his criminals and creatures distorted by suffering, amputation, and scar tissue. Darkness came with unexpected speed, the light of the sun spelunking into a black pool of night. Bela Lugosi glided ominously through the opera of terror that was Dracula (1931). The same year, British war veteran James Whale directed Frankenstein, presenting Mary Shelley’s monster as a very literal embodiment of a conflict that the German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg called “a corpse factory.” For almost twenty years, America danced the monster mash for the World War II generation and their children, making the squared cranium of Frankenstein’s monster and the lonely yet threatening howl of the Wolf Man two of the most recognizable menaces of America’s mass culture. Horror fictions clashed with the way much of America wanted to understand itself. The Great Depression had, ironically, plagued the decade that invented the term the American Dream. James Truslow Adams, a popular historian, coined the term in a 1931 book called The Epic of America, which asserted that the country offered “opportunity for each according to ability or achievement” even as millions stood in bread lines and a quarter of Americans found themselves unemployed. A bewildering optimism among American opinion makers of the era seemed irrepressible. In 1941, Henry Robinson Luce, the powerful founder of both Time and Life magazines, crafted the term the American century. In perhaps one of the most influential editorials in U.S. history, published eight months before Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, Luce worried that in certain quarters a “sickness” had taken over American life, a sickness something like a geopolitical malaise. “We Americans,” he wrote, “are unhappy . . . The future doesn’t seem to hold anything for us except conflict, disruption, war.”1 But did it have to be this way? Absolutely not, Luce insisted. He fervently believed the United States had a burden to carry for the world, what he referred to as a “manifest duty.” The phrase he chose consciously echoed the nineteenth-century idea of “manifest destiny,” a quasi-religious notion popularized by politicians and the press that saw the United States as chosen to civilize, colonize, and exploit the continent of North America. Luce argued that the sad giant must now take on a new destiny. The country had “grown up” and must do something more than defend its geographical borders. American “prestige” had to be weaponized so that the world could be safe for what Luce considered the country’s superior values. Those values had less to do with democracy than with capitalism, even if Luce chose not to put the matter so bluntly. It was time for the country to become an empire. Historians have used the idea of “the American century” not in the spirit of Luce’s cheerleading, but to describe the country’s military and political dominance. It’s been an elastic term, used to describe more than a simple chronology and applied not only to the twentieth century proper but to the hundred years following the end of the Great War, the bloodiest, deadliest, and most frightening century in human history. The bloody wake left by America’s ascent into empire has been legitimized by the notion of American exceptionalism. The idea has deep roots; in fact, the image of America as a nation with a special identity and destiny can be found among both the makers and observers of America’s war for independence. It’s only been in the last few years that some of the basic tenets of American exceptionalism have been questioned. As recently as 2010, a USA Today/Gallup poll found that fully 80 percent of respondents believed the United States to be “the greatest nation on earth.” Two-thirds believed this gave the country a special mission to lead the globe, essentially Luce’s claim about the country.2 But things have changed. Another USA Today poll in 2020, conducted just before the strangest Fourth of July in many years, found only 32 percent of Americans willing to assert without qualification that the country was the greatest on earth, while another 28 percent cautiously, one almost wants to say wistfully, suggested their country might be “one of the greatest.” In perhaps a much more telling response, nearly 70 percent of respondents wearily told pollsters that the United States had fallen into decline or was simply “headed in the wrong direction.”3 The dark side of American exceptionalism became a common phrase as we entered a new decade. But why has this gone so long unaddressed? Defeat in the Vietnam War would seem to have summoned the death knell of the notion. It did not. Ronald Reagan won a presidential election with a weirdly jolly assertion of American greatness given the tenor of the times. Other countries might “cling to the stale past,” Reagan beamed, but “we create the future, and the world follows us into tomorrow.”4 Today, grasping at the idea that the United States has a special destiny seems almost a kind of psychosis after the sacrifice of almost seven thousand American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tomorrow the world might follow us into appears distinctly dystopian. Almost twenty concurrent years of U.S. intervention and the death, dismemberment, and mental trauma of American soldiers left the region in catastrophic decline. Meanwhile, there have been close to one million civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq alone. But the lure of the myth remains powerful. As late as 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized Barack Obama for holding a nuanced view of American exceptionalism. Romney bragged that he “held his shoulders a little higher” when he traveled abroad since as an American, he had “a special gift.”5 Then we began to get sick. Chinese officials in the province of Hubei first warned of a novel coronavirus that caused severe respiratory problems in December of 2019. By February of 2020, the Centers for Disease Control recorded fourteen instances of the virus in the United States. In a February 25 news briefing, Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called for the cancellation of events and used the now familiar phrase social distancing. “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare,” she said, “in the expectation that this could be bad.”6 Two days later, President Donald Trump told a raucous rally in South Carolina that COVID-19 was “a hoax” and accused his enemies of “politicizing” the issue. Parsing the meaning of the forty-fifth president’s words offers an exercise in frustration. In the most sympathetic reading, Trump did not claim that the virus didn’t exist, only that its effects had been overemphasized by a press in, to use his words, “hysteria mode.” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic advisor, insisted that the virus had been “contained” and posed no danger to the economy. “I don’t think it’s going to be an economic tragedy at all,” Kudlow said.7 The virus has proven a human tragedy on a massive scale. At the time of writing, the national death toll totals nearly eight hundred thousand people, more deaths than the United States suffered during World War I and II and far higher than all combined American casualties in global wars since 1945. The number of new infections stands at more than one hundred thousand a day, nearly twice the numbers of the most serious hot zones of the spring of 2020. Most of the countries in the world have yet to even reach that number in total. My insides coil in dread when considering how these numbers appear as you hold this book in your hands. One assumes it became worse. We thought we didn’t have to worry about such things. The cheery outlook favored by American officials since the mid-twentieth century convinced the nation that infectious disease would have even less chance against the country than a foreign military incursion. In an era that celebrated scientists as key parts of the much-vaunted American military machine, Americans took solace in the idea that penicillin ended the terror of wasting plagues like the 1918 influenza pandemic. COVID-19 exposed the absurdity of claiming any kind of exceptionalism for a nation with basic social and economic weaknesses unknown in much of Europe, Japan, and East Asia. South Korea and Vietnam have so far led the world in containing the virus. President Trump appealed to South Korea for medical equipment even while attempting to bully them into large cash payments to maintain American troops at their border. Taiwan sent the United States PPE equipment, in fact, to my own county in South Carolina that currently has zip codes with some of the highest infection spikes in the country.8 The effect of the virus has baffled Americans convinced of their special destiny and special character and forced many to face hard truths about American power. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March of 2020 that “the United States has long stood out as the land of denial and death.” Even before the exponential spread of a novel coronavirus, the United States had one of the lowest life expectancy rates in the developed world.9 Though frequently called into question, the idea of the American century, the ideal of American exceptionalism, and the certainty that the United States is and has always been “the greatest nation on earth” still remain deeply rooted in American politics. They echo in the desperate and angry snarls to make America great again, bleating that sounds more like the cries of an injured animal than the confidence of a society that understands its values and practices them. But it also appears in the self-satisfied insistence that the United States is already great, thank you very much. Whether greatness lost or preponderance of power maintained, the idea of the American century continues to thrive. Is there a lonely crossroad where the nightmares of horror and the American century meet? Of course, horror and politics may seem as unrelated as raincoats and ice cream. The night you watch a horror movie is not the night you settle in with a history book or catch up on current events. You order pizza with friends and huddle together for the whirligig ride that jitters and jolts you. Ruined faces appear at rainy windows; the tension builds as a door creaks slowly into a vacuum of silence that suddenly erupts with screams. The whole flick comes in at just under ninety minutes and features a paranormal force unleashed by inebriated Gen Zs playing with that wicked old Ouija board or some comparable occult gadget. Or maybe a knife-wielding automaton will victimize the same age group for being at the worst possible place at the worst possible time. It’s escapist fun. You startle reflexively at the jump scares, something terrible suddenly filling the frame. Then you laugh at yourself and your friends, happy with your own terror. Someone makes jokes about being scared to go to bed that no one takes seriously. After all, no one takes horror seriously. Well, that’s no longer quite true. Over the last decade, as Americans became more acquainted with the twisted nature of their alleged exceptionalism, a clutch of horror films have given audiences more to think about than the dumb fun of a scare flick. Ari Aster’s Hereditary and Midsommar martialed complicated anxieties related to family, relationships, and social class. Aster jokingly called Hereditary “just a little family drama” when in fact it’s a crucible that burns the very concept of middle-class American family life to cinders, leaving behind a taste of its ashes. Similarly, Aster called Midsommar a “breakup movie,” but if you know the grotesque denouement, that’s like referring to Scorsese’s 1976 Taxi Driver as a classic boy-meets-girl drama. Aster knows his films cut to the bone and leave us questioning everything we think we know about even the most intimate expectations we have for the American good life . . . romance, success, money, home, and family. Aster tells a story of American dreams grounded in trauma that then becomes inestimably worse, descending into insane violence. Jordan Peele’s Get Out addressed racism in a “post-racial” society that maintains vast economic inequality and allows murderous police action against Black men and women. Peele’s film can be funny, horrific, and obsessively watchable. But in the meantime, it’s a devastating measure of white supremacy, a bleak miracle of a movie that addresses everything from the heritage of slavery to racist policing to the way social class informs a variety of racism just as brutal as you’d find in a lynch mob. Zadie Smith called the film a “compendium of black fears about white folk,” both in terms of cultural symbolism and historical legacy. In Peele’s ability to bring his gift of “comic reversals” to horror, Get Out becomes a film that “contains its own commentary” by making audiences understand that African Americans look fearfully on everything from “white women who date black men” to “well-meaning conversations about Obama” to “nostalgia for slavery” and, of course, “slavery itself.”10 Peele’s follow-up film, a complex tale of social class, race, and an unseen horror that undergirds all of American history, may be the most politically confrontational horror film ever made. As Sezin Koehler noted in a strenuous essay written during 2020’s nationwide protests against racist policing, economic structures, and public symbolism, Peele’s Us addresses “the fundamental toxicity of whiteness, white privilege, and its intersection with all kinds of violence.”11 In the wake of these films, a horrorsaince of social relevance, a debate between fandom and a relatively small number of cultural critics exploded across several social media platforms and resulted in a welter of dueling essays. Steve Rose set the cat among the pigeons first in his much-derided Guardian think piece “How Post-Horror Movies Are Taking Over Cinema.” In it, he described the traditional horror film using former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld’s infamously obtuse phrase known unknowns. Rose meant that while horror films proffered suspense, in reality every fan knows the accepted “rules” of the genre. He argued that, in general, horror movies are actually “one of the safest spaces in cinema” since a fan’s knowledge of what to expect provides them with a “flashlight” for the darkest corners a director might lead them to. These claims are untenable with just a glance at the long history of horror, reaching back to Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), which undermined audience expectations. In 1922, two World War I veterans produced Nosferatu as a reflection of “the great dying” of the war in which they and their countries had suffered. Rose avoided this history, skipping the silent era in America and Europe, the introduction of supernatural horror to America in the 1930s, and its terrifying revival in the 1960s and ’70s. In those decades, films like Hitchcock’s Psycho shocked audiences and critics into anger at the director himself. The butchering of Janet Leigh in the shower became the focal point of audience angst. But fans also hated, and loved, the film’s weight of dread that suggested you could not trust the director, that he might show you something etched like some cursed rune into your brain stem. George Romero assaulted his audiences with the gore his ghouls consumed (thanks to a Pittsburgh butcher friend who donated the day’s leftovers from his shop) and his introduction of a controversial Black male lead in the cataclysmic year of 1968. In 1973 documentarian William Friedkin made The Exorcist, a film that triggered such a convulsive reaction that Time magazine spoke to psychiatrists and theologians in an effort to make sense of why theaters in LA and New York had to begin running the film as early as 8:00 a.m. to handle crowds that stretched around entire city blocks.12 Rose ignored all this because he had to in order to claim our entrance into an age of post-horror, a phrase that obviously suggests something that has come after and replaced horror. The peculiar phrase, peculiar partially because it fails to communicate any meaningful information, is probably borrowed from the overused notion of “postmodern.” It also performed the job the author wanted it to in inciting fan outrage and hundreds of thousands of shares and likes, the cryptocurrency of online social capital.13 We could easily, too easily, write off Rose’s “post-horror” category as a provocative hot take, the current nomenclature for an undeveloped notion hurled like a hand grenade from the pillbox of a social media platform. But this idea has found wide support, especially among critics who found themselves drawn to the meaning of aesthetic documents that used horror commonplaces to make their point. The term elevated horror began to make the rounds among these critics in 2018. “Ugh. I’m not even much of a horror fan, but I can smell the condescension and the dissembling that’s baked into this awful phrase,” film critic Alonso Duralde told Indiewire. Jordan Peele felt it necessary to tweet simply that “‘Us’ is a horror movie” at the time of its release, possibly just to shut down what he considered a pretty pointless discussion. Influential critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted the obvious: calling a film “elevated horror” is a bit like calling a cheeseburger elevated. You’d simply be saying it’s a next-level cheeseburger and “if it’s delicious, no one will care what adjective you put in front of it.”14 Much of the conversation about “post-” or “elevated” horror (or other descriptors like “art horror” and even “smart horror”) glossed over the issue really being debated. Even unfriendly critics who probably want to see most horror tossed onto pop culture’s trash heap are attempting, maybe poorly, to articulate the meaning of horror. Ultimately then, the question has been less about whether horror films are good and more a question of whether they matter. The aforementioned horror films force us to see that there’s always been something deeply political about twentieth-century horror, all the way back to its roots as a cry of anger and despair in the aftermath of the Great War’s savagery. Arguably the late 1940s and much of the ’50s had been one of the most politically charged eras of the horror film. A generation sat through popular Main Street theaters for most of their Saturdays as flying saucers and mad scientists justified American military might in the face of an outside threat, transformed people of color around the world into monstrous beings and cruel villains, and offered a worldview fraught with paranoia and hair-trigger rage. Perhaps, and I stress perhaps, no deep philosophical questions emerged from Wes Craven’s The Last House on the Left or Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And yet both films were a punch in the gut. Jump scares and gore aren’t important to either film. Despite its reputation and title, you’ll see more viscera in an episode of your favorite TV police procedural than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. What directors, authors, comic artists, and even game designers want is to hit the audience with a cultural roundhouse. There’s no way to do that effectively without pushing political buttons to overstimulate the most delicate nerve endings of personal belief, ideology, patriotism, gender roles, and unexamined hatreds. Movies are not alone in having this effect, and so a full examination of how our monsters claw their way toward some of America’s deepest assumptions must speak broadly about horror culture. Best-selling novelist Paul Tremblay writes that horror really works only when it “push[es] and prod[s] at moral boundaries” and forces its audience to “confront personal and societal taboos.” In fact, he suggests that horror films need a “progressive” vision to really pull us out to sea on a dark tide. An attempt at a “conservative” horror tale that allows for an unambiguous happy ending fails to horrify the audience.15 Writer and director Aislinn Clarke doesn’t use the phrase elevated horror. But she has suggested that a difference does exist between something being “scary” and true, lingering horror. The creation of horror depends on upending convention and, she suggests, should “punch up” against those in power rather than “merely making monsters of those at the bottom.”16 Her masterful, thoughtful, and real damn scary 2018 film The Devil’s Doorway tosses more than a few matches at the incendiary questions of religion, sexual abuse, and misogyny. Rather than creating a possession/exorcism tale with a generic setting, she intertwines it with the legacy of Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries, which imprisoned unwed mothers, the mentally ill, or women who simply did not conform to social expectations. In Clarke’s film, there are jump scares, the suggestion of possession, and other tricks of the trade that pay homage to the exorcism drama. But the black wave that rolls over us after the credits roll, a feeling akin to grief as well as fear, comes from the complex evils we’ve encountered, the intractable horrors perpetrated, as Clarke notes, by both the church and the state. However, horror can also seem remarkably obtuse in how it attempts to critique or even resonate with the real world’s terrors. Award-winning science fiction and fantasy author Sam J. Miller told Wired magazine that the first episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which opened with televised footage of Donald Trump and his surprise 2016 election night victory, took a “ham-fisted” approach to politics, attempting to juice audience reactions by “reveling in the horror of our moment.”17 So does horror ask us to stop thinking or to start? Is it inherently political or simply a set of illusions that has perfected a way to play with our brain chemistry? If it does have a politics, are they progressive or reactionary? Is horror a red state, blue state, or the ultimate swing voter genre? The dark carnival of American history and horror does not offer a simple answer, at least one that we want to hear. Once we’ve read discussions about “elevated horror” and pondered what “post-horror” could mean, we are left with the simple fact that horror tells us more about the world than we want to know. Aislinn Clarke simply calls horror “the slow, dawning realization that the worst thing is true.” Historian and essayist Michael Parenti calls the horrors hidden by fantasy “dirty truths.” By this, he does not mean uncomfortable ideas that are debated. He means ideas that lack respectability to such a degree that you don’t mention them in polite company. They exude such an aura of unreality that they seem to besmirch even the people who tell you about them. Yet, they are still truths. If we grapple with the idea of horror and how it works, we also have to wrestle with the idea of empire. I’m aware it might seem bizarrely tendentious to refer to the United States as an empire. How can a democracy also be an empire? Don’t empires hold vast, extraterritorial colonies? Hasn’t the United States intervened only at moments of crisis when outside forces threatened the nation-state and generally chosen an “isolationist” approach? Haven’t even our worst mistakes in foreign policy come from a desire to make the world a better place? We are the greatest country on earth, aren’t we? It’s understandable that any American citizen would feel this way. Many of our grade school textbooks leave the impression that we are always and everywhere the good guys. So do many of our films, in so many ways the repository of popular memory. This book uses a simple definition of imperial power as the exercise of military, economic, and cultural dominance beyond the geographical borders of the homeland or nation-state. This has looked different in different eras; empire worked differently for the British than it did the Romans. The American empire works differently from both. Here, policy makers became increasingly skilled at shaping the world the United States would dominate while convincing us that something entirely different had happened. So what if the American dream is a nightmare? What if, at the bottom of an ill-smelling barrel brimming with secrets coiled like snakes, we find a terrible truth? It’s the truth of the dark carnival. Borrowing the image Ray Bradbury gave us, did something wicked this way come in the middle of the American night? Did only a few silent sentinels, watching at that dangerous hour of 3:00 a.m., hear the mechanical striving of a train on the tracks, pulling the sideshow acts, the automata, the game booths, and the scurrilous pranksters who will make it all spin and whirl and explode and pop? Did they really set it all up overnight, this tent city of bright reds and pearl whites that looks like so much fun as long as you don’t look too closely? This is a book about the kinds of stories we choose to tell, and why horror has become our story. This is a book of horror because it’s a book of war stories. We think we know what this means. Tim O’Brien told us what it means in, well, “How to Tell a True War Story,” a chapter from his award-winning The Things They Carried. In it, he claims “war is hell” but also “mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love.” These “contradictory truths” are at the heart of the experience that only those who wage war can begin to understand properly.18 I can’t follow O’Brien’s template and, more important, I think he is wrong. I have never been a soldier. I came perilously close to becoming one in the late nineties, having conversations with a Marine recruiter in grad school. My father, a working-class kid from the Carolina Piedmont who found himself in the Marines and then the Navy in the catastrophic years of 1967–1970, told me he’d feel nothing but disappointment if I did this. I’m grateful to him for this, as for many things, since becoming a reservist on the eve of 9/11 would have changed my life in ways I cannot imagine. The only time I heard shots fired in anger was in January of 1986 when I found myself part of a well-intended, if spectacularly ill-conceived, aid project in Haiti. In Saint-Marc and Gonaïves, the rattle of automatic weapons fire left me oddly unaffected, the invincibility in the face of history that only a white American fifteen-year-old can ever feel. But this experience matters in the war stories I have to tell you. Combatants are a relatively small part of any meaningful war story. Veterans fear being forgotten, but often their anxiety is that they be remembered in the right way. The ongoing concern known as “America, United States of” wants them remembered in specific ways too. Warriors, not soldiers. Effective killers but never rapists or plunderers. Figures on a stele or names on a wall but never human beings who are victimized and victimizers, unable to tell their stories because their throats are choked with rage, bearing the memories of the times the empire told them to mutilate, depressed, strung-out, addicted, suffering psychosis or the symptoms of chemical agents that cause heart problems, nerve damage, and cascading organ failure. The dirty wars of empire have to be submerged so that, paradoxically, the fighting can go on and on. This is why so much of the truth of the last one hundred years survives not in museum exhibitions or patriotic celebrations or lengthy documentary treatments but in horror films. It is a place where one does not expect war stories. The “holiness” that O’Brien thinks is somehow part of war can’t be found in horror. Horror as an art film, a silly film two clicks from porn, a novel, or a role-playing experience, all remind us of Lugosi’s strange moment in Dracula when he sighs, “there are far worse things awaiting man than death.” O’Brien says, “war can make you a man” and “war can make you dead.” But it can do worse. War is hell because we don’t want to die. But the military Moloch of empire doesn’t just want our deaths. It wants our need to murder, to rape, to pillage. It wants us maimed and raped and all our values desecrated. It has no interest in your masculinity crisis. If you can’t raise a flag and salute, it thinks your apathy will work just as well. It wants to build an empire on our bones. Most of us see this carnival’s garish illumination from a safe distance. The sounds of screams and clattering reveries of an organ grinding away take wing in the October air to thrill us and chill us. But we have more to learn about what kind of midnight ride the United States really is and the collective trauma its violent traveling circus has visited on the world.",

      "title": "1.Empire of Horror",
      "content": "1.Empire of Horror HORROR IS the dream life of American empire. Since the nineteenth century, the United States acted as an imperial power. The young nation seized land, killed Indigenous peoples, and battered to death any dissenters from its aggressive economic system. Once crowded into thirteen contentious little colonies that hugged the Atlantic, an empire born in blood emerged when these settler societies conquered most of Mexico and annihilated hundreds of small native nations that once lived from the Tennessee hills to the California coast, from Massachusetts Bay to the Ohio Valley. Many of the survivors of this genocide are today packed into hundreds of reservations, scattered across the continental and noncontiguous United States, where they sink below the poverty line at more than double the rate of the rest of America.1 The American empire slipped the confines of its continent in the early twentieth century. The new power’s shadow darkened Latin America and the Pacific, talons clawing for resources in East Asia. The Mexican War (1846–1848) doubled the size of the country. Hawaii and Alaska came next, along with the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, and a multitude of Pacific possessions. None would become states except for Hawaii and Alaska, and only after white men became the dominant political force in each region. Delivering a fatal blow to the decrepit Spanish imperium in the Spanish-American War (1898) allowed this rogue state to seize ports of call from the Caribbean to the doorstep of China. Cuba offered an experiment in which, after a military occupation from 1898 to 1902, a “republic” could come to life on the island so long as its government agreed to allow unilateral intervention, at any time, by the United States. The American military did occupy the country twice more and handpicked its leaders until the Cuban revolution in 1959. The United States never accepted that repudiation and continues to maintain a needlessly cruel economic boycott lingering now more than thirty years after the end of the Cold War. American presidents, military leaders, and captains of industry collaborated to create this new style of empire. The government could hold military bases in the Philippines without having to tangle any longer with the Indigenous insurgency that lasted more than a decade. U.S. Marines could protect business interests in Haiti during a nineteen-year occupation without having to administer it as a traditional colony. The U.S. military could run the Dominican Republic while keeping up the pretense of its independence. By the 1930s, Standard Oil (now Chevron) fully tied together American corporate and foreign policy interests by helping adjudicate an alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia that endures, profitably for both country’s ruling classes, into the present. Not only would oil interests benefit from the unlikely alliance. The partnership subsequently provided the United States with military bases in the region and the basis for an expanded network of bases in Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the United States officially structured its imperial holdings around the policy of “containing” communism. A new leadership cadre emerged in Washington, D.C., under the control of the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the cliques of unelected national security advisors that huddle around the country’s increasingly powerful executive branch. Closely linked to defense contractors with assets in the hundreds of billions, a relatively small and unsupervised economic and foreign policy elite waged secret wars, staged coups, and placed free-market-friendly dictators in power in Greece, Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Uganda, Iran, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Iraq. The end of the Cold War in 1991 changed none of this. The United States did not stand down with the dissolution of the Soviet Union—it launched invasions of both Panama and Iraq when their autocratic regimes, both longtime puppets of U.S. foreign policy and recipients of American arms and cash, stepped out of line. “Humanitarian interventions” into Haiti, Somalia, and the Balkans by the Clinton administration developed new military doctrine, tested weapons systems, and, in Kosovo, allowed for the building of enormous military bases to guard hoped-for oil pipelines that would bypass Russia and Iran. In the twenty-first century, the United States achieved a hegemony undreamt of by past imperial powers. Nearly 750 military bases, and hundreds of CIA black sites, are controlled by the United States around the globe. The majority of the world’s countries play host to American troops and weapons systems, 154 countries in 2020.2 U.S. covert ops does their work with impunity in nearly every country on earth. Regularly ignoring and sometimes even mocking the United Nations, American presidential administrations for fifty years have been breaking, amending, or simply ignoring multilateral treaties related to the UN Genocide Convention, the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, its own nuclear nonproliferation and test ban initiatives, and the International Criminal Court. The United States’ domination of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank gives the empire nearly limitless economic power over the debt of the world’s smallest and poorest nations. The Hollywood-McDonald’s-Disney industrial complex controls much of the global culture industry. Drone technology allows the United States to launch violent incursions in foreign nations that would have been considered acts of war in earlier times. Preemptive, bloody strikes in Sudan, Syria, Pakistan, and the Philippines have received limited news coverage from American media and a bored yawn from the American public. In November of 2021, news that American commanders kept secret a 2019 airstrike in Syria that killed eighty women and children spent only several hours as a top story for The New York Times online edition while no major news network provided coverage that lasted more than one minute. American power, covert and overt, over much of the globe leads analysts to describe the United States as a “hyperpower” rather than using the older language of superpower. The United States is also an empire whose culture industry makes horror films grossing more than half a billion dollars every year, many of them low-budget and highly profitable. Streaming services are cluttered not only with traditional horror films but with “true crime” documentaries that explore the most gruesome murders ever committed in surgical detail. Death’s own holiday, Halloween, has become a multi-billion-dollar affair that America has exported to other countries. It’s not paradoxical that an empire built on very real horror consumes horror as part of its regular entertainment. However, horror plays more than one role in the empire’s entertainment industry. Americans have, as Daniel Immerwahr described in his 2019 book How to Hide an Empire, worked assiduously to disguise their imperial design, even from themselves. Thus, some of our tales of terror are more oblique because we’d rather see ourselves as the shining city on a hill and not a global behemoth. So we tell horror stories that allow us to forget, that tell us of monsters beyond our borders and heroes that destroy them for us. And yet, horror also offers a shadowy mirror. It reveals truths and poses questions, tells us that we are the monsters that ignore borders in our insatiable hungers. The white American notion of the self—ruddy, open-faced, a bit innocent as it determinedly undertakes its mission to be what former secretary of state Madeleine Albright called “the indispensable nation”—stares into the glass only to find something twisted and not quite sane staring back. Despite the differences in horror fictions, despite how they offer radically different versions of the American dream, they always center violence. One kind of horror makes us yearn to turn the lights on and the other keeps the lights on the whole time for us. But both explore or exploit the violence of empire, critiquing it or imagining it as necessary for the preservation of the most prosperous, most dangerous nation on earth. The realities come to us in our cultural REM state. Our dependence on various sadisms to maintain the nation’s hegemony has caused two different dreams to emerge in the American unconscious. Both dreams have a darkness, even if one represses its cruelest assumptions. The first is a dream of safety and security. Most American citizens do not think of themselves as living in an empire but instead in a great nation that mostly does good things. The occasional failing, like the toppling of a government in a violent coup or the murder of civilians in an air strike, is “not who we are.” The world may be full of enemies of our freedom, but walls fashioned by the national security state, and actual concrete, protect us from “blowback.” This term, first coined in a secret history commissioned by the CIA and introduced to the public by former cold warrior turned critic of empire Chalmers Johnson, refers to unintended and unplanned consequences of the American empire’s most secret crimes. These actions are unknown to American citizens but unforgotten and unforgivable to its victims in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. When we screen the sunnier side of imperial assumptions, the horror film offers monsters marked for death from the beginning. Film or folklore predicates their existence on the monsters’ eventual destruction. Our heroes, often dealing with creatures who emerge from islands and maelstroms beyond the borders of America’s cordon sanitaire or violate U.S. airspace in their flying saucers or with their leathery wings, defeat the evil that threatens our safety and our sanity. These films, these dreams of innocence, tell us that the monsters are not unlike the psychos who attacked the Twin Towers on 9/11. Their motives are unclear, they are “evildoers” who have apparently attacked us for our inherent goodness. This book explains that Americans’ love of this iteration of horror comes from the same root as their acquiescence to the violence that made America. The jump scares and the gore, the evil cabals and paranormal activities, all allow us to imagine that evil comes from demonic principalities or masked killers, that it happens to innocent Americans in their allegedly safe homes. Violence is not what is done in our name, by fresh-faced young people we’ve hired to kill for us, in places we can’t find on a map. Violence is done to us and we fight back and we win—we always win. By the time the credits roll, these films assure us that everything is okay, that the evildoers have been punished and the American way of life, and the piece of it you’ve broken off for yourself, will not change even a little. Another kind of horror film denies us security and comfort, even as it refuses to let us believe we are the legitimate heirs of imperial privilege. These films demand we recognize how the American dream has been assembled from the night terrors of the world. They pose questions about how we won our comforts. They often leave us gobsmacked, muddled, and dazed as we try to bring ourselves to sensibility of what we thought was the real world. These are films that end with corpses everywhere and the survivors wearing their dead friends’ insides. The evil has not come from without, from empire’s frontier. It’s a violence we made, that we’ve either become or accepted, as the price of our privileges. These films critique the American dream by showing us the mounds of corpses it’s built on. These films are often aggressive with the audience, refusing to play by the rules of the genre. Commenting on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Mick Garris described it as a film that ignored old-school “somethings behind the door” scares in favor of “coming after you in fucking clown paint.” The thing coming at us in “fucking clown paint” has a lot more power than popular understandings of Aristotle’s notion of catharsis. The idea that horror films, especially ones that show body-rending violence, are palliatives for anxiety has been best summarized by Richard Rhodes as “taking the psychic garbage out.” Of course, as Maggie Nelson asks in The Art of Cruelty, where does this “psychic garbage” go? Who ends up with it? Is there any evidence that this “catharsis” is taking place, she asks, if “‘catharsis’ now means ‘tune in next week’”? Perhaps, as Nelson herself suggests, something deeply political, not simply psychological, works in our stories of violence. If we consume hour after hour after hour of innocence being corrupted or killed by monstrosity but watch our heroes annihilate the monster just before the credits roll, it’s soothing repetition and not catharsis. But horror also confronts us with unsettling dread that opens new possibilities. Horror directors like John Carpenter make films that, in his own words, critique “unrestrained capitalism.” George A. Romero could make a zombie film in 2005 that has Dennis Hopper standing in for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. These films follow the brutal logic of Eugene Ionesco’s famous assertion, sometimes in a very literal way, that “to tear ourselves away from the everyday, from habit, from mental laziness which hides from us the strangeness of reality, we must receive something like a real bludgeon blow.” These nightmares come from the irreconcilable contrasts of what Americans hope, or believe, the world to be and its bleaker reality. This is the reason so much of what spooks us in horror depends on sensory uncertainty, experience suddenly taking a dreaded turn, a past suddenly revealing its true meaning or a future lost. Horror lets us know that how we expected the world to act has been indefinitely cancelled. What appeared to be simply a shadow on the wall moves in a way nothing should. We are certain we are alone in a dark room when something brushes against us. The sunlight of a spring day suddenly dies as thunderheads trick out the sky in a sickening orange and Leatherface charges across a peaceful pasture, chain saw roaring, ready to teach us that you “DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS.” This is the precise opposite of entertainment as escapism, the wish to ignore reality. Michael Moorcock once attacked J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth fantasies as escapism that encouraged a Tory view of the world. Tolkien rebuked the young Marxist, saying that “jailers always hate escapism.” Moorcock famously replied that actually jailers love escapism—what they hate is an actual jailbreak. Many of our frightful fictions want us to contemplate a jailbreak from the American consensus. The horror film that demands we attend to the history of American violence does not simply reflect the culture. Its buoyant sadisms can restage the violence this country visits on the world and insist we look, that we see through lies and renounce the cant, the mental laziness, and the political nihilism. Americans can fight for tickets to the opening of Saw (2004) and Hostel (2005), infamously labelled “torture porn,” in the same cultural moment as the revelation that physical and sexual violence had been deployed by American soldiers against the detainees of Abu Ghraib prison. The tendency of our least comfortable filmmakers to try to bludgeon us says nothing about audience reaction or the meaning accrued to a specific film. This book does not suggest that audiences leave a horror film pondering geopolitics or the cost of American empire. Nor do they leave a simple monster-hunt story thinking about how good it is to live so well in a country like the United States. But they do leave the theater or close their streaming app with either a feeling of the rightness or wrongness of the world. They’ve been asked to question the story they tell themselves about reality. They’ve been asked to pay attention or they’ve been told to go back to sleep, everything’s okay. In the troubled sleep of empire, both dreams may come. In this book we will experience both fantasies and the political conviction that grows out of the worldview each assumes. We’ll see the predator who swims from sea to shining sea until slain by a working-class hero who’s trying to defend our amity. And we’ll have to watch a more excruciating vision, a murderous dance on the frontiers of American power, a roar of industrialized murder shattering the silence of purple mountains majesty. In the troubled sleep of empire, we meet the chain saw and the shark. 2. American Massacres TOBE HOOPER, his round, boyish, bespectacled face beaming with an easy smile, eased back in his chair as he responded to a question about the real meaning of his classic, and infamous, 1974 film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He laughed nervously, like a modest kid embarrassed by winning a prize at school, as he talked about his story of hippies finding some real bad trouble in the Texas hinterland. “I think what it’s trying to say,” Hooper quipped, as if giving credit to someone else for the eighty-minute nightmare, “is that this is America.”3 Hooper created a revisionist western, the myth of the American frontier that outdid The Wild Bunch in its unforgiving brutality. Hooper’s Wild West is not John Wayne facing down desperate men with the truest of grit. Hooper’s frontier rots like Katherine Anne Porter’s Texas dirt farms, so gone to seed that the clans that clustered there had to go to work at the local slaughterhouse. But, in the moribund heartland of seventies America, even the slaughterhouse has gone out of business. The evil demon presiding over the times in which the film first flickered on drive-in screens made the celluloid carnage appear a documentary. The first few minutes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre are staccato edits of unburied bodies. An edged, metallic riff tears the soundscape. Hooper, who spent a year chopping and scoring the film, created a whole library of unsettling sounds he could draw on. He achieved the grating sound of metal ripping apart by tearing apart a tambourine and dragging a saw across the threads so the seams busted like metal ripping flesh. So much for the sounds of the decade when Hooper came of age, when young, hopeful Americans wanted to hear Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for them. Hooper joined each serrated edit with the droning of a news anchor . . . murders, accidents, Nixon, and Vietnam. It’s a cacophony of horrors. The news reports, just like the unending stream of malignancies that greet us in our contemporary doom scrolling, report global and local carnage. The catalog of disasters continues as Hooper shows us exhumed graves in a small Texas town where some hippie kids drop by to ask directions to the old homeplace. The old men standing around, escapees from an Erskine Caldwell novel, are delighted by the women’s short-shorts and bemused by the bell-bottomed paramours the pretty girls prefer to John Wayne. We meet our heroes in this unquiet graveyard. Sally and Franklin are brother and sister, a duo living in different cultural time zones of the sixties and seventies. Sally is a liberated advocate of peace and love, while Franklin uses a wheelchair and is filled with an unendurable combination of sniveling self-pity and rage. The rest of the group are largely embodiments of the counterculture. Pam is a sultry astrology maven. Jerry and Kirk are floating clouds of cannabis eager to learn more about sultry astrology mavens. They’ve hit the road like Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters in part to find Sally and Franklin’s family home. Hooper told a story of a new kind of settlers. They are the children of the Age of Aquarius, but Pam warns that the times they are a-changing; Saturn has ascended. The monster who devoured his own children will become the new America. The Hitchhiker, no name provided, introduces us to the realities of American history that purblind patriotism would have us ignore. The blood is the life for the Hitchhiker and his family. They had worked for generations at a nearby slaughterhouse that fired them when it started using high-powered air guns. “The hammer was better,” the Hitchhiker assures his new friends, a gruesome observation but one that resonated with Americans who’d been hearing a new word on the evening news: deindustrialization. For the working class this meant, above all, unemployment as manufacturing jobs disappeared and the country began its arc toward today’s information and services economy. Sweaty, kinetic, and seemingly opposed to bathing, the Hitchhiker causes the kids to quickly become wary because, as Franklin puts it, they may have “picked up Count Dracula” from “a whole family of Draculas.” The Hitchhiker’s interest in blood, his own and others, suggests Franklin might be on to something. The film starts as a story about finding the family farm, the old dream of the homestead, the West that became the first frontier of the American empire. But it quickly becomes a fright tale that questions the sanity of any audience that would watch it and, by extension, the sanity of anyone who would believe the western fantasy of deserts inexplicably fecund and settlers moving peacefully across the landscapes, covered wagons like little puffs of cloud drifting along in an orderly row with the breeze of the American dream nudging them along. In place of a little house on the prairie, the kids find riverbeds dry as ash when they want to swim and, in the age of rural poverty, a crumbling Victorian farmhouse leering over the landscape. One by one, the hippie kids find themselves on meat hooks in scenes that are weirdly bloodless while evoking absolutely brutal violence. A man-child in a skin mask lays out Jerry in a single, spine-crunching blow from a slaughterhouse mallet. By the end of the film, only Sally remains, captive of the strange, male-only family of cannibals. The Hitchhiker, we learn, is part of this family, which includes the Cook; the murderous, if childlike Leatherface; and Grandpa, a desiccated corpse that comes to life only at the smell of blood and meat. All gather at what looks to be Sally’s last supper, the table piled high with offal and sausage, which we assume are pieces of her friends or other unlucky travelers in the heartland. The film ends without the now well-known figure of the “final girl” triumphing over the monster. Well, not exactly. We bear witness to another kind of America with a final girl less gritty and confident than we’ve come to know her. Sally, avatar of the last living hip sixties beauty, jumps through a window and runs for her life, slathered in blood and screaming, escaping to whatever fate awaits her in the back of a passing pickup truck. As she flees, Leatherface dances a gruesome ballet with his chain saw. A guttered western sun spreads a brown glow over the waterless landscape, a John Ford shot that would have suited Red River. Filming the movie had been a terror trip. The Texas summer broiled in 1973, making the shoot as miserable as all the characters seem to be on screen. Thirty-two days of temperatures at 95 to 100 degrees and sixteen-to eighteen-hour days made cast and crew hate each other and become dangerously accident-prone. The set almost became an actual chain saw massacre more than once. Gunnar Hansen, a Swedish poet who played the murderous Leatherface, later admitted that he became a bit too enthusiastic about trying to kill Marilyn Burns, Sally in the film. Indeed, swinging the chain saw, he came close to eviscerating more than one cast member and once Hooper himself. Burns later said that when she seems to lose her mind and have a complete psychotic break as she tries to escape at the end of the film, “that wasn’t acting.”4 Director, cast, and crew found the American past and present in Texas apocalypseland. Hooper’s camera moves listlessly across abandoned barns, rusting tractors, and a broken landscape that looks like a bone protruding from sand; rainless, the color of the earth is bright but harsh, baking the eyes of the viewer. Art director Robert A. Burns discovered a dead armadillo on the highway early in the shoot. Burns took it home, read a book on taxidermy, and sewed the animal into a Frankensteined version of its former self. An image of decay lying on the side of the road, vaguely portentous and, as Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) chairman H. Rap Brown said about violence, “as American as cherry pie.” The Texas Chain Saw Massacre appeared just as the crimes of the Nixon administration came slowly to light. The bodies buried in the American landscape had been exhumed, not unlike the harrowing scenes in the film’s opening moments. The house of the dead on Pennsylvania Avenue whispered ill-kept secrets: attempts to subvert a democratic election, the use of the FBI as an internal security force hardwired into Nixon’s presidium of corrupt advisors, and secret wars being waged in Cambodia and Laos that only a few in the Pentagon, and no one in Congress, knew anything about. Facing eminent impeachment, Nixon resigned in disgrace in the last weeks of the summer of ’74. In less than a year, Americans found themselves facing defeat in Vietnam. In late spring of ’75, families watched over TV dinners as the evening news showed the fall of Saigon in real time and the last Americans fleeing ingloriously in a helicopter off the rooftop of their embattled embassy. The most famous images showed hordes of South Vietnamese, who had worked with or for the Americans, being turned away at a makeshift helipad atop a downtown Saigon hotel turned CIA headquarters. During this year of the macabre, millions of Americans unexpectedly went to see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, first in drive-ins and grungy theaters and then on every screen that wanted to make a buck. The film reels turned on squeaky, stained, smoke-encrusted projectors for most of ’74, the movie’s dark reputation growing. The opening titles of Hooper’s film, a crawl that told of “the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history,” convinced some viewers that they were watching a true story, a companion piece to 1974’s controversial documentary that indicted American violence against the Vietnamese, Peter Davis’s Hearts and Minds. Tobe Hooper conjured the family of murderers from childhood tales of the Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, the grave robber, deer hunter, and taxidermist who lived his own gruesome vision of America. To Hooper’s consternation and delight, fans actually argued with the writer and director for decades about whether his film was a documentary or not. They were wrong about Hooper giving them an early example of a true crime murderama/docudrama. But more than childhood tales of Gein’s mayhem influenced the filmmaker. When he was walking on the UT Austin campus in August 1966, a cop screamed at Hooper to get his head down because “someone is shooting from the tower.” Hooper simply stared at the officer for a moment, maybe a little high and certainly oblivious to the mayhem swirling around him. Hooper sobered considerably when bullets ventilated the officer’s major organs.5 Charles Whitman had come to UT Austin to perpetrate one of the most savage mass murders, outside of covert warfare, in American history. Hooper hid behind cars and trash cans along with hundreds of others as the ex-marine fired from the twenty-eighth-floor observation deck of the Main Building. For ninety-six minutes the shots exploded, stopping only so Whitman could meticulously reload the arsenal of weapons he’d lugged up to his aerie. When police finally brought Whitman down, he had killed fifteen people and wounded thirty-one others. Earlier in the day, he enjoyed a quiet lunch with his mother and then stabbed her to death. He then drove home and stabbed his wife three times before heading to the campus. Like Hooper’s brutalist western, Whitman’s story is another tale that’s really about America. 3.I Wish They All Could Be California Girls BOOGEYMEN ALREADY haunted American dreams as the seventies became a turning point for empire. Tex left the ranch late, just as midnight came on and the campfire waned after dinner. He packed a .22 Buntline Special. Colt’s Manufacturing Company (founded in 1855) named the gun after Ned Buntline, the man who created the dime novel western. Wyatt Earp supposedly carried the same long-barreled smoke wagon to every killing he’d ever graced with his presence. Tex hit the trail to play his part in what became known as the Manson murders, despite Charles Manson’s limited role in the actual labor of killing. The importance of “Helter Skelter,” and Vincent Bugliosi’s archetypal 1975 true crime novel of the same name, has carried cultural weight out of proportion to the actual event. Bugliosi told readers a story not unlike he told jurors in 1970. Manson held a series of interconnected beliefs based on an exotic blend of white supremacist ideology folded in with bits and pieces of Scientology, Robert A. Heinlein, and the book of Revelation, all cooked in acid until fully homicidal. Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) proved a particular obsession to the group. It’s unclear whether Manson ever read it, but someone in the Manson Family did. When a child was born as a result of the group’s perpetual orgy, he was named Valentine Michael—a tribute to the alien fascist who’s the hero of Heinlein’s novel, a cult leader who enjoys patriarchal polyamory and “disincorporating” his enemies. Manson could relate. Heinlein, meanwhile, would go on to play an all too important role in the story of the American empire, endorsing policies that murdered more people than his psychotic admirers in the Manson Family could imagine offing in their most extravagant death fantasies. Reading Heinlein can teach you a lot about Manson and about postwar America. But it was Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter that became the book everyone had to read regarding the Tate-LaBianca murders, joining Ann Rule’s The Stranger Beside Me as the template for the true crime genre. It still keeps that reputation after half a century. Ed Sanders, poet and member of the Merry Prankster folk band the Fugs, also won a hearing with his 1971 book, The Family. It’s a wonderfully strange and byzantine mess, a true farrago of diary, reportage, memoir, fact-free rumination, political commentary, and occasionally a very detailed guide to the geography of the Southern California desert. It’s always classified as “true crime,” which is a bit like categorizing Robert Graves’s The White Goddess as classics. Sanders understood that the Tate-LaBianca murders had meaning beyond the actual event and would continue to accumulate meaning in the way of historical events. Joan Didion wrote in her famed essay “The White Album” that “many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969.” Greil Marcus insisted that “Manson’s shadow is everywhere” and suggested that the thrill kills of the Family had something to do with Woodstock, at least symbolically. But he couldn’t have conceivably meant such bum steer bullshit. He must have been upset, in the same headspace as Steve McQueen, when, out of the conviction that death cults might come for all the pretty people of new Hollywood, he packed a revolver to Sharon Tate’s funeral.6 Sanders saw another kind of connection. What made Charles Manson so different from Richard Nixon? What was the meaning of Manson gleefully holding the headline that read MANSON GUILTY, NIXON DECLARES? Why did Manson mock Nixon as late as the eighties and nineties and, in the stygian depths of his psychosis, how was he certain that he, Jesus, and the devil all in one package had actually been responsible for Nixon’s downfall? Maybe all that’s a story about America and not Manson. Maybe we needed Manson in 1969 and have continued to need him for the last half century. “I’m just your mirror” Manson was fond of saying to the throngs who interviewed him in prison; “you see in me what you need to see.” Even a broken, criminally insane clock can be right once or twice. Maybe the theatrical violence, the horror aesthetic that riveted the nation on 10050 Cielo Drive, had its corollary in an awareness of American imperial horrors? Did those two nights in the LA hills become a way to forget, or remember, how murder is done in our name? The Manson murders, many critics of the Vietnam War noted, had brought the war home. Perhaps this American massacre, and our reaction to it, showed our immense moral hypocrisy when it came to the crimes carried out on our behalf. Ed Sanders made this connection by comparing Manson to another figure accused of ordering a mass murder, Lieutenant William Calley. Calley became infamous as the officer who led Charlie Company, Twentieth Infantry Regiment of the “Americal” Division, into My Lai village, slaughtering as many as five hundred people, raping and mutilating as they proceeded. The army at first attempted to cover up the event but then put Calley on trial about one month after the Tate-LaBianca murders. No higher officers, including Captain Ernest Medina, who ordered the foray, faced conviction.7 Around the time the officer who led Charlie Company and Charles Manson came to national fame, Sanders had become the main man on the Tate-LaBianca beat for the Los Angeles Free Press, a countercultural lodestone known just as the Freep. Giving any nuanced view of the fascination with Manson got you in trouble in 1970, just as it does now. But after telling those who accused him of defending Manson to “go make motions of unification with a weather balloon,” Sanders proposed that the country that “perfected the concept of the ‘freefire zone’” in Vietnam and found fragmentation bombs amenable to the spirit of suburbia’s “well-kept lawns” possibly suffered a hypocrisy problem.8 In January of 1971, he forced readers back into the jungle with Calley. He didn’t believe Manson was innocent but insisted that “if you kill Manson you have to kill Calley.” He was not alone in seeing the correspondence. Allen Katzman of The East Village Other wrote that if Manson’s followers slaughtered the Vietnamese rather than Tate and her friends, Manson and his followers would have been “just following orders and obeying the ten commandments.” Even National Lampoon and Mad magazine made the connection, with Lampoon imagining a boxing match between Manson and Calley, won by the latter because of the quick intervention of Richard Nixon. Nothing made this point more brutally graphic in all meanings of the term than Tom Veitch and Greg Irons in one of their “comix” (underground, and very adult, work that emerged in the sixties often associated with Robert Crumb) entitled The Legion of Charlies. The opening page provides two top panels with Lieutenant “Kali” (a Hindu goddess associated with death) telling his troops “we’re gonna hafta wipe um all out.” The bottom two panels feature Manson demanding that “piggies must die . . . let’s get ’em.” The satire gets weirder as the U.S. government decides legions of Manson followers can kill and cannibalize with more speed and panache than the U.S. military. “We’ve taken the logic inherent in today’s news,” Veitch wrote, “and taken it to absurdity.” That’s just peacenik rhetoric, right? Sure it is. But that doesn’t change the fact that, as Manson had ordered his family “to do something witchy,” Calley ordered Charlie Company to do much the same. There’s nothing in the official army records that vindicates or even mitigates what happened that day. Moreover, as explored later in this book, the incident reads as a microcosm of the larger American war-fighting plan in which the United States would behave like a brutal confused schizophrenic, offering the Vietnamese people largesse to win hearts and minds while raining down hell and destruction in nearly incalculable tonnages of bombs and chemical weapons. Long before Calley and Manson, Horace Greeley’s injunction to “Go west, young man” became both the rallying cry and an epithet for a country determined to manifest the fuck out of its destiny. There’s a vicious subtext of violence and rapine in the tendency of American history textbooks to describe the opening of the West. The image suggests a flower opening to sunlight, but darker images await. Settlers violently “opened” the West; prospectors, frontier start-up entrepreneurs, saloon keepers, and, most of all, soldiers tore their way across the continent to make the first American empire. Ed Sanders thought “the Family” had, like Tobe Hooper’s clan of the chain saw, headed west to grow up with the country, an acid nightmare of violence becoming how the West was won. If only Joan Didion had brought the sensibility of her essay “John Wayne: A Love Story” to her epithet for the sixties. Maybe Gay Talese could have pressed his metaphors further in his famous March 1970 Esquire piece “Charlie Manson’s Home on the Range.” As things turned out, it proved easier for the liberal intelligentsia and the American ayatollahs of the eighties right-wing backlash to declare the death of a fragile period of experimentation with social justice than to see 10050 Cielo Drive as a hyperreal theme park of the American empire, an allegory of the dream of an ever-expanding West, a corollary to a brutal war in East Asia where kids nursed at the man-teat of John Wayne and talked about “playing cowboys and Indians” in the jungle of the new frontier, and an aging Wayne himself tried to shore up the fantasy in his ludicrous 1968 pro-war film The Green Berets. Americans loved reading about Manson and still do, but the millions of Asian corpses didn’t move them. Richard Nixon may have declared Manson guilty, but he declared Lieutenant William Calley innocent. In April of 1971, Nixon ordered Calley released from the custody of military police, pending his sentencing. Calley remained under house arrest for three years until federal court judge J. Robert Elliott overturned his conviction. Sanders was wrong. If you convict Manson, you can actually let Calley go free. Elliott even attended Calley’s wedding. Plenty of mythmakers, across the political spectrum, have found in Manson a seething symbolism. Culture warrior Senator Ted Cruz seemed worried about his ghost voting from prison as late as 2020. Depending on who you read, Manson “killed” or “weaponized” or “embodied” the sixties. Manson had the power to make Americans believe in him, and through successive interviews over decades with everyone from Geraldo Rivera to Ronald Reagan Jr., he successfully became the boogeyman. He started this in his trial, where spoke of “these children who come at you with knives.” A damn good line used to describe three not-children who came not for their parents but for an emerging actor and her friends at a Norman-style chateau in the Hollywood Hills that once belonged to Lillian Gish. The little crook his followers called “The Wizard” scried up the perfect storm. Cultural critics insisted on calling his Family “the cult” and “the commune,” turning Manson into “the Dark Hippie,” the sum of all the half-mythical silent majority’s entirely mythical fears. Rolling Stone saw this coming in June of 1970. Manson would become the bourgeoise bugaboo, “the long-haired devil you loved to hate.”9 What was not to hate? Manson had taken the life of Tate, America’s new beach beauty, even as she’d been on the brink of becoming an oddly political sex symbol—a Jane Fonda who’d never let our boys down. She’d been a real sweet girl from Texas, Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas 1943. A military brat, Tate lived in Texas, California, and even Italy because of the work of her father, Colonel Paul Tate, who later served as an intelligence officer in Vietnam. She was the all-American girl who only in your most grandiose of fantasies lived next door. Almost exactly eight years before being butchered in the Hollywood Hills, the icily gorgeous Tate, a Catherine Deneuve for Grand Ole Opry Fans, posed for the Atomic Frontier Days in Richland, Texas. Feet shod in boots, wearing shorts that revealed her lengthy tanned shanks kissed by the Texas sun, she straddled a Nike-class surface-to-air-missile, cowboy hat on her head. This was four years before Stanley Kubrick used the image of Slim Pickens bronco-busting a missile in Dr. Strangelove. The event celebrated the local plutonium manufacturing plant and its role in America’s system of mass destruction. Floats paraded down Main Street Richland reading THE WEST, NEW AND OLD, the atomic missile and the six-gun, the arms race and the cattle drive, the hope that the commies would go down like the Mescalero Apache. She continued to be a strange icon of American power. A few years later, Tate appeared mostly unclothed in a ham-handed attempt by Esquire to parody Mao’s Little Red Book, his turgid quotes juxtaposed with Sharon in wet T-shirts and bandoliers. Today, it looks more like a self-own, a parody of Esquire’s stated commitment to what they described as “the capitalist way of things” when they introduced Tate’s spread in the summer of ’67. Tate became a symbol of all kinds of things before the ’69 murders, just as she would after. Glamour, a rags-to-riches story, the ingenue that might become a star, something sexy and American. Her anti-communist wet T-shirt photos and willingness to rail on a missile seemed to make sense among baby boomers for whom “do our own thing” could mean the perpetual contact high of living in Haight-Ashbury or marching in an anti-war demonstration or growing old enough to support Donald Trump while believing QAnon and the Pentagon Papers bear the same level of meaning—the generation so certain of both the power of crystals and the danger of “chemtrails.” Can you dig it? After all, the world lost Tate because, while some women of the sixties founded and fought for the work of the National Organization for Women (NOW), a few female boomers lived in a biblical patriarchy with a hirsute, death-obsessed little goblin who played the guitar well enough that he attracted the attention of Byrds producer Terry Melcher and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Lynette Fromme, Leslie Van Houten, Linda Kasabian, and a host of others went California dreaming with a man who hobnobbed with new Hollywood while building weaponized dune buggies to fight Black Panthers in the San Fernando Valley. A very American story. So maybe the children were coming for an older America with knives out? Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman seemed scary, if not as utterly terrifying in the middle-class imagination as Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. For most of the white American mainstream, Manson served a useful purpose. The silent majority could silently nod as their president called this diminutive fright wig of a guy “guilty, directly or indirectly” of the murders of eight people. This just felt right, being so afraid that you felt an extra dopamine rush of satisfaction at the dark messiah’s sentence. It felt wrong to be upset over the hundreds of Vietnamese dead at the contested borders of the American empire. Fantasizing about the intruders, Manson’s Lugosi-eyes floating in mist above them, entering the Tate-Polanski home felt so much better than picturing young American soldiers raping and murdering an entire village at a leisurely pace, the hours it took to terrorize and butcher and burn becoming so wearing that most of Charlie Company took a lunch break before resuming the slaughter. Certainly no one wanted to think about how My Lai represented only the tip of the bloody spear in Vietnam, how tens of thousands of civilians died in the Mekong Delta during Operation Speedy Express or how “free-fire zones” made such massacres a tactical imperative. Lieutenant William Calley claimed he was just following orders. But rather than pondering the implications of that story about America, why not dwell on Tex Watson announcing to Sharon Tate and her coffee heiress friend Abigail Folger that “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business”? Better yet, let’s imagine that Manson said it. Let’s imagine the sixties revealed their true meaning on a single night in Benedict Canyon. Let’s forget the end of an era occurred in the Mekong Delta or at Kent State or with the Christmas bombings. Horror makes it easier to live in an empire. Except when it doesn’t. Tobe Hooper wanted the chain saw to show Americans a story about their country. George A. Romero described himself as “pissed off” that the promised “revolution” of the sixties had never truly come. Could his flesh-eating ghouls be the only kind of revolution that could endure? Could they at least interject chaos into the new American consensus that made meaningful change seem impossible by the 1980s?10 A fascination with horror, and the hope that horror can be so shocking that it burns this motherfucker down with the sound of a chain saw roaring in the distance, tells us about more than just the American seventies. It’s a history that has something uncomfortable to say about being a citizen of the American empire at this moment. The horror con that becomes an actual blood bath or the Halloween theme park where you are stalked and slaughtered by very real psychopaths appears in films like Blood Fest, Haunt, The Houses October Built (1 and 2), Hell Fest, and No Escape Room. Each ask the viewer to consider what horror actually means in a society where it’s everywhere. Awash in uncountable podcasts, documentaries, wikis, tribute websites, and books about “true crime,” how have we come to understand violence? When what counts as news has also taken on the tincture of hyperreality, a drop here and a drop there of rage and calamity, what do we mean by horror? Chain saw horror always comes as a crisis of knowledge. The portal opens when spells are whispered in some dark, forgotten tongue. What was not known is revealed and—uh oh—it’s something we never should have learned. Or maybe it’s better to know, to find the text or the amulet or the buried body to end the terror? We need the chain saw if we want to understand how America works. The slaughterhouse that calved a thousand maniacs means learning that everything you thought was true is wrong. Understanding politics and ideology means taking apart the assumptions that live like parasites in our minds. Chain saw horror does that. It doesn’t worry about the relationship of map and territory. It assumes the map has been lost, or drawn with malevolent purpose, and the territory is a place where you are about to die. 4.I Used to Hate the Water NOT EVERYONE in the United States wanted to turn the American myth into a slaughterhouse on a Texas homestead, or a California one. By the summer of 1975, another film seduced an even wider audience. The American public showed its Janus face by turning out in droves for a summer fairy tale with a monster in it, even as catching a midnight showing of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre remained a whispered dare, teenagers and adults watching with guilt and delight. Jaws came to swallow the entertainment industry whole. At a moment in the history of Hollywood and the United States when the national success story seemed to have ended with screams and the ear-splitting sound of a chain saw, the blockbuster, for the first time, became a perennial part of summer. The term referred to a film so popular, and so mainstream, that hopeful viewers lined up around whole city blocks waiting for their tickets. Steven Spielberg started the trend of Hollywood making an endless summer of high-concept films that sold tickets, tubs of popcorn, and colas by the tens of millions. Spielberg came of age with Tobe Hooper but took a different set of lessons from both film school and the America of the fifties and sixties. It’s impossible to imagine the young, thin enfant terrible saying his blockbuster Jaws was a movie about America, even though it inadvertently shows an even more frightening side of the country’s shadowy self than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It’s a story of American innocence and ability to triumph, a bloody companion piece to his friend and sometime collaborator George Lucas’s American Graffiti (1973). Huge crowds loved Jaws and shoveled 260 million dollars into ticket booths during a recession (1.2 billion in current dollars). No film had ever performed like this before, both at the box office and in a new world of movie merchandizing with iron-on Jaws T-shirts, books, and even a board game. Spielberg conjured an alternative vision of reality to Hooper’s dark Massacre. Awash in vivid blues, Jaws combined horrific death with a hopeful message about a can-do America. Anecdotes tell of American audiences breaking out in a home-team-scores-a-touchdown cheer as the monster goes KABLOW! after a million-to-one shot from Roy Scheider’s rifle to an oxygen tank the shark has ingested. In the final scene, Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss have blown the shark to bits and swim off into a sunset on a makeshift raft, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer of the seventies. Everybody is safe. Amity Island, the focus of the creature’s attacks, seems more like a mild, quiet suburb than an island facing off with a monster. Before the giant shark comes along, the biggest worries are kids “karate chopping picket fences.” It’s more than a geographical island—it’s an island out of time, America’s dream of itself in the fifties, a place where you’d never know Vietnam or Watergate ever happened. Everyone is inexorably middle class and happy until the shark shows up to ruin it. But then our heroes kill it and America can go on dreaming the dream of itself. Chain Saw and Jaws, appearing at the same cultural turn, are the twin poles of American imagination at a crucial moment in the country’s history. Jaws offered a nightmare, but one met on the way to a dream come true. It’s a film manifesto for an America where men with square jaws destroy monsters. It’s not Tobe Hooper’s warning about the monsters hatched from the dragon’s teeth America sowed in its own soil, about what had been and about what was coming, what was coming for all of us. Who could go watch Jaws and cheer while the country faced defeat, economic decline, and maleficence at the highest level of government? Didn’t Hooper’s dark vision make more sense? A film like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre becoming so intensely popular needs no explanation; it suited the times. But the sun-drenched seascapes of Amity Island are straight out of a fifties creature feature, and they promised escape from very real fears. How could such different films become so popular in the same country? To understand this is to understand the nature of the American empire and its citizens’ profound lack of interest in confronting that reality. It’s different from every imperial power that’s come before it. It pretends not to exist. It’s willing to use lethal violence or to celebrate it uproariously, and then to forget it, to imagine its consequences are less important than they are. The public goes along—except when they suddenly don’t—but then reveal once more their genius for moderation, simplistic thinking, and unwillingness to face the truths of the world that gives them the iPhone and The Bachelor, golf carts and local breweries, Whole Foods selling you fresh fruits out of season and delivery services that bring an insane variety of goods—unimaginable bounties for 99.9 percent of humans who have ever lived—to your door within hours. The horror emerges and then subsides, the corpse appears only to vanish, the past surfaces and then gets a premature burial, the shark attacks but a hero blows it to chum. America, and Americans, lighted on an innovative way of being imperial. We see this in our horror fictions and we find it in the difficulty many Americans exhibit, especially those who thrive most within its system, of even thinking of their country as an empire. The hard truths remain waiting, even when ignored. The story of empire traces its way down the centuries, leaving eerie glyphs not always easy to decipher. The facts never have the tensile strength of memory’s fiber-optic cable. We tell our stories to distort the real story. Although this book explores horror and the empire’s influence on the present cultural moment, it also questions what we think we know about the deeper past. It puts the idea that we are the white hats under a hot light in a dark room. It asks whether we are telling the truth when we look at some atrocity and say, “this is not who we are.” Once, the chain saw and the shark tried to make a movie together. Poltergeist (1982) joined the murderer’s row of classic horror films. It took a switchback path to production, creating confusion about who exactly shaped the film, Spielberg the producer or Hooper the director. The confusion at one point became a legal dispute, and it was not only fans who took sides. The Directors Guild of America ultimately awarded Hooper a cash settlement and accused Spielberg and MGM of downplaying the indie horror director’s role while celebrating the film as another triumph by the maestro of the mainstream. Apparently, Poltergeist had its beginning, sort of, when Spielberg wrote a script called Watch the Skies. When Hooper came on as director, he scrapped the plot that catered to the renaissance of alien obsessions from the fifties that dominated the seventies. Hooper worked since the release of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre on a film about the supernatural and the secret history of the suburbs, and that’s largely the film he made. Poltergeist follows the Freeling family into a home built in a “planned community,” an old idea but a much more common phrase in the 1980s. It’s the quintessential American no-place, an LA suburb called Cuesta Verde, following Californian and Floridian real estate in its habit of taking banal phrases and making them “exotic” by translating them into Spanish. The sprawl is advertised as “where dreams comes true.” In a Hooper film we need no further warning that this is nightmare country. Cuesta Verde incarnates apex Southern California just as Southern California acts as avatar for apex America. The fictional neighborhood could be Chula Vista in its infancy or anywhere in Orange County. Hooper set his night terror in the middle of what poet and essayist Alice Bolin called “the insanity of LA’s epically unsustainable urban development” with the unspeakable secret being that “it was all on purpose.” She’s commenting on Joan Didion’s 1990 observation that LA embodied “a new kind of city, one that would seem to have no finite limits, a literal cloud on the land.” Didion and Bolin could be describing the whole of U.S. history. A booming sprawl of an empire never contained by borders, each crucial, misguided step in its manifest destiny fully planned and mysteriously financed, with Americans ever after squinting at the spiraling chaos and asking how we got here. Hooper embraced that chaos, and we are in his dark dream of America, despite the widespread belief that Spielberg took the reins from his director. It’s evident Spielberg’s enthusiasms are there. It is truly very frightening, and yet you can tell Hooper pulls his punches. The spookiness is decidedly PG. Spielberg did create, by Hooper’s own account, a pointless sequence involving a child and an astral journey to the afterlife that bloated the film by twenty minutes. He possibly held the idea that she would end the haunting in a cloudbank of “and a little child shall lead them” schmaltz—a trope that is to Spielberg as inscrutable as endangered blonde women are to Hitchcock. But Hooper brought the chain saw to mainstream audiences. He happily included political commentary, showing boomers with a hippie, or at least a doobie-filled, past that are really starting to dig Reagan. This is distinctly un-Spielbergian, as he made sure to erase any references to current American politics, and drug use, from Peter Benchley’s script for Jaws. The closest we get to politics in the war on the Great White is the vague suggestion that small-town mayors in bad ties are often insouciant. More importantly, Hooper did what Spielberg never would; he placed the horror in the cold guts of the American home. In the Spielberg-verse, the inhuman never threatens the security of American domestic spaces in films, never making it beyond the shoreline. The uncanny comes as space brethren, poorly disguised Christ figures, ETs, and close encounters. They are either cuddly friends or quite literally messianic messengers who’ll soon have you joyously sculpting your mashed potatoes and then going to live with them in the mothership. Hooper’s vision is far bleaker. The dénouement is pure chain saw, in fact recalling the opening frames of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This time it’s not the sandy loam of Texas that regurgitates its dead. It’s the family swimming pool. The whole Freeling family runs screaming from their home in the night while an eldritch portal pulls their house into Hades and part of the planned development where dreams come true goes down into the dark. We will enter that darkness. The phantoms of a thousand Native American massacres are roused throughout this book. The roots of America’s wars are about what happened in 1965 or 2001, but also in 1918, 1898, and before. Beware how the roots of history clutch and call us back to a past as criminally deranged as the present. Empire’s shadow even blankets the golden haze of World War II, that supposed “good war.” It’s all a story about America, the chain saw, and the shark. 5.Built on Top of a What?? THE ROOTS of American power, memory, and historical amnesia are deep, reaching back through the centuries when a handful of violent settler societies with their minds set on commerce seized lands belonging to the Pequot, the Yamasee, and the Powhatan, some of the earliest Native American peoples destroyed in conflict with colonies in New England, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Clinging to a narrow band of colonial outposts from Georgia to Massachusetts, white settlers began the slow and steady conquest of a continent, killing Indians, felling trees, slaughtering animals, and fencing open land in a “new world” that previously held no concept of private property. By contrast, the Europeans developed a concept of property so expansive as to include human beings. The enslavement of African people in Virginia began early in the seventeenth century, more than 150 years before the American Revolution. Colonies like the Carolina settlement included the right to own African people in their charters. Early in colonial America, some poor whites worked without wages as indentured servants. The practice died out, however, and indentured servants eventually earned their freedom. Colonial law regarded African men and women as chattel, literally “movable property” like a cow or a wagon. White supremacy became more than a domestic institution. Racism played the central role in the creation of the American empire. Its shadows whisper all around us in the present, a nightmare from which the world has never roused. Horror films have dealt with the memory of America’s imperial beginnings by turning to the trope of the haunted Indian burial ground, a notion so well-worn that it has acquired the acronym IBG. The Amityville Horror (1979), The Shining (1980), Pet Sematary (1989), and the Poltergeist series (1982–1999) all deal in various ways with the idea that, as the famous line from Pet Sematary has it, “the sour ground” became a place of darkness because of its history. Both Colin Dickey and Shea Vassar describe how, somewhere at the edge of white awareness, there lurks the realization that American capital built an empire on the remains of the dead. The idea has become so deeply imbricated into American culture that in Poltergeist (1982), the unlucky Freelings seek reassurance that their extraordinarily haunted house is not built on an Indian burial ground. Even The Onion hasn’t been able to leave the idea alone, in 2011 using the darkly funny headline “Report: Economy Failing Because U.S. Built on Ancient Indian Burial Grounds.” Empire’s beginnings are soaked in blood, in genocide. Many know about the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, in part because of the American Indian Movement’s (AIM) insistence that the country face it in 1973. Few know that hundreds of massacres resulting in tens of thousands of deaths (and often the enslavement of survivors) occurred from the period of earliest settlement. English settlers murdered and enslaved Powhatan people in a 1609 war of extermination. In 1704, for example, Governor James Moore of the Carolina colony marched a volunteer militia all the way to northern Florida to slaughter one thousand Apalachee people and enslave two thousand more. This was one of dozens of such incidents that occurred before the American Revolution and the beginning of expansion across the continent. Frontier mercenaries known as “rangers,” early America’s version of “civilian contractors,” slaughtered the Cherokee in Georgia and East Tennessee and did the same to the Shawnee of the Ohio Valley. Several early presidential administrations (often cliques of land speculators who stood to make fortunes as the settlers moved west) gave themselves “plausible deniability” about some of the worst atrocities. In the seventy years after the United States became a nation, almost continuous warfare carved out a continental empire, killing hundreds of thousands of Native peoples and turning those who survived into colonial subjects penned in apartheid-style homelands. Massive fortunes accrued to white elites, and plantation slavery spread southwest. The psychopathic violence of counterinsurgency masterminds like Andrew Jackson made political careers. Jackson prepared himself for the presidency by ruthlessly destroying the Red Stick rebellion in the spring of 1814, a group of guerrilla fighters who received their nom de guerre from their crimson spears. In what is now northern Alabama, the so-called Battle of Horseshoe Bend made way for the creation of the states of Alabama and Mississippi, both slaveholding strongholds. This battle amounted to nothing more than a massacre of eight hundred Muskogee, Shawnee, and African insurgents who fought as “red sticks.” Like the décor fashioned from human skin, and the mask of Leatherface himself in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Jackson’s troops stitched saddles and horse bridles from the skin of their enemies and delivered scalps of fighters, of children, of old men, as souvenirs for “the women of Tennessee.”11 In the next century, because of the American empire’s overwhelming preponderance of military power, the United States and the world wandered through the dark carnival. Wars of extermination on the empire’s frontier were only the beginning. The human catastrophe the history textbooks file under “westward expansion” served only as precursor for the global violence of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 6.Horrors, Foreign and Domestic HARRY TRUMAN seemed to have a fine time of it when he served as an artillery officer in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. His letters home to Bess Truman are a peculiar cocktail of saccharine sentiment, blockheaded observations, and sheer bloodlust. Amid sweet nothings, he casually mentioned his pleasure at helping to lob “1,800 shells at the Huns.” All in all, Truman declared World War I a “terrific experience,” a sentiment only a young American of below-average intelligence could hold in 1917–1918. He did regret, as he said in one of his idiosyncratic love letters, that the warring powers signed the armistice when they did. The peace that settled on the blood lands of the western front on November 11, 1918, meant Truman would miss out on the chance to “detonate Germany and cut off a few of the Dutch [common slang for German] kids’ hands and feet and scalp a few of their old men but I guess it will be better to make them work for France and Belgium for fifty years.”12 Truman wore the uniform of a country about to become the next great power. The American home front suffered nothing in comparison to every other major participant in the global war, really almost nothing on its own terms. However, American combat troops suffered horrific casualties, especially given the short period the AEF engaged the German army: 116,000 dead and 266,000 wounded, a number that does not include the hundreds of thousands the war traumatized mentally. American culture simply did not respond to the cataclysm of the war the way much of the rest of the world did. While France, Britain, and Germany built cyclopean ossuaries to hold the mangled dead (Menin Gate, Douaumont, Tannenberg), statues of cheerful and brave doughboys littered America. In fact, even when it came to recalling the broad-gauge murder of the World War I, the business of America was business. E. M. Viquesney, originally of Spencer, Indiana, proved equal parts talented sculptor and virtuoso advertising shill with his The Spirit of the American Doughboy. In 1921 he sculpted a monument of America’s soldiers of the Great War that presented one of them emerging onto an imagined battlefield, the statue’s hollowed-out limbs made of cheap sheet bronze advancing toward an unseen enemy, right arm raised and left arm holding a Springfield rifle. Viquesney mass-produced the image, and city halls and civic groups across the country purchased the adventuresome-looking sculpture to place in front of courthouses, on major thoroughfares, in front of Veterans of Foreign Wars or American Legion halls, and on college campuses. In fact, the first appeared on the campus of Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, where it aged poorly in weather, nearly forgotten for a century. Finally, its shoddy condition caused enough embarrassment that the college replaced it.13 The emerging American consumer economy of the 1920s allowed individuals to break off a piece of Great War memory and take it home with them. Along with monuments for purchase by civic groups, Viquesney manufactured twelve-inch miniature figures of the statue and even a version of the statue in which the doughboy’s triumphantly extended right arm held . . . a light bulb. Advertising copy for this desktop ode to the American fighting man promised the piece would serve to memorialize “the intrepid Doughboy’s part in raising the hope-inspiring light of democracy for a world in darkness.” You could select a shade in “decorated parchment” or “elaborate silk.” There was no need to worry if you, like so many Americans in the twenties, found yourself low on cash but high on patriotism. You could buy on credit. The ad, in full caps, offered the unintentionally chilling phrase, “WE FINANCE YOU.”14 Viquesney never became immensely wealthy from The Spirit of the American Doughboy, but he made enough—partially from investment in local projects in Indiana—that he weathered the crash of ’29 with panache. But despite his promise that the spirit of the doughboy carried “a hope-inspiring light,” he himself suffered from depression exacerbated by personal loss and poor health. He asphyxiated himself in his garage in the autumn of 1946. The Spirit of the American Doughboy kept marching without his maker. In fact, he’s marching on a hundred years later. Since 1918, when, as is sometimes said, the British Empire won a war through suffering a horrific defeat, the island nation slowly began to lose the world it built for itself. America inherited that world and its problems but came up with new solutions . . . insidious solutions. But first, the muscular nation needed to secure the home front. Too many of America’s own citizens, including those denied the basic rights of citizenship, would not get with the program of shifting from an erstwhile republic into an economic and military empire. So the bleak world the United States built after the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 not only wreaked havoc around the globe. Americans, the working class, people of color, any dissenters, all suffered as their nation-state became a global leviathan. The foot soldiers of the new empire suffered first. While Viquesney made them archetypes in bronze, actual veterans returned home in 1919 with no economic prospects, having served a government unwilling to provide aid. World War I veterans anticipated what had popularly become known as a bonus payment from the government. The bonus, in the past paid in land as well as money, represented an imagined difference between what the soldier could earn at home as opposed to the pittance made as doughboys. For many, it embodied a kind of social covenant and a safety net that aided veterans after the economic disruption of military service.15 President Calvin Coolidge dismissively referred to the idea of the bonus as “patriotism which is bought and paid for,” though Congress overrode his veto and granted more than three million bonus certificates to veterans that they could redeem over time or borrow against. After the beginning of the Great Depression in ’29, President Herbert Hoover effectively rescinded this plan. Unemployed and deeply embittered, twenty-five thousand veterans marched on Washington with over ten thousand men and their families setting up Hooverville in Anacostia Flat, a muddy river bottom of the Potomac. The Senate declined to pass a bill paying out the bonus, and Hoover sent regular army troops, tanks, and machine guns to clear the tent city. The aggressive move resulted in one hundred injuries and wounds. Some veterans attempted to set up camp again, and this time Washington police fired on them, killing William Hushka and Eric Carlson. Both are buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Much-reduced bonus payments would eventually come in 1936. Some former doughboys took the route of many European Great War veterans and became the muscle for the new right-wing nationalisms that flourished like a sward of noxious weeds in the twenties. The boys back from France, especially those associated with the wealthier, upper-middle-class leadership of the American Legion, followed the lead of Mussolini’s veteran “Blackshirts” in seeking to stamp out even the hint of homegrown socialism. The head of the American Legion praised Mussolini’s war on “Bolshevism.”16 Admiration for Il Duce sometimes led to directly copying the violence of the Italian fasci. Such mob violence certainly did not limit itself to horror film screenings. On the first anniversary of the armistice in 1919, members of the American Legion attacked a hall belonging to the Centralia, Washington, branch of the International Workers of the World (the IWW, better known as Wobblies). Members of the organization, already harassed by local authorities and the public mobs who often worked with them, had the temerity to fight back. In the running gunfight that followed, ranging all over the streets of Centralia, they killed four legionnaires.17 Centralia authorities, aided by a posse, arrested eleven of the Wobblies. On November 12, members of the Legion cut the town’s power lines and used the thick darkness to break into Centralia’s jail and seize one of the imprisoned IWW members, Wesley Everest, himself a Great War veteran. The lynch mob murdered him in an especially ghastly fashion, then let his corpse lie on the river bottom overnight. Everest’s killers retrieved the corpse the next day, dropping it like a rag doll on the floor of the local jail, a rope still around its neck. Everest had become an IWW member soon after the war. Like many of his comrades, he returned home to a sluggish labor market at a time when a small number had made enormous fortunes, including some whose businesses had boomed because of the war. Furious at how the lumber barons reduced his fellow workers to penury and a nomadic, essentially homeless existence, he came to believe deeply in the IWW radical program to dismantle capitalism in America. His murder offered a lethal response from the freebooting barons of American industry. The country’s economic power brokers faced down open and violent dissent before. During the railroad, coal, and steel phase of the industrial revolution, the nation’s ruling class made use of brutal paramilitary contractors like the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, the recently reformed National Guard, and even the U.S. Army itself to break strikes, hunt down labor leaders, and respond with lethal force against striking workers. States deployed the National Guard one hundred times between 1886 and 1893 alone. A few months before the Great War began in 1914, National Guard troops and a private paramilitary force deployed by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (part of the Rockefeller empire) machine-gunned and burned to death whole families of striking workers who lived in a tent city raised outside the company-owned town of Ludlow.18 The American empire abroad thrived in a bloody permaculture fertilized at home. The idea that America is a democracy and not an empire simply doesn’t square with the facts. Denial of the right to vote has been a continuing theme in American history. Disenfranchisement of African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and even the white working class has been a political reality backed by violence. Individual states in the Cold War passed laws restricting the rights of Americans who joined “communist-front” organizations and then created their own blacklists. Meanwhile, even before the digital age, the national security state practiced counterinsurgency at home as well as abroad. Since a 1978 law that allowed the FBI to continue spying on American citizens, the bureau asked for thirteen thousand warrants with only one ever denied.19 The Great War triggered the repressive power of government and corporate interests to coalesce. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the slightest peep out of dissenting political groups often led to power brokers responding with the bludgeon of a mailed fist. Seattle experienced a general strike in February of 1919, though one in which workers made exceedingly minor demands. The mayor received the aid of the U.S. Marine Corps to squash the effort. In the fall, police in Boston went on strike with the simple demand that city government allow them to join the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a moderate and arguably even conservative labor organization. Public officials around the country used terms like agents of Lenin and Bolshevik nightmare to describe their action. The threat of an intervention by the army again crushed the strike.20 Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer’s raids against suspected radicals are well known. The incidents of mob violence and local repression that accompanied them have not become a part of American memory. A Connecticut salesman spent six months in prison for praising Lenin’s intelligence. An Indiana jury acquitted a man for killing an immigrant who had said “to hell with the United States” a bit loudly and in public. The rule on Amity Island has always been to never bring up the shark, especially on the Fourth of July.21 Official acts of repression also unleashed lynch mobs against African American communities and individuals. The fear of political subversion made a poison alliance with white supremacy. The violence visited on sharecroppers in Alabama and Arkansas who attempted to unionize provides an example. But, with savage irony, mobs also targeted Black communities if they became cradles of small-scale capitalism, havens for an emerging Black middle class behind what W. E. B. Du Bois called “the veil” of Jim Crow. The pogrom against the “Black Wall Street” of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 has become the best known of such incidents. However, white supremacist violence erupted against African Americans in Washington, D.C., as early as the summer of 1919, some of it directed specifically against Black veterans of the Great War. Outside of these large-scale assaults, seventy-eight Black men died at the hands of lynch mobs in 1919, many of them burned alive in public rituals, enacted amid a carnival atmosphere.22 Leaders of heavy industry and finance could afford to act with near impunity against working-class Americans. The United States had been a debtor nation in 1914, but most of the world found itself indentured to the nation by war’s end in 1918. By 1929, Great Britain owed the United States an amount equivalent to one half their national income. Much has been made of the effect of the payment of war reparations by Germany, though the practice had long been a part of European peace settlements. The real story concerns how the United States saw the payment of German marks to Britain and France as crucial to maintaining a credit squeeze on their allies, keeping much of Europe servicing a mortgaged war. One financial writer for The Boston Journal made this plain, crowing triumphantly that, “Europeans must pay tribute for years to come.”23 So emerged the roaring twenties, a state of mind rather than a historical era. Some of the myths of the twenties actually happened. A nation of Gatsbys held parties for the extravagantly wealthy, and bathtub gin, jazz, and short skirts gilded life with glamour even for some of the plebeians. Millionaires became multi-millionaires. Many Americans who bought into the decade’s optimism looked askance at socialists and even organized labor. They believed that captains of industry wrangled their impossible wealth on the frontier of America’s Wild West economy through sheer force of will. Moreover, in this world of new American possibility, they themselves might own at least a small strip of beachfront on Amity Island one day . . . at least a little cottage with oceanfront access so they could go back into the water. By 1929, the entanglement of American money with the international debtor economy led the country into crisis. The shark had started feeding. America coughing caused the rest of the world to die of pneumonia in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. But in truth what historian Eric Hobsbawm describes as the “house of cards” created by the first (but not the last) American effort to shape the world economy had come crashing down.24 7.Weird Mystery Tales THE GREAT Depression represented a crisis for American capitalism and also suggested a crisis of confidence. Left-wing organizations, including a public and popular Communist Party of the United States of America, drew one hundred thousand new members and made allies in labor unions and left-leaning organizations. Many Americans wanted change in the thirties, a period that has become known as the country’s Red Decade. And yet, optimistic images of the American spirit like the unfortunate Viquesney public square monuments and parlor room tchotchkes reveal that much of the nation saw itself as a kind of Amity Island fifty-five years before Steven Spielberg’s Jaws (1975) gave the image to the world. In the minds of many middle-class white Americans, their towns and cities functioned like privately owned resorts, and the country itself could forget that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it had been a battleground of many nations, some European and others native to the continent. Politicians, who represented the interests of the wealthiest Americans and the class that aspired to be like them, could even speak of “isolationism,” a country able to hide behind its two walls of water after having done its part in a world war. Isolationism has largely been a myth that really means “the United States will make unilateral decisions rather than forming meaningful alliances.” During the era isolationism supposedly shaped American standards of international behavior, the country launched incursions into Mexico, occupied two Caribbean nations, toppled the government of Nicaragua, and seized major islands in the Pacific and dozens of small islands for what was rapidly becoming the American tradition of building multiple military bases in every region of the globe. The pretense of isolation extended to culture as well. European veterans scripted, produced, directed, and acted in what would become the first silent horror films, but Americans eschewed the emerging genre. When Variety reviewed Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the entertainment magazine tried to interest American audiences by calling it “a mystery story told in the Poe manner,” though it also warned them “it is morbid.” A much stronger, indeed violent, reaction to the film appeared in the streets of Los Angeles when Miller’s Theatre attempted to premier it in May of 1921. A two-thousand-person-strong protest, ginned up by William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers, prevented the film from being shown. Moving Picture World, a bubblegum guide for movie fans, wrote Caligari off as more evidence of “degenerate German invention.”25 Lingering anti-German sentiment left over from the Great War explains some of the negative responses to a motion picture that would play an important role in reimagining what a film could do, what it could be about, and how it could call forth new emotions. But something even more pungent, part of the bone and marrow of belief in a particular kind of America, called forth these violent responses. Most Americans did not like horror, or more accurately they thought it had nothing but ill intent. In fact, Americans seldom to never used the word horror as an adjective for films, fiction, stage plays, carnival shows, or other entertainment outlets. The use of the word weird in describing most any storytelling that departed from formulaic American flicks featuring action, romance, and comedy (often all at once) predated the Great War. Reviewers often described turn-of-the-century magic shows, especially those that encouraged audiences to view their illusions as the supernatural creeping across the boundaries of the rational, as weird. Any film that suggested mystery, supernatural or not, received the label weird. Early film magazines regularly described the weirdness of comedies that featured humorous ghosts, even when they turned out to be dreams or a kind of Scooby-Doo experience of a human pretending to be a visitant from beyond. The cinema scholar who has written the most about how Americans received and reviewed “weird” films, Kendall R. Phillips, sees a peculiar turn in attitudes toward them. By the time of the Great War, reviewers for magazines like Variety had begun to connect spooky topics on screen with “foreign” productions that are also described as “ghastly” or pretentious. The term weird went, Phillips writes, from being a general term for tales of the fantastic “to connoting films that were decidedly foreign and, ultimately, un-American.”26 Americans wanted their entertainment to let them visit an Amity Island without the shark. Threats to the beautiful heroes of cinema had to be of the criminal, often inept, variety in the 1910s and early ’20s. Americans raised monuments to the happy warriors their doughboys had supposedly been or used the image as peculiar reading lamps or parlor lighting, as the ads for the patriotic saint statues said, “in a world of darkness.” But as they did, large numbers of actual veterans fared poorly in the postwar years, a fact that helps us understand the otherwise inexplicable rage Hearst could stir over the showing of a somewhat challenging German art film that Americans hadn’t exactly clamored to see in the first place. 8.Empire’s Butcher Bill THE SECOND World War accelerated the options opened to the new world power as the United States took control of military bases all over the world. Bases leased from Britain in exchange for U.S. arms marked a kind of formal changing of the imperial guard, the last wheezing gasp of “Rule, Britannia!” An aggressive American foreign policy created flash points of conflict with the Soviet Union that provided numerous opportunities for the United States to extend its reach. Japan and islands seized from it like Okinawa gave the United States far-flung ports of call. West Germany hosted hundreds of U.S. bases during most of the Cold War. But this wasn’t enough and so, sometimes, the United States just took what it wanted without apology. In 1953, the United States seized a sizable chunk of Indigenous lands in Greenland, giving its inhabitants only a brief deadline before the U.S. Army bulldozed their communities. This became a forward base for America’s nuclear triad and is the root of one of the Trump administration’s frequent non sequiturs, a briefly touted plan to “buy Greenland.” The small-footprint empire that the national security state thought it had made had at least as much, perhaps more, destructive effects on the world than earlier powers. The large land and naval empires of the past ruled oppressively but, in cases like Austria-Hungary or the Ottomans, they also held in check and even salved conflicts between the peoples within their borders for hundreds of years. American hegemony had the opposite effect, ginning up older conflicts and even creating new ones. Since 9/11, the contours of the American empire have become increasingly clear. Ironically, President George W. Bush—until 2016 perhaps the chief executive most ill-informed about American foreign policy and one who surrounded himself with a coterie of operatives with decades of secrets to keep—spoke most openly and forthrightly about American imperial imperatives. In September of 2002, what became known as the Bush Doctrine called for preemptive strikes against any nation, at any time, in order to make possible “free and open societies.” It also, for the first time in American history, declared that the United States would not allow any nation to challenge its military preeminence as had the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Karl Rove, often referred to as “Bush’s brain,” announced matter-of-factly that “we’re an empire now . . . we’re history’s actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” An openness about the expansive use of American power continued, transmogrifying under the Trump regime into weaponized tweets that advertised threats, insults, ambitions, and sometimes even explicit initiatives—empire gone viral. The immense popularity of horror, and the violence horror revels in, restages the horror of empire’s reach for screaming audiences and chilled readers, who can’t take their eyes off the mayhem on screen and page. It’s the nature of living in an empire. Life in the empire means, above all, experiencing violence as a way of life. The shape this takes depends very much on whether you are a citizen, a citizen with limited constitutional and cultural protections, or a subject with no rights that the unimaginable colossus of American power sees itself bound to protect. But whether you are part of a wedding party slaughtered by a U.S. drone attack in Yemen or a bored middle-class dad in Kansas flipping between news channels featuring stories about school shootings and footage of explosions in places you couldn’t locate on a map, lethal threat and force are the coin of the imperial realm.27 So it has ever been with empires. The Assyrians of the ancient Near East welcomed you to their cities with monuments made of the skulls of their enemies, stele that celebrated the destruction of whole civilizations and their peoples. The Roman Empire brought its captive opponents in chains to parade them through the streets of their capital. Even Victorian Britain featured carnivals and freak shows that displayed the subjects of the empire as primitive, exotic, and defeated. The British Museum became a warehouse of objects ripped from the hands of colonized peoples. We have horror. It speaks our language of violence and conquest, sometimes to alarm us and sometimes to tell us that daddy vanquished the monster under the bed. Multiple Hugo Award–winner N. K. Jemisin’s now classic The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms featured a scene where the protagonist confronts the way the imperial power that runs her world legitimizes itself through lies, half-truths, and the general assumption of superiority. “They found so many ways to lie about the things they did,” she thinks. “It mocked the suffering of their victims.” It’s become very easy for us to lie about the things we do and to mock our victims’ suffering. Since Rove admitted the United States not only built an empire but could rearrange how the public conceives of reality, few Americans have been aware of the drone strikes that have killed civilians at weddings, at funerals, and in civilian refugee convoys. Living as a citizen of the empire means never having to think about it. Meanwhile, living as a subject, or victim, of the empire means never being able to forget it. Horror films are one of the few places the nature, the violence, and the failure of American power blinks in the unearthly light of the present, a blighted, ugly fog where you can find yourself wandering in a past they didn’t teach you about in school or looking into the abyss of a lost future. In Puerto Rico, you are ignored and disenfranchised with no voice to speak with and no vote to cast after being hit by a catastrophic Category 5 storm like 2017’s Hurricane Maria. In Sudan, your family grocery explodes after a drone strike, killing your brother and his wife because a “person of interest” who may or may not have been associated with Al-Qaeda or ISIS lived a block away. If you are an eighteen-year-old Marine Recon recruit between 2003 and 2021, you hump your way through a desert toward mountains likely hived with caves of Taliban fighters. You are about to become a casualty of a war that started before you were born. Privileged America doesn’t understand all the ways reality differs from their experience of it. There is a shadow moving at the edge of our consciousness, and the maestros of our dreams remind us it waits there. 9.The Thing on the Stairs “AS SOON as I looked up, there it was, and it was horrible.” Ray Bradbury, a little kid in the twenties, experienced waking nightmares of a monster balefully watching him from the top of the stairs. He remembered how the shadowed presence waited for him nearly every night. He would scream, sometimes fall backward onto the floor at the ghastly presence. He could recall, nearly ninety years later, his parents sighing and saying, “Oh my God, here we go again.”28 If a monster haunted the stairwell, a peculiar combination of rockets and dinosaurs filled his dreams with wonder. At the age of five, Bradbury thrilled to The Lost World, a 1925 film based on a novel by Arthur Conan Doyle that imagined explorers finding a land of dinosaurs in a remote part of the Amazon basin. He soon devoured Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. In his teens, he befriended the future genius of stop-motion animation Ray Harryhausen when both joined the Los Angeles chapter of the Science Fiction League. The boys had been enchanted by King Kong (1933), a film both friends claimed they saw hundreds of times. A love and terror of the primal, prehistoric beasts and behemoths from out of time lived in the same heart as an obsession with the future. It was one of the many paradoxes in the life of Bradbury that the man who wrote The Martian Chronicles and predicted everything from earbuds to artificial intelligence hated the internet, refused to type on a computer, did not want any of his work released in electronic format, and never learned to drive. And yet, he has inspired several generations with a dream of the stars. NASA gave the touchdown site of the Mars rover Curiosity the name Bradbury Landing when, on what would have been his ninety-second birthday, it settled into the waterless volcano-born regolith of the red planet.29 As a young teen, Bradbury found relief from his monsters by writing a short story a week in the basement of the UCLA library. Having discovered he could rent a typewriter for ten cents, his fingers began clattering away. Only death chilled them to a halt in 2012. Science fiction and horror are siblings, twins who have always tried and failed to cut a different figure from one another in the world. Dreams of the stars never really banished the terror of Bradbury’s monsters, and some of his anxieties remained decidedly earthbound. While he watched American society descend into political conformity in the 1950s, he wrote Fahrenheit 451 about a not-so-unbelievable near future where the “firemen” burn books because of the danger they present to the social order. Bradbury’s first short story collection, Dark Carnival, appeared in 1947 from Arkham House, a press first created for the sole purpose of publishing the short fiction of H. P. Lovecraft. The stories, many of them later republished in his 1955 The October Country, deal with how a skeleton might decide it could get along without its fleshier parts, how death might play the gentleman caller, and the kinds of things that live in the deep places of the earth. They are his monster at the top of the stairs. He went back to this nightmare land in the 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes, a book he originally called (again) Dark Carnival. Probably known to most for the Disney film adaptation, it’s arguably the best novel of Bradbury’s incredibly prolific career. In it, Cooger and Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to a small town, appearing in the middle of the night. The lights of the carnival draw the townspeople, all dissatisfied with their lives, into halls of mirrors, dark rides, the carnival clown’s uncomfortable laughter, and the call of the barker that offers wonder, mysteries, and something new, something different, if ultimately something as wicked as the title suggests. The small town as the setting for something dark to emerge has haunted the American imagination over the last century. It’s the little California village of Santa Mira where the pod people descend, a place where everyone knows everyone and there’s just the one local doctor in the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In 1960, Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone offered “A Stop at Willoughby,” the story of an anxiety-ridden businessman given the chance at a new life in a little burg. The viewer learns of the true horror of such seemingly anodyne hopes when the dream ends, and we face a more believable bleakness. Tobe Hooper imagined a lethal carnival coming to a little Florida town in The Funhouse (1981), a place where Mom and Dad tranquilly watch Bride of Frankenstein at home while a maniac dons a rubber mask of Boris Karloff’s monster and slaughters their kids in the ultimate haunted ride. In 1984, the nightmare comes to quiet Elm Street when Freddy Krueger extends his serrated glove in murderous rage, or maybe, the film asks us, it already lived in the hearts of the parents and their very eighties fear of the ill-kempt stranger. Stephen King’s Derry, Maine, was a little hamlet of human-made horrors before terrifying transdimensional clowns began croaking out of storm drains in the novel It, the 1990 TV limited series, and the more recent blockbuster films. Simple, staid, and very white America. When the sinister carnival comes, all the fairy tales that have poisoned us come alive and show their teeth. But even then, we’d rather believe the monsters are out there, and not in here with us. Even the most paranoid of Americans have found a way to tell themselves horror stories that are ultimately comforting. 10.The Greenbaum Effect THE WAY of the shark, the story of an innocent America fighting an outside threat, ultimately wants you to believe everything is just fine. Because of the nature of American exceptionalism, and because of the structures of imperial control that hardwire how Americans experience reality, some aspects of horror culture assure the watcher that everything’s okay and, in fact, really, really nice. Horror’s nightmares have not escaped the American dream of consumption and domination. One response to the confrontation with a reality in which “the worst thing is true” has been to amass stockpiles of weapons, suppress Black and Brown Americans, and attempt to exclude, colonize, and even exterminate perceived foreign threats. Don’t worry about the thing on the stairs. If you don’t want to be “woke,” it’s terribly cozy to sleep on peacefully while vast tracts of American horror culture allow you to float in Amity’s warm and woozy dream. But you can hear the chain saw’s death rattle in your dreams. Horror has also whispered about things we did not want to know, would prefer not to hear, about American history. These are stories that, while well-documented, you likely have either not heard of or, if you did, sounded like odd anecdotes. In some cases, you may think some of what you’ll read about can be dismissed as conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories are, like horror, tales of how the worst thing you imagine is true. “You think things are bad? Well, let me tell you, buddy, you don’t know the half of it.” Most readers likely view the conspiracy theorist as someone engaged in a granular drilling into obscure facts helped along by untreated mental illness who then freely dispenses the false information they have cobbled together. The idea of conspiracy has a complicated history, much too complex to relate here. Historians and cultural critics have sometimes viewed the American people as peculiarly vulnerable to false conspiracies. The American colonies premised their war for independence on the idea of a “conspiracy against the rights of Englishmen” among the king’s coterie of advisors. The country’s first partisan election in 1800 found John Adams supporters claiming Thomas Jefferson to be a member of the Illuminati who would confiscate Americans’ Bibles. In the midst of America’s post–World War II red scare, with many Americans certain Bolsheviks hid under their beds, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote his essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics” for Harper’s Magazine. Hofstadter claimed that a “paranoid style” of political rhetoric had been part of the American experience since the early national era and that it infected people across the political spectrum. In the 1950s, it just so happened that the American right had begun to suffer, “afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us,” but also by their “fantasies” about how the world works.30 The way Americans use conspiracy is, of course, not just a matter of the past. Tom Engelhardt wrote in 2015 that white Americans believe themselves the victims of various dark conspiracies by terrorists, even as they enjoy the protection of the most formidable arsenal of conventional and unconventional weapons in history. He notes that at a Trump rally in New Hampshire, audience members told horror stories about “‘training camps’ for terrorists” and a “new holocaust” taking place right there in New England with people “loaded into boxcars” and assassinated by ISIS. Then-candidate Trump said nothing to discourage such talk, as it fit his and his supporters’ “fact-challenged fantasy of a country,” a military and economic colossus somehow being victimized in lurid, gothic terms. Trumpism and its adherents may represent the apogee of what these and many other writers and thinkers have claimed about conspiracy theory. The belief in Qanon, the driving engine of Trumpism’s most devoted followers, seems to confirm America’s special identity as Conspiracy Nation. In order to understand these strange impulses, it appears we are forced to disagree with Hofstadter’s assertion that all of us have to deal with history’s afflictions, while conspiratorial thinkers are what he calls “double sufferers” in facing “the real world” and “their fantasies.” Is this true? What if the fantasies Americans accept as false conspiracy theories protect them from the real world? Perhaps it proved easier in the fifties to think about your government hiding a flying saucer than it is to look into how your country became the first, and so far the only, nation ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population. Or in the 1980s it seemed anything but comforting to tell myths about Satanists who murdered innocents at will. But perhaps it proved more salutary to the mind than the well-documented fact that your country engaged with terrorists, gunrunners, and international drug cartels to funnel arms to a band of mercenaries plotting to overthrow a legally elected government in Central America, or that the nation bears responsibility for brutal dictatorships ranging from the Iranian shah to Idi Amin to the Khmer Rouge? The strange story of Dr. Corydon Hammond and the illusory “Dr. Greenbaum” best illustrates this tendency of false conspiracy theories to add an extra layer of confusion to the nation’s maleficence. Hammond gave us a perfect template for this mythic bait and switch best called the Greenbaum effect. At a major medical conference in 1992, Hammond claimed that a Jewish scientist he identified simply as Greenbaum worked with the Nazis during World War II, teaching them various satanic mind control techniques learned from the kabbalah. After the war, this sinister figure came to the United States, where the CIA recruited him in their efforts to perfect brainwashing techniques. Somewhere in this anti-Semitic super villain fantasy, the highly peripatetic Greenbaum helped build a demonic infrastructure in America made up of, Hammond claimed, “tens of thousands of mental robots” engaged in everything from gunrunning to child molestation rings. All of this, he asserted, had the goal of creating “a Satanic Order that will rule the world.”31 Hammond’s claims call for chilly sarcasm. His use of age-old anti-Semitic tropes and laughable suggestions of satanic influence, however, hide the fact that almost every one of his unsustainable claims has a real-world analogue, a refracted mirror image of his easily falsifiable assertions. For example, we will see in this book that the CIA and the Pentagon did recruit Nazis to work toward American hegemony in the Cold War. The CIA also engaged in experiments with mind control, primarily with LSD, focused on the prison population. Former CIA directors have testified before Congress to this effect, and you can read the official history of the MK-Ultra experiments on the agency’s own website and in declassified documents available from the National Security Agency. And while the perpetual delusions of satanic covens kidnapping and killing children have zero basis in evidence, gunrunning has been a foundation of American foreign policy with a particularly egregious example, the Iran-Contra scandal, coming to light just a few years before Hammond made his claims.32 The Greenbaum effect is the tendency of Americans to choose outlandish and unsupported conspiracy theories while ignoring the conspiratorial actions of political and economic elites that are backed by evidence. It has shaped almost every decade of American life we’ll consider. Hammond’s early-1990s vacation from reality reveals that fictions immunize the public against the dark realities, neutralizing them and causing rational people to question other assertions of conspiracy, actual conspiracies, when they appear based on fact and from reliable sources. If a huge number of Americans are ineptly tangled in conspiratorial beliefs while ignoring actual conspiracies, another and perhaps larger proportion of the country uses conspiracy theory as a term of derision for any suggestion that powerful economic and political elites might collude together for unethical purposes. As this book explores in part 3, the CIA and a very willing American media engaged in a psy-ops campaign in 1968 to damn the ideas of the conspiracy theory and conspiracy theorist. Their conspiracy to spread conspiracy theory worked more thoroughly and quietly than most of their other efforts. One finds even among rational Americans, maybe especially among them, the tendency to use conspiracy theory to describe well-documented facts like the Iran-Contra arms deal, the CIA arming of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the 1980s, and the influence of the petroleum industry over the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. The same well-worn terms are used to describe evidence-free absurdities such as alien crafts being hidden away at Roswell, New Mexico, or a race of lizard people masquerading as the world’s ruling elite. In the meantime, false conspiracies, often weaponized by racism, flourish. Real conspiracies have hidden in plain sight. Now and again, as we’ll see with the flying saucer panic of the 1950s, the praetorians of American empire have seen the utility of the Greenbaum effect, pushing absurd fantasies to hide the empire’s work. This has allowed the American empire to have not only a “small footprint” but also in the lives of most of its citizens, an invisible one. It’s always been easy to sound a little crazy talking about American imperial power. The power of the Greenbaum effect and the public decision to regard some facts as Michael Parenti’s “dirty truths” makes it a risky endeavor to state the obvious. 11.Stranded in a Nightmare CONTEMPORARY AMERICANS feel stranded in their history. Those born in the seventies, eighties, or nineties, they called their grandparents “the greatest generation.” They learned a little about the Vietnam War, mostly from the movies. Something bad had happened there, something that was no one in particular’s fault. The events of 9/11 shocked them into supporting a war that cost them nothing. The upsurge of patriotism in the first Bush administration did not impel these Americans to volunteer for military service; recruiters noted in 2003 that few seemed to want to sign up for an actual war. The president told them to “get down to Disney World in Florida” and “go shopping.”33 But this is no tired polemic about the current generation’s inability to live up to some imagined greatness in the past. For the American generations who were your grandparents or great-grandparents, the world was easier than they admit—if they were white and in a relatively stable economic situation. World War II created the largest and most prosperous middle class not only in American history, but in the history of the world. The G.I. Bill, at least for white veterans, opened up the possibility of home ownership in suburbia and, because of segregation in the form of housing covenants, homogenous neighborhoods. The G.I. Bill allowed the U.S. government to build a white middle class quite literally from the ground up with subsidies for education as well as housing. Wages rose so high for middle-class Americans that they confessed themselves baffled by the changes from the 1930s. And, like the old false dream of the West, indeed like some biblical prophecy, deserts bloomed in California, Nevada, and Colorado after federal damming and irrigation projects. Hydroelectric power brought both light and water to what early white settlers had seen as a wilderness eager to kill them. National Geographic painted an image of the American frontier turned from threat to quiet paradise with “endless farms, all atwinkle, like stars along a manmade Milky Way.”34 Peace and security and more than the hint of the elusive notion of happiness. But, as often in peculiar dreams, many Americans felt a chill and knew something was very wrong. The American horror film that, as early as the 1950s, began to remind us again and again of the dues of empire, attracted fans who experienced these costs in their daily lives. The most escapist of such films, from the sometimes bizarrely optimistic sci-fi of the fifties to Jaws in the seventies, promised the bliss of terror quieted: there are threats, but we will defeat them and you, viewer, are part of that “we” that will benefit from the violence we will execute in your name. We are blowing up the shark for you. But the shark and its death throes offer only horror that comforts the comfortable. The shark is not just the predator gliding in the water out there. Imperial power does not simply do its wet work abroad. White supremacist and class violence have become the cost of maintaining the wealthy, the gated communities, the suburbs, and the illusion of safety. Global economic exploitation begins at home. Shadows purple mainland America, and even those who have thrived in the system see it from the corner of their eyes before quickly looking away. In many rural states, the death rate among infants, especially in marginalized groups, places the United States at thirty-second among the thirty-five wealthiest nations in infant mortality. In a country where everyone from paupers to billionaires report themselves as “middle class,” an aspirational assertion more than anything, one quarter of American households somehow subsist on under twenty-five thousand dollars a year. Many of these households include more than one wage earner, often working an exhausting and debilitating job in construction day labor or the fast-food industry. Nursing home assistants, day care employees, home health care workers, and EMTs are told to see their long and stressful weeks as vocations even as they struggle to pay bills. Tens of millions labor in the often-humiliating worlds of big-box retail, the daily uncertainty of the gig economy, the cubicled call center, or the dangerous, dehumanizing abattoirs of factory farming.35 Tobe Hooper understood this when he made his cannibalistic family out of people destroyed by their work in a slaughterhouse that didn’t need them anymore. Jordan Peele knew the same in 2019 when the film Us (U.S.?) featured the zombie-like “tethered” coming forth from an underground world to destroy the America of showboat SUVs and vacation homes more luxuriant than the houses much of America rents from a landlord, or from a bank. During the last century, the United States has been, writes historian Joshua B. Freeman, “as dominant in the world, in its own way, as Great Britain and Rome had been at the height of their empires.” But Freeman may underestimate American power, or at least what living in the empire has meant for the nation-state’s middle and upper classes. Inequality defends itself against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There’s not a question now of “how the other half lives” within the borders of the nation, what Americans took to calling “the homeland” in the early twenty-first century. Instead of “two halves,” there’s instead now 70 percent of us hustling and striving every day to live on declining wages and limited access to health care, a (relatively) stable and secure 29 percent of us whose privilege is more fragile than we think, and a tiny coterie of tech and investment oligarchs who have utterly unimaginable wealth counted not in the billions and often not even in the tens of billions but in the hundreds of billions. Hooper’s vision, the horror film literally reframing American history in all its primeval savagery, has remained the best and simultaneously the most politically subversive part of the genre. The alleged age of prosperity feared the atom bomb and the invasion of alien forces that would burn the suburbs to the ground, forces that could stand in for Soviets or Black Power advocates. While the country became mired in its violent campaigns in Southeast Asia, George A. Romero created an army of the dead. In the Reagan era, white flight took those who could still afford it from the suburbs to the exurbs, quiet towns now supposedly safe but threatened by unstoppable menaces like Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger. After 9/11, pronouncements of war without end and brutal retaliation against all conceivable enemies brought Romero’s zombies back from the dead while making torture sadism a Roman coliseum of the American mind at the local Cineplex. Horror waits for us at the end of empire’s dreaming.",

      "content": "1.Twilight Zone THE ROAR of sixteen-inch naval guns made one young Navy recruit from Brooklyn imagine a hundred subway trains flying over his head. Amid the cacophony of the explosions unleashed from nearby ships, Ensign Gabe Pressman could not identify the even more massive shells lobbed in his direction, thinking at first the flashes across the crepuscular horizon must be heat lightning. Pressman’s small ship, the PC-470, formed part of the American seventh fleet that steamed into the Philippines to retake the American colony, seized by Japan at the same time they struck Pearl Harbor. The small craft normally performed patrol duty, sometimes acting as a submarine chaser tracking the Nazi “wolfpacks” of U-boats in the Atlantic. On October 23, Pressman’s boat faced the daunting challenge of landing troops on the fortified island of Leyte. The American invasion force included a future writer who, anguished almost daily by his experience of combat, became one of the most trenchant critics of the country whose uniform he wore in that late October of 1944. Halloween came early for him, and millions of others, that year.1 Rodman Edward Serling had the terrifying experience of landing on Leyte and establishing a beachhead. Japanese snipers harassed his unit, the 511th Parachute regiment, who fought as light infantry in the Pacific. Rod, as everyone called Serling, joined the army immediately after finishing high school in 1943. In the days before graduation, he’d been aglow with idealism about the war against the Axis, and tried, not very successfully, to recruit his friends at Binghamton Central High School in New York. Serling would also be disappointed in his hopes of getting to Europe to fight the Nazis. Instead, he found himself the summer after high school graduation training with his regiment in New Guinea for the planned assault on the Philippines. He had no concept of what awaited him on Leyte. The landing itself proved surprisingly easy. The battle raged offshore while Serling’s unit hit the sand behind the main landing parties. The smell of cordite, charred metal, and burning petroleum saturated the air as American and Japanese airplanes twisted into death spirals and fell into the Pacific, staining the turquoise waters black and red. Although they had no way of knowing it, Serling on the beach and Pressman from the deck of PC-470 took part in the largest naval engagement in human history. American submarines sank two cruisers. The American carrier USS Princeton exploded in a giant ball of flame following attacks of wave after wave of Japanese Zero fighters. The enormous hulk slid under the water as little more than shattered steel debris. In turn, American Hellcat fighters made this victory costly, downing a huge number of land-based Japanese aircraft. Meanwhile, repeated attacks from American torpedoes against the largest battleship in the world, Japan’s seventy-thousand-ton Musashi, eventually capsized the beast, the seas trembling under the monster’s weight before embracing it. On October 25, the third day of the battle, another American escort carrier took a direct hit from a kamikaze attack and gurgled under the waves only an hour later. Serling knew little about the details of the carnage occurring offshore the relatively peaceful sands of Leyte Island. Despite continuing attacks of snipers, the beach had been won. His unit soon moved inland, where they encountered significant resistance from Japanese ground forces. In a single firefight, Serling received wounds in the wrist and knee, although, per army policy with combat troops in the Second World War, he quickly returned to combat. But a more gruesome memory of the Battle of Leyte Gulf stayed with the nineteen-year-old. Serling could hear the peculiar combination of faraway explosions and airplane engines competing with the eerie counterpoint of somnolent surf sliding across the sand. Serling paused with some of his fellow soldiers in the so-called Death Squad, the demolitions platoon of the 511th with a reputation for high casualties given the nature of their work, attempting to disarm land mines and booby traps under the deadly eye of Japanese snipers. The sun broiled high and hot, but a breeze picked up across the ocean spray now and again. Serling sweated under a palm tree with some of his fellow privates while his buddy Melvin Levy, the 511th’s aspiring comedian, performed some impromptu stand-up for their other pals. In the middle of his routine, a low-flying U.S. transport plane suddenly roared overhead and dropped its payload of army rations, an enormous crate weighing hundreds of pounds. The huge container knocked Serling to the sand but barely scraped him. It landed directly on Levy. Serling saw his friend decapitated, the sudden impact turning him into human paste.2 An absurd accident amid the chaos of one of the decisive battles of the Second World War. A meaningless sacrifice, an incident that seems like it belongs in Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. For Serling, it opened a doorway to a dimension of the imagination, a region in the middle ground between sight and shadow, the entry point into the twilight zone. 2.Death of the Monsters? THE ENTRANCE of the United States into World War II came at a time when, not unlike the plot of one of Universal Studio’s classics, the monsters died only to resuscitate and return. They could and did become icons of empire. A new kind of fandom for horror films appeared. This audience had been forged by large groups of mainstream fans of the golden age of the early thirties that played a crucial role in keeping the macabre alive when the studios showed little interest. The release of 1935’s Bride of Frankenstein showed every indication of being the last of the great Universal Studio horror films, and horror seemed out of style. After 1936, Universal went into receivership under the guidance of the powerful John Cheever Cowdin. His portfolio included Standard Capital, Ideal Chemical, and Curtiss-Wright, the largest supplier of airplanes and aviation-related war material for the American army at the end of World War II. Cowdin sat as president and member of the Board of Directors of Universal Studios during this entire period, while studio head and early Hollywood icon Carl Laemmle Sr. received a promotion that removed him from day-to-day operations, and Laemmle Jr.—responsible for ensuring the production of masterpieces like The Phantom of the Opera, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dracula, and both of James Whale’s Frankenstein pictures—received a pink slip. He retired into relatively wealthy obscurity by age thirty. Cowdin seems like a caricature of a mid-century American capitalist, owning more companies than he could pay attention to, distracted by his interest in polo, having his multiple marriages blessed aboard his yacht Surf, and getting himself voted one of the best-dressed men of his era by Esquire. Under his benign neglect, a new vision of filmmaking emerged at Universal that favored cost cutting and subject matter that suited Americans who understandably wanted to avoid thinking of themselves as victims of their own economic system.3 The 1936 Universal film My Man Godfrey provides a perfect example, featuring a story of a Boston Brahmin with the bluest of blood who decides to live in a “hobo camp” for a bit of slumming adventure. The hero marries thirties beauty Carole Lombard after saving her dad’s business and opens a night club that puts his homeless pals to work. It’s a plot more bizarre than any monster movie, a fantasy of an America free of class conflict, where money that appears out of nowhere sets everything to rights and romantic love quite literally seals the deal. Audiences loved it and so did the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which nominated the flick for six awards. Universal decided its future lay in big-budget romances, light-hearted musicals, and serials like Radio Patrol and Jungle Jim. The latter became a successful effort to plagiarize the Tarzan books and films while joining the rise of “jungle horror” in legitimizing allegedly primitive people’s needs of American patronage abroad. Horror from the crypt and the laboratory seemed dead in this new environment. The genre suffered further from years of a near glut of films at the box office, not all of them the classic monsters from Universal. In 1935, rival studios had given the world the Werewolf of London, The Raven, and the Mark of the Vampire, with Universal managing to sneak past the censors a year later, with some significant changes, a wildly outré sexual and psychological thriller entitled Dracula’s Daughter. The deluge of scary caused one alarmed writer for The New York Times to worry that morbid films embodied “the national state of mind.”4 He may have been right. The term horror fan had not yet become a common one. But these fans of darkness were out there and, more important, the children of the Depression wanted to meet the monsters their older brothers and sisters obsessed over. The year 1938 surprised the studios and started a new round of horror films, most much less creative than the first efforts but satisfying for the generation that would fight the Second World War. My Man Godfrey seemed from another world. 3.My Man Frankenstein THE CRAZE started in Beverly Hills when a single hard-up theater owner had the idea of trying to revive the success of horror enjoyed in the early thirties by showing Frankenstein, Dracula, and King Kong in a marathon triple showing. The response was a bit too positive, with police called to restrain the crowds. Universal started charging hefty rental fees for their marquee monsters, and larger venues on Wilshire made room for the incredibly raucous crowds that seemed almost desperate to see the films again. Most theaters dropped King Kong, or added the RKO property to another double feature, but Dracula and Frankenstein stayed together, a deeply twisted meet-cute. Soon the Blue Mouse Theatre in Seattle picked up the idea promising “A MAMMOTH HORROR SHOW!” The Seattle Daily Times on August 25, 1938, seemed proud, if a little tentative, that their city “kept pace with the success that has attended this weird mystery entertainment.”5 The Seattle paper mused that the double bill offered a good opportunity for what it called “jaded mystery fans.” But it’s clear that the crowds coming to see what motion picture trade papers dubbed “the horror boys” included more than an older jaded crowd. Anecdotes suggest that the return of Dracula and Frankenstein’s monster set off a wave of young children skiving out of school. Theaters like the Blue Mouse charged twenty-five cents for adults but just a dime for “children” (age undefined). The double bill moved east to Salt Lake City, where an incredible line, probably overestimated at five thousand people, waited to see the vampire and the animated pile of corpses that went by his maker’s name. The theater’s manager rushed to rent out extra space. The now infamous undead duo came to the Capitol Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, which offered “ten dollars to the lady that will volunteer to see it alone,” even though the enormous crowds suggested no real necessity for the promotional push. Ads in Spanish ran in Dallas that warned viewers that “Bela Lugosi represente a un hombre pavoroso que calmba su se con sangre humana.” In Montreal, a dry account of the phenomenon told viewers that the vampire and the “unhuman” monster of Frankenstein recalled some of the “old German films,” in other words the films of Weimar Germany—Caligari, Nosferatu, The Golem—that first cradled modern horror.6 “Can you take it?” asked an advertisement that ran in the Brooklyn Eagle when the delirious furor over the films made it to New York City during the Halloween season of 1938. The RKO Albee Theatre, just west of Fort Greene Park, dared and really threatened their customers with a double feature of “Bela Lugosi in Dracula” and “Frankenstein with Karloff.” The Rialto in Manhattan ran the films ten times a day to satisfy crowds through much of the autumn. J. Cheever Cowdin played a lot of polo and made much of his fortune in the munitions industry while his studio’s now very famous monsters packed Americans into movie houses. Monster fans were attempting, so claimed at least one commentator, to escape worries about a world of “war and dictators.” But accounting at least paid attention and Motion Picture Daily could announce that after “scanning its profit books” Universal Studios constructed “eerie sets” for the 1939 Son of Frankenstein. Universal’s new management made the most of the rage and urged theater owners in a trade paper ad to “Throw away the books! Forget all you Everknew [sic] about showmanship! Because horror is paying off again!”7 If monstrous nightmares rather than capitalist fairy tales made money, let them have their terrors. Meanwhile, Cowdin made only part of his enormous fortune at Universal. While he worked on his tan and drank cocktails on the Surf, he let middle management decide if they wanted to keep the old Universal Studios warehouse of monsters or embark on the new sensation for “chillers” that billed themselves as “psychological horror” in the wake of World War II. Armament sales increasingly occupied him, and the emergence of a new American military, preparing itself for global hegemony and a Cold War, beckoned with profits to be made. Curtiss-Wright survived a controversy that, in a rational economy, would have destroyed it forever. In 1943, an investigation revealed that high-ranking army officers who, as one claimed, had been “wined and dined” by the company, knowingly allowed defective engines to be sold to the U.S. Army Air Force. Army officers faced court martial, though the civilian contractors who bribed them faced no penalties whatsoever.8 The company itself endured, eventually getting into a peculiar and profitable combination of the oil industry intertwined with supplying parts for nuclear submarines that would become part of the American “nuclear triad” of apocalyptic weaponry delivered from bombers, from ground-based missiles, and by sea. Today, the company’s website touts its core values, including leadership, innovation, and, in a peculiar take on the idea of values, “winning.” If Cowdin’s dapper ghost went online right now, he might find some of his company’s current corporate-speak confusing and elliptical. Nevertheless, he certainly represented a twentieth-century American type who saw “winning” as a “core value.” The form success took didn’t matter much to him, whether delivering a goal-scoring swing of a polo mallet, producing films like House of Dracula, or making tens of millions of 1940s dollars in the Cold War arms race. By 1945 a broad cross section of Americans saw “winning” as an ethical value, even if they did not put it in exactly those terms. In an atmosphere of America’s growing optimism about itself, the monsters could be fun too. 4.Monster Mash “A NECROLOGY of the inmates of this macabre manse includes practically everyone in Universal’s vicious varsity,” wrote New York Times critic A. H. Weller of House of Frankenstein in early December 1944. Weller viewed the latest in the Universal monster series at the Rialto, the storied palace of moviegoing at the corner of Forty-Second and Broadway. He liked the flick, though he encouraged prospective viewers to “bring a tongue and cheek and an open mind.”9 While Rod Serling endured the horror of the Philippine campaign, Americans at home experienced a near-complete repurposing of the terrors born in the golden age of 1931 to 1935. Horror films during World War II self-consciously offered, as Weller described, “more chuckles than chills.” The studio that gave the country Frankenstein, Dracula, The Bride of Frankenstein, and The Invisible Man in the thirties began to decline by 1941, when German émigré Curt Siodmak scripted The Wolf Man, the first successful lycanthrope lope across foggy moors starring Lon Chaney Jr., the hangdog-faced only child of the man who terrified Americans in the twenties. Son of Chaney became a mainstay in horror for three decades without ever quite managing the octave of his father’s dark song. If you believe horror films are not about anything but sudden scares and unnerving situations, The Wolf Man appears to make your point. At a crucial junction in American history, the beginning of the clash between Japan and the United States for Pacific power, Americans flocked to see a fantasy about curses and gypsies and bogs with man-beasts in a contemporary Europe in which no one referenced or even seemed to know that there was a war on. Did the monster mash offer nothing but a safety valve, a place to take our anxiety, a place where horrors emerged red-fanged from the shadows only to dissipate as the credits rolled? The dark carnival succeeds because it breaks our temporal prison, allows us to enjoy some amnesia about the world. Popular culture allowed frightening world wars to seem anodyne. It encouraged people to forget the horror of their own lives. Plenty of real-world horror needed ignoring. In the first months after Larry Talbot found out that the autumn moon doomed him to shape-shifting, bad news about the newest global war rattled out of every newsreel moviegoers saw before the film; the headlines of the morning paper wearied them even before their day began. In the weeks following the December Pearl Harbor attack, Bataan and Singapore fell to Japan while German U-boats ravaged American shipping. In one of his famed fireside chats, FDR rather ominously evoked the miserable condition of the Continental Army at Valley Forge and made use of the famed Thomas Paine quote about times that “try men’s souls.” Under the direction of Roosevelt’s government, the National Association of Broadcasters forbade the use of the phrase now for some good news from the radio, as it highlighted the bleak situation.10 Universal Studios understood. Producers followed up Siodmak’s scruffy new monster with what became known as monster mash films (later inspiring Bobby Pickett’s 1962 hit single). The studio unleashed their whole catalog of monsters in an effort to keep American audiences entertained in the midst of war, pitting Frankenstein against the Wolf Man, throwing in Dracula for good measure, sometimes spoofing the monsters that had frightened the kids who, now in their late teens and early twenties, grinded slowly up the Italian peninsula, fought for every village in Nazi-controlled France, or landed on frighteningly fortified islands in the Pacific, jungles hived with determined enemies. The monster movies’ turn toward the silly and sensational didn’t represent an entirely new phenomenon in American filmmaking, far from it. The moviegoing public, and the studios themselves, had never taken “the cinema” as seriously as their European counterparts. Only amid the Great Depression, a time made of equal parts despair and rebellious impulse, did European directors like James Whale, Paul Leni, Karl Freund, and Edgar G. Ulmer successfully bring meditations on morbidity and fairy tales about death to American audiences uncertain about the myths they had been taught since the turn of the century. In the desperate and hungry thirties, only gangsters competed with monsters for America’s sympathy, both sticking it to a corrupt system, even if fated to be ground under by its wheels. But it’s impossible to overestimate American optimism, or at least American hubris. By the late thirties, the screwball romantic comedy proved the most popular genre, often featuring the lavish, fun-loving lifestyles of the wealthy. Director George Cukor’s Holiday (1938) featured Cary Grant turning cartwheels as he prepared to marry his wealthy fiancée (Katharine Hepburn). The moviegoing public loved a rags to riches story or, even better, a riches to even more riches story with nuptials as a lagniappe. The men who owned the movies by the late 1930s provide the best explanation for the values screened by popular films. The old joke that only organized crime and filmmaking are depression-proof proved half right after the collapse of the world banking system in 1929. Almost all the major studios went into receivership, staying afloat with funds from the banking houses that built American capitalism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Others went completely bust, their assets soaked up by brokerage firms with origins in the Gilded Age. Obviously, this does not mean that movie scripts suddenly issued forth from a cabal of capitalists in a smoke-filled room, all dressed like the top-hatted real estate mogul from Monopoly. But it would be naïve not to note that plenty of movie deals that made a small number of families rich did occur in gilded rooms filled with the actual smoke of cigars enjoyed after steak dinners while millions of Americans starved their way through the Great Depression. Of course, layers of artistic freedom, not to mention middle management, existed between the bosses’ values and what showed up on local screens. So what happened to the movie industry of the thirties couldn’t be called a conspiracy . . . except insofar as parting customers from their money requires premeditation and planning. The small coterie of powerful families that ran Wall Street did not micromanage studio production. They simply had no interest in underwriting an experimental, shocking, or even particularly interesting motion picture industry. Since the House of Morgan and the House of Rockefeller held the purse strings of Paramount, Warner Bros., Fox, and Universal, it’s not shocking that House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945) provided light entertainment rather than raising questions about the nature of American society in the tradition of horror in 1920s German expressionism and European avant-garde cinema more generally. But why did Americans want horror to begin with, even in its pallid 1940s form? How could a country so sure of itself have a place for monsters? The growth of an internal security state to police the boundaries benefitted from the movies as anesthetic. Monsters could be Marx’s “opiate of the people” and “the sigh of the oppressed,” for all the imperial state cared. But it could even be more useful. In the decade after the Second World War, plenty of horror films became unofficial propaganda, alien invasion flicks made with government blessing and even cooperation. But the empire did worry about the nightmares Americans might have about this new atomic age. An empire extending military and economic power abroad must quell dissent at home. A wide range of Americans received nasty attention from the national security state after World War II. Strikingly, many of the men who made the monsters became special targets. Horror could and did make Americans forget about the realities of the world, could defend Amity Island. But even in the early days of the Cold War, the chain saw could unleash its dissonant barrage on the false dream of America. Could you censor dark dreams? What about when the monsters wouldn’t behave? Thus begins the long history of what we know today as surveillance culture. 5.Dracula vs. the FBI BELA LUGOSI spoke before a Los Angeles crowd of over two thousand people in August of 1944.11 The Hungarian-American Council for Democracy (HACD) sponsored the mass rally to urge the Roosevelt administration to end immigration restrictions for Hungarian Jews and to pressure the collaborationist Nazi regime that controlled Lugosi’s homeland to protect those that remained. He had no way of knowing the effort did little good. The SS, with the direct aid of Hungarian fascists, had already deported nearly half a million Jews to death camps in Austria and Poland the previous month. Lugosi described the plight of Hungary’s Jews nearly a quarter of a century after he fled his native land to escape the White Terror that ensued after a right-wing government seized Budapest. His previous support for the communist regime of Belá Kun, who had briefly come to power in 1919 only to be quickly toppled after a disastrous war with Romania, placed Lugosi on the kill list of Admiral Miklós Horthy, who, for all intents and purposes, ruled from Budapest as head of a military junta. The elderly warlord still controlled Hungary in 1944, though his regime existed largely at Hitler’s sufferance. Hungarian forces aided the invasion of the Soviet Union, and members of the country’s large, fascist Arrow Cross Party actively participated in the Holocaust throughout eastern Europe. Born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in eastern Hungary, Lugosi became his stage name, an homage to his 1882 birthplace, Lugos (today Lugoj, Romania). He abandoned school at an early age but quickly rose to prominence in Hungary’s National Theatre. Although granted a deferment when the Great War came in 1914, he volunteered to fight for the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1915, he received his first war wound fighting against the forces of the Russian czar in what is now western Ukraine. A few months later, he would receive a second wound. Ironically, this time he had been fighting in the Carpathians, the treacherous, jagged mountain range that in the twentieth century became fully associated with vampire legends and Count Dracula himself. Lugosi left the army in 1916 having suffered a “mental collapse.” The precise cause of the incident remains unclear. We do know that Lugosi, in one of the rare moments he spoke about the Great War, described the experience of being buried alive in a trench beneath a mound of his comrade’s corpses as Russian forces clambered over him. After leaving the army, he returned to the theater and worked to create an actor’s union. Lugosi supported the goals of the communist regime and became especially vocal in his calls for the nationalization of the theater. He was well known enough to Horthy’s regime to flee to Vienna after Kun’s fall. Agents of the new government continued to pursue him. Lugosi worked his way to America in 1920, first aboard a merchant ship bound for New Orleans and then on to Ellis Island. During the Red Scare of the 1920s, with most eastern Europeans suspected of being communist revolutionaries (and Lugosi had, after all, been an actual communist revolutionary), becoming a naturalized citizen proved almost impossible. Lugosi did not become a citizen until 1931, the year that Dracula made him an international star. Lugosi’s involvement in the labor movement did not end after Dracula. He became, along with Boris Karloff, a lifelong supporter of the Screen Actors Guild. Lugosi served for several years on the advisory board. He also attempted to unionize his costars, as did Karloff, who handed out SAG applications in his heavy-browed Frankenstein makeup during the original film. Since Lugosi’s role in heavy makeup as Ygor in 1939’s Son of Frankenstein, he played a significant number of murderers and mad scientists for poverty-row studios, even appearing as the Big Bad in one of the era’s popular, but low-budget, serials, The Phantom Creeps. The effort to stay afloat financially as a freelancer in Hollywood, part of the personal experience that drove his labor activism, increasingly faltered as he sold his Tudor-style home in the Beachwood Canyon district of the Hollywood Hills and found himself appearing in small and silly roles even as tiny studios graffitied their posters with his name. In the serial The Phantom Creeps (1939), Lugosi played a scientist who, in a precursor to the Bond villain archetypes, creates various death rays, murderous gadgets, and a killer robot (the titular creeping phantom) that he hopes to sell to the highest bidder among the international market of warring powers. The serials, which introduced a generation of Saturday matinee-goers to “Commando Cody and the Rocket Men” or heroes they knew previously from radio and comics like “The Shadow” and the “Green Hornet,” can be enjoyed today for their peculiarity and vivid, if simple-minded, melodrama. But, amid playground dialogue and cliffhanger plotting, Lugosi must have suffered as he remembered his days as a rising star in Budapest. In 1942, Lugosi appeared in a propaganda/espionage/horror mash-up rushed into production soon after bombs fell on Pearl Harbor. Black Dragons, originally entitled The Yellow Menace, opened with what appears to be the claws of a dragon reaching across a map of the Pacific to threaten the American mainland. This is a peculiar reading of geography. Japan’s war aims included the seizure of American imperial holdings but not an invasion of the boundaries of the United States. Black Dragons tells a different story, and, given his political leanings, Lugosi likely appreciated the plot. The Black Dragon Society, a secret arm of the Japanese emperor, takes on the identities of major American industrialists with the help of a Nazi plastic surgeon (played by Lugosi). But the Black Dragons even betray their Nazi ally and imprison him since he’s the only one who knows of their sinister conspiracy. A convoluted plot point has Lugosi play both the original Nazi scientist who returns to kill the Black Dragons and a Japanese spy who himself receives plastic surgery so he can return to Germany with the Führer none the wiser. There’s not much of interest in the film aside from its context. Although something of an artifact of the Hollywood left, Black Dragons contains as much race-baiting as warnings about the possibly traitorous intentions of corporate America. Anti-Asian slurs are tossed around thoughtlessly in a film purportedly about dangers to democracy. Lugosi is the only thing worth watching in the film today as he drifts ominously through the scenes, the intensity of his eyes a hypnotic frightmare. After Lugosi’s years of exile on poverty row, many expected that Universal would ask the fading star to reprise his most famous role two years later in House of Dracula (1944). Instead, they picked John Carradine for what turned out to be a minor role for the titular monster. After World War II, Lugosi, like several of Hollywood’s B- and C-list actors, became popular in summertime stage productions. He would appear as Dracula in stage plays that ran in Denver, Colorado, or Reading, Pennsylvania. As Hoover’s investigation sputtered to a halt, the summer of ’48 found Lugosi playing a one-week engagement at the Norwich Theatre and Masonic Temple in New London, Connecticut. The year 1947 became the first since 1931 that Lugosi did not work on a film set. In 1948, Universal proffered him a role in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, though as the title of the film suggests, it’s a rather small one. Lugosi insisted to Hollywood Digest that his role in the film contained “no burlesque” and that “his trademark would be unblemished.” The film did rake it in for Universal at the box office. But not unlike the success of 1931’s Dracula, it did not lead to Lugosi being offered more significant work in the long term. Lugosi’s long struggle with alcohol and drug addiction are well known. He became one of the first American celebrities to speak openly, and very bravely, about this when he sought treatment. By the 1950s, as he worked less and less and in smaller and odder roles, he unfortunately became something of a joke in an industry with a notoriously short memory of its stars. But he never stopped working completely and this tells us something about how the American taste for horror had changed since the days when the “weird mystery” offered pleasure to a relatively small, mostly older, and mostly male group of pulp magazine aficionados. During the Second World War, Lugosi became the president of the Hungarian-American Council for Democracy, an organization largely focused on the ouster of Hungary’s decidedly undemocratic regime. During this same period, he wrote a series of articles for the leftist Hungarian journal Magyar Jövő, or “Hungarian Future,” that evoke the revolutionary ideals of 1919. Lugosi’s leftist activities during the period before the Los Angeles rally included appearing on a Brooklyn radio show called The Voice of Fighting Spain, which had its roots in the anti-fascist struggle in the Spanish Civil War and received its funding from the Communist Party front organization that called itself the Institute for International Democracy. Lugosi’s affiliations would have attracted some attention even in the midst of a war in which the United States counted the Soviet Union as one of its two major, and certainly its most powerful, allies. The Office of Strategic Services, transformed at the beginning of the Cold War into the Central Intelligence Agency, opened a file on Lugosi. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), the congressional power brokers fueling the post–World War II Red Scare and incidents such as the persecution of the Hollywood Ten, appointed a small group of operatives to keep an eye on him. They called themselves the Dracula council. They appear to have lost interest in Lugosi’s leftist sympathies given the much more pressing matter of winning a war against the Axis. In 1947 the combination of the National Security Act and the acceptance of the doctrine of “containment” acted as charters for the launch of America’s Cold War. In that year, a man few Americans wanted to take an interest in them turned a baleful eye on Lugosi. J. Edgar Hoover made his bones in the Bureau of Investigation, the FBI’s forerunner. In 1919, at age twenty-four, he headed the bureau’s General Intelligence Division, christened the Radical Division given Hoover’s interest in ferreting out real and perceived revolutionary parties in the United States. Hoover became convinced that the shadow of Trotsky loomed behind every labor organizer, that every one of the era’s large strikes presaged an American Petrograd. By the 1940s, the FBI essentially functioned as his personal police force and spy network. Agents assembled thick files on major and minor figures in entertainment, politics, and the arts who held the vaguest of liberal sympathies. Hoover’s interest in the former communist from Hungary with the thick Magyar accent seems entirely predictable. Hoover ordered the Los Angeles office to open an investigation into Lugosi, “concerning his activities.” This phrase, in Hoover-speak, meant that agents should pore over every aspect of the public and private life of their subject. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service also looked into the possibility of revoking his citizenship. Other emerging voices in horror and science fiction faced similar investigations for their left-wing views. Peter Lorre proved a special target because of his friendship with Bertolt Brecht, the German communist playwright who strongly supported a failed 1919 revolution in his country. Like Lugosi, Lorre came from Hungary, but before he fled Nazi terror, he starred as one of cinema’s first serial murderers in Fritz Lang’s M. Automatically becoming the heavy in films ranging from pitch-black noir dramas to Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon, he soon became a natural choice for horror films.12 Lorre earned Hoover’s ire after publicly supporting the Hollywood Ten, a group of left-leaning screenwriters singled out by Congress’s HUAC for refusing to cooperate with their investigation. Hoover launched Operation COMPIC (Communist Infiltration—Motion Picture Industry) while segregationist John E. Rankin of Mississippi lead the charge against Hollywood as “the greatest hotbed of subversive activities in the United States.” In response, Lorre joined a radio program effort called Hollywood Fights Back. Despite stars like Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball, and John Huston participating in the effort, smearing someone red had a chilling effect on their career. Vincent Price, whose star began to rise in Hollywood in 1945, had yet to become as deeply identified with horror films as he would after House of Wax (1953). Most did know the young, handsome actor’s left-leaning politics and willingness to talk openly about them. This attracted FBI attention, but the actor had leaned hard right in the thirties, when many Americans went to the opposite end of the political spectrum. Price said he came to his senses in 1938 after watching the gears of Hitler’s death machine begin to grind. Still, Price remained more circumspect than most in supporting liberal and anti-fascist efforts that had little or no ties to American communists. Several figures who continue to shape the American tradition of horror, fantasy, and science fiction received the FBI’s unwonted concern. Ray Bradbury, with his tales of an America perpetually facing a thing at the top of the stairs, had forty pages of material assembled by agents who suspected his then-genial liberalism hid communist sympathies.13 The report included the contention that “he has been described as being critical of the United States government.” In a memo, now available through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the FBI copied their colleagues at the CIA, violating the agencies’ proscription against surveillance and investigation of private American citizens. Large portions of Bradbury’s file are redacted, but what we can read makes clear that the FBI worried that the author planned to travel to Cuba and take part in a writer’s conference “whose [sic] goal of action is to obtain unity in the fight against anti-imperialism.” What interested the FBI in Bradbury to begin with, particularly given that his file admits “there is no evidence” he ever “joined the CP”? For the FBI, the idea that Bradbury suggested in The Martian Chronicles that humans came to the red planet as “despoilers and not developers” sounded a bit too much like a critique of imperial America, both in its frontier past and Cold War present. Much of the case rested on the word of a former communist turned government snitch named Martin K. Berkeley, who claimed that Bradbury supported the Screen Actors Guild because of sympathy for “its more pro-communist elements.” Berkeley insisted he heard Bradbury describe writers who caved to McCarthyism as “cowards” and that Bradbury’s stories “had been definitely slanted against the United States and its capitalistic system.” Indeed, the informant warned that science fiction itself “may be a lucrative field for the transmission of Communist ideologies.” Too many science fiction writers, he warned Bradbury’s investigators, shared pro-communist views with “a small number of scientists” who believed a war with the Soviet Union would be “threatening to the isolation (existence?) of the universe.”14 What other information did the FBI have on the prominent writer, the poet of dark carnivals? After a ten-year investigation of Bradbury, it seemed investigators uncovered one clear communist connection when an unnamed informant (likely Berkeley, again) claimed Bradbury planned to attend an “anti-imperialist” writers congress being held in Havana, Cuba. In fact, a Roy Bradbury, possibly the source of a misprint of Ray Bradbury’s name in his FBI file, had been invited to the gathering. After keeping tabs on Bradbury almost since the end of World War II, the FBI quietly dropped the case. Isaac Asimov also received Hoover’s attention. As Olive Beck has described in unpublished research on the topic, Asimov, who joined Robert A. Heinlein and Bradbury as leading writers of science fiction after World War II, faced a rather more sinister set of charges. A practicing scientist in the biochemistry department at Boston University, he came under scrutiny for possibly aiding the Soviet espionage networks that had ferreted out secrets of the A-bomb. The FBI long believed that an academic leaked scientific secrets to the Soviets, a figure they referred to as ROBPROF. The basis for the code name seems to have been Asimov’s own work as the author of I, Robot.15 The only information the FBI found that pointed to Asimov concerned a list compiled by the Communist Party USA (“The CPUSA underground,” a bureau memo ominously called the tiny organization) of Boston-area figures who might be “possibly amenable” to membership. Asimov remained under investigation for two years, even with no other evidence surfacing. While not as long under surveillance as other figures in the world of fantasy and horror, it’s notable that the FBI shadowed Asimov for espionage and high treason, a capital crime.16 But few in the world of horror and science fiction carried as strong a resume on the left as Lugosi. It did not help that the Hungarian Communist Party made significant gains in summer parliamentary elections, the major step in the country falling into Stalin’s grip and becoming part of the Warsaw Pact. Lugosi’s case had been dropped by the time of his death, and in fact, Hoover and the immigration authorities dropped the matter much more quickly than Bradbury’s, perhaps because of the latter’s growing fame and influence. Moreover, the investigation of Lugosi revealed nothing that did not already exist in the public record. No evidence emerged that Lugosi ever joined the CPUSA. His file would include his Magyar Jövő articles and the fact that he subscribed to a fund supporting labor leader Harry Bridges in a legal struggle to prevent the federal government from stripping him of his citizenship and deporting him. In line with the FBI’s desire to collect personal dirt on its subjects in case it needed to besmirch their reputation later, one of his agents included in his report that Lugosi appeared “intoxicated most of the time.”17 Dirty tricks are the companion of dirty wars. The need to keep track of Lugosi’s drinking habits along with his politics became a standard part of the bureau’s internal security apparatus. Former director James Comey has described, for example, “the darkest chapter” in the bureau’s history as the sending of a package to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964 that contained a set of recordings of his extramarital transgressions and a typed note urging him to kill himself within the month. Clearly, horror would have a role in an emerging national security state such as this one. But would it distract a populace restive under the reigns of the growing hegemony of the Pentagon, Hollywood, and industry? Or would it become a spectral light revealing that mad scientists had taken charge of the American experience? Horror was about to meet the bomb. 6.Terror Bombing ROBERT A. Lewis, copilot of the U.S. B-29 bomber the Enola Gay, kept a folder with him in the summer of 1945 labeled “letter to mom and dad.” In fact, it would become the logbook for a top-secret mission that the crew readied for on Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas held by the Japanese early in World War II. American forces seized it a few months before the Battle of Leyte Gulf, precisely because it offered an excellent launching site for the increasingly destructive American air raids. Lewis grew up in New Jersey and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A facility with electronics, and a preternaturally calm demeanor, led to his selection as part of a small group who tested the new B-29 Superfortress. In 1945, General Curtis LeMay chose Colonel Paul Tibbets to command the Enola Gay. Tibbets immediately chose Lewis as his copilot. They would drop the first atomic weapon in history on the city of Hiroshima. The USAF chose the city since it was spared conventional bombing runs for most of the war. This allowed America to demonstrate the full power of these weapons. Apologists for the bomb later called Hiroshima the site of a major military base. There was a base near the city. But the blast killed over one hundred thousand civilians, along with a contingent of Korean prisoners forced into slave labor after the Japanese conquest of their country and some American POWs. Lewis wrote an unofficial account of what happened in August of ’45 on the back of army department action report forms. He stenciled a sketch of the mushroom cloud and compared the dropping of the superweapon to a Buck Rogers adventure. “We had expected something fierce,” he admitted, but also wrote, “My God what have we done?” He ruminated over how many Japanese the new superweapon killed.18 We don’t know whether Lewis felt guilt over his bit part in the inauguration of the atomic age. In some ways, his comments reflected all the confusion, anxiety, and excitement Americans experienced in 1945. They were like Buck Rogers, the popular movie serial hero who used high-tech weapons to fight malevolent enemies. But should they be? What had they done? How many did we kill? Do we want to know? Most Americans didn’t know the answers to these questions, and it likely wouldn’t have mattered much if they tried to find out. The U.S. government used its power to ensure that the public would not care how many we killed. Many of the war films made while combat continued assured audiences that the Japanese people suffered little, if at all, from the air campaigns conducted since 1942 against the Japanese home islands that LeMay proudly described as “terror bombing.” In the film Bombardier (1943), a young pilot briefly has a crisis of conscience over the death of civilians but is assured by his commander, and in a letter from his mom, that a new target site would make “munitions” the only victim of the bombing campaign. The ownership of major studios by corporate moguls, many of whom had diverse streams of revenue generated by the war, ensured more than the transformation of horror films into escapist fantasies. The tendency for financial and political elites to ally assured a cozy relationship between the studios and the American government. In the summer of 1942, the Office of War Information created a special branch to ensure that films would “enhance understanding of the war at home and abroad” and act as “liaison with the press, radio, and the motion pictures.” This language makes what came to be known as the Bureau of Motion Pictures sound like a benign public relations agency. In theory, this did not give the War Department authority to censor films. In reality, military censors insisted on seeing and editing any scripts that might portray, for example, a human side to Japanese soldiers or civilians. In film after film, Japanese pilots are shown bombing and strafing civilians, an inhuman tactic they did, in fact, employ. However, in these same films American pilots are always hitting “military targets” with utter precision. There’s certainly not a word said about “terror bombing.”19 In an animated feature you aren’t likely to see appear on the Disney+ channel any time soon, the House of Mouse released Victory Through Air Power (1943). Viewers are treated to exploding military compounds and munitions without the slightest suggestion that human beings are killed in these raids. Frank Capra’s Know Your Enemy: Japan seems out of step with much of his Why We Fight series, which attempted to blend a set of universal values with American patriotism. The war ended before the film gained wide distribution among the troops. But its content gives us a fair representation of American propaganda efforts. The film insisted that Japanese soldiers had been mentally shaped by the Bushido code to believe that “treachery, brutality, rape and torture” are justified. Meanwhile, the film celebrated the killing of twenty thousand Japanese at Iwo Jima and described the horrific battle of Okinawa as a triumphant moment when American forces “trapped and destroyed 100,000.” At a time when hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians died in LeMay’s “terror” campaign, the film insisted that “the nasty gangsters” in the “factories and war plants” were the only victims of the constant air raids.20 These propaganda efforts had real-world effects not only for Japanese civilians but also for Americans of Japanese descent. A little over two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR issued Executive Order 9066, which allowed the U.S. military wide latitude to exclude anyone deemed a security risk from “military areas.” Although the order did not specifically mention Japanese Americans or insist on the building of detention camps, it came with a wink and a nod, and the commanders across the country understood its meaning. The entire state of California became a “military area,” and Japanese Americans were not allowed in the state unless detained in an internment camp. The U.S. government imprisoned 127,000 men, women, and children of Japanese descent during World War II. Newspaper editorials, including one in the Los Angeles Times, justified their imprisonment by describing the war in the Pacific as “a war with their race.” California Congressional Representative Leland Ford pulled no punches in insisting that all Japanese should be placed in “concentration camps,” a phrase in common use for the internment camps, even though much current discussion, journalism, and even historical writing uses the term relocation camps.21 The degree of racial hatred most white Americans felt toward the Japanese makes it hard to discern whether few if any felt any qualms about the genocidal air campaign waged on the Pacific rival’s homeland. The war on the ground seemed a struggle to match, and sometimes overmatch, the Japanese atrocities against soldiers and civilians. Acclaimed author Paul Fussell, a combat veteran of World War II, admits that American servicemen enjoyed using Japanese prisoners for target practice and “felt intense satisfaction when watching them twist and writhe when set on fire by the napalm of the flame thrower.” In a grotesquerie that would surface in the American horror tradition in the 1960s, soldiers and marines made trophies of Japanese skulls. This may appear to the reader as a bizarre rumor or, at the very least, uncommon. In fact, the May 22, 1944, issue of Life magazine contains a picture of twenty-year-old Natalie Nickerson writing a thank-you note to her boyfriend for the skull he mailed her, a macabre gift the photograph shows her gazing at lovingly.22 Terror bomber Curtis LeMay took command of the Pacific air campaign in February of 1945 and rejected even the concept of precision bombing. The tough-talking LeMay, later the model for General Jack D. Ripper in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, believed the use of a relatively new incendiary weapon called napalm—but evocatively referred to by the air crews on Tinian as hell-jelly—would reduce Japan’s wooden cities and the people who lived in them to ash. He was right. Two Harvard chemistry professors, Louis Fieser and E. B. Hershberg, developed what would become the basic formula on Valentine’s Day, 1942. They chose the Fourth of July to test the new weapon on a Harvard University football field, hoping sedate Cambridge would assume the work of rowdy undergraduates when the explosive charges ignited. What they created was much worse than an incendiary bomb. The new weapon ignited into a viscous jelly that burned more slowly than gasoline—whether it adhered to a structure or human flesh. In March of 1945, LeMay unleashed 325 bombers armed with napalm on Tokyo, burning much of the city and killing 89,000 people, the overwhelming majority women, the elderly, children, and babies. The center of the blasts extruded such incredible temperatures that the city’s canals boiled. The work of the air corps, designated XXI Bomber Command, had only begun. Using up to 600 aircraft in raid after raid, almost all Japan’s major cities burned in the months to come. The death toll reached 260,000 and, with the island on fire, 13 million became homeless. An uncountable number suffered lifelong pain from disfiguring burns.23 Taken together, LeMay’s “terror bombings” created a larger mound of corpses than the two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But, after the immediate elation over the war’s end, the bomb became a shadow cast across everything Americans believed about themselves. Nancy Arnot Harjan, one of Studs Terkel’s interviewees for his oral history project The Good War, experienced World War II as a teenager who believed above all that “the country was innocent,” that the GIs liberating Paris “were all knights in shining armor, saving humanity.”24 But painful questions began to surface. Harjan remembered about “a week or two” of elation stalked by disturbing questions. Her thoughts may not have been representative of the official culture of victory. But it shows Americans could express doubts about their government’s use of such a weapon, perhaps pondering and refining their misgivings for decades, and speak of them thoughtfully when a well-known writer like Terkel asked about how it felt to be American in the summer of ’45: This wonderful new bomb had ended it all . . . Seventy thousand or a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand civilians? It came as a shock after seeing so many war movies with the Japanese portrayed as militaristic brutes. To see women, children, and old innocent civilians brutally burned . . . What was it all about? In truth, most Americans expressed unease about the use of the bomb, wondering at least to themselves, “What was it all about?” They also quickly accepted it as part of a Faustian bargain that ensured both the political dominance of the United States and the peculiar kind of pleasure in life a cross section of Americans had come to enjoy during the war. One member of the U.S. Merchant Marine, Frank Keegan, only remembered relief upon hearing news of Truman’s decision, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan’s surrender. Keegan said to himself, “Nice goin’, Harry. You did it to ’em, kid. That’s how guiltless I was.” He could recall later, matter-of-factly if not entirely pleased with his attitude, “He saved our lives, he terminated the goddamn thing.”25 In his own reflections about the decision to use the bomb, Fussell reminded us that frontline troops in modern wars live with a primal certainty of either death or catastrophic wounds. The news of the end of war, whatever form the denouement takes, comes to them with a wave of feeling that can’t be described as relief or celebration. They essentially feel that a death sentence has been lifted, that someone in authority made a call in the final seconds and granted them a pardon.26 But other Americans experienced war’s end with a triumphalism of a type that had been building since the news from various fronts had become increasingly positive. One of Terkel’s interviewees remembered that while the “the rest of the world came out bruised and scarred” by the global conflagration, many Americans who had not been in a branch of the service, or had not lost family members, discovered “new gratifications they’d never known in their lives. Mass travel, mass vacations, everything else came out of it.” This may have been true of many of those in uniform as well. Unlike the armies of the rest of the globe, a majority of enlistees in the armed forces served behind the lines and a majority of those never left the States.27 Many Americans entered 1945 convinced their country had swept the world of its shadows. Roosevelt and then Truman sought to win the war both “thoroughly” and “fast,” while doing so “at the lowest possible cost” to Americans. That’s certainly an admirable goal, arguably a moral imperative. And yet, a massive loss of life among enemies and allies revealed the secret of the administration’s nightmare math. While tens of millions died on home fronts across the globe, saving gasoline and growing Victory gardens counted as “sacrifice” for Americans. Even Joseph Stalin, better known for his brutality than perspicacity, could blandly note that compared to his country of burning rubble and twenty-one million corpses, “things are not that bad in the United States.”28 Things weren’t so bad. And yet, historian Tom Engelhardt has referred to the postwar era as the time of “the Great Fear” during which “backyard barbeques” took place in “an anxiety-ridden garrison state” where abundance competed with horror. What could Americans have been afraid of? As the world’s only atomic power, the United States could have withdrawn back into its continental borders. It could have concentrated on being a constitutional republic that used its vast resources to build an equitable society that benefitted its citizens from cradle to grave. Indeed, in the first years after World War II, Harry Truman faced a populace eager to demobilize. They did not want to build a military machine, having seen what government intervention in the economy could do if it set itself to projects responsive to the needs of the people. Roosevelt’s promised freedoms for which we fought seemed within reach . . . freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and even freedom from fear. But the thermal flash of the atom bomb left these promises in ruin. A professional class of militarists became intertwined with a war economy that kept the country on a war footing and in fact increased military expenditures. By 1950, the United States footed the majority of the French bill for maintaining their control of East Asia. Horror films now seemed less about fear and more about the yuks, a way to take the edge off, especially with Abbott and Costello meeting up with the monsters of contemporary America’s youth for gags. Older horror seemed a little too subversive, at times with a sexual subtext that challenged the cult of breadwinner, wife, and children that would emerge in the American middle class after 1945. Slapstick could not properly channel America’s Cold War uncertainties. Amity Island had become a truly global power, with plenty of anxiety building under the era’s gleaming sunshine. Someone who’d seen the face of American power abroad would rev the chain saw long before Tobe Hooper told his tale of a Texas massacre. 7.Void, Despair, Torment ROD SERLING joined hundreds of thousands of American veterans returning from Europe and the Pacific to find a much different country from the one that greeted their fathers and grandfathers in 1919. White veterans received the full benefit of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, better known as the G.I. Bill, which provided money for a college education and help with securing a thirty-year mortgage on a home they could, at least theoretically, claim as their own. The possibility of buying a home with such a generous loan period was first made available to many Americans with the Fair Housing Act of the New Deal era. Low-interest loans also allowed the purchases of businesses and farms. But Serling could not settle into this shockingly comfortable niche in American society. He worried that his generation might sell their own freedoms for middle-class prosperity, or simply become lost in the narcissism that the expanding American economy encouraged. Discharged in 1946, he certainly benefitted from the best of these changes. The G.I. Bill allowed him to join hundreds of thousands of other young white men in attending college, once the privilege of the upper middle class or the tiny numbers able to gain scholarships. He enrolled immediately at Antioch College in Ohio, studied literature and creative writing, and managed to sell his first teleplay to NBC while matriculating. He graduated in 1950, married his college sweetheart, Carolyn Kramer, and walked into the bright future offered to privileged citizens of a superpower. Black veterans faced a different reality. Lynching remained a feature of American life, publicly celebrated by the mobs themselves if rarely discussed in the broader culture. Isaac Woodard, on his return from service where he had been decorated for bravery under fire in New Guinea, met just such a fate on February 12, 1946. Riding a Greyhound home to see his family, a white bus driver stopped in Batesburg, South Carolina, to complain to authorities that Woodard had asked for a bathroom stop. A group of police beat Woodard severely and the local sheriff gouged out Woodward’s eyes with a nightstick. Federal attention led to the sherriff’s trial but also a quick acquittal by an all-white jury. While the situation was particularly egregious in the American South, every American region had laws, de facto and de jure, that prevented Black men and women from reaping the G.I. Bill’s benefits. These veterans could, in theory, receive money for college, but most colleges in the United States remained whites only. Under the law, Black veterans could lay claim to home and business loans, but banks could and did refuse them without fear of legal repercussions. So-called covenant neighborhoods collaborated with real estate firms and local politicians to ensure no Black families moved into the new suburbs. Whites who wanted to live in segregated neighborhoods had the support of the Federal Housing Administration. The U.S. government, in a practice known as redlining, made fluid funds available to contractors who agreed to build suburbs that excluded African Americans.29 World War II looked in some ways like the beginning of a new phase in the freedom struggle for African Americans. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled against state practices that suppressed, or simply denied, Black women and men the right to vote. Veterans of World War II like Medgar Evers brought home from the war a determination to make America live up to its claims of being a bastion of democracy and freedom. During the war itself, A. Philip Randolph, an African American socialist and labor union leader, held a huge rally in Madison Square Garden to protest the treatment of Black soldiers. He would later be the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. But, when World War II ended, it would be another twenty years before the 1965 Voting Rights Act laid the groundwork for African American political autonomy. It’s also true that, outside of a general sense that something happened with segregation during the civil rights movements, even most college-educated whites have a limited grasp of the role of thousands of organizers whose experience had been shaped by World War II and their mistreatment by an American army allegedly fighting fascism. We know about Medgar Evers because he was murdered in his own driveway. James Baldwin thought that World War II meant something very different to African Americans than to whites. “A certain hope died,” he wrote, both because of the treatment even Black veterans received and how little the world changed for all Black people in 1945. In fact, the twin shadows of the Holocaust and Hiroshima seemed a deadly warning to Baldwin, a reminder of what white people would do while claiming to be both Christian and civilized. Baldwin wrote in the evocatively titled The Fire Next Time that “the threat of universal extinction” had entered the world. Wasn’t the bomb part of the logic of white supremacy, an iron logic of nihilism that had created “this void, this despair, this torment” felt all over the world from “the streets of Stockholm” to the “sidewalks of Harlem”? Terror at what the world had become haunted millions of Americans. The prosperity and eerie optimism of postwar America reached only a large minority of its white citizens. The long period of economic growth, more than a quarter of a century after 1945, came in fits and starts for many families. The larger paychecks many workers began to see did not keep pace with prices. Companies like General Motors and U.S. Steel made tens of millions in profits while refusing Truman’s admonitions to ward off strikes with tiny wage increases. Meanwhile, a Republican-controlled Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which struck an enormous blow to labor unions, one from which they arguably never recovered. Among other restrictive provisions, the act outlawed unions among supervisors and foremen, effectively severing a large part of the new white-collar workforce from membership in, and sympathy with, organized labor. The emerging Cold War with the Soviet Union ensured that American foreign policy poisoned discussions about worker’s rights. Republican leaders in Congress insisted on widespread communist infiltration in organized labor and used anti-communist rhetoric to frighten suburban voters who unreasonably connected rising prices and wage slumps with strikes rather than with the powerful corporations that kept wages low and prices high. The attitude of the United States toward its recent enemies, and its recent friends, seems shocking, but it followed the economic logic of imperial power. It’s difficult, nearly impossible, to imagine a continuing partnership between the United States and the Soviet Union, despite the warmth of the relationship through the thirties and the alliance of the war years. Truman and Stalin didn’t share much in terms of either politics or background. But both did hold a morally blinkered view of the postwar world. 8.Cold Warriors . . . in Space!! MOST AMERICANS, now and at the time, do not grasp how the Soviet Union interpreted the United States’ embrace of Germany after 1945. The Truman administration’s quick willingness to welcome Germany back into the family of nations, at least American-controlled West Germany, which had received a free market makeover, seemed an astonishing move. Over the next several decades, West Germany became a deadly forward base from which to project nuclear missiles. Medium-range missiles aimed directly at the Soviet heartland remained frightening portents into the 1980s, as much to the western Europeans being “protected” by them as to the Russians. Anti-communism perhaps made this decision at least as rational, or rather no more irrational, than Stalin’s insistence that the Warsaw Pact nations provide the Soviet Union with “buffer states.” But Operation Paperclip, though little known at the time, proved one of the more shocking decisions by the emerging American national security state. This initiative brought over 1,600 Nazi scientists to the United States, cleared them of all war crimes, and set them to work developing the basis for delivery systems of nuclear weapons. This ethically purblind decision transformed the global balance of power. It’s difficult to imagine that the United States would have charged so far ahead of the Soviet Union in the arms race without the help of Wernher von Braun, a fact admitted by a number of NASA scientists from that era. Von Braun had joined the Nazi Party when Hitler came to power, and he rose through the ranks of the SS to become a major. In his early thirties he’d been given the title of professor, a particular honorific in German, by Hitler himself. During the war, he led the V-2 rocket building program, which employed slave labor from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Victims who survived the camp have testified that von Braun selected workers personally. He even handpicked prisoners for torture, seemingly for no purpose other than sadistic pleasure. At the end of the war, von Braun claimed he wanted to surrender to the Americans rather than the Soviets. The Americans would make the best captors, he asserted, because “they believed in the Bible.”30 By 1948, the CIA went even further in enlisting former Nazis, including members of the Waffen-SS who had played a central role in the Holocaust and related war crimes. A few such figures provided alleged intelligence about Soviet activities in eastern Europe that facilitated the move toward the Cold War. A retired CIA agent later admitted that this provided the American security establishment with the “Russian boogeyman junk” that Truman’s national security state loved rather than a meaningful picture of geopolitics.31 The American public might have been even more shocked to learn that the CIA worked closely with Nazi collaborators in the Soviet Union itself after 1946. Not only had many of these groups aided in the German invasion of the Soviet Union but they also had, by the agency’s own admission, “been linked to Nazi atrocities on the eastern front.” The mass murder of Poles, Jews, Red Army POWs, and communists represented this “link.” In the fall of 1949, the CIA parachuted guerilla squads of war criminals back into Ukraine in what became known as Operation Nightingale. Although Russian special forces quickly annihilated these cells, the reader should imagine the American reaction to Soviet-sponsored guerrillas dropped into, say, Nebraska to take lives, destroy critical infrastructure, and generally wreak havoc.32 Perhaps Americans would not have been appalled by their government. Mainstream white America became convinced that their pastel middle-class dreams could turn Marxist red, so much so that even the worst crimes of the Nazis faded for a time out of American memory. The famous, mostly infamous, General George S. Patton, whose failures and inconsistent performance as a military thinker have been overshadowed by legend and the 1970 film, provides an interesting case study in American attitudes. After touring the Ohrdruf death camp with Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, Patton wrote that the victims appeared to him to be “a subhuman species without any of the cultural or social refinements of the time.” Patton had no sympathy for the dead, using his celebrity to insist the United States immediately rearm the Nazis and launch a preemptive offensive against the Soviet Union.33 Historians spill gallons of ink over the origins of the Cold War. There’s no single answer to why the United States and the Soviet Union, former allies against the Axis, turned on one another so quickly. Numerous commentators have suggested that both great powers needed the Cold War. Stalin and his successors, with an occasional notable exception, could set aside hopes for a worldwide revolution and settle into what Noam Chomsky described as the dominance of “a military-bureaucratic elite” over Soviet foreign affairs. For the United States, the Bolshevik threat gave legitimacy to the new, expansionist American foreign policy and a highly militarized economy. However one feels about the nuances of the debate, it’s impossible to chalk it up to Soviet aggression. Communist revolutionaries around the globe—from Vietnam to Ghana and Greece—found the Soviets decidedly drowsy on the matter of proletarian revolution. While convinced of Moscow’s influence everywhere, Americans lived in ignorance of the steps their government took to ratchet up tensions between the two powers. No one wanted to think much about foreign policy after V-J Day, and when told a new enemy had appeared, only a small number questioned the state’s assurances that “the American way of life” faced an implacable foe or had any idea of a longer history that helped explain Soviet suspicion. The relationship soured in 1917. The United States invaded Russia at the end of the First World War, largely in support of the British effort to prevent Lenin’s communist revolution from succeeding. A thaw in relations came in the 1930s and many Americans admired the undeniable economic miracle taking place in the Soviet Union as socialism sent Russia’s essentially medieval economy barreling into the twentieth century.34 A darker picture emerged for those who paid the closest attention. Increasingly, even American leftists grew nervous about the emergence of Stalin as he consolidated the Soviet Union into a dictatorship, repressed dissent at home, made small and devious land grabs in the Baltics, and, ironically, gave up on precisely what the Anglo-American right so deeply feared: the spread of an international worker’s revolution around the globe. Instead, Stalin insisted on a theory he called “socialism in one country,” an idea that confronted Marxist dissidents, or anyone who actually read Marx, with a bizarre formulation. Stalin gave half-hearted support to the fight against fascism in Spain and no attention at all to the emerging communist revolution in China. Meanwhile, he murdered his fellow communists in enormous numbers and even sent his dreaded secret police, the NKVD, to assassinate left-wing dissidents from Stalinism around the globe. The United States entered a cold war with Stalin’s Russia, despite having little to fear from the wounded giant. Uninterested in spreading Lenin’s revolution and leading a country decimated by a world war that killed nearly twenty-seven million Soviet soldiers and civilians, Stalin spent the remaining years of his life (d. 1953) watching American westerns, eating enormous meals with his flunkies, and ensuring he remained in power. The Soviet Union did have cause to worry about America’s space program. By the late forties, von Braun worked on rocketry for the U.S. military and converted to evangelical Christianity. Transferred to NASA on its founding in 1958, he played an integral role in the development of the launch vehicle for the Apollo program. His ambition grew, seeing rocketry as a path to the exploration of Mars. By 1960, von Braun received enough adulation for his work in the United States and Britain that a biopic appeared entitled I Aim at the Stars. Comedian Mort Sahl suggested that But Sometimes I Hit London would make a fine subtitle. In fact, von Braun dreamed not only of Mars but also of an orbital space platform that could rain down destruction on the Soviets from the skies.35 The reality was that the United States, a superpower with global reach, defined the Soviet Union, a regional power with limited ambitions, as a mortal enemy. Americans became fearful, uncertain, and anxious in an age of increasing abundance, indeed in a society that had the largest and most prosperous middle class in the history of the world. It also became a society wracked by anxiety, over the bomb, over change, over fear of the Soviets, even over the idea that they belonged to a generation that seemed so stable and secure in relation to that of their parents. Wouldn’t it all be taken away? 9.Noon on Doomsday MILLIONS OF men and women who had seen the worst of World War II were not ready for the American empire’s slugfest with another enemy. Rod Serling, for example, brooded over what he’d seen in the Pacific at a time when discussion of postwar trauma, both physical and mental, had no place in American society. Discussion of the wounded, including the psychologically wounded, veteran remained verboten in American culture after the first months of peace. Indeed, popular magazines such as Ladies’ Home Journal and Life ran articles directed at soldiers’ wives, suggesting that their homebound husbands likely needed “a few weeks” (!) to adjust to the civilian experience.36 One of Serling’s first successes in television revealed his growing social conscience. His 1956 script Patterns became a huge hit for NBC’s Kraft Television Theatre. A boardroom drama that placed big business maleficence and cultural conformity in its crosshairs, Serling’s film tapped into a widespread American fear of corporate life revealed in the success of novels like The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and Revolutionary Road. Patterns aired twice due to its popularity and a film would be produced from it. Serling seemingly had found a way to write about the dangers of fascism in his own country without being called a communist. Indeed, he could do it and be highly successful all at once. Or so he thought. Serling, like many whites, found himself shocked out of his complacency toward the treatment of Black Americans by the vicious murder of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till. In August of 1955, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam beat, mutilated, and shot Till, dumping his body in the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. They believed the young child had “whistled” at Carolyn Bryant, Bryant’s wife. Less than a month after Till’s murder, an all-white jury found the accused not guilty. Carolyn Bryant claimed Till not only whistled at her but grabbed her around the waist. Decades later, Bryant admitted she’d lied about the entire story. Black death has meant very little to a country steeped in white supremacy.37 Till’s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, sent the young boy to live with his grandparents in the Mississippi Delta because she believed it safer than her southside Chicago neighborhood. After his death, she insisted on an open casket funeral, revealing the torture inflicted on his body. Major magazines and newspapers carried the story, and while many treated it as a singular incident, at least some used it to tell the wider history of ongoing violence against African Americans. Moved to anger by the racist violence, Serling attempted to reimagine the tale in a teleplay he called Noon on Doomsday, alternatively titled A Town Has Turned to Dust. However, fear of offending the American public caused corporate sponsors to demand radical changes to the script, a somewhat odd decision since they allowed Patterns to mock the very corporate environment they now sought to protect. White supremacy, and any challenges to it, clearly remained the hill the country’s ruling class would die on. The changes to Noon on Doomsday made it unrecognizable as a comment on the Till lynching. CBS insisted that the murdered character have a Mexican background rather than being African American. Also, and at the network’s insistence, hints of advances toward a white woman as the cause of the killing were dropped. To completely erase any political commentary, studio executives moved the setting out of Mississippi and the contemporary period and into a generic “Old West” setting. Disgusted, Serling watched as a network beholden to advertisers reduced his clarion call for racial justice to little more than a police procedural with an excruciatingly vague message about tolerance. Serling never forgot his anger over what he considered one of his more important works. In what was supposed to be a promotional interview for a new anthology series helmed by Serling, network executives gritted their teeth as he barked at Mike Wallace that it was “criminal” that television execs simply refused to allow writers to explore “social evils.” His new show, he wrote in TV Guide, “probes into the dimension of imagination but with a concern for taste and for an adult audience too long assumed to have IQs in negative figures.” 10.What the Martian Said THE PILOT for The Twilight Zone aired on October 2, 1959. Serling wrote more than ninety scripts for a series that ran 156 episodes. It became the first show on television to imagine fascism coming to America, to challenge the red baiting woven into the culture after World War II, to question how the Japanese were stereotyped after Pearl Harbor, and indeed the first to show the mushroom cloud and wonder about the morality of atomic weapons. But, as Serling once noted, you can get away with anything “if a Martian says it,” or even if you throw a flying saucer or two into the story. Serling used alien invasions and nightmare scenarios to ask hard questions of an America used to horror from the stars shaping how they understood the terror of the real world. An expert on the science fiction and the politics of postwar America, Steffen Hantke, described “the amalgamation of science fiction with the horror film” in these years. This new way of thinking about monsters would attempt a marriage, doomed to divorce, between the fifties’ fascination with the American empire creating “the World of Tomorrow” and the dystopian realities the tomorrow being built for Americans promised.38 The beginnings of this great divorce, and the creation of what James Cameron has called “the interzone” that links horror and science fiction, appears in the bizarre celebrations of predatory American conceptions of space spearheaded by none other than Walt Disney and former SS officer Wernher von Braun. Their collaboration, made even eerier by Disney’s flirtation with the German American Bund (the American fascist movement) in the 1930s, intertwined with the growing fascination with manifest destiny in space in America’s emerging right wing. Disneyland opened in the summer of 1955 and visitors could ease into the diverse hypersensory worlds of Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorowland by entering through Main Street, U.S.A., the world of the American small town. Tomorrowland’s vision of space conquered and sanitized already played out for viewers of Disneyland, a TV anthology series that mixed animation with iconic, and revised, stories of American history. Disney brought in von Braun to showcase the future. Two episodes, “Man in Space” and “Man and the Moon,” feature the former SS officer explaining in his thick East Prussian accent that America would go beyond the moon and someday reach Mars itself. The man who could get a call through to Hitler any hour of the day found in the United States his instrument for his quest to “aim at the stars.” The Stars and Stripes would fly over Tomorrowland, literally and metaphorically. Hungarian-born director George Pal attempted something similar with his flop Conquest of Space (1955). Drawing in part on von Braun’s vision of the American future, specifically his 1952 book, The Mars Project, the film fell flat for most audiences. Pal had been associated with two classics, When Worlds Collide (1951) and an American reimagination of The War of the Worlds (1953). Both offered viewers differing visions of conquest and space, though in each of these classics old-fashioned military power and triage eugenics are the ultimate savior. Conquest of Space, despite a title that seemed to promise lasers massacring whatever indigenous extraterrestrials America might meet out in the black, caused viewers to leave the theater disappointed. Although now and again scientifically accurate, audiences seemed to feel that Pal had produced a western with no native peoples to kill. Aim at the stars, sure. But sometimes can’t we hit Moscow? 11.Shelter from the Midnight Sun ROD SERLING’S daughter Anne remembers her father as kind, funny, given to pranks, and doing his best to ensure that she did not have a “Hollywood dad.” She also recalls that he woke up screaming and when, terrified, she asked what was wrong, he simply said, “I dreamed Japanese soldiers were trying to kill me,” and gently told her to go back to bed. World War II and its legacy appeared again and again in The Twilight Zone, often very directly. The treatment of Japanese Americans and the lingering scars of war have seldom been more thoughtfully explored than in his scripts for season one’s “The Purple Testament” and season three’s “A Quality of Mercy.” Both draw heavily on Serling’s efforts to make peace with his combat experience. Both stories are set in the Philippines during the closing days of the war. “The Purple Testament” creates a supernatural aura for the trauma of battle itself in the story of a lieutenant who can see which of his men will die in combat by looking into their faces. “A Quality of Mercy” enters completely unexplored territory, featuring a gung ho lieutenant, eager to kill the enemy since he arrived in the Pacific just as the conflict was winding down. Taking over a war-weary platoon, he wants to launch a frontal attack on a cave filled with a small number of wounded Japanese soldiers, a pointless sally mounted over the protests of his sergeant. But before the deadly assault can commence, the bloodthirsty young officer finds himself mysteriously transformed into a member of the Japanese Imperial Army about to slaughter American soldiers in the same situation. He awakens from his tour of duty in the twilight zone to hear his sergeant tell him “a big bomb” has been dropped in Hiroshima and HQ has ordered that the platoon hold its position. Serling told his most poignant, and most controversial, tale of war in what became the final season of The Twilight Zone. In “The Encounter,” Fenton, an angry, severely traumatized, and alcoholic veteran of the Pacific, meets a Japanese American seeking work. Fenton offers to give him a job helping clean out his attic, an accidental ramshackle museum of mementos and souvenirs of the Pacific war including a samurai sword taken from the dead hands of an enemy that reads, “The Sword Will Avenge Me.” George Takei, soon famous as Star Trek’s Mr. Sulu, starred as one of the two protagonists, Arthur Takamori, who endures Fenton’s racist comments as the old souvenirs of war that clutter the attic begin to sizzle with a dire supernatural energy. The episode isn’t one of the classics of the series and some of the plot twists undercut the political comment. Still, it explored the idea of a World War II veteran suffering from guilt and trauma, a notion that has found little purchase in pop culture portrayals of that not-so-good war even today. Adding power to the story, Takei himself had been imprisoned in detention camps in California and Arkansas as a child under Roosevelt’s Order 9066. Perhaps Serling’s engagement with the bomb made for some of his most important efforts to use horror as social criticism. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki inaugurated an explosive and ominous end to several decades of unending warfare that grew out of the First World War. Historians today, looking at the period of 1914 to 1945, urge us to see it as a “thirty years’ war” to better understand the spasm of violence that eviscerated the world. But did the twin mushroom clouds really end the vile era? Staring back from our current vantage point, we see a century of wreckage and ruin. Unending war with a cease-fire proclaimed now and again until the bloodletting resumed. We continue to live in the nuclear age, though it seldom appears on our current list of concerns. But immediately after 1945, the fascination with the bomb bled into all aspects of American culture, frequently as a source of profound anxiety. This included the obsessive fascination that accompanies the object of our fears. Serling worried Americans about the moral meaning of the bomb through a medium that had long assured them it represented American omnipotence. Television, struggling to decide what it would become in the postwar era, attempted to satiate the strange need to see death incarnate. Two Los Angeles stations attempted to film a nuclear test 250 miles away in early 1951. Viewers simply saw, in an image that seems positively Lynchian, “the flash of eerie white light.” In 1952, televisions across the nation pulsed weirdly with a flash that sank into “a dark penumbra” enveloping a tiny tenebrous light. Viewers complained about the quality of the image of holocaust, few ever learning that the chiaroscuro image had ruffled across their tiny screens because even at the distance from which the cameras filmed, the heat from the blast melted their lenses.39 Serling grasped the dangers of such weapons and not only in the obvious sense of their threat to human life on earth. He wondered whether a democracy could withstand the pressures of becoming an unstoppable military juggernaut. Could American democracy survive the American empire? Serling’s interest in racial justice already made him aware of the limits of American democracy. Would even basic community break down in an age of apocalyptic weapons needed to defend the porous borders of a global empire? Over the years, in fits and starts, he bleakly decided the answer was yes, eventually using his platform to speak out forcefully about American intervention in Asia. But even in the early sixties, we see him trying to make sense of his country and its possible fate. Serling took viewers to a particularly sadistic corner of the Twilight Zone in September of 1961. In an episode entitled “The Shelter,” which aired about one year before the Cuban missile crisis, suburban neighbors blithely gathered for a birthday party rapidly turn on one another when the television reports UFOs, probably Soviet bombers, descending on them. Only one of the neighbors, the beloved family doctor to most of the gathering, has built a fallout shelter. Even some dedicated fans of the show found the episode heavy-handed, too blatantly allegorical, preachy. Would people really turn on one another so quickly in a crisis? Serling, and the embattled protagonist of “The Shelter,” thought it naïve to believe otherwise.40 Atomic weapons became, and have remained, a symbol of the apocalypse, a haunting backdrop to horror culture’s tales of death. Serling frequently revisited the theme directly in episodes like “Time Enough at Last,” “Third from the Sun,” “A Little Peace and Quiet,” and, more obliquely, in “The Midnight Sun.” Serling’s use of science fiction terrors to make people think appeared at a period when, just as often, these tropes reassured Americans everything would be fine. In the center of empire, theaters had begun a new kind of danse macabre as dark powers starved for conquest arrived to conquer the ailing earth. The future belonged to horror.",

      "content": "1.Unidentified THE MONSTERS usually came from Mars. The bloody iron oxide glow and association with the god of war made our closest planetary neighbor in the void a natural jumping-off point for an extraterrestrial invasion. H. G. Wells predicted just such an attack in his 1897 tale The War of the Worlds, appearing in serialized form to the British public the same year the world met Bram Stoker’s Dracula. In Wells’s original vision the Martians came thirsting for our blood. Dying on their moldering planet, like the rotting five-hundred-year-old warlord in the Carpathians, the aliens hungered for a literal fresh transfusion of life. Mars and Transylvania had one thing in common. The old cultures, in British imperial myth, wanted, depended on, the vitality of great Britannia. Americans proved willing to believe the same about their growing empire. In 1939, a radio play by Orson Welles’s The Mercury Theatre on the Air narrated a version of The War of the Worlds in a fashion that convinced at least some listeners that Martian death rays scoured the landscape of New Jersey. Welles saw his production as part of the coalition building that many left-leaning artists and activists pursued in the thirties, a broad anti-fascist front. So he must have been delighted that at least some listeners misheard the program in such a way as to believe that the Nazis invaded the East Coast. In the year 1947, invaders filled the skies over the forty-eight states. By the middle of the summer, newspaper accounts dubbed their touring vehicles “flying saucers.” Most agree that the term can be traced to the private pilot and U.S. Forest Service employee Kenneth Arnold, who saw “nine, bright, saucer-like objects” flying at “incredible” speeds. At the same time, the idea of saucer-like crafts played an important role in the pulp sci-fi and horror magazines of the twenties and thirties, ensuring that the idea already held some currency in American culture. Arnold’s supposed sighting made an ephemeral cultural image into an icon. The Chicago Sun reported on June 26 that Arnold insisted, based on his flight experience, that the object sighted near Mount Rainier moved at speeds exceeding 1,200 miles per hour. “It’s impossible,” Arnold admitted, “but there it is.”1 The U.S. military agreed with Arnold on the impossibility of such a craft. Officials connected to the newly created Air Force, formerly the Army Air Forces, overanxiously denied the existence of any actual craft buzzing around up there. They invented the term unidentified flying objects (UFOs) since they knew from their own experience that nothing kills enthusiasm like a military acronym. UFO stuck, becoming a permanent part of American popular culture and lexicon. The acronym lost its original bureaucratic origins and came to mean “visiting and/or invading extraterrestrials” in general parlance, contrary to Air Force hopes that it simply means a thing in the sky that doesn’t matter because we can’t identify it and could well be a weather balloon, a hallucination, or a simple trick of the light. Gritting their teeth, everybody in the Pentagon with less than four stars busily worked to convince Americans there was nothing to worry about. They failed spectacularly. Then, they succeeded beyond their wildest hopes. Was the newly inaugurated Pentagon hiding secrets? Yes. Did it have to do with alien craft, crashing with some regularity in the desert Southwest? Sadly, no. Most Americans, at first, did not assume that horrors from outer space accounted for what writers on the topic later dubbed the summer of the flying saucers. The Second World War convinced many that the sightings related to a new kind of superweapon. Perhaps surprisingly, few seem to have assumed that these vehicles flying around unidentified represented a Soviet plot. Kenneth Arnold himself sent a telegram to Wright Field in Ohio expressing his “disappointment” that the Air Force gave no confirmation of the origin of what he had seen since he “felt certain they belonged to our government.” Arnold hoped that the commanding general and the Air Force scientists would take his concerns more seriously since he assumed that he’d seen “an instrument of destruction meant to be used in combination with our atom bomb.” Shouldn’t the American people know about this?2 Truman’s burgeoning national security state thought there was plenty the American people did not need to know. In 1947, the National Security Act created the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon, putting in place a cooperative and unitary military command structure. At least that’s all the American public assumed had happened. And, anyway, the new legislation looked about as interesting as changes to an administrative flowchart. Most took little notice. In fact, the act allowed for a complete reorientation of foreign policy, extremely powerful institutions not answerable to the democratic process, and what amounted to the unconstrained ability to wage secret wars anywhere around the globe. Historian Tom Engelhardt writes that the National Security Council became, in effect, the president’s “second cabinet, coordinating domestic, foreign, and military policies beyond the oversight of Congress or the public.” The new National Security Agency (NSA) quickly became a clearing house of data on American citizens as well as foreign powers. Under the act, the NSA did not even have to reveal its existence to the American public until 1975.3 A single short paragraph in the act created one of the most powerful agencies in American foreign policy over the next seventy years, a secret army answerable primarily to the president and his advisors. The CIA became, in effect, a new, secret branch of the armed forces with a mission broadly defined as the “analysis” of intelligence and the dangerously vague permission to conduct “clandestine activities.” In 1949, a wave of bad news from the fluctuating fronts of the Cold War led to a bill that exempted the agency from having to disclose “its size, budget, operations, and sources.”4 The sweeping powers of the new agency deeply concerned many senior officials and military leaders, even if the American public paid very little attention. In some cases, this opposition amounted to administrative turf wars. Hoover seemed especially concerned about what would become of his beloved FBI. Other critics sounded off with more serious concerns about what the NSA meant for democracy. More traditional military leaders and a few in the press warned of the creation of “an American ‘Gestapo.’” Several months before the CIA began operations, George C. Marshall, the top American military commander in World War II and secretary of state in 1947, sent a private memorandum to Truman that said in part that “the powers of the proposed agency seem almost unlimited and need clarification.” There is no record of a response.5 The culture of secrecy that emerged with the National Security Act carried direct implications for what would become the new American fears of invaders in flying saucers. The entire intelligence community and the Air Force took an interest in the reported phenomenon, though not because they thought (or knew) that aliens regularly visited some of the most isolated parts of the United States. Instead, the national security state very much needed a panic-free American public to carry out the Cold War geopolitical agenda. Advantageously for America’s foreign policy commissars, the Greenbaum effect began to do its work. Flying saucer enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists, without fail, latched on to conspiracy folklore with no basis in reality or uncovered secrets the government barely tried to keep hidden. Over the decades since the 1950s, UFO fans have frequently become excited about various smoking guns they are pretty sure the Freedom of Information Act, or the FBI’s own decision to release documents digitally, has allowed them to find. Anyone enthusiastic over U.S. government conspiracies would require a serious stockpile of cork, yarn, and thumbtacks to make enough murder boards to cover them all. And yet, the Greenbaum effect prevented any serious research into truly troubling matters. The desire to ferret out state secrets seldom included an examination of assassinations and the overthrow of foreign governments, the meaning of various obscure treaties, or the involvement of the U.S. military all over the globe. Instead, visitors from other worlds became the consuming passion, surely to the delight of the alphabet agencies raised to life by the National Security Act. Meanwhile, the CIA provided the less suspicious elements of the American public with a phrase that also helped them ignore what their country was really up to in the world. CIA Dispatch #1035-960, now widely available, reveals that the agency encouraged the use of the term conspiracy theory by the shapers of American opinion. “Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose” the document code-named PSYCH reads. In a series of talking points, the document urges that “assets” in the American news media be told that conspiracy theories “appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”6 The creation of an American consensus of ignorance about the crimes of empire seemed complete. The Greenbaum effect ensured that absurdities about little green men and lizard people kept the tin foil hat crowd busy. Meanwhile, the very term conspiracy theory and its associations successfully inoculated more skeptical Americans against the horrors of American interventionism, conflating evidence-free nonsense with realities that hid in plain sight. The national security state squared a very dark circle. 2.Crash Landings THE FBI released an influential bread-crumb trail to nowhere, referred to as the Hottel memo or the Roswell memo, to an eager public in the late 1970s. In it there’s some red meat for anyone hoping for a close encounter of any kind. In March of 1950, the special agent in charge of the D.C. office, Guy Hottel, reported to J. Edgar Hoover a rumor circulating in New Mexico that “an investigator for the Air Forces stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered.” According to the story, beings “three feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture” occupied each craft. Hoover never ordered a follow-up on the vague hearsay.7 Sounds suspicious, doesn’t it? When news of the released memo spread, the faithful believed it confirmed a government cover-up with the mention of New Mexico proving it. The reason for this “aha!” lay in another obscure 1947 incident that occurred soon after Kenneth Arnold experienced his flying saucer sighting: an Air Force craft crashed at a ranch near Roswell. Locals took up Arnold’s language and spoke of a “flying disc.” The front page of the Roswell Daily Record on July 8 came emblazoned with the headline “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region.” The Army Air Force sought to tamp down the story by dismissing the crash as a failed weather balloon and that seemed the end of l’affaire Roswell. Few continued to hold much interest in Roswell until the Hottel memo. True believers circulated it widely to the delight of UFO fans, who crowed over the sudden, supposed proof of a government cover-up at Roswell—never mind that the alleged deception occurred three years before the field office director’s report. In 1980, Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, the former a paranormal enthusiast who previously wrote about the Bermuda Triangle and other alleged paranormal phenomena, published the hugely popular book The Roswell Incident. Their false assertions, allegedly based on interviews with numerous eyewitnesses but actually jerry-built from informal chats with people who claimed to know eyewitnesses or someone who knew an eyewitness, became the template for the idea of a government conspiracy to cover up the supposed crash and discovery of an alien craft in the New Mexico desert. Every decade or so, there’s new interest in Roswell. In the 1990s, more books, often making contradictory claims, appeared about the supposed crash. Many of these news books seem to have been fueled by the enormous popularity of the television series The X-Files (1993–2002), a brilliant twist on the police procedural. Running for nine seasons, plus two feature films and a reboot, the franchise made use of the era’s fascination with conspiracy and suppression of the truth. At least “truths” related to aliens and assorted cryptids . . . never coups, assassinations, or quotidian tales about the building of hundreds of U.S. military bases on foreign soil. In 2011, the FBI’s digital history project called the Vault created renewed interest in the old story. The Vault was a kind of image-building project for the FBI, a joint effort with the National Archives to release about seven thousand unclassified documents to the public. The Guy Hottel memo sent to Hoover in 1950 quickly became the most popular. Indeed, to the chagrin of the FBI, mainstream news outlets reported on the memo as if it suggested a cover-up of the Roswell incident, ignoring that it constituted a third- or arguably fourth-hand account of rumors of an incident that seemed to warrant no further investigation. In April of 2011, just as the FBI launched the Vault, an ABC news report entitled “FBI Vault Reveals UFO, Roswell Files” again linked the memo, now available for more than thirty years, to the possibility of a government cover-up. The reportage would have left most readers with the lingering suspicion that there was more to the story, especially since the director of the New York Center for Extraterrestrial Research was the single person ABC chose to interview in depth. Described with the grammatical conundrum “a UFO supporter,” he insisted that the news would force the government to come clean about the truth behind the flying saucers. In 2013, the FBI reported that the memo had been viewed nearly a million times. Roswell continues to be a popular topic among UFO enthusiasts and in popular culture. In 1999, a cult TV show called Roswell ran for three seasons. A remake of the series launched in 2019. Why do Americans care so much about these kinds of stories? In June of 1997, a CNN/Time poll found that three-quarters of respondents believed the government covered up the incident at Roswell. The same survey found, confusingly, that more of those polled believed in a Roswell cover-up than believed in extraterrestrial life. Apparently, this comes from a general sense that the U.S. government must be up to something. Maybe it’s aliens? As we’ve already seen, the birth of the national security state played a decisive role in both creating and sustaining these illusions. The people, or small movements, that have come to be known as conspiracy theorists actually exist in a peculiar symbiosis with the desire of the Cold War state to engage in actual, rather complex conspiracies. In fact, the semi-seriousness with which the Pentagon, the CIA, and the FBI took flying saucer sightings points to the real horror of the era. The government was, for example, utterly deceptive about the nature of the 1947 crash near Roswell when the Air Force described the wreckage as a weather balloon. In 1995, an Air Force report quietly explained the entire Roswell incident, an explanation disregarded or ignored by anyone more interested in little green men than the politics of the Cold War. The crash, wrote Air Force investigators, appeared “consistent with balloon devices and most likely from the MOGUL balloons that had not been recovered.” In other words, America’s Cold War with Russia and the need to keep the empire’s secrets played a crucial role in the belief that monsters were descending from the stars.8 Project Mogul launched at the end of World War II, a classified collaboration between the U.S. Army Air Forces and New York University that used large clusters of balloons and radar reflectors to trace seismic activity possibly indicative of a Soviet atomic test. Mogul long remained classified since it inaugurated decades of aerial espionage conducted against the Soviet Union. This would come to include an embarrassing May 1960 incident in which the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 spy plan in their airspace and captured the pilot, forcing Eisenhower to admit that such flights had been carried out for years.9 But far more Americans know about Roswell and its supposed alien connections than their country’s tendency to violate the rest of the world’s airspace with impunity. And far more care. Why is this so? The answer lies in the directions taken by American horror in the Cold War. It has its genesis in the fact that the worst possible thing really is the truth in the story of the American empire and the fact that Americans are quite comfortable not knowing that. 3.Lone Gunmen THERE ARE plenty of fringe theorists in America who believe an astonishing variety of nonsense. The American public mocks them and buys hundreds of thousands of copies of their books, listens to their podcasts, and watches hours of series that air, and re-air, every 1970s theory about extraterrestrial life. The television series Ancient Aliens has run for eighteen seasons on what purports to be the History Channel, despite its bizarre mix of creationism, contradictory claims, and junk science. In Smithsonian, science writer Riley Black memorably called the popular series “some of the most noxious sludge in television’s bottomless chum bucket.” In her detailed article she explains a multitude of manufactured truths and notes how frequently the show describes fundamentalist Christians without formal advanced degrees as “biblical archeologists” and “paleontologists.”10 The misinformation industry thrives off America’s juvenile dance between consumer and commodity. The authors of the Roswell paperbacks that began appearing in the eighties are both absurd and rich from the desire of Americans to hold on to modern myths. In fact, the success of their claims makes perfect sense in a country where millions believed in and spread music producer Ray Santilli’s 1995 alien autopsy hoax, including a former CIA scientist who insisted the footage was real even after the revelation that Santilli used a foam alien to create it. Then there are academics like Courtney Brown, of the prestigious Emory University, who claimed to use telepathy to learn the true nature of the Hale-Bopp comet . . . the same psychic talents he used to communicate with Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth (Brown assures us they are also aliens). And, of course, Cory Hammond, whose nightmare visions of Satanists, mind control, and the CIA question American covert actions and manage to find all the wrong answers. These examples are easy to mock. They also often find a large audience, have their speculations taken seriously by major news outlets, and earn an odd kind of belief by Americans who, looking at the maelstrom of history, politics, and science, are so baffled that they throw up their hands and mutter, “Well, it could be, I guess.” Meanwhile, mass culture phenomena from films like the The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and The Parallax View (1974) presented the possibility of American institutions subverted at the highest level, often by outside powers (an international communist conspiracy in the first and a corporation in the other). Like the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), anyone you know might be a pod person and woe betide you if you try to convince the authorities. Or, more likely in American life, you’ll be considered a delusional paranoid by consumers who also turn your book into a best-seller while a film adaptation goes into development. The official keepers of state secrets have, since the end of World War II, been perfectly content to allow such theories to spread. For all the latent American concern over conspiracy, and the occasional pop culture celebration of heroes trying to figure out the score (“The Truth Is Out There” became the most instantly recognizable tagline of The X-Files), the paranoia or simple intrigue shown by the American public never focuses on getting to the bottom of actual conspiracies. There’s certainly evidence that the caretakers of the national security state understood the power of promoting false conspiracies to cover real ones. In 1952, Walter Bedell Smith, once Eisenhower’s chief of staff and at that time serving as director of the CIA, suggested that the UFO had some real potential in advancing U.S. interests. He encouraged his top lieutenants to “discuss the possible offensive or defensive utilization of these phenomenon for psychological warfare purposes.”11 The flying saucers did offer a much-needed distraction. Indeed, during the period that Americans watched the skies for extraterrestrial invaders, the highest echelons of the U.S. government successfully created an infrastructure for clandestine terror, overthrew two elected governments and waged a guerilla terrorist campaign against another, all the while hiding significant facts about the use of atomic weapons. General public ignorance of these facts offers a clear example that Americans want their conspiracies to involve only aliens, international cabals, or both. We want the monster out there, not in here with us. We accept the apex predator in the water that we can kill but not the American myths of the frontier turned into a psychopath with a chain saw fetish. Thus, when a whistleblower shows us the truth that’s actually out there, as Edward Snowden did by revealing the National Security Agency’s PRISM program that collected cell phone data on most Americans with the cooperation of companies like Verizon, most Americans brand them as a traitor. Snowden had to go into exile or face conviction under the draconian 1917 Espionage Act. (Passed as the United States entered World War I, this act had been used to imprison anyone who opposed the country’s entrance into the conflict.) He was not asked to share his thoughts on the History Channel and his book did not become a mainstream best-seller available in cheap paperback editions. In the 1940s and 1950s, suggestions like Kenneth Arnold’s claims are what really concerned the newborn national security state. What did Americans know about the nation’s new superweapons? Most important, could a panic over their power be prevented or the terror they caused become part of the public relations arsenal needed to keep the Cold War at a low boil? In the late 1940s, the U.S. government began preparing to do some pretty nasty business at home and abroad. An informed public might demand an accounting of the new agencies that sprang into existence after the National Security Act. What would happen if Americans ever really came to grips with the reality of atomic weapons? Perhaps they would balk at the apocalypse. 4.The Creatures with Atom Brains!! WE KNEW radiation killed. It’s impossible to imagine the army of radioactive monsters that crawled, slithered, and skittered toward fifties horror fans without noticing the role of the bomb. Susan Sontag’s essay “The Imagination of Disaster” takes seriously the desire of American filmgoers to look at destruction, its possibility and its outcome. Sontag, and the ruminations of a hundred commentors on genre film, have insisted that the Cold War and sci-fi horror must be explained as allegories for aliens as communists and creature features as atomic anxiety. What was missed in trying to understand the need to screen apocalyptic horror is Sontag’s point that there’s a fantasy being lived in these films, as much as a set of anxieties about the bombs from the sky and reds under the beds. Had she pondered this fantasy over the decades, Sontag might have concluded that it’s a central tenet of the citizens of empire. The destruction of America, restaged and replayed again and again, became a symbol of undefined and inexplicable grievance. Despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, Americans since World War II imagined themselves as the victims on the world stage. In 1949, when a civil war overthrew the brutal and corrupt Chiang Kai-shek, America believed it “lost China.” We feared the Soviets during decades when they had no way to deliver their tiny nuclear arsenal to the American mainland. Defeat in Vietnam became a myth of betrayal and victimization. The country’s culture remains beset with an unhealthy neurosis that allows it to ignore the overwhelming hegemony it exercises over most of the people on earth. The only country ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population has a fortress mentality, an inexplicable seething rage against the world. The country did not collectively forget its conscience in 1945. The bomb became a moral issue for millions of Americans after the elation over the war’s end. Close to the one-year anniversary of the first bomb falling on Hiroshima, the New Yorker published John Hersey’s account of the effects of the new weapon. Hersey forced Americans to wonder about the decision to use the bomb, his spare prose making it clear that Hiroshima was anything but a giant military base. The emotional effect of his article, soon published as a best-selling book, grew from his intimate portrayal of the effects of radioactivity on six survivors. Hersey, without falling into sentimentalism, described the deteriorating health of the six in ways that horrified readers. Readers learned that the bomb’s aftereffects included the rapid degeneration of stem cell tissue as the phosphorus in their bodies caused bones to glow hot with radiation. Their blood boiled with poison. Hersey reported that men had become sterile while young women simply ceased menstruating. Victims suffered intense pains from burns that had depilated skin down to cartilage. Hersey taught Americans the phrase radiation sickness. His work carefully, and sometimes even dryly, documented how the weaponized dust and debris, ionized with radium, that emerges out of the heart of an atomic explosion eviscerates human cells and mutates DNA. Perhaps for the first time in their lives, many Americans found themselves confronted with the Japanese people as human beings. But we must be careful. It would be easy to overstate the effect of Hersey’s book, and the efforts of other critics of the atom bomb. The sense of outrage over Pearl Harbor, and a profound lack of knowledge about the diplomatic and strategic context of the attack, clouded moral reasoning about the use of such a weapon. Americans already accepted the idea of LeMay’s “terror bombing,” a practice that actually killed more civilians than the twin A-bomb attacks in August of ’45, and, to many, the mass murder at Hiroshima and Nagasaki seemed like a quicker and more efficient version of the deadly air campaigns. Not everyone, even those who pondered Hersey’s spare but muscular account, came to grips with the fact that the bomb secreted a deadly element that rewrote DNA sequences, mutating human beings at the level of their basic code. Radiation killed tens of thousands in the months and years after the bombings. “So what?” many thought, and either put down Hersey’s book or never read it in the first place. After all, hadn’t the use of weapons of questionable morality already been a part of America’s “good war”? Marine and army forces from Guadalcanal to Tarawa to Okinawa deployed the flamethrower, a weapon repeatedly condemned in the twenties and thirties by the world community after its use in World War I. Wielded by a single soldier or marine, the fearful weapon incinerated the “bug hives,” pillboxes that held Japanese soldiers, portrayed in propaganda cartoons as an inhuman, insectoid enemy fanatically willing to die for the emperor. For many Americans, the bomb just seemed a bigger and bolder version of such tactics. In fact, perhaps one of the most common comments about the bomb in politics and journalism after August of ’45 touted it as an example of American know-how. The scruples shown by at least a sliver of the American public in the few years after their country dropped the world’s first atomic device went into a political coma after the Soviet Union announced it had atomic weapons. Code-named First Lightning, the American intelligence community also called the device Joe-1 in recognition that Joseph Stalin now possessed the bomb. The American public’s response contained the peculiar mixture of nationalist bravado and sheer panic that came to represent the American state of mind in the years after World War II. Less than a month after American spy planes detected Joe-1’s radioactive trail, Democratic senator of Connecticut Brien McMahon warned Americans against complacency and insisted that the development of conventional and atomic weapons must continue. An arms race had become central to preserving American prerogatives. McMahon’s view got the most attention, as it offered a narrative of immediate threat. In the meantime, no one paid any attention to the numerous scientists calling for a sweeping internationalization of scientific research and shared risk instead of national self-interest. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who became a critic of the Pentagon’s use of the weapon he played a pivotal role in creating, found himself stripped of his security clearance. After his last, difficult meeting with Harry Truman, the president told aides never to let that “son of a bitch” appear on his schedule again. The president, who, as a young man, wished the Great War to last longer so he could kill more Germans, didn’t care for the scientist’s moral scruples.12 The country seemed ready to enjoy Sontag’s imagination of disaster. In 1955, Creature with the Atom Brain became one of the many films to imagine a mad scientist who uses radiation for apocalyptic designs, specifically raising the dead. The villain of the piece is a Nazi scientist or, in other words, precisely the kind of person working on America’s radioactive arsenal through the auspices of Operation Paperclip. Viewers watched this peculiar reflection of reality on a double bill with It Came from Beneath the Sea, a tale of nuclear submarines and giant cephalopods weaponized by radiation. Though these seem like modern fairy tales concerned with the dangers of atomic weapons, their celebration of American military power left audiences assured of the need for America’s full-spectrum dominance. 5.We Gratefully Acknowledge the Cooperation of Those in Authority SCIENCE FICTION horror already worked to encourage trust in the national security state. In 1950, hoping to build on the “summer of the flying saucers” and the continuing alleged sightings, a tiny production company called Colonial Productions made the first feature film to deal with the phenomenon. They called it The Flying Saucer. Colonial included patriotic text at the film’s beginning that read, “We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of those in authority” for making the picture possible. “Those in authority” could not help being pleased with the film’s message, which combined action and America triumphing over their enemies with tough-guy antics and technological acuity. The Flying Saucer opens with sightings of the eponymous craft over a number of American cites. An unnamed American spy agency, clearly the new CIA, enlists Mike Trent, “a playboy, sportsman, and two-fisted drinker,” to investigate sightings in Alaska. Ominously for the logic of the Cold War, “undercover agents in a communist group” in Juneau were trying to locate and learn the tech behind the alien craft since it offered “a perfect delivery system” for the A-bomb. The intrepid Trent, after some romantic adventures and fisticuffs with Russian spies, discovers that an American scientist, not extraterrestrials, developed the saucer. This nod to Kenneth Arnold’s suspicions about a U.S. superweapon is tamped down as the last minutes become a race to prevent the Soviets from stealing the saucer (small enough to conceal in the basement of a log cabin). One communist agent briefly absconds with the craft, but the American scientist has rigged it to explode. Proclaiming “all of that settled,” playboy Trent decides to marry his blonde CIA handler and all’s well. The slipshod production of The Flying Saucer—probably at least thirty minutes of the hour-and-fifteen-minute running time is filled out by aerial and landscape footage of Alaska—did not prevent it from becoming a drive-in theater standby and even a mention, if a rather acidic one, in The New York Times (“A film called ‘The Flying Saucer’ flew into the Rialto yesterday,” wrote critic Bosley Crowther, “and . . . it can go right on flying”).13 Whatever the Times thought of it, an American public nervous that Joseph Stalin had an A-bomb proved ready for a flood tide of films featuring alien aggression and radioactive monsters, usually with a thinly veiled Cold War message. The basic formula for most science-fiction horror films of the decade uses the first act to introduce a threat from beyond the stars or, somewhat ironically, from under the sands of “the West,” a New Mexico of the mind where audiences would vaguely remember the Trinity test exploded the bomb into the world. In act two, Washington learns of the threat (usually because of a child or a scientist or a child and a scientist, almost always in a small town), and the filmmaker inserts World War II or Korean War footage to show tank treads rolling formidably in a long steel line, jeeps filled with combat troops, and a general mobilization against the threat. The scientist, sometimes with the help of another very pretty scientist/soon-to-be love interest, engineers a way the army can destroy the flying saucers or the giant ants or the mutated octopi. In the last act, the army, with a bit of scientific can-do, destroys the threat in a Hiroshima strike against the extraterrestrials. Sometimes there’s fallout, literal fallout, but that’s the price of peace. The success of these films, and the hundreds of them made between 1950 and about 1968, is equal parts celebration of American empire building and assurance from “those in authority” that the U.S. military could defeat any threat. The year 1949 had become a crucial turning point in American public opinion regarding the Cold War, a hardening of attitudes that overdetermined the political possibilities of the country for decades to come. The fantasy of disaster, the fantasy of being both victim and conqueror, played out on thousands of screens almost every night through the first two decades of the Cold War. America the victimized saw its post–World War II preeminence under siege. In the same year that Stalin could celebrate his nation being able to explode an atom bomb, the communist revolution in China headed by Mao-Tse Tung succeeded. This created shock and surprise in the United States, and perhaps even in Mao himself. Mao’s revolution solidified the American foreign policy establishment’s aggressive stance against an alleged international communist conspiracy. The somewhat moderate policy of “containment” advocated by George F. Kennan in ’46 called for a sort of diplomatic and economic seawall raised against a rising red tide. Many foreign policy wonks, and an increasingly paranoid right wing in both major political parties, entertained the possibility of communist influence at the highest levels of government. The phrase domino theory percolated among elites and soon the public, the logical fallacy of the slippery slope turned into a geopolitical confession of faith. If one country “went communist,” its neighbors would also tip over, one after another, into a sea of red. It’s a fantasy of loss of control, the need of empires through history to see every small act of independence as a threat. The United States had, in fact, already declared its vision of the postwar world, where if any nation refused the country’s influence, they were, by definition, a tool of Moscow. In 1946, Truman called for a massive aid package to the right-wing monarchy of Greece. The Greek government faced a communist insurgency comprised mostly of partisans who fought against the Nazis with Allied help since 1941. Stalin, perhaps the least revolutionary leader on the planet, took little interest in the conflict but did react with horror to Truman’s characterization of it. In a 1947 stem-winder of a speech, given to a joint session of Congress but directed at the Kremlin, the American president described the “terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists” who threatened “the very existence of the Greek state.” But he went further. “I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” The cynical use of rhetoric about “free peoples” aside, this seemed both a threat to Moscow and a declaration of war against the revolutionary aspirations of people from Africa to Asia to Latin America who labored under the centuries-old yoke of European imperialism. The Truman doctrine made it clear how America would use its military and economic power to stack the dominoes any way it wanted to. The United States pursued a course in Greece, soon to become a familiar pattern, in which American “advisors” and military hardware arrived in 1947 to prop up the repressive, but anti-communist, regime. The conservative Greek government survived to place in power a menagerie of criminals, economic oligarchs, and even some Nazi collaborators who earned U.S. approbation for their virulent anti-socialism.14 In Asia, Truman and his National Security Council poisoned relations with China for decades. The 1950 deployment of U.S. troops to South Korea to defend it against invasion from the communist North Korea fell within the parameters of “containment.” However, early successes led General Douglas MacArthur and some of Truman’s closest advisors to urge a full-scale invasion of North Korea, despite China’s explicit warning they would intervene if the United States took this step. American troops crossed the thirty-eighth parallel in the summer of 1950. In response, Chinese forces threw a punishing haymaker of an assault that forced the American army into retreat and even retook the South Korean capital of Seoul. After two years of talks, the deaths of 33,686 American soldiers, and perhaps as many as four million Korean dead in both the North and South, the conflict ended with the divided country having essentially the same borders it did in 1950 and a heavy, permanent American military presence along the restored border. Nearly every major city on the peninsula lay in ruins from American air power. Millions faced starvation. The city of Wonsan endured a forty-one-day, nearly twenty-four-hour shelling from American battleships that U.S. Rear Admiral Allan E. Smith concluded had been the longest and most destructive naval bombardment in human history.15 The catastrophic circumstances strengthened the hand of the most reactionary elements of the North Korean state. Today it remains one of the most isolated and repressive countries on earth. Generations of leaders with a bizarre, semi-mystical version of communism that ritualized a cult of personality around the “Dear Leader” rule an impoverished nation that’s nevertheless well on its way to becoming a nuclear power. The Korean War grimly affected U.S. foreign policy and democratic institutions. The specter of defeat after the Chinese intervention caused discontent and outright fear at the Pentagon and in the administration. Truman suggested at a news conference that field commanders could authorize the use of nuclear weapons and mused in his diary about a new Hiroshima that might bring a quick end to the conflict. The United States readied atomic weapons at bases in Japan. In the spring of 1951, the Joint Chiefs ordered an atomic attack on Manchuria—the very region where Chinese troops first fought the Japanese invasion as American allies—if China sent in more troops to consolidate its early gains. Paradoxically only the fanaticism of MacArthur caused the administration to pause. MacArthur wanted to go nuclear on China and the Soviet Union, and apparently he floated a plan to irradiate much of Asia in order to make a point. In pushing back against this psychotic suggestion, the Truman administration decided to stick with conventional warfare rather than annihilate the Korean peninsula.16 Defense spending boomed. The United States held a stockpile of two hundred atomic weapons in 1949. By 1960, when Kennedy claimed that Republicans had allowed a “missile gap” with the Soviet Union, America possessed eighteen thousand atomic devices. The idea of the missile gap emerged, according to the most distinguished historian of the CIA, from unsubstantiated claims by the agency, the USAF, and the defense industry that the Russians had five hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) able to strike anywhere in the United States. They actually possessed four, and three of those might not have made it off the ground. The Soviet Union would not achieve anything like missile parity until the late 1970s.17 The United States also accelerated research and testing of the hydrogen bomb, triumphantly called “the super bomb” by many in the defense establishment. First tested in the Pacific in the fall of ’52, the device contained one thousand times the force of the weapon dropped on Hiroshima. A crater that yawned two miles wide and almost a mile deep appeared on Enewetak Atoll and gave some hint of the new weapon’s power. Polls suggested that a slim majority of Americans wanted to see an end to nuclear testing. At the same time, sheer, unstoppable military power had come to hold a special place in the American people’s hearts. Paul Fussell describes the enormous tonnage of explosive power placed in the hands of individual America GIs that left Europe a scarred and blasted landscape. He writes that, despite hours of “marksmanship” practice U.S. soldiers engaged in with their M1 carbines, ace shooting and battlefield tactics became passé when “mass wiping-outs, artillery stonks, and frontal flamethrower assaults” could do the job. By late 1944, Europe looked as if the no-man’s-land of the Great War metastasized across the continent, enveloped major cities, and rolled over every acre of farmland and factory district. The men who fought the war, the staff officers who took note of the effect of the unfettered violence, and the commanding generals who ordered mini apocalypses unleashed on ancient European cities all came home with a deep appreciation for the American military machine’s ability to blow the absolute hell out of any obstacle and burn alive any possible threat.18 Horror science fiction accepted the logic of total military supremacy as well, especially when tied to the can-do spirit of science, often evoking the image of the scrappy American inventor. This archetype of the heroic innovator had long held a special place in American mythology. The new style of scares, with a few cinematically interesting exceptions, showed us a new kind of scientist, the opposite of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his crew of doubting Thomases. These new scientists work with the military, they answer to the call of duty, and there’s no question whose side they are on. The mad scientist had transformed into the patriotic scientist or simply the compliant one. Stanley Kubrick’s dark comedy Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb didn’t appear until 1964. By then, as the director well knew, too many Americans had developed a peculiar affection for the bomb. A popular flick called The Atomic Submarine appeared in 1959, and at the time, probably moved at least as many Americans as Kubrick’s arty, over-the-top parody. The Atomic Submarine took some cues from The Flying Saucer, even as it reimagined the alien invasion story by adding some Arctic adventure and even more slack-jawed militarism. The story involved the North Pole becoming a kind of Devil’s Triangle where American ships and subs have begun to disappear. Surely it must be some Soviet plot, and so the USS Tigershark, christened by the film “the deadliest atomic submarine in the U.S. fleet,” goes to investigate. The building of the USS Nautilus, the first submarine to use atomic power, inspired the film. The navy sent the sub to the Arctic waters in an effort not to find commies or to fight flying saucers, but to break submersion records and become the first watercraft to reach the geographic North Pole. The first attempt failed in July of 1958. A second effort succeeded, and the Eisenhower administration hoped the mission would counter the world’s perception of superior Soviet technology after the successful launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957. The Atomic Submarine also coiled into the belly of Cold War politics. A civilian peacenik scientist joins the crew for unconvincing plot reasons. He stands in for every member of the scientific community who warned about the effects of atom bombs and, in fact, exactly the kind of submarine he finds himself aboard. A chisel-chinned officer declares that the scientist’s anti-war statements are “open propaganda” and, worse, that he even shamed his own high-ranking naval officer dad into retirement and ill health. According to chisel-chin, the “press got in on it” and declared the scientist’s father “a warmonger.” Nonsense. In the actual 1950s, what destroyed Joseph McCarthy was not his disregard for civil liberties or even his grotesque, bullying public image. No one blinked an eye when he accused private citizens, or most of the State Department, of treasonous behavior. But when he went after the army, he went too far. The military may have been, other than Billy Graham, the decade’s most respected public institution. The Tigershark discovers a flying saucer at the North Pole inhabited by a tentacled one-eyed beanstalk intent on prepping planet earth for colonization. An intercontinental ballistic missile destroys the craft, but the sailors simply call it an ICBM without giving any explanation of what this meant. Clearly, the acronym had become as well known to the American public as UFO. A new mass militarism meant movie producers could count on their drive-in audience knowing the utter devastation such a device could wreak. There’s no room for dissenting voices aboard America’s atomic submarine. If you wanted to be a real American, not a communist flunky or worse, you had to come along fully for the ride. In the final scene, the peacenik scientist accepts atomic weapons as at least a necessary evil, admitting that “guys like the sailors” aboard the Tigershark, guys willing to unleash weapons of apocalyptic power when the order comes down, can save “us” from the invaders. America was not going to take any shit. 6.The Midnight Monster Show AMERICANS FROM all walks of life now believed they saw flying saucers, or flying somethings, careening across the skies. Films—not the ones best produced and now recalled as classics like The Thing from Another World (1951) or Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), but low-budget screamers, quickly produced and distributed widely and repeatedly at double bills in traditional theaters—helped shape the perception of these not-very-close encounters into alien invasions. But Martians or Venusians or the occasional unnamed extraterrestrial empire hungry for earth’s lifeblood provided many Americans with only some of the strange solaces of horror. The shiny steel surfaces of the flying saucer, mimicking the curvaceous modernism of both household appliances and the postwar automobile, took up only part of the shadows of the American mind. During the Second World War, Americans could venture out to venues on the home front to discover the frightful delights of horror’s first golden age. The monsters of their youth might have been cavorting with Abbott and Costello. But in cities and small towns across the country, the so-called spook show became a popular attraction, delivering live-action versions of the increasingly placid, predictable American horror film. In some respects, these local performances helped horror survive in the age of Frankenstein engaging in hijinks with Lou and Bud. Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors brought dark carnival delights across the country beginning in the 1940s. Dr. Silkini was actually Jack Baker from Toledo, Ohio. Baker’s show became the most popular of its kind, lasting until 1963. The traveling horror show included some traditional magic tricks, a séance played for laughs, and the occasional gag, like promising to show the audience an actual dead body only to lift the veil on a frozen chicken. But Baker served audiences some pretty strong stuff that went beyond these hijinks. He called the show’s most potent trick the Blackout, a skit in which he or one of his performers threatened to throw live snakes into the audience and then cut the lights, leading to inevitable screams as he flung a heavy, damp rope into the sudden darkness. Dr. Silkini really gave his audience the business at the show’s climax. The stage became a grand guignol gathering of what looked to be body parts in an art deco lab familiar to fans of the era’s many mad scientist films. Working with a hunchbacked assistant, Silkini brought the body to life with a fog and fireworks show of sparks and miniature explosions and Frankenstein’s monster himself. The monster would gruesomely strangle the hunchback and then shamble toward the audience just as Silkini dropped all the lights in the house. Screams edging into utter panic always followed. Universal Studios took a dim view of the unlicensed use of one of their marquee characters. However, Silkini managed to convince the studio’s legal department to allow him the rights to the character. Universal may have rightly understood that the popularity of the shows kept their classic monsters in undead circulation. In fact, Universal’s 1944 House of Frankenstein made use of a traveling midnight show (its ghost host played malevolently by Boris Karloff) in what seems a reluctant tribute to the rising popularity of Silkini and his many imitators. In fact, rescreening of classic, and perhaps some not-so-classic, horror films went hand in skeletal hand with the midnight shows. Silkini introduced the practice of “midnight bicycling” in which he rented out one venue to startle and entertain with his magic show and monster mash as well as a nearby movie palace the audience could bicycle to directly after his stage show to eat popcorn as eagerly as they gobbled down a horror film or bleak murder mystery. The midnight shows brought delicious excitement to small towns throughout the United States. Their appeal went beyond, and blended with, the outré character of the entertainment. The conventions of the event allowed teenagers, adults, and children to ignore curfew, young couples copping feels in the shadowy privacy of theaters while kids bicycled across town in the small hours. It’s challenging for contemporary readers to grasp how, in the quiet and often very homogenous town of the fifties, this allowed for a carnivalesque atmosphere edged with terror. But this was a white empire at play . . . and so not open to everyone. Segregation excluded many Americans from enjoying the pleasures of the midnight monster shows. During the height of Silkini and his many imitators’ popularity, state laws throughout the South and parts of the Midwest segregated all public spaces. De facto segregation in much of the rest of the United States prevailed. When Dr. Morris and His Weird House of Horrors brought their midnight show to the New Bern Theatre in North Carolina, the advertised “frightmare of monsters” was a whites-only affair. A poster for a “Mammoth Horror” event at the old vaudeville theater in Fort Smith, Arkansas, told “colored folks” that they would have to come to their own “exclusive”—that is, Jim Crow—performance.19 American racism brought out other ugly elements of the American id, fueling the empire’s suspicion and arrogance. In the atmosphere of the Cold War, seething prejudices against Asians and Asian Americans intertwined with the monster shows. The horror of movie monsters and dark magic mixed with a blighted representation of the enemies of the empire. A new midnight monster show illustrated this sinister side of the monstrous fun. In June of 1950, Bill Sachs reported for Billboard magazine that he recently caught Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient,” a “45-minute display” making its way through Kansas and Missouri. Sachs records the impressions of a reporter named Ray Amy, who watched what he described as “the snappiest and most clean cut of its type I’ve ever seen” in Kansas City in the early summer.20 Los Angeles–based Frank Chan performed as the villainous Chan Loo. Chan began his career as a magician working in the late 1930s at a tourist trap its promoter called China City. Developer Christine Sterling successfully created a kind of virtual Spanish mission on Olvera Street, a faux-historical rendition of a romanticized “mission days,” as cultural tourism usually termed the period that ignored the real costs of the conquest of California: destruction of Indigenous peoples and their culture by the spread of smallpox and forced baptisms that harried the region’s Chumash, Tataviam, and Tongva peoples like twin pale riders of plague and war.21 Sterling’s China City offered white Americans an equally patronizing representation of Chinese American life and indeed of Asia itself. Chan became one of the many Chinese Americans to receive some financial and social benefits from the project. Amid the false front of an imaginary China, people displaced by the destruction of L.A.’s original Chinatown in 1933 during the building of Union Station found jobs as performers, store owners, or practitioners of their traditional craft.22 Chinese American organizations in the thirties created the so-called New Chinatown on Broadway, which ultimately offered more autonomous opportunity for entrepreneurs in their community. China City, on the other hand, gave a performance space to people who already often played unidentified Asian extras for Hollywood studios, or in some cases, craftsmen whose families hailed from northern regions of China, where everything from handicraft to language and foodways could be vastly different from the country’s southern region, which most first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants once called home. Chan bridged a lot of these differences that held little interest for America audiences who wanted an imagined China. He blended very generalized symbols of his Chinese heritage with elements of traditional magic shows audiences had enjoyed since the late nineteenth century. Chan’s act promised “oriental mystery.” A contemporary photograph shows him dressed in elegant robes (most of the people who performed in China City wore costumes from a patchwork of varied periods in Chinese history with no concern for anachronism) while pulling a rabbit from a box painted with a lu-ung, or Chinese dragon.23 Chan followed in the footsteps of Dr. Silkini by creating a road show that combined his act with the American interest in horror. An accidental fire destroyed China City in 1948. Two years later, as the Korean War began, Chan built a career as Dr. Chan Loo, possibly using as inspiration Bela Lugosi’s 1932 Chandu the Magician. In promotional materials, Chan described himself as coming from a “long line of mystics,” including his father “a Seer as well as a magician,” who “in a letter to his son in 1932 gave an almost complete account of World War II which was to prove correct.”24 Two attractive young women appear on Chan’s poster. Their stage names are Allen Chin and Jessica Wong. They haves smiles as ripe as summer oranges and wear highly nontraditional kimonos cut high on the thigh. This obviously helped the show’s appeal. Chan traveled the country until the early 1960s. His formula promised a display of mystic art combined with the assurance that if you want to be scared, “this show will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. You will see the Wolf Man in person, the living Zombie and Igor the Hunchback . . . it’s sen-sational, weird, thrilling!” We shouldn’t underestimate the American public’s desire for the “thrilling” or the promise Chan made that “you’ll see gorgeous girls” along with a serving of monsters. But Chan’s mix of magic show and horror film offered the 1950s much more. He promised the “Horrors of the Orient,” a stylized Chinese dragon choking up fire and a partially decayed skull at the other end of the banner offering twin images of traditional scares from Asia and Europe. The “oriental horror” Chan proffered worked in part because of a long American suspicion about Asia exacerbated by Pearl Harbor and the subsequent conflict. By the 1950s, many Americans transferred the fear and hatred they felt toward Japan during the Second World War to a generalized Asian menace, a Cold War nightmare of the mind. This transference occurred all too easily since most Americans had limited knowledge of Asia and the Pacific world. The faux set pieces of China City encapsulated what most thought they knew, not simply about China but their mental construct of “Asian.” Moreover, the prejudices had roots deep in the previous century. Arriving in mid-nineteenth-century California to work in gold mines and then for the Central Pacific Railroad, Chinese laborers entered contracts with their employers best understood as indentured servitude. Though they made up about a quarter of the California labor force, the menial and deeply demeaning nature of their work did not prevent Chinese immigrants from being seen as insidious threats. In 1871, mobs burned and murdered their way through a section of Los Angeles called Calle de los Negros, slaughtering eighteen Chinese men. Between 1885 and 1887, eighty-six Chinese people died in shootings and lynchings.25 When a so-called Workingmen’s Party seized control of the city government of San Francisco in the 1870s, the new regime used their leverage to shape a revised state constitution that forbid citizenship for “any Chinese or Mongolian,” language that showed the general confusion about the identity and background of the new immigrants. Many white Californians and their representatives blamed an 1876 outbreak of smallpox on the Chinese community. The anti-Asian propaganda that resulted created a national, nonpartisan coalition opposed to the immigration of more Chinese people to America. This local boomlet of racism had a national counterpart. In 1882, Congress ended legal immigration with the Chinese Exclusion Act, continuously renewed until 1943, long after some Americans began to view the Chinese as victims of Japanese atrocities and, in ’41, as important allies against the Axis. According to leaders in California’s anti-Asian movement, in what continues as a common refrain about the anger against immigrants today, the Chinese would take American jobs and lower wages and, moreover, they were “utter heathens, treacherous, sensual, cowardly, and cruel.”26 This conception long poisoned American attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans. Ignorance and hatred of the Asian communities also worked dark magic with American foreign policy in Cold War attitudes toward China, the Korean War, and the disaster in Vietnam. Horror films extruded the poison of American fears and, in turn, brewed an even deadlier toxin. In 1932, Boris Karloff starred as a murderous and perverted Chinese crime lord in The Mask of Fu Manchu. The film appeared a year after Karloff had played the Monster in Frankenstein and the same year he would shamble forth as The Mummy. MGM briefly borrowed Karloff for the production of Mask. Based on a novel by Sax Rohmer, the archvillain Fu Manchu appears as equal parts mad scientist and super villain given to dressing as a Mandarin from the Han dynasty. Myrna Loy, who played the sadistically evil daughter of Manchu, had not yet found fame in the Thin Man series of films. When Mask appeared, the former dancer at Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard had starred as various femme fatales, what the silent era called a vamp. What audiences read as her “exotic” looks also found her cast in various roles as an Asian character at a time when Hollywood hired actual Asians only for comic effect or, more frequently, as street scene extras in so-called oriental adventures. A hit film that starred Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy in yellow-face, and for the purpose of portraying absurd caricatures of Asian villainy, stands as a bleak testament to American attitudes in this era. But the plot itself goes even further down the well of ruinous fantasy, creating a brutally racist pornography. In the climactic scene, Karloff dons the mask of Genghis Khan to which the plot has hazily attributed a degree of supernatural power. He stands before what he describes as “the hordes of Asia” and promises them the conquest of the world and, in a line forever associated with the film, calls on his followers to “Kill the white man and take his women!” The infamously nasty moment prompted a protest from the Chinese embassy in Washington when the film appeared. It’s some indication of the film’s effect when we consider that the Chinese ambassador had a great deal on his mind already in ’32 given the recent Japanese invasion of the Chinese mainland. The Mask of Fu Manchu taught another equally fiendish, if more subtle, lesson to its viewers. At the pinnacle of the mastermind’s power, he calls together “all the hordes of Asia” to overrun “the Western world. The film shows us the rogue’s gallery of the American mind, a gathering of global stereotypes. The followers of Fu Manchu are not only from East Asia. Some appear dressed in the traditional clothing of Arab Bedouins, others wear the fez of Turkey and North Africa, and a group appears that seems to represent a stereotype of barely clothed Pacific Islanders. Meanwhile, the guards of Fu Manchu are racist conceptions of sub-Saharan Africans, complete with loincloths. The “hordes of Asia” that threaten white men and “their” women are the peoples of most of the globe. These ideas continued to circulate during the Cold War, and white audiences proved hungry for images of the enemies of their empire. In 1952, Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” appeared at a local theater in Kearny, Nebraska, followed by a screening of Lugosi’s 1942 Black Dragons. Frank Chan, in character as the evil Chan Loo, could ensure a bigger crowd by blending “oriental” horrors so that, to the American mind confused by old ally China suddenly becoming the bad guy while Japan became a Cold War client, Asia itself could stand in for all manner of murky threats to white America. After all, anyone who saw the The Mask of Fu Manchu twenty years earlier already had some idea of the terror of “hordes of Asia.” The wax museum of American fears made the transference of hatred of the Japanese to a more generalized communist Asian a fairly easy process. Even to veterans who served in the Pacific, the geography of the region, its diversity of cultures, and its political complexities made it “inscrutable.” This word, symbolic of general American ignorance of Asian history and culture, became a racist stereotype of Asian people themselves. Japan, China, and soon a place called French Indochina, Vietnam, intertwined in the vague Asia of the American mind. The American imperial age has been built on such assumptions. The American takeover of Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century came with one army officer declaring that the people were “no more capable of self-government than the savages of Africa.” In the Philippines, an army private wrote that “no cruelty is too severe for these brainless monkeys.” These attitudes, which produced massacre, torture, and the building of detention camps, received a high-toned gloss from American officials at home who spoke of the need to “educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.” In more recent decades, talk of nation building, globalization, and spreading democratic values has blended with the language of race and stereotyped villainy.27 White supremacy has always been the cornerstone of American empire. Raw, colonialist, and racist notions continue to bubble like acid beneath the surface. In March and April of 2020, the president of the United States persistently referred to the novel coronavirus as “the Chinese virus.” At a rally for conservative college students held at a church in Arizona, Trump called COVID-19 “the Kung Flu,” earning him thunderous applause. Facing public criticism after numerous incidents of physical threats and violence against Asian Americans, Trump tamped down that language even as it enjoyed wide popularity on right-wing social media, podcasts, and radio programs. The idea that “Chinese labs” created the virus itself became a viral phenomenon.28 Insidious rumor legends can rip the social and the geopolitical fabric to tatters on their own. They take on darker forms when governments weaponize them. At the end of April 2020, intelligence analysts and current and former administration officials revealed that both the president and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exerted pressure on the CIA to find evidence of either an accidental or purposeful creation of the virus in a Chinese laboratory environment. The president even raised the possibility of suing the Chinese government ten million dollars for each American death. In the coming weeks, Pompeo went against the findings of most of the American intelligence community in asserting that some kind of Chinese maleficence caused the spread of the virus. Mounting evidence suggests that this rhetoric encouraged an outbreak of violence, including mass shootings and public attacks with edged weapons, against Asian Americans.29 The Trump administration found purchase by using these fears of “the East.” But this had been done before. Creating monsters to destroy, a set of “oriental horrors,” offered Americans a way to ignore the horror their atomic Frankenstein birthed into the world. A 1946 issue of Science magazine suggested that with the atomic bomb, “an unconquerable monster has been released.” In fact, the language of the horror film appeared even in the high-toned pages of The New York Times. In pondering the image of the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, William L. Laurence imagined it as a headless monster or a “funeral pyre” that suggested “the presence of the supernatural.” Or maybe, he mused, it looked a little like the Statue of Liberty.30 7.Future Imperfect FOR RAY BRADBURY, the atomic bomb represented the thing at the top of the stairs, the impending arms race a new dark carnival come to America unbidden, whispering seductive promises that could come to no good end. The aspiring writer still clattered away on his typewriter every day, publishing his first story in 1938, though receiving no money for it. A somewhat uncertain period followed in which he hoped to emulate his serial film heroes Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers by joining the army in World War II. Rejected because of his ridiculously poor eyesight, he attempted a brief career in some very minor New York plays but, by his own admission, possessed no acting talent whatsoever. His big break came in 1947 when, to his chagrin, his short story “Homecoming” received a rejection slip from Weird Tales magazine, the pulp that published the works of horror masters from H. P. Lovecraft to Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Feeling confident because his collection Dark Carnival had received good notices, he submitted the story “Homecoming” to Mademoiselle magazine. This unlikely effort paid off when Truman Capote, then an editorial assistant, happened to glance at the story on top of the magazine’s tottering slush pile. The story entranced the twenty-two-year-old Capote, who convinced his bosses to publish it. One of the first science fiction stories to appear in a mainstream magazine, it won an O. Henry Award in 1947. The politics of the forties and fifties drove Bradbury’s works of fantasy, horror, and sometimes frightening science futures. Thoroughly marinated in the world of early horror films and sci-fi fandom, Bradbury also took his writing cues from the likes of Edith Wharton, Thomas Wolfe, and his favorite author, Katherine Anne Porter. Porter’s stories about revolutionary Mexico may have influenced Bradbury’s 1950 story “The Highway,” in which, in an ironic immigration reversal, American refugees stream by the home of a Mexican campesino family. The tale presents the United States as utterly devastated by atomic war and one of the passing, abject Americans, a well-heeled group of young tourists traveling through Central America during the attack, despairingly tells the Mexican family that the end of the world has come. Suggesting that their lives could continue after the desolation of its aggressive northern neighbor, the father of the family ends the story by sardonically wondering aloud, “What do they mean ‘the world’?” When he was a young man, rocket ships and a gleaming sci-fi future were Bradbury’s passion. But so were the extinct dinosaurs. The reality of the bomb weighed heavy on him, social criticism leaking into his worlds of wonder. Bradbury’s 1950 “There Will Come Soft Rains” became one of the most famous, and most poignant, of fantastic tales that attempted to respond to the monsters of the atomic age. Appearing as one of the interconnected stories in his classic collection The Martian Chronicles, it evoked a post-nuclear suburb and a home of the future in which the vacuum cleaner runs unattended, happy hour cocktails mix themselves, and bridge tables pop out of walls while the soothing voice of the smart home asks the lady of the house what poem she’d like to hear read. The people are missing even as the machine continues to run. All that remains, in a phenomenon reported from Hiroshima, are the shadows of long-dead children at play and a man mowing a lawn, the outline of their cindered bodies burned into a wall by the indescribable temperatures rising from the heart of an atomic blast. Bradbury would once again write more hopeful stories of the human future, but the shadow of apocalypse and accompanying dystopia would continually bring the worlds of horror and science fiction together. This marked a significant departure from the first generation of sci-fi fans, whose interest in science (and politics) as much as fiction had informed their vision of the world. No group, out of all the fissiparous sci-fi fan clubs of the thirties, better represented this trend than the Futurians. The motley gathering began in New York City after splitting off from another science fiction league that wanted to keep politics out of their fandom. For the members of the Futurians—which included authors who later became enormously popular, like Frederik Pohl, Damon Knight, James Blish, Cyril Kornbluth, and occasional visitor Isaac Asimov—science fiction could become science fact in a future that had to include a new political regime. It would not be an American empire that brought a prosperous future. Indeed, the young idealists dreamed not only of the stars but of the red star that rose over Russia in the October Revolution of 1917. Looking back through the filter of the Cold War, some Americans today may be surprised at this hearty left-wing enthusiasm. But the Futurians reflected the political upheaval and free-flowing discussion of new possibilities of the thirties. In that decade, when the Great Depression appeared to have come to give capitalism its last rites, the seeming success story of the Soviet Union impressed numerous westerners. Stalin’s cruelties remained unknown. American communists, while hated by those on the far right, were known primarily as defenders of the unjustly executed Scottsboro Boys of Alabama and faithful allies to the labor unions starting to enjoy a series of successes in American life. The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) reached its largest membership in the decade, many of them very young. Its relatively small membership numbers belied the outsize influence of the CPUSA, which played a key role in both the largest strike in American history, the primarily southern Uprising of ’34, and one of the most successful, working hand in glove with the CIO in the 1937 auto strike. Indeed, even Hollywood films portrayed Stalin’s Soviet Union as admirable (as in the 1943 Mission to Moscow) or at least affectionately comical (as in German émigré Ernst Lubitsch’s Ninotchka). In 1939, Time magazine named Stalin, “Uncle Joe” to the burgeoning American left, as “Man of the Year.” Although the highly conservative ownership obviously despised Stalin, the magazine had to cite the undeniably rapid and successful transformation of Russia from a nearly medieval economy into an industrial powerhouse that weathered the Great Depression. In 1942, he received the same designation, the Soviet Union now an American ally. Awareness of Stalin’s crimes would come later. In the 1930s, communism, not American hegemony, looked like the future. Damon Knight, in his memoir of the Futurians and what became of them, remembered the group’s “mighty mission” to educate the science fiction fandom politically. Donald Wollheim, one of the leading lights of the group, delivered what Knight called “a fiery speech” on science fiction and revolution at a 1937 Philadelphia Fan Convention. The next year, the Futurians officially came into existence, attempting to produce a left-wing organ called Science Fiction Advance and meeting at halls loaned by the CPUSA or its Young Communist League.31 Despite their aspirations for a leftist revolution, the Futurians’ mission suffered from no real funding, no actual plan, internecine fighting, the occasional distraction of trying to create new science fiction pulp magazines or glom on to older ones, and the changed political atmosphere of postwar America in which it was supposedly better to be dead than Red. Moreover, none of the Futurians, except perhaps Frederik Pohl with his well-stocked library of socialist classics, seem to have known very much about Marxism. From the standpoint of the CPUSA, their understanding of revolutionary theory and dialectical materialism must have appeared ghastly, mixed up as it was with technocratic notions of utopians, jet packs, monsters from Venus, and spaceships. Knight perhaps sums up the nature of the Futurians when describing David Kyle, a young associate who may have been a Republican but “enjoyed playing at being Bolshevik—wearing a red hat and marching on May Day—he never took it seriously.”32 While the Futurians issued confused manifestos, alienated more than a few sci-fi fans with their stridency, and generally puttered about in lengthy meetings of motions, objections, and peculiar arguments, two men who shaped the future of horror and science fiction for the second half of the twentieth century had a much more focused agenda at the other end of the political spectrum. Rather than an international workers’ revolution, they imagined an empire guarded by science fiction weapons made reality. 8.Who Goes There? JOHN W. CAMPBELL was born in 1910, and his father abandoned the family by the 1920s after years of combat with the young boy’s peculiarly cruel mother. Indeed, when not a volcano of rage she played bizarre pranks on young John, including having her twin sister masquerade as her and then revealing the shadow play at especially embarrassing moments. This background gave Campbell a streak of paranoia as well as the need to escape into imaginative worlds that often reflected the horrors of real life. His best-known and wildly influential tale Who Goes There? became the inspiration for Howard Hawks’s The Thing from Another World (1951), reimagined by horror legend John Carpenter in his cult classic The Thing (1982). The story presented a monster from the stars who could look like anyone, deceiving you through the people you loved and trusted the most. If paranoid, Campbell was also brilliant. If brilliant, he could also be self-destructively undisciplined. Accepted to study physics at MIT, he was asked to leave during his first semester. He spent his college years at Duke University, barely passing his classes and churning out ZIP! BANG! POW! space operas that amounted to little more than Buck Rogers knockoffs. Marriage and a job no one else especially wanted made Campbell famous and more focused. In 1937, the man who wanted to write science fiction became an editor instead, taking over the pulp magazine Astounding Stories, rechristened by Campbell as Astounding Science Fiction. He quickly turned the pulp into his own bailiwick and the place where aspiring writers of the fantastic simply had to publish. Changing the title to Analog by 1960, Campbell made the monthly a finishing school for some of the greatest science fiction and horror talent of the twentieth century. Campbell himself could write sophisticated tales about alien worlds and even the longing that the idea of alien worlds could awaken. Who Goes There? channeled his own fears but also managed to tell a cracking good horror tale. It also resonated with the growing conspiratorial mood of mid-twentieth-century America. This allowed him to nurture talents like Isaac Asimov, who, as he struggled to publish his first story, visited Campbell for notes and encouragement nearly every month in 1938 even as the editor rejected each of his carefully typed tales. Robert A. Heinlein became Campbell’s earliest apprentice to reach sci-fi superstardom, a man many fans still insist is the greatest sci-fi writer of the twentieth century and who (like Asimov and Bradbury) had become a household name by the 1960s. Heinlein eventually turned from sci-fi writer into apologist for the American military juggernaut, a propagandist for a whites-only empire. Heinlein’s early life was a baffling combination of false starts and dead ends, both in his professional life and his whirligig political trajectory. Heinlein was born in 1907 and grew up in Kansas City. In his teenage years, Kansas City boomed, going from sleepy town with the mores of the American South to a major railway terminus plumped from the wealth brought by decades of a successful cattle industry. Although the city’s history into the twentieth century and up to the present offers a case study in the inevitable boom and bust cycles of American capitalism, growing up in the rough-hewn town turned mini metropolis deeply informed Heinlein’s worldview. He believed the world gave men—and with few exceptions his writing focused heavily on men—what they wrested from it. His politics would eventually show this influence. The family military tradition stretched back to the American war for independence and further shaped Heinlein. He entered the Naval Academy in 1925 with plans for a career as an officer. However, in a bit of misfortune he arguably never recovered from, Heinlein contracted tuberculosis and retired with disability pay in 1934. Heinlein became very interested in politics with the onset of the Great Depression, drawn particularly to the reformist socialism of Upton Sinclair. Known to most Americans today as the author of The Jungle, Sinclair wrote over one hundred books, many of them challenging the maleficence of the era’s industrial titans, from Henry Ford to John D. Rockefeller. Heinlein worked tirelessly for Sinclair’s effort to become the governor of California in 1934. To call Sinclair’s campaign controversial defines understatement. FDR refused his endorsement even though Sinclair ran as a Democrat. Earl Warren, future Supreme Court chief justice, described the effort to defeat Sinclair as a struggle “against radicalism and socialism.” So inspired did Heinlein become by Sinclair that he himself ran, and lost badly, for the California State Assembly. The Second World War and John W. Campbell changed Heinlein’s career path, his politics, and his worldview. Campbell began publishing his work in 1939, and Heinlein quickly became one of Astounding’s most popular and prolific writers. Isaac Asimov first met Campbell in this period, earning a look of irritation and displeasure when enthusiastically speaking of his attendance at a Futurians meeting. Asimov commented in his diary that Campbell seemed “a hidebound conservative.” Campbell’s paranoia shaded his ideas about government, world affairs, and eventually race in ways that affected Heinlein’s own drift to the right.33 World War II became the second defining event for Heinlein. Unable to serve in the military any longer after his illness, he worked instead as a civil engineer for the navy. His devotion to the cause also found expression in a 1941 novel called Sixth Column, in which an enemy Heinlein describes as PanAsians conquers the United States. A resistance movement emerges against what Heinlein insists on calling “the slantys,” who have brutally suppressed all freedoms and killed red-blooded Americans by the hundreds of thousands. The yellow peril has returned, Fu Manchu’s “hordes of Asia” are on the march, and Heinlein’s novel swims in the same cultural sludge as Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient.” Heinlein ingested all the libertarianism of Campbell. American success in the Second World War led him to add a fascination with brutal combat and military might. By the 1950s, Heinlein’s convoluted worldview can best be described as militaristic libertarianism, a challenging intellectual hobbyhorse to ride given that he had to square the idea of rugged individualism with a very powerful national security state. He managed it over decades and hundreds of thousands of words. The acceptance of America’s military power, and the communist threat, sometimes appeared allegorically in sci-fi horror films, as in the film Invaders from Mars (1953), in which science and the quick intervention of the armed forces save the United States. But the flood tide of such films sometimes ignored allegory altogether. The low-budget crowd-pleaser Project Moonbase (1953), story and screenplay by Heinlein, told of a distant future of 1970 in which a human being recently orbited earth. The astronaut responsible is the female Colonel Briteis, whose accomplishments in that future world do not protect her from egregious sexual harassment from her rival, Major Moore, who insists on calling her Colonel Bright Eyes, or her commanding general, who threatens to spank her. The film sends Moore and Briteis on a mission to the moon with a scientist who turns out to be a Russian spy. Crash-landing on the lunar surface, the Soviet agent dies, leaving Briteis and Moore stranded. But, so it turns out, that’s all to the good. Their commanding general orders them to set up “Moon Base One,” which will be a “perpetually menacing eye in the sky” to all “the enemies of freedom.” It’s Wernher von Braun’s dream of deadly orbital weapons platforms, a dream that would become one of the far right’s enduring fantasies in America. Meanwhile, the Pentagon orders the marriage of Colonel Briteis and the Major for the sake of “public opinion.” Briteis breathlessly accepts. Heinlein wrapped the film’s script by having the Pentagon promote Major Moore to brigadier general, ensuring he properly outranks his wife as they embark on their mission to protect “the safety of the free world.” In other words, raining down H-bombs on any “enemies of freedom” who might challenge American hegemony. The politics of empire appeared outside of Heinlein’s fictional worlds in his emerging activism. In 1958, he took out an ad in his local Colorado newspaper entitled “Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?” The tract—a response to his estranged friend Isaac Asimov’s involvement in the effort to convince Eisenhower to unilaterally end nuclear testing—urged Americans to accept the risks of nuclear war gladly. Heinlein insisted that even if the “willfully distorted” claims about the outcome of an atomic exchange were true, it would be preferable to “Communist enslavement.” Better irradiated than Red.34 The United States did not end unilateral testing but did enter an advantageous three-year test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Heinlein took no pleasure in this. Campbell suggested to him that his ad would do little good since, Campbell insisted, “the Common man” was in control and had no idea of “the systems he’s controlling.” Heinlein agreed and over the next decade wrote two novels that are manifestos as much as fiction. Starship Troopers appeared in 1959, imagining a future world where one can only exercise the right of suffrage if one engages in “Federal Service”—joining an interstellar military to wage a war of containment and conquest against insectoid aliens. The novel imagines a young male with little personal discipline, a little like a young Heinlein, transformed into a warrior by training and combat. The “Bugs” that the trooper and their massive fleet slaughter in droves are rather obvious representations of the American right’s understanding of the communist world—unthinking drones, they only follow their leader’s aggressive tendencies. Heinlein and his legion of fans mostly failed to notice that the starship troopers do much the same. The wildly successful novel became a model for a subgenre of militaristic science fiction, often with a right-wing slant, that burgeoned in popularity by the 1980s. Heinlein also single-handedly created the “space marine” trope that would appear everywhere from the sequel to Alien to video game franchises like Doom and Halo. Few admirers of the book and its many imitators noticed that Heinlein’s libertarian paradise where you earned your citizenship with violence looked very much like a totalitarian state. Several years later, in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Heinlein published Farnham’s Freehold (1964). The hero of the novel takes his rather nontraditional kinship group into a shelter while an atomic war rages above. As the atomic holocaust obliterates most life on earth, Farnham holds forth to his mistress, both sexy and a dutiful listener, about how the war would ensure “good genetics” since only the intelligent prepared properly while billions died aboveground. The United States was, he insists, “breeding slaves” but the war would create a “genetically purified” environment. In Heinlein’s survivalist fantasy, that’s exactly what happens. Rather than a radioactive wasteland, the new world is idyllic. Farnham’s compound becomes a refuge for “freedom loving peoples everywhere” where American flags fly and yet no government exists to collect taxes. Farnham’s Freehold shows the influence of Campbell, especially in its portrayal of Black people. The major obstacle to true paradise in Farnham’s “purified” world is a Trans-African Empire that enslaves whites and, indeed, cannibalizes them. In this white supremacist nightmare, white men are castrated, and their women used as sex slaves. We are back with Fu Manchu calling for the destruction of the white man and the “taking of his women.” The novel ends the only way it can. Farnham builds a wall around his paradise of one. Heinlein’s mentor was lost in racist fantasies. As Astounding/Analog sales declined and Campbell began to drink more heavily, he frequently used fan conventions to spew racist bile. In 1965, he proclaimed that the upheaval in Watts over police brutality proved that African Americans needed slavery in order to control their impulses. He regularly ranted against the most moderate aspects of the civil rights movement.35 An aging Campbell feared the world of the 1960s. His protégé, Heinlein, saw in a new, dangerous world the consummation of some of his darkest dreams. Heinlein would in turn stand as godfather to a new generation of writers, one in particular who would have some influence over American foreign policy. The United States didn’t have to fear the horrors from deep space. Perhaps the country could embody that horror to its enemies. By the 1960s, American military, economic, and diplomatic muscle reshaped the politics and even the geography of whole regions of the globe. The country had begun its journey to this apogee in 1917 and now its global reach fertilized poison flowers on almost every continent. But many Americans heard the weird carnival calliope tingling in the night air and sweated in fear. A letter to Time magazine, appalled at America’s use of the bomb, insisted that their own country represented “the new brutality” in the world, “a Frankenstein’s monster” committing crimes that could never be erased.36 Frankenstein’s monster offered the perfect metaphor for what the United States would next unleash. 9.Crime, Sadism, Monsters, Ghouls, Corpses ROBERT A. HEINLEIN and John W. Campbell’s vision of military might slaughtering insectoid monsters faced some ideological competition in the growing world of horror culture. Comic books, for a time after World War II, presented an alternative vision of the world and, in fact, of American history and society. Tobe Hooper and George A. Romero learned a different America from the gory panels of these comics. They met an America that didn’t deserve its imperial status, that clawed its way to power through a mound of corpses. Crime and horror comics, many of them appealing to adults as much as to children, challenged the popularity of superhero and funny animal stories that once dominated the genre. In the early fifties, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein took Entertaining Comics, popularly known as EC, in a direction they called the “new trend.” Inspired in part by 1930s and ’40s horror radio dramas like Lights Out and Inner Sanctum, they created horror comics that cast a gruesome shadow over the sunnier disposition American popular culture projected in the 1950s. In their title Crime Patrol, usually a collection of police procedurals and detective tales, they introduced stories with titles like “Return from the Grave” and “The Spectre in the Castle.” Crime Patrol became The Crypt of Terror just as their popular War Against Crime title became Vault of Horror.37 These comics mixed tales of familial discord inevitably leading to gruesome murders with stories of undead ghouls clawing out of the grave to harry the living. In the first style of story, Brooklyn-born EC artist Jack Kamen quipped that “there was no such thing as a happy couple household in EC” and remembered illustrating story after story in which couples “were always trying to bump each other off.” Such stories gleefully contradicted the postwar images of happy households, prosperous nests of male privilege, and consumerist fantasy, promulgated in advertisements, on television, and in popular magazines. The suburbs, where such fantasies allegedly took place, tamped down class conflict. For a brief period, the growing white American middle class tended to live side by side in nearly identical gimcrack homes with blue-collar workers seeming to have achieved a similar level of prosperity. In suburban sprawl, Harper’s Magazine insisted in 1953, “there is no wrong side of the tracks.” Such assertions would not age well as the muscle of American capital immiserated industrial workers and created a new economy by the 1970s. But for a time, the ability of most white suburban families to own a TV and an automobile and watch as their kids played together at backyard barbeques suggested that capitalism, not its deadly Soviet rival, had ended class conflict.38 Horror comics questioned this rosy picture. In their pages, housewives weaponized their sparkling kitchen appliances to dismember, parboil, and blend to mush their problematic patriarchs. Parents found themselves the victims of misfit children. Men dug graves for their spouses in backyards, the stink of a rotting corpse intermingling with the smell of newly mown grass. 10.Two-Fisted Tales WAS THERE a political motive behind EC? On the one hand, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein appeared to adopt a smash-and-grab style of attack on popular attitudes with no clear political agenda. In an advertisement for new writers in the February 1954 issue of Writer’s Digest, Gaines asked prospective authors to recall that “We love walking corpse stories” and tales in which “the villain tries to get away with murder—and probably does. No cops and robbers stories. Virtue doesn’t have to triumph over evil.” In a time that worked assiduously to maintain a frozen smile, it’s impossible to overemphasize how much this represented a call for anarchy. Moreover, while EC has received understandable credit (or blame) for pioneering such stories, nearly 150 different horror comic titles appeared in the early fifties from their rivals, most reveling in the same kind of brutal art and gruesome storytelling. Sometimes much more specific political critique of the American empire appeared from EC. Readers, including a new wave of adult readers, began to see the EC brand as a mark of quality and maturity—not to mention bloody images and bleak ideas hard to find in other nooks and crannies of popular culture. Horror remained the primary draw, and few companies other than EC managed to come up with a continuing stream of exceptionally weird ideas, macabre humor, and unforgettable artwork. But the work of Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood ensured EC horror would be tinctured with an even stronger dose of cultural criticism than The Crypt of Terror or Vault of Horror. A series of comics took on American imperialism past and present, often telling truer tales of American history than most of the era’s school textbooks. Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat, titles that seemed to promise childish conceptions of war, carried a radically different message. Kurtzman, who authored most of EC’s war comics, grew up in Brooklyn and the Bronx in the 1920s and ’30s. His family left Odessa after World War I. His stepfather (his father died when Kurtzman was very young) regularly read the radical Daily Worker and could be described as an active socialist at a time when the movement conceived of itself as deeply American and patriotic. Kurtzman joined the army soon after high school. Although trained as a rifleman, his talents as an artist and writer soon found him illustrating posters and camp newspapers. Wallace Wood (known to everyone in the EC bullpen as Woody) grew up in Minnesota, graduating high school near the end of World War II. He served briefly in the Merchant Marine and then as a paratrooper in the Army Airborne. In his early work for EC, horror from and in space became his first love and he excelled in imagining Lovecraftian creatures rearing their oily tentacles and oozing green slime. But Woody’s turn to war comics made horror much more visceral and, along with Kurtzman, created what can only be described as anti-war war comics. Kurtzman told an interviewer in 1972 that “all our stories really protested war.” Woody covered the panels of EC’s war comics with decaying body parts and, in one particularly haunting tale of trench warfare in the First World War, featured a rat crawling out of an empty eye socket in no-man’s-land. Even a story of the Revolutionary War, “Pell’s Point,” questioned the values of a gung ho Continental Army soldier who ends up bayonetted in a foolish and pointless show of bravado.39 Most astonishing of all, a 1953 Kurtzman/Wood tale called “Atom Bomb” followed the daily life of a Japanese family in Nagasaki. Wood drew bodies swept into a sky on fire but also the slow death of radiation sickness that followed. Kurtzman ended the story by showing a young survivor but also recording the grim statistics of the blast.40 This comic masterpiece appeared at a time when very few Americans understood the consequences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The U.S. government made a full-throated effort to squelch information about the death toll of the bomb and the effects of radiation sickness. John Hersey’s book had already passed out of the American consciousness, and in fact historian Paul Boyer suggests its account may have allowed readers to face the horror of the A-bomb and then literally “close the book on that episode.”41 EC encouraged readers young and old to reopen the black book of American crimes. Both their war and horror lines joined in a full-frontal assault on the values and assumptions of white Americans in the 1950s. Why did anyone want to read an attack on their values? David Hajdu has suggested that the success of EC emerged out of the fear of the times. The empty-eyed corpses that shambled from panic to panel in EC and their competition “could not have been far removed from the readers’ mental pictures of their own fate in the wake of the nuclear holocaust.” Maybe at least some Americans were terrified of what their values might do to them and the world.42 Not surprisingly, the efforts of EC and its artists and writers attracted plenty of unwanted attention. The FBI briefly investigated EC in the final year of the Korean War. An April 29, 1952, memo from Hoover’s office suggested that the government might render a charge of sedition against Gaines and even specific artists. EC comics, the memo read, “tend to discredit the army and undermine troop morale.”43 Other comic publishers faced similar scrutiny, none more than Lev Gleason of Lev Gleason Publications. His company’s series Crime Doesn’t Pay seemed to promise a moral message in its very title. It told stories from the perspective of criminals themselves. Although Gleason could point to the fact that the characters in these books did face the consequences of their actions in the final panels, the stories tended to build sympathy for bank robbers and crime lords in a fashion not dissimilar from gangster pictures of the thirties such as The Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Gleason also faced intense personal scrutiny from the FBI, who closely monitored his activities during World War II. In December of 1943, Hoover sent a memo to the special agent in charge of the New York bureau ordering the office to “immediately open a case” on Gleason that would “develop fully all information on his Communist activities.” Gleason does not seem to have ever been a member of the CPUSA, though he certainly worked with communists. The FBI investigation focused on three matters in particular: Gleason and his wife traveled to Mexico City for a meeting of an organization devoted to aiding refugees of the Spanish Civil War. He attended meetings of the left-wing Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. Most damning, from the perspective of Hoover’s men in black, Gleason wrote a letter to the editor of the Newcastle News that praised “our ally” the Soviet Union during World War II at a time when, in fact, the Soviet Union was our ally.44 The FBI lost interest in the investigation, possibly because heavier thunderheads emerged over the comics industry by 1953. A national panic developed over comics in the aftermath of the brutal but indecisive Korean War. Students of folklore describe such moments as a moral panic, a widespread sense that some kind of poisonous conspiracy planned to subvert society. A moral panic has far sharper incisors than what’s sometimes called an urban legend. A panic may begin with the sharing of baseless stories told as personal anecdotes. But it ends with legal and political authorities taking such stories seriously and announcing to the public that some insidious danger threatens the very foundations of national life. The great comic book scare had numerous sources in the 1950s. The actual content, both imagery and text, played more of a role than the problematic idea of “mass hysteria.” EC and their many imitators really did challenge some of the basic values of America’s dominant culture; in the lurid beauty of their pages, American family life became an abattoir, with spouses plotting each other’s demise while teenage rebellion took the form of homicide. The angry dead refused to stay in their graves, a disturbing image at any time but particularly after a half century of corpses being produced by global war. Artists suggested that war and the military represented pointless bloodletting and institutionalized sadism. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee led an investigation of possible links between what the era called “juvenile delinquency” and comics. His committee soon moved on to an investigation of organized crime for which he became famous. But the grassroots hand-wringing of parents, clergy, and civic leaders continued, their fears blooming an angry red. Parochial schools and PTAs held public burnings of comics, and now and again parents took it upon themselves to purify their households of the comic scourge. Some of these burnings involved students allegedly gathering up offensive comics themselves, although David Hajdu’s interviews with participants at several of these local events revealed that many of the students never read the comics anyway, while some may have developed an interest in them while stoking the bonfires. At a Catholic high school in New Jersey, one alum remembered years later that as they stacked comics for incineration, a pile developed of “jungle books, with their covers of heroines swinging from vines in leopard-skin bikinis.” That particular pile disappeared, saved from the conflagration by “several of the young crusaders” who hid it “under a step in the boys’ lavatory.”45 The war against comics coalesced at the national level in a series of Senate hearings culminating in the industry creating their own Comics Code. EC refused to comply, only to find they’d been abandoned. They would turn to the magazine format with many in their stable of artists, like Wally Wood, working for companies that created horror magazines like Creepy and Eerie to continue the EC tradition. The size and the amount of text in the new magazines allowed them to operate safely outside the Comics Code. Twenty-six publishers assented to the code and incorporated the Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) to administer its standards. Charles F. Murphy, a judge with a particular concern for the alleged outbreak of juvenile delinquency, headed the association. Most publishers felt they could keep sales up by sanitizing their comics while also destroying competitors who essentially depended on crime and horror fantasy. In a move that clearly suggested this mercenary motive, one of the first provisions of the new code banned the use of even the words horror and terror. The German émigré Fredric Wertham has usually been presented as the villain behind the death of EC’s glory days. His November 1953 Ladies’ Home Journal article “What Parents Don’t Know About Comic Books” appeared to lend scientific justification for parental anxiety. The book born from his somewhat limited reading of comics bore the dangerously sensationalist title Seduction of the Innocent. Wertham’s book appeared at a time when local police produced public service announcements like the Inglewood, California, police department’s “Boys Beware,” which insisted in the ugliest of terms that gay men are by definition sexual predators. Wertham’s willingness to tap into those dark energies remains unforgivable, particularly since it seems his own celebrity became his driving motivation as national fame beckoned.46 However, Wertham himself remains a complicated figure. He did not favor complete censorship of comics and his reputation as the incarnation of a killjoy has overshadowed his work on, for example, the Brown v. Board of Education case the same year he released Seduction of the Innocent. His work on Brown grew in part from the free psychiatric clinic he ran for African Americans in New York City, at a time when the Black community continued to be denied any access to mental health care beyond segregated and often brutal institutionalization. Influenced to some degree by the Frankfurt School’s critique of popular culture, he saw comics and television as narcotics for the masses, especially dangerous to the young.47 Wertham saved his harshest words for comics that related in any way to the supernatural. They were, he insisted, “horror, crime, sadism, monsters, ghouls, corpses dead and alive . . .” He unfortunately could not see that the best of these tales mirrored many of his own concerns over social justice and American apathy. In the many stories of nonconformist adolescents that peopled the pages of Vault and Crypt, parents are repeatedly shown as desensitized by exhausting work, television, and their afternoon martinis. EC even broached the topic of American racism at a moment when most white readers would have been unaware of a struggle for racial justice or its origins in the Civil War and Reconstruction era. The final comic published by the company in February of 1956, an issue of Incredible Science Fiction, featured a story called “Judgment Day!” in which a human astronaut visits a planet of orange automata that has long been at war with blue automata. The orange mechanicals, we learn, once enslaved their blue counterparts. The astronaut decides the planet has not advanced enough beyond the most savage prejudices to join an intergalactic alliance. As he blasts off to return to earth, he removes his helmet to reveal that he is an African American, a not-so-subtle note to the reader about the nature of the allegory they just read. The very moderate liberal appeal to tolerance in a science fiction tale proved too much for the CMAA. When Feldstein submitted the story for approval, Judge Murphy leaned back in his heavy leather chair and looked gimlet-eyed at the editor. “You can’t have a Negro,” Murphy declared flatly. Feldstein, genuinely shocked, asked what part of the Comics Code forbid the representation of Black people. Murphy said he had the authority to forbid it. Feldstein walked out. Back at the EC bullpen, the news made Gaines something more than furious. He was finished with comics. He let Murphy know that he planned to hold a press conference describing the effort to censor “Judgment Day!” and tell anyone who would listen that the Comics Code apparently had a deeply racist agenda. Murphy called Gaines and announced a sudden change of heart, but he bizarrely suggested that the final panel should be fine as long as the artist removed the beads of sweat popping from the character’s forehead. Apparently, Murphy considered an African American man sweating in a comic too suggestive. “Fuck you,” Gaines said, and slammed down the phone.48 EC published the story with only one change. Feldstein called attention to the controversial perspiration by adding to the text that “the instrument lights [of the spaceship] made the beads of perspiration on his dark skin twinkle like distant stars.” Gaines had largely been right when he suggested that the Comics Code allowed for racist caricature. In fact, white supremacist fantasies, ignored by the conservative critics of comics, flourished in “jungle adventure” stories not dissimilar from the mad-scientist-zombie-jungle-horror films in the forties, fifties, and sixties (explored in the next section of this book). But Wertham is not guilty by association. Part of his critique of comics in general, if not EC in particular, concerned how “jungle adventure” tales affected the self-esteem of Black children and encouraged a rancid racism in their white counterparts.49 William W. Savage Jr. explained the racist assumptions of this comic genre well when he described, in his wonderfully researched and written Commies, Cowboys, and Jungle Queens: Comic Books and America, 1945–1954, the “jungle lords and ladies” that all imitated Tarzan in stories that regarded Black people as “a form of fauna” not so different from “lions, panthers, snakes, [and] elephants.”50 The incredibly creative and perhaps surprisingly socially conscious horror and crime comics created some interesting work. Fans of EC, for example, included what would become a new generation of horror film directors who would completely reimagine how to tell tales of terror in a darkened theater. George A. Romero even drew on the visual style of comics, noting how they had influenced the way he shot and edited Dawn of the Dead.51 Perhaps Wertham was correct that comic creators engaged in a spree of “horror, crime, sadism, monsters.” What he missed is that such stories grew directly out of the tortured history of the nation. By the 1960s, more and more Americans would come to agree with Malcolm X, and EC comics, that they’d been sold an “American dream” but found themselves in an “American nightmare.”",

      "title": "1.Black Magic Island",
      "content": "1.Black Magic Island WHITE ZOMBIE (1932) is all atmosphere. It’s a film of shadow, jungle, and cemeteries, the ground itself extruding fog and dread. The undead menacingly stumble in the tropical night, their frightening cadence moving in disturbing rhythm with the drums from the blind, hot darkness. Not everyone saw its charms. Mocking the film in a July 1932 review, a reviewer for The New York Times snarked that “Necromancers waved their sinister hands from the screen of the Rivoli yesterday and tried to hypnotize blondes into killing their boyfriends. A legion of individuals, with deceased minds but alert bodies, threw butlers into subterranean streams.”1 It may have sounded ludicrous, but the flick had something going for it. Bela Lugosi played Murder Legendre, a sorcerer who knows the secrets of the dead and the undead. His role in the low-budget effort seemed an odd choice for the actor, fresh off the box office bonanza of Dracula. Lugosi’s role in the film may seem inexplicable, but the film’s subject could not have been more relevant. The generation born at the turn of the twentieth century held an enormous interest in Haiti since, by 1932, the United States had occupied the country for seventeen years. The 1915 invasion of Haiti by American troops could have been predicted by anyone who watched the trajectory of American power. Haiti seemed predestined to attract American attention. After its revolution in the 1790s, it became the first republic of African peoples in the new world. This meant, as historian Raphael Dalleo wrote in his book American Imperialism’s Undead, that “Haiti represented the idea that black people could be agents of world history.” White America, North and South, trembled at Haiti’s example during the antebellum slave regime. Following the Civil War, as slavery ended but segregation took its place, Haiti remained a bothersome symbol to a country whose mainstream politicians regularly and openly spoke of America as “a white man’s country.”2 Although the very existence of Haiti rankled many Americans, other variables ultimately led to the invasion and occupation. The administration of Woodrow Wilson agreed with American corporate interests that the island, long closed to the incursion of the American market, had to be seized. U.S. corporate interests shuddered at a provision in the Haitian constitution forbidding foreigners from owning land, an assertion of independence galling to the values of global piracy. The City Bank of New York, now the financial conglomerate Citigroup, demanded the deletion of this provision to facilitate the building of a railroad. The U.S. Marines promptly expropriated the land of farmers, and much of Haiti became a plantation economy in the 1920s.3 White Zombie probed Americans’ fears about Haiti and legitimated them. The long-suffering country became a world of sorcery and superstition during the occupation. The best-selling 1929 book The Magic Island by William Seabrook described the mélange of African, Arawak, and European traditions called Vodun (or “spirit” in the African Fon and Ewe languages) as a wicked necromancy that demanded the drinking of blood and resurrected the dead as shambling zombies. In 1927, the forty-three-year-old Seabrook had published a tale of his travels in the Middle East that emphasized the allegedly exotic and uncanny nature of the region carved up by Britain, France, and the United States after the Great War. He went to Haiti to do some similar ideological work, at times criticizing the attitudes of Marine officers but also emphasizing the alleged “economic prosperity and political peace” brought by “our own benevolent American protectorate.” The supposedly wicked nature of Vodun ultimately justified the American seizure of the island. Although his attitudes about the tradition are complicated (he could describe the “beauty” of a Vodun ceremony), Seabrook ultimately decided to use adjectives like monstrous, obscene, or forbidding to seduce the American reader eager to hear of a black magic island. Haiti as a country dominated by “voodoo” quickly became a standard part of the American horror tradition. Readers of horror pulps such as Weird Tales, best-known today as the outlet for the work of H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, encountered stories like the December 1924 tale “Voodoo.” Written by Arthur J. Burks, a marine during the early part of the occupation, the story reads like a fictional travelogue in which an American soldier rescues his buddy from “a devilish ceremony.” Burks’s version of Vodun did not include zombies but described other diabolical features like “a priestess of the serpent” planning to sacrifice a teenaged girl. In August of 1925, Burks wrote another occult tale set in Haiti called “Black Medicine,” which presented the islanders as worshippers of a demonic green serpent.4 The pedigree of White Zombie, like much in the American horror tradition, lay in the emergence of the United States as a postwar global colossus. Frightful and titillating to white audiences, it played to American fascination with the peoples it ruled. It also legitimized that rule by telling white America it had to suppress the evils lurking in the night. White Zombie borrows from themes found in the 1930s golden age of horror. There’s a bit of the “old dark house” concept, only it’s an old dark plantation in the jungle rather than a mansion on a lonely moor suffering through another dark and stormy night. A young couple, Madeleine and Neil, are set to marry in the Caribbean because the hopeful husband works at “the Bank of Port Au Prince,” a notable theme given the role of American banking interests in the invasion of Haiti. The plantation owner desires the bride-to-be and enlists the aid of Legendre the zombie master. Legendre poisons Madeleine on her wedding night only to bring her back as the slave of the plantation owner. Advertising for the film promised audiences that the heroine (played by beauty Madge Bellamy) would have to “perform his every desire.” Sadly, for audiences hoping for salacious material, they only got to see Bellamy play the piano with a thousand-yard stare. Filmed just before the Motion Picture Production Code went into effect, the film does show the audience her compelling figure while wiggling into her trousseau. As native women help with her voluminous undergarments, we see her nearly weep with horror when she hears drums in the night. By today’s standards, the scene is more than modest but certainly offered strong sauce for 1932. The sexual subtext remains throughout and the implications of a white blonde being a physical and mental captive in Haiti are allowed to smolder. In early notices, Lugosi’s eyes and magical grip appear abstracted in a sea of jungle green on a poster that promises “with these zombie eyes he rendered her powerless.” After Madeleine’s undeath, the wronged husband pines away for the return of his blonde, but on learning from a sympathetic missionary that she may have become a zombie and “fallen into the hands of natives,” he drunkenly raves, “not that . . . better death than that!” White Zombie gave viewers all manner of bewildering messages about Haiti. On the one hand, it showed the exploitation of the labor of native peoples. One of the most intriguing set pieces takes place in a sugarcane mill. Zombified workers drudge bundles of cane to the top of a catwalk to drop into the mill’s churning blades. Moving in a stolid trance, the undead look more or less like any set of workers toiling under the burdens of plantation labor . . . or of underpaid, disregarded “free” labor. The film even evokes the history of slavery on the island and the new world more generally. A missionary who befriends the unlucky couple makes the historically dubious claim that the pharmaceutical magic necessary for making a zombie came “from Africa” and, farther back, “civilizations old when Egypt was young.” Americans are lights of civilization and morality. “Haiti is full of nonsense and superstition,” insists the missionary, who wants to defeat Legendre’s plan so that he can bring the light of truth to the island he portrays as lousy with “witch doctors.” White audiences left Lugosi’s new hit with their sense of racial superiority intact. This would have been true whether they walked out of the theater with the ugly racist porn of a white woman captive to native desires on their mind or the sense that the uncivilized native peoples of the world needed America’s help to escape “nonsense and superstition.” In fact, by 1932, Americans had believed this about the Caribbean, Latin America, and much of the Pacific world for decades. 2.Jungle Fever THE UNITED States opened the twentieth century by taking on the decayed Spanish empire in Cuba and annexing the Hawaiian Islands. President William McKinley baldly asserted that that United States needed the latter for a military base. Toppling Spanish control over Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines would create more complex problems. In order to build a new, more fluid imperial style, American leadership developed patterns of rhetoric, control, and explosive violence used throughout the century. Cuban leaders, who fought against Spanish rule for decades, looked uneasily at American occupation forces even as they hoped for the best. They would be deeply disappointed. In 1901, an army appropriations bill in Congress came tainted with poison for Cuban democracy. The Platt Amendment, inserted into the new Cuban constitution at gunpoint, allowed the United States a laundry list of privileges on the enormous island and capped them all by giving the United States the right to intervene in the country’s affairs at any time. Cuba’s economy belonged to American corporations for sixty years and the people would be ruled by a series of dictators selected by the United States.5 The Philippines, an enormous archipelago of nearly eight thousand separate islands, proved more challenging to dominate. After winning freedom from the Spanish, Filipino insurgents continued the fight for years against American forces that refused to end their occupation. American troops killed thousands of Filipino fighters and civilians caught in the crossfire. American forces introduced a torture method later known as waterboarding and even more egregious forms of torture that included pumping seawater into the veins of suspected insurgents. The United States came to rule the Philippines but never annexed it outright and granted the country limited independence in 1946, leaving behind military bases and handpicked pro-American dictators. The brutal experiment in the Philippines allowed American leaders to construct a sense of American nationalism with clear borders while extending economic and military power with a limitless circumference. American leaders at home had their eyes on markets. Moreover, politicians proved less wary of talking in terms of empire than they would later in the twentieth century. President McKinley spoke of a civilizing and Christianizing mission, but in the Senate, Henry Cabot Lodge simply described the need for military bases that would open the promising market of China and “the far East” more generally. White supremacy at home became the justification for intervention abroad. At the beginning of the twentieth century, state laws ignored the Fifteenth Amendment and part of the legacy of the American Civil War by disenfranchising African Americans. Beginning in 1876, accusations of voter fraud became the bludgeon to use against the Black vote. Meanwhile, the country accepted de facto and de jure segregation of all public life and services with the blessing of the Supreme Court. American soldiers in the Philippines used racist epithets with roots in American slavery to describe the islands’ peoples alongside a new phrase with uncertain origin, gugus. Scholars have suggested it’s a mocking term for a language the American invaders did not understand or perhaps a word for sex workers on the islands.6 Gugu became the gruesome word gook, a dehumanizing term that has followed the American flag all over the globe. By 1920, during the occupation of Haiti, a reporter for The Nation noted that American troops called the Haitians this term and treated them “with every variety of contempt, insult, and brutality.” He described how American officers spoke of trips to the island’s interior to, in the marines’ words, “bump off gooks” with comparisons made to duck hunting. The racist term reappeared in the Korean War and, most infamously, the Vietnam War.7 White supremacy at home shaped foreign policy abroad. Though remembered in many American history textbooks as an idealist, Woodrow Wilson took the United States into the Great War, now generally referred to as World War I, with a mission of empire building grounded in his own conception of white supremacy. A Southerner by birth, Wilson famously praised the deeply racist film The Birth of a Nation (1915) and remained a defender of Jim Crow segregation throughout his life. Wilson’s attitude toward African Americans extended not only to Haitians but to the Mexican people as well. The Wilson administration staged several “interventions” and “expeditions” into the nation aflame with revolutionary fervor, allegedly as a “punitive” response to the raids of Pancho Villa along the New Mexico–Texas border. John J. Pershing, who pursued Geronimo in 1886 and savaged the Filipino insurgents, attempted and failed to capture Villa. Two years later, Wilson appointed Pershing to lead American forces in the Great War. Pershing’s careless use of American lives led to catastrophic losses given the United States actively participated in the global war for only a few months. The effects of early American forays into imperial conquest remain with us. Haiti never recovered from its years of occupation and would face future American invasions and occupations. White anger simmered at Mexico and Mexican Americans, a hatred of the conquered by the conqueror. The anger became explosive violence. Lynch mobs terrorized the Tejano community from 1916 into the 1920s. The Texas state government effectively disenfranchised all Latinos through poll taxes, the same method used to take ballots away from African Americans in much of the South. One Texas rancher called for “detention camps along the border” and the building of infrastructure to allow the American military ingress into Mexico. Historian Stephen Hahn estimates that several thousand Tejanos died at the hands of white mobs, the police, and the military in the years after the Pershing invasion.8 Today, the United States maintains a military presence, and allows paramilitary vigilantes to operate, along the border with Mexico, protecting the territory seized from the country in the nineteenth century. In 2019, in Texas alone, the United States held 14,500 people in precisely the kind of concentration camps called for in the 1910s. Despite this legacy, Wilson’s rhetoric about “self-determination” in his “Fourteen Points” (Georges Clemenceau quipped that “The good Lord had only ten!”) burnished his image as an early globalist. Behind the scenes, the American government made clear its real intent. Wilson’s secretary of state, Robert Lansing, insisted that the language of self-determination did not apply to “races, peoples or communities whose state of barbarism or ignorance deprive them of the capacity to choose intelligently their political affiliations.” The lands with “devilish ceremonies” would remain subject to the American world order. White Zombie suggested a horrifying paradox, one that American military and economic power would never allow. The phrase banana republic still makes the rounds, even used since the eighties as the theme for a clothing store catering to youthful, middlebrow tastes. It’s meant to evoke a tropical dictatorship, absurdly corrupt and laughably underdeveloped. While used by most Americans to express disdain for foreign institutions, the phrase first appeared as an epithet for American maleficence in Central America. O. Henry in his 1904 short story “The Admiral” first used the term in relation to Honduras. In that country, the New York/Boston–based United Fruit Company acquired vast lands and ownership of most of the railways and ports. In 1911, the company used its own funds to pay for a coup that installed a dictator more amenable to United Fruit’s neocolonial policy. Zombie republics might be a better descriptor for many of the countries where American corporate and military power exercised control. Stripped of economic resources and moving at the direction of United States–supported puppet dictators, they represented decayed versions of hopes for autonomy and independence, the rotting corpses of colonial states subject to American necromancy. 3.Bombs and Movies GERMAN THINKERS forced to emigrate to the United States from Nazi Germany in the thirties, particularly philosophers and social critics like Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, worried that an American equivalent of European fascism could easily emerge in their new homeland. They feared that, as in Weimar Germany, the crass nature of American pop culture softened up the brain for fascism. “Automobiles, bombs, and movies,” they wrote, all did their part in assuring mainstream America that the concept of an American way of life was not a belief but just common sense. Adorno and his colleagues are usually loosely grouped together as the Frankfurt School, named after the original site of their research institute in Frankfurt, Germany. In a bleak irony, the institute for Marxist studies established by primarily Jewish thinkers there became the home of Germany’s major Zyklon B manufacturing plants. The reputation of the Frankfurt School has been fusty and fraught. They not only seemed like a squad for the fun police in their distaste for popular culture, but sometimes as the reactionaries they certainly were not. Adorno, for example, critiqued the use of rock music in anti-war protests during the 1960s in such a way that he appeared to criticize the idea of protest itself. Now and again, they just seemed absurd, as when Adorno wondered aloud about the fascist proclivities of escalators—one had to surrender one’s autonomy to ride one, after all. It did not help their reputation with the sixties generation, or later generations, that Adorno and his colleagues often chose to be abstruse and abstract when they could have easily explained. More recently, scholars and a wider literary culture have decided the fussy Frankfurt School might have been on to something after all. Alex Ross, a contemporary writer for the New Yorker fascinated with this band of émigré culture critics, wrote that Adorno would have looked grimly at how the twenty-first century proved him right. In a prescient warning in 2014, Ross wrote that much of our social media landscape looks very much like an Adornoesque nightmare. “Technology conspires with populism,” he suggested, “to create an ideologically vacant dictatorship of likes.” In 2016, Stuart Jeffries, author of a collective biography of the Frankfurt School critics, told Vox that Trump speaks in a “stream-of-consciousness gibberish” free of “thought” and “historical memory.” Jeffries sees him as a product of exactly what Adorno feared. He folded “pop entertainment into politics” and created a “spectacle” that requires nothing but attention to thrive.9 Long before the “dictatorship of likes,” small genre films did shape how white America looked at the rest of the world. While empire dared not speak its name since the early years of the twentieth century, horror films often relentlessly hammered home its racist logic. In everyday conversation, we use the term ideology to mean something like “a political position held to with some conviction.” Since the nineteenth century, its denotative meaning has been a set of ideas that everything from media to market values asks us to accept as “common sense” or “the way things are.” The most ideological documents are precisely those we don’t perceive as ideological . . . maybe even those it seems laughable to perceive as such. What works better than an advertisement that makes fun of advertising, or a film that manages us with the camera’s privileged point of view? Horror in American culture has been more than a catharsis, more than a reflection of anxieties, more than the need to test the limits of our fears. It has played an integral role in what Adorno called “the culture industry.” The manufacture of dark images of the allegedly primitive corners of the earth has been a thrumming cog in the machine of empire. If we take the best of the Frankfurt School at its word, the horror film proved a necessary element in the American public’s acceptance of, and even entertainment through, America’s imperial ambitions. Warning in 1933 about the popularity of King Kong, a film that became something of an archetype for films that combined horror with the alleged primitivism of most of the world, Adorno described it as a tale of Americans who, without realizing it, agreed to be cast as “walk-on parts in a monster documentary.” 4.Welcome (Back) to the Jungle IN 1941, just as the United States entered the Second World War, King of the Zombies attempted to tell a story of rough-and-ready agents of the OSS (forerunner to the CIA) combating an unnamed foreign government on a Caribbean island “somewhere between Puerto Rico and Cuba.” This seems an absurdly obtuse reference to Haiti. But in truth it’s scripted as a nonspecific anywhere, the savage jungle of imperial imagination. Crash-landing on the island, the two white agents and their African American valet, Jefferson Jackson, find a plantation house where Dr. Sangre (“Dr. Blood”) pretends to be a refugee from Nazi-controlled Vienna. In fact, Sangre blends science and an alliance with a “voodoo priestess” in a nefarious scheme that involves kidnapping a rear admiral of a foreign nation and seizing the Panama Canal, one of the early twentieth-century outposts of American imperial power. Sangre’s dastardly plot is to use a “voodoo ceremony” and his army of zombies to force the captive admiral to reveal the “canal zone defenses” for “his government.” Most of the American audience likely assumed the alleged Austrian refugee worked for Hitler but, depending on where they fell on the political spectrum, might have placed him in the employ of Stalin. King of the Zombies makes full use of racist imagery that delighted and frightened white audiences all at once. Dr. Sangre’s zombies are “big black ones,” as an OSS agent affirms. Later in the film, an agent calls them Sangre’s “ape men.” Meanwhile the accomplished Black humorist Mantan Moreland embodied the American stereotype of African American men with Jefferson Jackson, complete with malapropisms and a perpetually pop-eyed expression. Moreland remains one of the great forgotten talents of midcentury Hollywood, his reputation obscured by the racist cartoons he was forced to pantomime if he wanted to work at all.10 King of the Zombies shows an important side of horror science fiction too often ignored in the forties and fifties. It’s easy to see the metaphor for communist invasion and infiltration in the flying saucers flitting about the screens of the era. But there’s another side to the horror culture of World War II and the decades that followed. Americans obsessed over invasion, but it was not only communist powers coming to American shores. Filmmakers found the public hungry for various kinds of colonial horror, films in which representatives of white civilization are the invaders in imagined Latin Americas and Africas, meeting with the “superstition” of “primitives” that turns out to be all too real. Americans did not even have to turn to film to get an entrée of primitivism matched with horror. At the 1939 New York World’s Fair in Flushing, the “South Seas” exhibit offered a “zombie-themed restaurant,” showing once again the way the geographies of monster and empire could collapse into one another. The theme of racism and American power appeared at the fair in the form of African Americans portraying natives in the fair’s “Jungleland” and minstrel singers like Bill “Bojangles” Robinson performing. These representations of the atavistic subjects of the American empire becomes all the more striking when considering the 1939 fair’s celebration of “The World of Tomorrow.”11 These are entertainments aimed at the perpetually aggrieved empire. White America imagined itself becoming the victim of an invasion from beyond, but it also listened to stories of how it could become the victim of people of color abroad. Jungle horror legitimized racism at home and offered a rationale for an aggressive foreign policy, the creation of zombie republics. Bride of the Gorilla (1951) takes place in what appears to be Dutch Guiana (now Surinam) in Latin America. But the contradictory messages the audience had to read in the geography of the B-movie tell us much about Cold War America’s understanding of the world and its place in it. The mix of characters the film presented as foreign, even though they are in their homeland, are represented as Asian, other times African, and only vaguely Latin American. The only real geography is a nondescript “jungle” that narrator Lon Chaney Jr. describes as “lush, green . . . as old as time” and willing to “[take] the law into its own hands.” It’s a new frontier, pilgrim. Curt Siodmak, émigré (and escapee) from Hitler’s Germany, wrote the screenplay. A successful novelist by the fifties, Siodmak is also known for his better-than-it had-to-be script for The Wolf Man. Contending with much lower production values and a sillier plot, Bride of the Gorilla managed to be somewhat literate even with its racist assumption that the non-white peoples of the globe represented a malignant threat to American power. The Van Gelder estate becomes the “old dark plantation” in Bride of the Gorilla. We’re never told the cash crop or where the story takes place. The audience only knows it’s somewhere all white people agree is not in the civilized world. The jungle itself becomes a monstrous, mysterious entity working its will through a witch doctor who witnesses the white overseer murder the plantation owner. Adultery and subsequent marriage to the plantation mistress are the crimes that the jungle unleashes its wrath against, not the colonial economy or the overseer’s sexual exploitation of Indigenous people shown early in the film. A white man has taken a wealthier white man’s woman and the punishment will be . . . becoming black and then turning into a primate. The jungle takes away his whiteness and then makes him something inhuman. It’s the threat implied in the phrase white zombie in another form. Konga (1961) followed a similar heavily racialized theme. The audience receives a more exact geography this time: the dangerous monster comes from Africa, specifically Uganda. When Konga appeared, the British protectorate smoldered with rising nationalist sentiment that some in the United States, nearly inevitably, connected with socialism. British rule had been somewhat benign in Uganda. However, benign in an imperial context meant that indentured servanthood rather than genocide became the fate of many of the Indigenous peoples. Discontent roiled the country, which won its independence in 1962. In Konga, the colonies came home. A mad scientist has spent a year “with friendly natives” where he met the omnipresent “witch doctor,” who taught him how to use “seeds to control his subjects.” Konga the chimp comes home to London and transforms into Konga the monster, rampaging through the city like his obvious giant ape ancestor King Kong. Colonial independence meant monsters at home. The United States would, a few years after Uganda’s independence, endorse British and Israeli intelligence efforts to install Idi Amin. In the 1970s, the CIA helped supply him with arms. A bit like Konga, the brutal regime in Uganda would be a joint British and American production.12 But did anyone really take away these kinds of political messages from low-budget horror films? They were only movies, right? Horror films told audiences that if they left the United States for anywhere but Europe, they’d find it really was a jungle out there. Sitting, maybe giggling, through King of the Zombies and Bride of the Gorilla, shoes sticky on the popcorn-butter-splattered floor, white audiences could sit back and learn why theirs was just the best nation ever. The rest of the world seemed filled with superstition and sorcerers, mad scientists and their monsters. The non-white world probably needed an invasion, a first strike. Corporate and political interests helped produce the real “monster documentary.” In Guatemala, next door to the earlier zombie republic of Honduras, United Fruit even seized control of the postal service to ensure fast delivery of their product. The company would eventually own three and a half million acres in Central America and the Caribbean. Most of this land underwent a process best described as agricultural fracking, a transformation of small holdings into banana and sugarcane plantations and vast tracts of land for railroads and ports to ensure Americans received a steady supply of fresh bananas. In the second half of the twentieth century, United Fruit, today rebranded as Chiquita Brands International, could count on American foreign policy to conform to its designs. In the 1950s, Eisenhower’s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, best known for his streetfighter style of anti-communism, performed legal work for United Fruit. So did his brother, CIA Director Allen Dulles. In 1954, the CIA orchestrated a coup against the government of Jacobo Árbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala, when he nationalized almost half of United Fruit’s holdings as part of his plans for agrarian reform. The Dulles brothers saw Árbenz as a crypto-communist with ties to Moscow even though their own intelligence reports concluded no such thing. The CIA trained a small army of mercenaries and funneled arms through Honduras and Nicaragua, right-wing dictatorships dependent on the United States. Bombing runs by CIA pilots convinced Guatemalans and their president they would face a full-scale invasion by the United States. America’s clandestine service further created chaos in the country by suggesting the occurrence of an alien invasion. Planting false tales of all kinds and then taking over a shortwave radio station, CIA operatives warned of flying saucer sightings and plans by the government to close churches and force everyone to worship Stalin. Bombing and assassinations proved even more convincing, of course, though clearly some CIA field agents had been listening to Walter Bedell Smith when he suggested the use of space invaders for psychological warfare. CIA black ops specialist E. Howard Hunt said frankly that the United States wanted “a terror campaign” and compared the work done in Guatemala positively to the fear inspired by Nazi Stuka bombers over Poland.13 The terror campaign worked. Árbenz chose to step down and go into exile and a military junta headed by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas seized control of the country, and thus did the United States. The United Fruit Company benefitted enormously from the coup, again showing the degree to which capitalism drove the American empire. In fact, the New Orleans–based corporation helped finance the effort. A CIA cable two years before the government’s overthrow assured the Pentagon that “[redacted] officials of the United Fruit Company have promised financial aid. [Redacted] and Castillo met in Baton Rouge, LA in December . . . [Redacted] will get money in Honduras and deliver it to Castillo in that country.”14 If the seizure of the country by the right-wing dictatorship proved a boon for United Fruit and its stockholders, a curse fell on the people of Guatemala. Outlawing labor unions and indeed any effort by campesinos to organize politically represented the least of the regime’s crimes. Castillo imprisoned tens of thousands of people for “communist sympathies,” all at the advice of Allen Dulles. The resulting Guatemalan Civil War resulted in the deaths of two hundred thousand civilians over several decades, years in which the U.S. government provided the regime with hundreds of millions of dollars.15 The United States sought to perfect the small-footprint empire. Why occupy a country and annex territory when covert ops, corporate interest, off-the-books murders, and proxy armies could install American assets as dictators? The year before the intervention in Guatemala, an American-led coup in Iran overthrew the elected prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq because he favored the nationalization of foreign oil interests. Placing the unpopular Reza Shah Pahlavi on the throne, the CIA and U.S. special forces turned the republic into a monarchical police state.16 Films shaped American conceptions about Latin America, the nature of the Cold War, white supremacy, and the prerogatives of the United States around the world. It is hard not to see the kind of soft power even B-movies could exercise on public opinion and its underlying attitudes. In fact, outside of a few slapstick comedies that made light of mustachioed generals ruling “banana republics,” Americans saw no real representations of Latin America and the Caribbean other than horror. Moviegoers had their choice of bizarrely lighthearted romps concerned with corruption and military dictatorship in the tropics (with, of course, no hint that the United States funded and armed these regimes) or frightening portrayals of exotic jungles of temptation and terror where the king of the zombies, ancient curses, and threats to white women and white manhood waited. Send in the marines, somebody. America’s vast colonial undertaking in the twentieth century bundled together packet injections of geopolitical ambition, folklore, rumor legends, and films to shape the acceptance of the empire. Films and bombs, as the Frankfurt School argued, kept the United States on its imperial course while the American people played their walk-on parts in a monster doc. 5.Night(s) of the Living Dead ERIC BLAIR, known to the world as George Orwell, sat in his cabin on the isolated Scottish isle of Jura. The chill of the Hebrides wind competed with the smoky warmth of burning peat in the fireplace. Orwell scrawled out his final and most famous work, Ninety Eighty-Four: A Novel, usually published today as 1984. Right-wing libertarians have sometimes seized on the book as a critique of activist government, or in their rhetoric “the nanny state.” In fact, Orwell himself held to what we would label democratic socialism and admired communist thinker Leon Trotsky. Killed by a Stalinist assassin in Mexico in 1940, Trotsky appeared as a revolutionary betrayed by authoritarians in both Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell joined a Trotskyite brigade during the Spanish Civil War as part of the effort to defeat Francisco Franco’s fascist legions. Orwell died in 1950, tubercular and beset with pneumonia and strep he apparently contracted on an ill-considered boat trip in the frigid waters of the Inner Hebrides. His predications of a despotic future served as a critique of Stalinism in his own time even as they effectively predicted the power of surveillance and lack of privacy of our contemporary moment. He also accurately predicted every superpower’s need for an enemy. Certainly between 1941 and 1975, the idea first presented in 1984 that we “had always been at war with Eastasia” seemed a quantum expression of American foreign policy and public opinion. The names and geographic locations of the cultures their government obliged them to hate proved confusing to many Americans. But that was more than acceptable to foreign policy elites. In part, as horror films revealed when they showed Americans a peculiar mash-up of places decidedly NOT-AMERICA, confusion was the point. Fear and hatred of the Japanese during World War II became hatred and fear of China. The baffling nature of the Korean War for most Americans, the reality that American soldiers and other U.N. forces actively engaged both North Korean and Chinese forces, helped shape a sense that we “had always been at war with Eastasia,” although, just like the slogan in 1984, this represented a revision of history, a willful forgetting, and a racist set of assumptions that allowed white America to see Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam as some version of Fu Manchu’s “Asiatic hordes.” The Soviet Union could be bundled into the eastern monstrosity, with serious foreign policy analysts, writers, and artists describing Russia as attracted by Bolshevism because of its history of “oriental despotism.”17 At home, as the story of Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” showed, hatred of Japan could easily be replaced by hatred of China. The opposite had been effected during the Second World War when an outbreak of assaults on Asian people after Pearl Harbor had become indiscriminate. Just before Christmas in 1941, Life magazine ran a piece entitled “How to Tell Japs from Chinese.” The piece in America’s most popular magazine essentially told readers that if they wished to assault someone, make sure to look for the alleged telltale signs of the Japanese “massively boned head” as opposed to the “delicately boned” features of the Chinese. The Chinese, meanwhile, wore “the rational calm of tolerant realists” while the Japanese face is “humorless” and “ruthless.”18 The roving imperial eye saw a jungle everywhere, from West Africa to the Middle East, from the Pacific and Asian countries to all of South America. By the 1960s, Americans focused these attitudes on the ancient society of Vietnam. Readers should know that Vietnam (explored later in this book because of its immense importance) became a horror landscape of American nightmares about its ability to assert its global hegemony. Left-leaning guerillas, many of them fighting for their national independence since the Japanese seized the country, drove out their former colonial masters, the French, after the decisive 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu. The Truman administration footed the bill for the French struggle, paying up to two-thirds of their costs in Southeast Asia between 1950 and 1952.19 Following Eisenhower’s inauguration in 1953, his administration continued support for the French and, under the banner of anti-communism, eventually took over for France as colonial overlord. The 1954 Geneva Accords allowed for a French withdrawal, a supposedly temporary division of Vietnam into North and South, and an election in two years that would unite the country. The United States prevented the election from happening, certain that the socialist hero of the wars against Japan and France, Ho Chi Minh, would emerge victorious. Political rhetoric at home sought to hide these facts. Most Americans believed by the early 1960s that North Vietnam, a “foreign communist power,” invaded South Vietnam, and the United States, wisely or not, intervened against an aggressor nation. In fact, Americans, who largely supported some level of intervention, had really no idea that they had become embroiled in a civil war. Even fewer knew their leaders sided with a corrupt, inept, and brutal regime, a zombie republic ensorcelled from nothing by the United States, which never managed to convince the South Vietnamese of its legitimacy. Ngo Dinh Diem ruled South Vietnam with the support of important American business and military leaders. Diem’s regime, however, helped the communist cause in the South thrive through the draconian actions of his secret police and attempts to uproot native Vietnamese Buddhism. It’s a sign of the clueless authoritarianism of Diem and his numerous replacements that, as much as some South Vietnamese feared the communists, they could never see their own government as a real alternative. John F. Kennedy, still for many Americans the iconic president, received a pass on the escalation of the conflict in popular memory. The facts are not on the side of his admirers. Most any textbook will tell you that the first Marine combat brigades appeared in Vietnam in 1965. Technically, this is true. But by the time of his assassination in 1963, Kennedy deployed close to seventeen thousand troops in Vietnam officially classified as “advisors.” Indeed, one of the few times the highly conservative comedian Bob Hope, by the sixties out of fashion with the young, managed a chuckle out of American GIs when he acknowledged this reality. When Hope performed his first Vietnamese Christmas Show in 1964, he started his set for the thousands assembled by gleefully hailing them with “Hello, advisors!”20 The Geneva Accords limited “advisors and observers” to under seven hundred. The United States ignored this limit just as it ignored the provision for a national election to settle the conflict. Kennedy insisted that Americans did not engage in combat even as it became clear that American pilots oversaw and took part in napalm raids. Dow Chemical developed an improved version of the vicious, inflammable jelly since the “terror bombings” of World War II, hotter and longer burning. Life magazine ran a story in January of 1963 about an American aircraft allegedly piloted by Vietnamese airmen trained by American observers. Historian of the Vietnam War Christian G. Appy writes, “the caption was written by editors still willing to parrot the official fiction.”21 The use of deadly bioweapons and the secret war being waged against North Vietnam continued the trajectory of American foreign policy that began with the seizure of the Philippines. The kind of conflict the Vietnam War became, the willingness of a small group of political elites to sacrifice human life in the hundreds of thousands, clearly appears in the earliest days of American involvement. By 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson had deployed over five hundred thousand U.S. troops to Vietnam. Moreover, the belief that the United States could win the war through pure attrition, slaughtering so many Vietnamese that the conflict would simply end when the country became a desolation, took the military command structure down the darkest of paths. The military hierarchy, from lieutenants all the way up to commanding general William Westmoreland, demanded the production of “body count” to such a degree that platoons sometimes competed in their accumulation of corpses.22 The death toll among the Vietnamese people, of all political shades, went exponential. After 1968’s Tet Offensive rocked the United States back on its heels, the American military responded with devastating violence. As the war dragged on, artillery strikes, B-52 bombing runs, shells hurled from battleships offshore, and incessant machine-gun fire on the ground and from Huey and Chinook helicopters above expended more firepower than used by all sides in the Second World War. By 1970, U.S. forces used 128,400 tons of munitions a month. The sheer amount of firepower, including chemical weapons and the poisonous defoliant Agent Orange, vaporized entire villages. A conservative New York Times estimate of Vietnamese causalities, dependent on U.S. military and South Vietnamese army sources alone, concluded that North Vietnam and “Viet Cong” suffered close to one million deaths with no tally for the wounded or any real separation between “civilians” and “Viet Cong.” A reported 20,587 South Vietnamese believed to have been sympathizers died at the hands of their own government, aided by the CIA. Indeed, these numbers are vastly underinflated given that official CIA totals for their Operation Phoenix program claimed to have killed more than 20,000 “VC.”23 Significant attention has been paid to the atrocity of the 1968 My Lai massacre, the work of that legion of Charlies, Charlie Company of the Eleventh Brigade. Such incidents, often excused by the military brass as the acts of “a few bad apples,” are representative of the decimation of the country systematically ordered by the Pentagon and carried out with weaponry that went far beyond what a single platoon could accomplish. Journalist and historian Nick Turse closely examined the record of American atrocities in Vietnam using primarily veteran accounts and archived war crimes investigations by the U.S. Army. He found that, for example, the 1968 Operation Speedy Express campaign in the Mekong Delta unleashed F-4 Phantoms dropping a massive tonnage of napalm on civilian hamlets, swift boats machine-gunning anyone who ran from U.S. forces among the rice paddies, B-52s raining down unimaginable carnage, and SEAL teams joining regular infantry in what had become a 350-kilometer-wide free-fire zone.24 As charred corpses covered South Asia, the year 1968 introduced the world to a new kind of fictional terror, a kind of horror that belonged very much to the times. George A. Romero turned twenty-eight that year. Since his graduation from college in 1960, his dreams of becoming a filmmaker were limited to work on commercials and filming a segment of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood that assured children that having their tonsils taken out really wasn’t so bad. As the war escalated, Romero made an independent film that rattled the nation in ways it didn’t quite understand. Americans just knew it scared them in ways vampires, flying saucers, and giant bugs couldn’t manage. What if America became a zombie republic? Romero’s Night of the Living Dead became a surprise hit at small theaters and drive-ins all over the country. Although in no sense a political allegory, nerves already raw sizzled with the film’s allusions to a country facing an Armageddon, violent dissension, and a world in which the Black hero died in the end at the hands of a white police force providing tactical support for a white lynch mob. Romero’s zombies are rotting embodiments of the war at home. Unlike the overwhelming majority of gothic horror films since the 1930s, the monsters are not in a far-off land, an imagined Europe, or a collage of the non-white world. Romero doesn’t separate the horror of the undead from a group of survivors who hate one another as much as the monsters who want to make them into a meal. “They’re all kinda insane,” Romero said of the group. Their isolation from one another in the midst of the apocalypse is, he said, “the most frightening thing” about the horror masterpiece.25 Romero’s creatures are masterless ronin of death. They don’t embody, as in White Zombie and its imitators, white America’s fear and anxiety over its colonial projects abroad. No sorcerer wielding the power of voodoo has called them forth. They are not a monstrous metaphor for colonization and the unfree labor that accompanies it. But they are still very much monsters of empire. In Romero’s world, the American government created them. A space probe brought back “radiation” from Venus that caused the dead to rise. Moreover, in one brilliant scene, Romero rewrites the script of most of the science fiction horror of the 1950s and ’60s. Rather than banding together against the threat, scientists and generals argue with one another in front of the media about what Americans should know and what they should be lied to about. We get the sneaking suspicion that the military-academic-industrial complex made it possible for our fellow Americans to eat us for dinner. Like the survivors in the farmhouse, “they’re all kinda insane.” Romero chose Duane Jones, a young African American actor, to portray the lead role of Ben. Although the director always insisted he did not select Jones based on his race, this in no way suggests Romero failed to understand the implication of his selection. He worked on his small-budget masterpiece on location in western Pennsylvania during a year in which the freedom struggle entered a critical new phase in the fight against white supremacy. Night was released a few months after an assassin with a highly suspicious background took the life of Martin Luther King Jr. Romero likely refused to comment on Jones’s race because he never wanted to suggest he’d selected the extraordinary actor simply because of his skin color. It’s the no-nonsense, won’t-take-any-shit, fire-raging-in-the-belly attitude that Jones brought to the role that matters. He represents the embodiment of the angry Black man, a construct worried over by white editorialists, the monstrous archetype that white politicians later invented terms for like superpredator and thug to inspire fear and new voting patterns among suburban whites.26 Romero surrounds Ben with white America under siege. An aging 1950s couple trades vicious barbs with one another as the husband tries to play patriarch to the household. But his time has passed. Barbra, a young white woman, is comatose. A rural Ken and Barbie doll couple are directionless. A decayed and cannibalized body lies at the top of the stairs before Ben removes it, a fleshless skull with empty voids for eyes urgently invoking the photographs and film footage of the corpses of Vietnam. They sit in the abandoned farmhouse. It’s the dead West, the Spahn ranch, the Texas cannibals’ homestead, the last house on the left. It’s the haunted castle of American frontier expansion gone to seed. The besieged microcosm of America hears conflicting reports from scientists and military leaders. Unlike in many of the sci-fi horror films of the time, the military will not come to save us. The scientists working for the Pentagon and a proliferation of national security agencies cannot be trusted and may have even been the cause of the outbreak. The bleak ending leaves us with a corpse, part of the mound of corpses produced by American racism, police power ensuring white interests had the protection of a well-armed lynch mob, the violence of the state outsourced to a backwoods paramilitary. This mistrust of the Pentagon, deeply intertwined with the protest culture of the anti-war movement, reversed the somnolent message of so much of fifties and early sixties horror culture. Kyle William Bishop, author of American Zombie Gothic, writes that Romero viewed films like Invisible Invaders (1959) and The Earth Dies Screaming (1964) in which aliens bent on conquest reanimate the dead. He also loved more literate sci-fi epics like Howard Hawks’s 1951 The Thing from Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still. In these films, Bishop writes, “the soldier’s first reaction upon encountering life from another planet is to shoot first and ask questions later.” In this new zombie tale for a new generation, Romero ruthlessly critiqued this blinkered use of violence, a theme he returned to throughout his film career.27 In 1968, Romero saw the beginning of the reign of the dead. In the years ahead, his new kind of zombie would become America’s most popular monster and one that he, along with others, would consistently use to critique American values. The United States continued to busily create zombie republics abroad. But in the American collective imagination, the dead began to return to the homestead, indomitable and hungry. 6.The Null Zone IN THE June 1968 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, two competing ads appeared side by side. They revealed two alternative ideas about American imperial power among the most influential science fiction writers of the second half of the twentieth century. One read, “We the undersigned believe the United States must remain in Vietnam to fulfill its responsibilities to the people of that country.” On the facing page, readers saw a slightly longer list of names under the words “We oppose the participation of the United States in the war in Vietnam.” The same issue included the announcement of a contest entitled “What would you do about the Vietnam War?” The best five answers would receive a one-hundred-dollar cash prize. Throughout the 1960s, Galaxy was known for publishing a wide array of science fiction tales, including Ray Bradbury’s short story “The Fireman,” which became the basis for Fahrenheit 451. In contrast to earlier science fiction magazines, editors H. L. Gold and Frederik Pohl sought to propel their work beyond its reputation as the space-adventure-for-boys genre. Galaxy hoped publishing tales with social commentary or that made use of parody and satire would help solidify SF as a serious literary phenomenon. Kate Wilhelm and Judith Merril circulated the first call for a petition against the escalating war. Wilhelm became a multiple Nebula winner, one of the highest honors for speculative fiction, for her stories of postapocalyptic American landscapes. Merril, one of the most politically sophisticated of the somewhat directionless Futurians, joined the Trotskyite movement after realizing the brutal, and in many respects anti-socialist, direction Stalin took the Soviet Union in the thirties. By the 1960s, she actively engaged in anti-war activities while churning out a host of tales centered on nuclear nightmare scenarios. Both women expected a near-universal condemnation of the American war in Asia from their fellow writers. Perhaps they should not have been surprised by Robert A. Heinlein’s response. Heinlein’s position regarding race, the utter supremacy of the U.S. military, and even enthusiasm for atomic weapons almost guaranteed his adamant refusal to sign. In fact, Heinlein wrote a novel, Glory Road, in 1963 that presaged the later popularity of military techno-thrillers like those of Tom Clancy. In it, an embittered Korean War veteran goes to Vietnam to fight communists, lamenting that in Korea “we weren’t allowed to win” and excoriating American society for its “weakness” in not using nuclear weapons. In an obvious allusion to his Starship Troopers fantasy of space marines waging a fascist war against monstrous bugs, Glory Road compares the “natives” of Vietnam with “insects.” Another signer of the pro-war proclamation, Joe Poyer, authored a nonfiction piece for archconservative John W. Campbell’s Analog Science Fiction and Fact suggesting that capitalism and democracy would triumph over insurgent wars of liberation in the developing world by using futuristic weaponry. In one of Poyer’s short stories, a Green Beret tricked out with war tech like some combination of the Predator and Iron Man hunts and kills his human targets mercilessly, a new incarnation of Heinlein’s Starship Troopers brutally extirpating the enemy in South Asia instead of outer space. In the same tale, the U.S. military deploys droplets of “deadly radioactive waste” to create what Poyer called “the null zone.” Commenting on the signers behind the pro-war ad, historian H. Bruce Franklin notes that it “reads like a roll call of champions of super science and supermen, of manly and military virtue . . .” Jerry Pournelle offers the best example of a writer soon to play a walk-on roll in the monster doc of the American empire. A protégé of Heinlein’s, he built an entire career around the notion of American supremacy using sci-fi-inspired weaponry to destroy monsters, particularly those he saw embodied in nations and peoples resistant to American power.28 Pournelle served in the Korean War where he, paradoxically, joined the Communist Party. He later called this “misplaced idealism” and made a whiplash-inducing swing to the other end of the political spectrum. He became an advocate of an America First position while pushing Heinlein’s monster-slaying fantasies and racist nightmares to their logical conclusion. Pournelle worked for a few years in the aerospace industry, where his interest in the killing power of science flourished. In the late 1950s, as an employee of Boeing, he imagined the design of a new high-tech killing machine he called “Project Thor,” which could rain tungsten steel rods from space platforms with the destructive force of nuclear weapons, minus the radioactive fallout. While producing more and more science fiction, he continued to work with high-tech weaponry, specifically new designs for the next-gen ballistic missiles of the 1970s. Like Wernher von Braun and Heinlein himself, Pournelle became a key component in the American right’s fascination with space exploration and its possibilities for raining destruction from orbit on America’s enemies.29 Later in life, Pournelle found it charming to describe his politics as “somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan.” His extremist worldview and interest in space exploration, high-tech weapons, and science fiction frequently gelled. His tales bristled with space marines and futuristic versions of America’s “technowar.” The line between slaughtering monstrous humanoids in space and the American imperial adventure dissolved in his coauthorship of the textbook The Strategy of Technology. Used in courses at West Point, the volume declared that “3 megatons of small nuclear bombs” would be enough to win the Vietnam War.30 Pournelle and Heinlein continued to believe the Vietnam War could be won by turning soldiers and marines into starship troopers and using futuristic weapons of annihilation. The development of the neutron bomb became important to both writers, a weapon often described in the popular press, using tones of fear or wonder, as “a death ray.” The low-yield weapon explodes radiation into the air, killing people while doing minimal damage to physical structures or vehicles. Deployed as tactical weapons on the battlefield, they would have a devastating effect, neutrons eating human tissue like vermin swarming in a dumpster. Pournelle, in a later incarnation as a military strategist and advisor in the Reagan administration, played a role in the effort to deploy such weapons in Europe in the 1980s. Americans should have been appalled that genre writers of sci-fi fiction horror fantasies helped create the Pershing II missile crisis, an extraordinarily dangerous Cold War moment when the placement of these medium-range nuclear devices and aggressive U.S. “war games” in Europe convinced the Soviets that Reagan planned a preemptive strike. But, given the secrecy long surrounding American foreign policy, the public had no clue how close they came to the “null zone.” Pournelle remerged in the twenty-first century as an advocate for the Ballistic Missile Defense System fantasies of the second Bush administration. As late as 2010, he praised the neutron bomb for its ability to keep the “Red hordes” at bay.31 The willingness to see the war in Southeast Asia as a testing ground for the most hideous weapons of empire explains the massive number of civilian casualties in that long war. The counterculture became inexplicably enraptured with Heinlein’s solipsistic fantasy Stranger in a Strange Land, while he and his protégés wondered why the United States didn’t simply eliminate “the bugs” that resisted the American invasion. Perhaps Charles Manson had really understood Heinlein’s message of “disincorporating” one’s enemies. Kill the bugs, kill the piggies, do something witchy. Several generations of sci-fi warriors who lived their fantasies of killing monsters in print must have been pleased that so many of America’s leaders shared their views, into and beyond the Vietnam War. In fact, one administration after another indulged in the right wing of science fiction’s militarist fantasies when encountering threats to the extension of American power. If we had atomic weapons, why not use them again? Truman pondered their lethal application in Korea. Then, in 1954, Eisenhower considered their use against North Vietnam. Even before Vietnam became unwinnable, the Pentagon Papers revealed the National Security Council placed nuclear weapons on the table. In 1968, William Westmoreland, head of all military operations in Southeast Asia, recommended nuking much of East Asia as the fighting, and public opinion at home, began to turn against the war effort. In fact, even after the war ended, Westmoreland lamented that politicians refused to employ “small tactical nuclear weapons” in order to “tell Hanoi something.”32 The Vietnam War, an issue in American life for nearly a decade, threw its murderous shadow over the history of American horror. Many of the phantasmagoric forms that have haunted the country for the last fifty years came to unnatural life in the jungles of Vietnam. Generals and politicians, the real ones and the Archie Bunkers in their armchairs at home, engaged in an orgy of mythic thinking about the war empire lost. For some, these legends took the form of very literal monsters. 7.Empire’s Missing Links IN THE summer of 1966, marines of First Force Recon Company set out to build a helicopter landing pad in South Vietnam’s Quang Tri Province, one of the most contested regions of the war. Part of a larger effort dubbed Operation Prairie, First Recon began a “reconnaissance in force” to patrol for NLF soldiers (National Liberation Front, better known in American parlance as the Viet Cong or VC). While working on the landing zone near a hill they called “the Rock Pile,” the official report notes that the platoon encountered “some playful rock apes” that “engaged in some rock tossing contests with the Marines.” Supposedly this high-spirited encounter continued until a surprise attack by the NLF halted work on the helipad and resulted in a deadly firefight.33 “Rock apes” could be so casually mentioned in an after-action report because the existence of such creatures had become part of the everyday chatter among troops in Vietnam. Most soldiers in Vietnam probably knew they were part of the native fauna, either gibbons or a red-shanked monkey called the douc (some reports of rock apes insist they had red hair). Gibbons in particular chilled numerous American marines and soldiers with their unearthly screams, banshees in the jungle night. In remembering strange experiences of the war, sometimes a decade or two later, some veterans found that the rock apes took on a much more monstrous form. Marine Anthony Goodrich recalled “it was so damn dark in the jungle” that “rock apes” had an easy time moving around and terrifying patrols. Goodrich even awoke one night thinking a fellow marine had shaken him out of sleep to take his watch, to find a rock ape “about three feet high” sitting on his chest. His screaming woke his entire platoon, who later ribbed him about the incident. Goodrich told an interviewer he had heard about these creatures since his arrival in Vietnam but at first believed they were, in his words, “old wives’ tales.” He then claims he learned that they were “brought south” by the North Vietnamese, essentially becoming weaponized monsters for the communist cause.34 The supernatural “jungle people” appeared suddenly, using tactics not dissimilar from the ambuscades of NLF fighters. The commonalities seemed so obvious to American troops that many rock ape anecdotes told during the war concerned soldiers certain they had been set upon by VC only to express relief upon finding a terrifying cryptid. These stories often took on an even more sinister turn with the tales of ma, or phantoms, that inhabited the dense jungle, precisely the regions that the NLF found most effective for launching surprise attacks on American platoon patrols and makeshift bases. Nearly a half century since the end of the Vietnam War, such stories have proliferated. Many of the stories are connected to the beliefs of the Hmong, a discreet ethnic group in Laos and along the Cambodian border with no loyalty to either the South Vietnamese government or the promises of communism. The CIA saw them as the perfect instrument for counterinsurgency operations. Supposedly, the Hmong passed the tale of jungle phantoms or jungle people on to American CIA agents, special forces, and mercenaries. In more recent retellings, “locals” told marines about the “reanimated corpses” who lived in the jungles. Military.com, a site dedicated to news of interest to veterans and a clearinghouse for information on VA benefits, ran a spring 2019 story about Vietnam’s “ghouls of the jungle,” which insists that American troops “began reporting ghostly figures moving supernaturally through the trees.” Meanwhile, it claims, “others reported fanged creatures with black eyes.” Bizarrely, the article ends by claiming the walking dead could move about in the day because “the triple canopy jungle” kept the sun out and is “the real reason the military developed Agent Orange and napalm.”35 Stories of phantoms in the jungle, like the encounters with cryptid rock apes, may have been a function of memory and amnesia, the delicate process of forgetfulness that plays an integral role in the trauma of war. An adult male gibbon moving through the high trees at night would certainly seem a monstrous phantom to nervous, watchful soldiers. Getting spooked by a monkey would be cause for laughter and relief if the other option involved a grenade tossed out of the steaming darkness or the explosive rattle of an AK-47. Platoon jokes quickly became legend in the retelling. Certainly, there’s no evidence of the existence of rock apes. The memory of them as communist-controlled monsters owes more to the mad scientist/malignant magician films of the Vietnam veteran’s childhood than reality. The real missing link here may be how modern memory of the rock ape connects to the catastrophic use of chemical warfare. By the end of the Vietnam War the United States had dropped more than four hundred thousand pounds of napalm on the Vietnamese people. This represented four times the amount used against Japan in the “terror bombings” that Curtis LeMay admitted had been so egregious that “if we’d lost the war, we’d all have been prosecuted as war criminals.” This fact helps explain why a respected veterans’ site might venture the claim that the use of chemical defoliants, defoliants of plants and humans, may have cleared the jungle of monsters.36 These fanciful creatures provided a way to talk, perhaps half-seriously at times, about the mad science practiced in Vietnam. Telling a story about fanged ghouls with black eyes doesn’t unsettle as much as a viciously burning jelly dropped on civilians and combatants, leaving them forever scarred. A mythic creature hiding in the dark seems charming in comparison to the dumping of tons of a defoliant that had long-range consequences for American soldiers as well as the people and ecosystem of Vietnam. But monsters contain multitudes and seldom have a univocal meaning. Stories of a creature intertwined with America’s guilt and shame over Vietnam, and the near impossibility of negotiating the meaning of the conflict, helped make a monster. These cryptid legends from the battlefield prepared the way for the belief, still making the rounds among cryptid enthusiasts in the 2020s, that the monsters of Vietnam, as in Konga, made their way back to the homeland of the empire. Ken Gerhard, a self-described cryptozoologist who has had an enormously successful career talking about everything from Bigfoot to werewolves on numerous basic cable networks, believes that at least one of the rock apes of Vietnam came home to America. He was, Gerhard claims, shipped home by a former air force pilot in 1965 “using a body bag.” Gerhard appeared in the 2019 Travel Channel series In Search of Monsters, which asked, “Is it possible that one of the monsters of Vietnam made it to North America?” Gerhard makes his claim based on the bizarre tale of the Minnesota Iceman, a complicated fable of an air force veteran, a sideshow act, the CIA’s connection to the heroin trade, and even the Smithsonian Institution. It’s a tale that reveals much about the interrelationship of horror and empire, how a monster story acts as a cover story for some of the stranger covert ops of the Cold War. 8.The Creature in a Grave of Ice!! THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN (1957) featured Peter Cushing as a cryptid hunter at the roof of the world. Cushing soon earned much more fame for his roles as Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein in Hammer studio’s now classic reboots. But this film, released in the United States as The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, transmogrified over the years into a cult classic, portions of it even influencing the cult indie film The Blair Witch Project (1999). The film drew on contemporary fascination with both Bigfoot and the Yeti. It also drilled into a vein of geopolitical weirdness that intertwined monster tales, espionage, and American imperial adventurism. Retired air force veteran Frank D. Hansen unwittingly helped foment this strange corner of the historical meaning of Vietnam. In 1967 he began exhibiting an ape-like creature encased in ice at carnivals, shopping centers, and supermarket parking lots. Hansen previously made extra cash on the county fair circuit showing off antique tractors, including “the world’s oldest John Deere,” which proved especially popular among Midwestern farm equipment enthusiasts. But nothing he ever exhibited became as popular as the thing soon christened the Minnesota Iceman. Hansen’s scam might have remained just a popular regional sideshow attraction. Unfortunately for him, he attracted the attention of two fringe zoologists, Bernard Heuvelmans and Ivan T. Sanderson. Heuvelmans, known for a combination of encyclopedic research and jaw-dropping leaps in logic, may have coined the term cryptozoology. His lifelong love of Jules Verne and the 1925 classic film The Lost World made him playfully open to all manner of wondrous, and highly dubious, claims. In 1948, he encountered a decidedly unscientific article by Sanderson in the Saturday Evening Post entitled “There Could Be Dinosaurs.” He soon wrote On the Track of Unknown Animals, which, in a stroke of luck, appeared about two years before the first supposed sightings of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. Sanderson himself had been a popular nature writer who found a much larger audience for “unexplained phenomenon” in the wake of the ’47 summer of the flying saucers. His alliance with Heuvelmans emerged when their mutual admiration society found funding from the exquisitely named Texas oilman Tom Slick. Slick, who had already footed the bill for several expeditions searching for the Abominable Snowman in the Himalayas, freely dispensed cash to the Sanderson-Heuvelmans research team until his death in 1962.37 The pair, no longer having the financing of the Texas oil industry to go Yeti-hunting in Nepal, looked for mystery closer to home. Hansen seems to have believed, at first, that the cryptid hunters’ interest in his iceman could increase the popularity of his creature already touring much of the Midwest and occasionally as far south as Louisiana. He did insist that Sanderson and Heuvelmans neither open the glass case nor shatter the ice that held his creature. Obviously, this failed to offer anything like the conditions required for empirical research. Nevertheless, both men wrote extensive papers on their limited observations that provided pages of information on the “morphology” of the form they could barely see beneath Hansen’s sideshow trappings. Sanderson and Heuvelmans bought into the idea that the specimen represented a lost human ancestor that continued to live in the remote regions of the world. Sanderson’s writing on the subject would appear, not in scientific journals, but rather in science fiction and “men’s magazines” such as Argosy, for which Sanderson served as “science editor.” Heuvelmans published a book that claimed Hansen had an example of a Neanderthal man, living contemporaneously with humans. And that it had come to America from Vietnam. The origins of the Minnesota Iceman provoked so much speculation because Hansen himself told three different and utterly conflicting stories about how he came into possession of the specimen. In the most elaborate narrative, a Japanese whaling ship discovered the creature blocked in ice and floating in the frigid waters off Kamchatka. Somehow “Red China” ended up with the specimen and, just as mysteriously, the creature found its way to Hansen through “a Chinese gentleman of British nationality” in Hong Kong. In this iteration of the tale, Hansen had pulled off some Cold War cryptid espionage and managed to wrest the monsters from “the reds.” This seems to have been the story he told of the creature’s origins at the 1967 Minnesota State Fair. Hansen presented the alleged creature to patrons in its “grave of ice” according to the August 10 Ironwood Daily Globe. Other attractions on offer included “Big Willie, the world’s largest alligator” and an invitation to “Take the Trip the Hippies Take,” a drug-free psychedelic light show that offered anodyne thrills to the squares. Sometimes Hansen suggested he had possession of the creature after its purchase by a “Hollywood millionaire.” This second version of the story simply suggested that an unnamed benefactor who collected oddities owned the icebound monster but, for reasons never explained, allowed Hansen to tour the county fairs with a missing link in human evolution. The unlikely tale spread that this mysterious Hollywood patron was none other than James Stewart, a rumor that Hansen encouraged. Stewart had been a combat pilot, like Hanson, though during World War II. But there may have been a much better reason why the star of It’s a Wonderful Life and some of Hitchcock’s most chilling thrillers found his way into the tale of the Minnesota Iceman. A decade earlier, Stewart played a decidedly weird role in the story of the Pangboche hand. A cryptid hunter named Peter Byrne, financed by Tom Slick, had discovered an alleged “hand of the Yeti” at a Buddhist monastery in Pangboche, Nepal, in 1957. Formerly isolated, the monastery attracted paying tourists for its supposed Yeti relics in the fifties, particularly after Edmund Hillary’s successful ascent of nearby Mount Everest in 1953. Finding the monks unwilling to part with the attraction, Byrne returned in 1959 and, after getting the monk standing watch thoroughly plastered, stole one finger from the object. He then replaced it with a human finger that he handily (sorry) brought along. There’s obvious speculation about where he found a detached human digit. In all likelihood, he snapped it off one of the hundred or so frozen corpses of dead climbers that have proliferated on the Himalayas since the early twentieth century, bodies fellow climbers have been unable to bury or remove because of weather conditions and logistics. Given that customs agents tend to frown on the export of human remains in a carry-on bag, Slick contacted Stewart, vacationing with his wife, Gloria, in Calcutta. Stewart long held a fascination with natural history and readily agreed to help. Gloria stuffed the finger in her lingerie bag and, as Slick expected, no one rummaged through the celebrity’s luggage. Told and retold, the true story of Stewart’s adventure in extractive tourism only helped the prospects of Hansen’s sideshow.38 As the Minnesota Iceman gained more attention, Hansen came to prefer a story that he perhaps saw as unfalsifiable. He attempted to make canonical the tale that he himself shot the creature while hunting in Minnesota and encased it in a block of ice and a glass canister to preserve it. Heuvelmans wanted a more interesting and perhaps timelier story, and so he looked to Southeast Asia. 9.Drugs, Cryptids, and Covert Ops THE MINNESOTA Iceman becoming entangled in the story of the CIA’s secret war in Laos may seem a bizarre coincidence. But, in fact, cryptid hunting and covert ops often had an intertwined history. Author Colin Dickey discovered that a surprising number of Yeti hunters in the fifties and sixties had some link to various intelligence agencies, so much so that he writes, “the hunt for the Yeti was inescapably tied to Cold War politics.” The Soviet Union thought the same. The state-run newspaper Izvestia claimed that the hunt for the snowmen masked an effort at “the subversion of Communist China.” The New York Times reporter who wrote about this could barely contain their sarcasm about the Kremlin’s apparent nervousness over Tom Slick’s interest in the “abominable snowman.”39 But the Soviets had been right. In 1965, mountaineers connected to U.S. intelligence attempted to set up a sensor on a Himalayan peak, without the knowledge of the Nepalese government, that allowed surveillance of Chinese atomic capabilities. The Kremlin likely suspected a less paranormal reason for the expeditions since the CIA used a hunt for Noah’s Ark along the Turkish-Soviet border to gather photographic intelligence as early as 1949.40 Heuvelmans needed a story better than Yeti fingers hidden in Gloria Stewart’s underwear. His book Neanderthal: The Strange Saga of the Minnesota Iceman, first published in 1974, provided the background for Ken Gerhard’s claim that “body bags” had been used to bring a monster from Vietnam. While admitting that his narrative was in part “based on conjecture,” this rather enormous caveat did not prevent Heuvelmans from strongly affirming that Hansen located the “bizarre hairy man” in Southeast Asia. In this telling, Hansen probably had no idea of the scientific discovery he made but saw financial profit in the specimen. So he arranged for the thing encased in ice to return to the States in a body bag. “What better place to hide a corpse,” Heuvelmans has Hansen reason, “than in a container normally used to carry corpses?”41 In hopes of buttressing this claim, Heuvelmans told a story that readers might find as bizarre as that of the iceman. He insisted that nearly anything could make its way from the major airport of Da Nang to California. How? He explained a large drug-trafficking operation the CIA and the U.S. military carried out to fund pro-American insurgencies in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This of course sounds a bit like a theory in need of a tinfoil hat for its parturition. Unfortunately, the story of the drug trafficking by the United States during the Vietnam war is true.42 In 1971, The Washington Post reported that the CIA had long denied any knowledge of drug trafficking in Vietnam and neighboring regions. However, the article showed the CIA armed and trained tribal groups like the Hmong who grew opium, necessary to produce heroin. The agency also made convenient deals with leaders of the Hmong. One of these warlords, General Vang Pao, convinced the CIA to build an airstrip that allowed the transport of refined heroin. By 1972, 70 percent of the world’s opium came from the region on the Thai, Myanmar, and Laotian border where the Hmong and the CIA worked together against the red menace.43 There’s little evidence that Air America, the name for the CIA’s airlift projects in South Asia, directly facilitated large-scale shipments of heroin to the United States. Nor did CIA agents directly engage in the distribution and sale of the drug, or at least no reliable evidence has appeared to prove such a thing. But the fact that the CIA facilitated the trade remains indisputable. Although often considered a false conspiracy theory of the left, even the CIA’s official examination of the issue admitted that while there was an “unequivocal” restriction on large packages of opium, it remained possible that smaller amounts had been shipped by CIA contractors. The agency preferred to allow assets like General Pao to move drugs in complicated schemes for the funding of counterinsurgency groups, a pattern that would become increasingly common, and insidious, in the coming decades, showing up in the Rube Goldberg machine Oliver North built to fund the Contras in the 1980s. Heuvelmans discusses the close involvement of the CIA and the heroin trade only because of his interest in how an alleged monster made its way to America. He makes it clear that he could not care less about how the American empire used heroin as a leveraging tool with local clients in its expansive South Asian war. What he calls the “scientific Watergate” that led to a lack of interest in his Neanderthal man represented for him the real scandal. After the kerfuffle raised by Sanderson and Heuvelmans over the iceman, Hansen became very nervous. Heuvelmans made the claim, even before the publication of his book, that Hansen illegally obtained a new link in human evolution that still survived in isolated parts of the globe. The claim interested a skeptical John R. Napier, a primatologist with the Smithsonian Institution, who sought to examine the specimen for himself. Hansen tired of the attention and probably knew his iceman would soon be revealed as a fraud. He allowed Napier to examine what he called “a latex model” of the iceman and said that he would no longer display the original for fear it would become damaged. The public lost interest and the Smithsonian concluded that the only version they had been allowed to see of the monster from Vietnam had been a work of special effects. The Minnesota Iceman dropped, for a time, out of public memory until a revival of interest in cryptids in the early twenty-first century.44 Hansen’s family sold the latex model on eBay in 2013. Hansen’s iceman, once connected to both the body bags of the war dead and shadowy covert operations throughout Southeast Asia, can be viewed today at the Museum of the Weird in Austin, Texas. However, a version of Heuvelmans’s strange saga of the connection between the rock apes of Vietnam and the Minnesota Iceman has appeared in every iteration of the story on basic cable’s popular cryptid-hunter shows into the 2020s. 10.They Own the Night A SIGNIFICANT part of the American memory of Vietnam concerns homecomings, or more precisely the homecoming gone sour. Numerous legends, which often became widely and deeply held beliefs, cluster around the warrior who fails to come home. It’s nearly impossible not to see such stories as grassroots metaphor manufacturing, stories that simplify or reimagine the complexities of a lost war. Monsters with their origin in Vietnam, predators in the Mekong delta’s rice fields, that made their way to America comported with how Americans saw the Vietnamese people. Increasingly, Americans told stories about the horror of Vietnam that ignored American culpability in the catastrophe and shifted the focus to unexplained creatures and ghost stories, a haunted ride on the midway of the country’s dark carnival. In 2018, a University of Notre Dame alumnus posted on the university’s class of 1969 blog about a strange night in 1967. Domer Costantini worked that summer for a construction company, “grueling” work that he describes as leaving him physically and mentally exhausted. On a hot July evening, he made his way from the work site to his parents’ home in the Bronx. Costantini regularly passed Gleason’s Funeral Home in the half-mile walk from the subway to his family’s apartment, and on this night, he saw an old high school friend he had not seen for two years, Gerald L. Fox, known to everyone in the neighborhood as Jerry. The “solitary figure” lingered in front of the mortuary and seemed to want to talk, but a weary Costantini begged off and offered a plan to meet up with his school chum another time. He arrived home to learn from his mother that Fox died in a firefight on July 12, 1967. The funeral would be held the following day at Gleason’s. Rational explanations for Costantini’s experience are probably obvious to the reader. He was tired, he saw a friend who reminded him of Jerry, and he probably did not learn of his death that night. But fifty years of misremembering corrupted the timeline, and his very real grief over Jerry’s death created a very genuine haunting. When Costantini attempted to recall the events half a century after they occurred, what came to his mind was his unwillingness to greet his friend, to welcome him home. He would write in 2018, “Who was I and what am I to have shunned an American hero?” Costantini became so invested in the tale that he and his wife traveled to Vietnam, and he wears a wristband that reads “PFC Gerald L. Fox / US 12 Jul 67.” Monster tales can become personal expressions of grief rooted in the many sorrows of empire.45 Point Pleasant, West Virginia, is a tiny Ohio Valley town near a major tributary of the Kanawha River with a population of less than five thousand people. Its Main Street stores shuttered early in the 1960s. At that time, its only claim to fame seems to have been an 1805 house-raising during which a falling log killed Mark Twain’s grandfather. No significant tourist industry seemed likely to germinate from this anecdote. Point Pleasant remained a sleepy hamlet even as residents worried over news of the escalating war in Vietnam, the growing strength of the anti-war movement, and the freedom struggle led by Black Americans demanding economic rights as well as the ballot. But these things appeared to many residents of the isolated town like news from another world. Soon enough, other worlds seemed to swirl around them. On November 16, 1966, the Pittsburgh Press reported that a couple driving near the town was chased “by a birdlike creature” with “red eyes.” On November 27, 1966, a teenager saw “a huge gray figure” that she estimated as being six to seven feet tall with “large, round, fiercely glowing red eyes that focused on her with hypnotic effect.” She watched in horror as “a pair of wings unfolded from its back.”46 UFO enthusiasts and cryptid hunters proved quick to see the Mothman sightings wrapped in our deadly embrace of the Vietnam War. At the time of the sightings, the Pentagon deployed more than two hundred thousand American troops in Vietnam, with former vice president and soon to become presidential candidate Richard Nixon calling for five hundred thousand. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara worried that although the enemy seemed to suffer casualties beyond counting, “there is no sign of a break in enemy morale . . . in the countryside the enemy almost completely controls the night.”47 Did something else control the night? John A. Keel certainly thought so, claiming in his enormously popular book The Mothman Prophecies that numerous UFO sightings had occurred in Southeast Asia in 1966 to 1967. He quoted PFC Earl Morrison, who claimed he and two buddies saw “what looked like wings, like a bat’s, only it was gigantic” near Da Nang. The figure gave off an unearthly greenish hue, though the soldiers claimed its nude body was obsidian. The creature then began flapping its wings and rose into the air. The whole experience, Morrison remembered, lasted “three or four minutes.” Private Morrison’s sighting may have been especially detailed but was frequently repeated in more general terms regarding UFOs, bright lights, and sometimes “enemy helicopters” that neither the North Vietnamese army or the NLF could have accessed. Pete Mazzola, a soldier who later founded a UFOlogy institute, claimed to see “bright objects” appear over rice fields when guerillas pinned down his patrol with heavy fire. Similar reports occurred until the end of the war. Why did soldiers need these stories? On one level, they are hazy incidents occurring in the fog of battle, interpreted according to the flying saucer films and creature features of the soldier’s childhood. A few cases may have been sightings of secretive missions by the CIA either into Laos and Cambodia or the agency’s shadowy Project Phoenix. The tortured memory and the political upheaval caused by defeat in the Vietnam War are more essential to the spread and interest in these stories than the easily explained sightings. The real conspiracies that the citizens of a democracy should speak out about, such as the CIA’s involvement in drug trafficking, become explanations for how a hairy beast could have been transported home from Vietnam. The black helicopters of conspiracy fantasy are reason to distrust the government but not the use of chemical weapons or the murder and maiming of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the most extensive bombing campaign in modern history. In the case of the Vietnam War, the language of monsters hides, rather than reveals, the real horrors of history. Horror films and racism continued as boon companions even as George A. Romero changed the politics of monsters. A new wave of Fu Manchu films became popular in Britain and the United States, helmed by Hammer horror star Christopher Lee as the dastardly mastermind. In precisely the years when the Vietnam War escalated, 1965 to 1969, Lee appeared in no less than five stories of the Asian crime lord in forgettable but popular flicks like The Vengeance of Fu Manchu and The Brides of Fu Manchu. The “Asiatic hordes” continued to batter down the doors of the Western world, if only in the fevered imagination of the American empire. 11.The Ghost of a Previous Nightmare THE UNITED States saw itself under siege even as it projected military and economic power around the globe. In February of 1962, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, formerly an executive with the Ford Motor Company, warned Americans not only that their government called on them to support an apocalyptic arms race, but also that they needed to support wars that are “often not wars at all.” This peculiar admonition, to support a thing that’s not really the thing you think it is, grew from the Kennedy administration’s concern about Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev’s verbal and often material support for “wars of liberation” in the former colonial, or in some cases newly colonized, world.48 When is a war not really a war? McNamara forcefully, if at the time mysteriously, stated his case by talking of a shadow realm in which “the force of world communism operates in the twilight zone between political subversion and quasi-military action.” Of course, the United States in its role as protector of world capitalism operated in this same murky dimension for much of the twentieth century, so murky that many Americans didn’t even know it. McNamara wanted to evoke his boss’s memorable inauguration speech of 1960 when he imagined the Cold War as a “long twilight struggle.” But the phrase the twilight zone had another meaning for many in 1962. Rod Serling had become a successful television writer by the time he invited Americans to ponder their fears, and their politics, in the twilight zone. But Serling was intensely frustrated. In an interview with the young, hard-charging reporter Mike Wallace, Serling complained about constantly having to “battle sponsors and agencies.” Thinking in part of the soporific the network had made of A Town Has Turned to Dust, he told Wallace he didn’t want “to compromise all the time, which in essence is what the television writer does if he wants to put on controversial themes.” Serling also once wrote a political drama for television titled Playhouse 90, but sponsors did not allow his senators to discuss politics, party affiliation, or any current issue. He later noted that “in retrospect, I probably would have had a much more adult play had I made it science fiction, put it in the year 2057, and peopled the Senate with robots.” In other words, if he’d “had a Martian say it.”49 Critics called Serling “television’s angry young man” even before his relentless pasquinades of American society. His daughter Jodi Serling remembers the anger but said it never came from “conceit,” calling her father “a gentle, kind man.” He had, she said, returned from the war “broken . . . He had to start a whole new life, and he used writing as a form of therapy.” His therapy became a conversation with American ideals revealing their true face, seen in his worry over America’s romance with the atom, the possibility that these weapons would not only destroy democracy but create an extinction event.50 Serling’s concerns went beyond the obvious issue of America’s world-ending weapons. Could democracy survive in a militarized state? What happened to freedom of speech and basic ideals of identity in a society that built its foreign policy around bases and bombs, client states and conquest? Could America be great or even good when it appeared the empire might swallow the nation? These anxieties run through every season of The Twilight Zone. The fascism Serling wanted to fight as a high school kid could happen here. Maybe it had already begun. In episodes like “The Obsolete Man,” Serling asked if any element of the First Amendment could survive in a militarized society. Although the episode is sometimes read as an indictment of Stalinism or totalitarianism more generally, Serling’s experiences with the soft censorship of capitalism made him particularly critical of any efforts to limit the spread of ideas in his country. The Twilight Zone did not completely escape the stealth campaign of American censorship. Ratings behemoths like Leave It to Beaver and Gunsmoke dominated the television landscape, while The Twilight Zone appeared Friday nights at 10:00 p.m., late-night TV in the early sixties. The odd hour and some of the themes prevented Serling’s masterpiece from even coming close to the top-rated shows in audience share. But, running for five seasons, Serling’s peculiar TV show created what we today call a cult following, and a very devoted cult at that. Fan clubs of the show, most of them made up of adolescents or college students, emerged around the country. Nevertheless, CBS executives consistently worried about the show’s content, its ratings, and its budget. Serling pressed on, sometimes creating alternate Americas that looked all too familiar. “The Obsolete Man” reads as so heavy-handed today that viewers, just like those in 1961, could easily identify the good guy versus the evil state. At times, Serling wrote or adapted tales for TV that showed the more subtle seductions of fascism. In “He’s Alive”—an homage to the horror tradition’s frequent use of Frankenstein’s moment of “It’s alive!”—Serling introduces us to what he calls “a bush-league Führer” played by Dennis Hopper. He cannot get his fellow Americans to listen to his bile until he’s visited by the the “ghost of a previous nightmare,” the shade of Hitler himself. In the closing monologue, Serling asks his audience to directly ponder the episode’s message. Remember . . . when he comes to your town. Remember it when you hear his voice speaking out through others. Remember it when you hear a name called, a minority attacked, any blind, unreasoning assault on a people or any human being. He’s alive because through these things we keep him alive. But could Serling’s viewers remember this wisdom in a country terrified of outside menace and willing to make a totem of their weapons of mass destruction? As Serling’s Twilight Zone completed its fifth and final season in 1964, the United States intervened and sometimes established a permanent occupation force in countries most Americans could not locate on a map. In January 1964, The Twilight Zone did not appear in CBS’s announcement of its fall schedule and Serling publicly expressed doubt that the show could survive. It did not. Efforts to re-create the show as Rod Serling’s Wax Museum came to nothing, largely because Serling would not do a show that failed to use science fiction and horror for the purpose of social criticism. He loudly complained that everyone from his agents to studio executives wanted him “stuck in a graveyard every week” to introduce a television version of “C-movies.” Serling didn’t need a television vehicle for social criticism. He found the Vietnam War deplorable and spoke out strongly against it in language that much of white, mainstream America found extreme. In December of 1968, Serling delivered a speech to students at Moorpark College in California. Even before he delivered his remarks, he stirred up controversy. The college’s conservative administration demanded that all official campus lecturers sign a loyalty oath to the United States. Serling took umbrage at this, saying that he had already taken an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic when he fought in the Second World War. His body still ached from the wounds he’d received for his country. He held to the conviction that repeated declarations of loyalty to the state cleared the way for fascism. Serling did not sign the oath but the students wanted to hear him anyway, so he gave an informal talk to hundreds of undergraduates without the college’s approval (and without a speaker’s fee). In it, he briefly excoriated the idea of loyalty oaths, comparing them to demands made on citizens in fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. While critiquing the new fascism, Serling took the opportunity to address police brutality, very much on the minds of the sixties generation after the 1968 Democratic National Convention the previous summer when Mayor Richard J. Daley unleashed the police in a wave of violence against anti-war protestors. Serling dismissed the idea that the protestors offered provocation since, he strenuously argued, no possible provocation existed for a “representative of law and order wading in with a billy club under the pretense of saving the sovereign city of Chicago.” Serling went further. Aware that police riots against white students received far more attention than the history of violence against Black people, he scorned the use of law and order in politics, saying it amounted to “a battle slogan.” Nixon and his creatures used the phrase in the ’68 presidential election as a code, assuring white Americans that civil rights legislation did not mean an end to systemic racism enforced with real and threatened violence. Serling noted that “law and order” seemed important only when used as a rhetorical tool. Where, he demanded to know, had the crusaders of law and order been when “four little Negro girls were bombed to pieces in a Birmingham church” or “when three young civil rights workers were slaughtered in Mississippi.” What about a call for law and order during “the bombing of over a hundred churches in the south in the past five years”? Given this, he bluntly asserted in terms that have contemporary application, “It’s hardly a revelation to me that the young people in this country take a dim view of our current uptightness when it comes to street rioting . . . on the scale of misbehavior, the black man who takes a torch to a building or breaks a window to loot, and does so out of passion, is less the criminal than the white man who puts his torch to human beings . . .” In the very same speech, Serling asserted that, even as public opinion began to turn against America’s invasion of Vietnam, few understood or accepted the real meaning of the war. Rather than protecting South Vietnam from the unprovoked aggression of the North, we had allowed “twenty-thousand dead American boys” while “half a million civilians [were put] to a torch” to interfere with a civil war in which the United States sided with a corrupt regime that did not have the support of the people. “So,” he wondered aloud, “what, indeed, are we defending there?”51 Serling died in June of 1975 following coronary bypass surgery. His family had a history of heart irregularities, in Serling’s case exacerbated by smoking as many as four packs of cigarettes a day since World War II. At the time of his death, he suffered with depression, despite some very significant and critically acclaimed writing done for an off-kilter western called The Loner and his newest TV series, Night Gallery. He felt that, as studio execs tried to make Night Gallery competitive with the hugely popular detective series Mannix, social content had given way to “the need for producing simple and unconvincing frights.” Meanwhile, he often commented that while The Twilight Zone had been a mixed bag of excellent, good, bad, and terrible episodes, he also thought it the most politically relevant work of his career. Yet, he doubted it would survive in American memory. He could not have been more wrong. The memory and increasing relevance of Serling’s work entwined with the hopes and anxieties of a new generation of filmmakers like George A. Romero. Like Rod Serling, they did not want to simply “hang out in a graveyard” and raise some ghouls for suspense. A new generation of filmmakers wanted to comment, to make statements, to make important films. A new breaker of horror washed over America, a bleak and chilled wave inundating late-twentieth-century America’s imperial dream. A backlash against this critique would also wash over the American landscape, at times seeming to carry all before it. 12.Bats Leaving, Virgins Bleeding BELA LUGOSI last played Dracula on the silver screen for giggles in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). The forties served Lugosi manifold frustrations, even for a film career hobbled since before World War II. In one of his final films with Boris Karloff, Black Friday (1940), Lugosi played an unconvincing crime boss. He had so little screen time that he could almost be considered an extra. In the following decade, his career cratered with the low-budget attempt at comedy Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla. A spoof on the mad scientist genre, the film tapped into a new science fiction fascination with gorillas gone wild. The few who saw the film perhaps remembered Lugosi’s Murders in the Rue Morgue. He certainly brought a little bit of the light of a dying star to the flop meant as a vehicle for comedians Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, forgotten celebrities whose act amounted to plagiarism of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis’s shtick. Bela Lugosi died on August 16, 1956. It’s a legend that the seventy-three-year-old asked to be buried in one of his several Dracula capes. But his family believed he would have wanted it so. They laid Lugosi to rest in the cloak of the vampire who stalked his career. The death of Lugosi came at a moment when American horror had undergone a complete transformation. A new sensibility emerged even while flying saucers hovered threateningly and giant mutations rose from their prehistoric sleep as humanity harnessed, and lost control of, the power of the atom. Audiences remained fascinated with such films and even flocked to revivals of the ideas about invasion and infiltration they represented. But American horror changed as the American empire changed. Lugosi’s White Zombie joined the Fu Manchu series in creating for Americans a Manichean world of supernatural villainy, a constant threat to American values. The Red Scare and the growing disaster of Vietnam convinced a significant portion of the American public that infiltrators and enemies lurked everywhere, even though the projection of American military and economic power—inciting coups, propping up dangerous regimes, arming proxy fighters, building a vast network of bases, airfields, and military prisons in client states and colonial possessions—encapsulated the real story of global politics. The sounds of the calliope continued to vibrate menacingly in the darkness as the 1970s began. Like the macabre traveling show of Bradbury’s imagination, things happened in the sightless black of America’s new night. Slasher films reanimated the murderous intent of empire for the big screen. A bizarre, seemingly premodern, obsession with demonic evil rode the backs of a generation. A razor-edged counterstroke by American militarism drowned the dreams of the sixties and seventies in bloody waters.",

      "content": "1.Unlucky Numbers THE CAMP counselor, stretched out on the bed in a postcoital fugue, chokes and gasps as an arrow explodes out of the front of his neck. Blood blossoms from the young actor’s body, a twenty-two-year-old named Kevin Bacon in his first film role. It’s 1980 and it’s Friday the 13th. Directed by Sean S. Cunningham, the film did not aim for social relevance. Made on the cheap for a little over half a million dollars, it earned 59 million at the box office, today about 250 million. The nasty little campfire story became a forty-year-old franchise with ten sequels, a reboot, and varied official and unofficial spin-offs across several media platforms, including PC and console games. In the 1980s, only the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise gave it much competition, leading inevitably to the cross-studio horror funfest of Freddy vs. Jason (2003). None of the sequels held the dark allure of the original. The 1980 premier treated anxious audiences to a believable beheading and a misshapen creature suddenly surfacing from a placid lake in a moment that squeezed several minutes of screams. In the days before CGI, pre–Jurassic Park entertainment, hundreds of thousands left the theater asking, “How did they do that?” Some had been so convinced by Bacon’s macabre death scene that rumors circulated the filmmakers “must have killed that person.”1 “I’m sitting here looking at pictures scattered all over my desk, looking at cut throats, and severed arms and people with bullet holes in them.” Tom Savini, the man who convinced some audiences that they’d witnessed an actual murder in Friday the 13th, described his workspace as looking like a crime scene. By the 1980s, with some apprehension, Savini wore the title “The King of Gore.” He preferred to think of himself as “a sorcerer who worked with illusions, sculptures, and mechanisms” to make horror come to life. He spent much of the 1970s earning this reputation before Friday the 13th took his effects mainstream.2 Eleven years before the surprise success of the low-budget film, Savini sat behind a bamboo barricade peering into the steaming Vietnamese night. In 1969, the man who would assault the senses of a generation was just a nervous kid. The heavy hot air and the smell of grease from his M60 machine gun mingled into an unpleasant aroma. The heat beaded his face with sweat. Savini had been assigned night watch for the camp perimeter against guerilla attacks from NLF insurgents.3 When, deep into the loud jungle night, a trip wire twanged a warning, he let loose with the thunderous roar of the M60, a weapon that spatters its heavy-caliber bullets at six hundred rounds a minute. All along the line, other crews with the heavy weapons opened up. Savini was required to contact headquarters before firing, but the tense anxiety of the night watch took over his reflexes. The powerful guns, and a grenade or two, devastated the dense tangle of tree and vine in front of their forward position. A duck had tripped the wire. And, in something of a metaphor for America’s invasion of Vietnam, the duck had somehow survived the punishing hail of gunfire and high explosives. “You didn’t even get the duck?” Savini’s commanding officer angrily wondered aloud. He did not get the duck and his lieutenant rotated him off guard duty. The next night, NLF soldiers overwhelmed the position, leaving Savini convinced that the lucky duck had saved his life. Savini wasn’t sure why he, or any other American, had been sent to Vietnam. He had enlisted because of the personal economic pressures of a new family and the likelihood he’d be drafted anyway. He primarily served as a combat photographer, taking pictures of ghastly images for after-action reports. He recalled that he viewed human bodies “blown nearly in half by a grenade blast,” unattached hands grasping the ground, and scattered body parts in the aftermath of a firefight. Savini writes that, “I felt a kind of safety behind my camera . . . Perhaps my mind was seeing it as special effects to protect me.” He spent much of the rest of his life behind the camera in one way or another. It may have given him a sense of safety, but the same cannot be said for his audience. Savini always displayed a thoughtfulness and sensitivity you would perhaps not expect from someone who began their career making convincing mock-ups of mutilated bodies. But almost half a century after the South Asian conflict, he remembered the impression the Vietnamese people made on him as heirs to a beautiful culture and country. He watched the wholesale destruction of the Vietnamese ecosystem and questioned the point of the war. Before leaving Vietnam, Savini saw American soda being sold in traditional villages to and by the American armed forces. Coca-Cola, that’s the reason his country sent him to South Asia, he later suggested. Savini’s anecdote may seem impressionistic to some. But he had witnessed a local phenomenon that symbolized a larger truth about America’s fight for capitalism in East Asia: they had brought it with them. So-called Ports a-Go-Go began arriving in South Vietnam in the early 1960s, prefabricated docks that, as early as late 1965, received nine million cans of soft drinks and beer.4 Savini would become the prince of special effects artists, rivaling Lon Chaney in his influence on the craft. Working with George A. Romero on Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Cunningham on Friday the 13th, he played an essential role in the new horror revolution of the eighties. In the years to come, as an actor and director as well as SFX maestro, Savini would bring his heavy splatter style to a series of movies very much out of step with the eerie optimism of the period. The uncertain, gory delights of late-twentieth-century horror offered the former combat photographer a way to not only deal with his demons but to bring them to life.5 Gradually, he became better known for the bizarre creatures he constructed. His monsters of hybridity affected audiences more deeply than the hyperreal productions of CGI, the creatures that look so unconvincing they appear encrusted on modern screens, like something you could scrape off if you had the right tool. Savini attributed his fascination with makeup effects to his experience in Vietnam, pointing out that his interest in SFX began during his working-class childhood in Pittsburgh. At the age of twelve, Savini went to his neighborhood theater, the Plaza, to see James Cagney portray Lon Chaney in Man of a Thousand Faces. He became obsessive about re-creating what he saw in 1950s horror comics, the photographs in Famous Monsters of Filmland, and any horror movie he could possibly watch. Then, like Ray Bradbury’s dark carnival rolling into town the year Halloween came early, “Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors” came to Pittsburgh in 1960. The once enormously popular show had been hobbled by changing tastes and time. But Savini loved it. He dressed as Dracula, and his convincing makeup led to his being invited on stage, adding to the magical monster show. He became a regular when Silkini came to town. A few years later, Savini fashioned his drill sergeant a realistic scar to frighten new recruits. He crafted fangs to entertain his buddies in Vietnam. While he makes it clear today that his interest in gore effects did not begin in Vietnam, he admits that his gruesome experiences there shaped the way he approached the making of a horror film. When creating an effect, his interest is always in terrifying realism. Beheaded corpses, skewered bodies, and cut throats must “give me that feeling I used to get when I’d see the real stuff.” When Savini watches a film, if the bloodletting and hideous creatures fail to evoke Vietnam, they simply don’t work. “It’s just not real enough for me,” he wrote. Too many scripts, he once off-handedly noted, feature the dead lying with closed eyes. Savini knew from the corpses he’d seen in Southeast Asia that the eyes of the dead are wide open, flash frozen in horror and surprise.6 The first Friday the 13th film appeared in an America far distant from the one Savini came home to in 1970. Many Americans lost interest in Vietnam as early as 1972, even as the Nixon administration continued to level North and South Vietnam with devastating bombing runs. This included the infamous Christmas Bombings of ’72, which incinerated large portions of Hanoi with twenty tons of explosives. But the American public tired of the war and its intractable issues. The crimes of the Nixon administration increasingly carved out space in print and televised media. The embattled president, obsessed with his alleged domestic enemies more than the obvious catastrophe of Vietnam, tried to spin the decades-long American failures in the region by insisting the United States finally achieved “peace with honor.” U.S. defeat in Vietnam became something of an unmentionable cultural secret. The idea of peace with honor clashed with what American TV audiences saw in April of 1975 as U.S. helicopters crashed, final CIA and army operatives fled unceremoniously from rooftops, and North Vietnamese troops and armored vehicles rolled into Saigon. Adding to the sense of a declining superpower, the 1970s became a decade of torpor, economic turmoil, free-floating anxiety, and even the possibility of apocalyptic catastrophe. By May 1, 1975, more Vietnam veterans committed suicide than died in the war itself. The images that haunted veterans became the images of what empire looks like on the ground, the horror it inflicts on its victims. Sergeant Lee Childress of the 206th Assault Helicopter Company remembered an elderly woman murdered by an American soldier because he believed she’d taken a stick of gum from him. “He shot her point-blank in the chest,” Childress recalled. “We got in more trouble for killing water buffalo than we did for killing people.” He told an interviewer he spent “every fucking day” asking “why? why?” He never found an answer, he admitted, and that left him with nothing but terror.7 Savini’s first special effects work after coming home became Deathdream (1974), also released under the titles Dead of Night and The Veteran. Director Bob Clark, who also made one of the ur-slashers, Black Christmas (1974), borrowed the primary conceit of the chilling W. W. Jacobs tale “The Monkey’s Paw” and presented an American soldier dying in Southeast Asia at the very moment his mother makes a portentous wish for his return. He does come back, but as a vampiric specter who can live only off blood. An especially macabre climax allowed Savini to put his talents, and his trauma, on full display. The tagline of the film? “Some boys never come home.” The darkness learned to follow even when the boys did come home. W. D. Ehrhart graduated high school in 1966 and immediately enlisted in the Marines. He did a tour of duty in Vietnam and fought in the bloody house-to-house fighting in the city of Hué in 1968. Following the war, he did with poetry what Savini had been able to do with make-up—cauterized his trauma while putting it on display before the American public. In the chilling poem “Making the Children Behave,” Ehrhart imagined how he and his comrades in arms left their shadowy memory in the villages of Vietnam, a tale of boogeymen now used to frighten bad children. “When they tell stories to their children / of the evil / that awaits misbehavior / is it me they conjure?” Some may have projected the horror on the experience of Vietnam itself, “a tragedy” often portrayed in popular media as a victimization of Americans. Veterans like Savini and Ehrhart imagined Americans themselves as the instigators of horror.8 Veterans returned to a country in turmoil. The center of a far-flung empire looked to have fallen into decay. The anti-war movement eventually brought together Americans of almost every background and staged the largest protests in the history of the country. In the United States, making money had always been the business of business. But by the end of the decade, a new kind of capitalism was born that continues to affect the work and paycheck of everyone reading this book. It became the foundation and the mechanics of the American empire, at home and abroad. Economic decline allowed business leaders to launch an assault on the American working class from which it never really recovered. Weary of providing benefits and livable wages to unionized workers, heads of large companies and their boards simply closed steel plants and automobile factories, and silenced the beating heart of American manufacturing from South Chicago to Youngstown.9 Gary, Indiana—once the home of U.S. Steel and a city where state and federal authorities deployed the military repeatedly throughout the twentieth century to successfully crush the labor movement—became an economic nightmare where unemployed steelworkers competed for jobs at fast food chains. Much of America in 1984 could be described as “medieval cities of rusting iron” with even the so-called Sun Belt losing textile mills at such a rapid rate that towns could be referred to “morgues” and sites of “rural malingering,” with oddly little comment that “malingering” might be the only option available to former workers. A 2010 study by MIT of 150 cities and towns described industrial powers houses like Buffalo, Cleveland, and Allentown as “dying cities.”10 If you found yourself in the Rust Belt or the Dirt Belt over the last several decades, the logic of the chain saw makes more sense than the promise of Amity Island. This perhaps explains why Tobe Hooper’s vision of the chain saw became one of the most remade, rebooted, and reimagined horror films of the last half century. These “rural malingerers” have been left behind, left out, and despised for their failure. The mad dance of Leatherface holds some appeal. As have the promises of a con artist who represents a parasitic class that destroyed entire social and cultural worlds with their mind-numbingly relentless financial monoculture. Yet, like a good horror film, he gives them an outlet to expend their rage and feel their fears. Millionaires became billionaires while cities died. Reaping massive profits from austerity measures that amounted to wage cuts and layoffs, corporate heads congratulated themselves on becoming “leaner” and showing “innovation and flexibility.” General Electric cut its total number of blue-collar employees by almost two hundred thousand in the early eighties. Rather than facing a backlash for what the newspeak called downsizing, CEO Jack Welch managed to become something of a folk hero who allegedly “saved the company” even though he enriched himself enormously without reinvesting in actual manufacturing. Auto exec Lee Iacocca wrote an enormous best-seller in which he became his own hagiographer. Iacocca also told a story of how he brought Chrysler from the precipice through hard work and allegedly rationalized free market principles. Some Republicans hoped he’d run for president. Few noticed that the salvation of a corporate entity created a crisis at the dinner table and the gas pump for workers whose wages stagnated while inflation exploded. Almost no one, certainly not Iacocca, noted that Chrysler’s salvation came from a government bailout.11 These changes in the economy opened the increasingly enormous economic gap in a country full of Gatsbys whose source of wealth remained mysterious and who did no labor in any meaningful sense. The maw between the nation’s richest and poorest had never grown wider than it did in the seventies and eighties, a trend that continues to worsen. Regions that built communities around manufacturing plants, support services for those factories, and neighborhoods where union membership had been at least as important as what house of worship you attended became haunted ruins. By 2020, Forbes magazine, not exactly an outlet of socialist propaganda, noted that 1 percent of the American population had fifteen times more wealth than the entire bottom 50 percent combined.12 So much of the country began to look like the set of a horror film. Perversely, many of these cities became the setting of horror films. East St. Louis provides an especially egregious example, a place of decline and social death that became part of America’s apocalyptic fears. Although the city struggled since the 1960s, white flight from the largely African American area drained the tax base. Freeways cut apart neighborhoods and community gathering spots. By the eighties and nineties, industries moved to the region only when offered massive subsidies and given allowance to operate as private jurisdictions, contributing nothing to the social safety net. The ravaged city became such a desolation that it earned the dubious honor of serving as the set for John Carpenter’s postapocalyptic film Escape from New York (1981). An associate producer recalled that, because the film was to be made cheaply, he and Carpenter had to go on a search for “the worst city in America.” East St. Louis, poisoned by decades of systemic racism, offered the “seedy run-down quality” of the bleak future of 1997 portrayed in the film.13 The uncertainties of the seventies, the sting of loss in Vietnam, and the cruelties inflicted on the American working class hid a very important fact. Wounded, the country healed like the mythic hydra, and not unlike that beast, its tentacles continued to encircle the globe. By 1975, the United States exhibited nearly full-spectrum dominance over much of the world’s capital, resources, and military supremacy. A vast network of American clients, military bases, and corporate power ensured that every human being on the planet, in one way or another, was forced to contend with the United States.14 This dominance in world affairs did nothing about the problems at home. In fact, the economic policy of empire benefited elites and not the nation-state as a whole. Steel workers and coal miners, not to mention fast food workers, do not benefit from the United States having a squeeze on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In fact, economic hegemony abroad whipsaws workers at home. In an especially reprehensible example, America’s global power allowed corporations to take the lash to some of the empire’s first victims. In 1965, Fairchild Semiconductor received government subsidies to open a plant on Navajo Nation land in New Mexico. Originally employing 1,200 Navajos, the plant laid them off after Bureau of Indian Affairs subsidies ended. The company replaced them with white workers. Protests in the early seventies by the American Indian Movement brought enough bad press to Fairchild that it simply closed the plant in 1975 and moved overseas.15 Americans who live in this ruined palace find themselves looking at the bloody face of American empire when they see their paychecks. The symptoms of a country that’s a behemoth abroad but an orphan at home are seen in a fifty-year trajectory of declining wages, growing rates of suicide, terrifying gun violence, and both white rural and Black urban communities torn apart by violence and drug abuse. Nightmares made flesh stalked our collective dream life. 2.Elm Street WES CRAVEN’S The Last House on the Left (1972) felt so real, and so contemporary, that audiences struggled to watch it. The Hills Have Eyes (1977) offered an excruciating journey of terror for a suburban family stranded in the desert and facing a family of violent cannibals, their misshapen forms created by American atomic testing. What monsters could the former professor of philosophy pull from the American psyche next? Walking to a meeting in downtown L.A. in 1982, Craven’s mind wandered as he ran through his agenda and pondered recent books he’d read about Indonesian “dream demons.” Kenin tindah, as it’s called in Indonesia, is the experience widely known as sleep paralysis that some attribute to supernatural forces. Dream demons on his mind, Craven also came across a bizarre story of dozens of cases of “arhythmic heart failure” among Hmong immigrants to the United States. The CIA recruited the Hmong leadership in Vietnam, who lent soldiers and regional support bases to the United States in exchange for help controlling the South Asian heroin trade. By the 1980s, many had come to the United States, fleeing persecution from Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge and the communist government of Laos. And, as Craven read in a 1987 story in the Los Angeles Times, many of their young people began to inexplicably die from heart failure, seemingly while trapped in a nightmare. The syndrome even received an acronym, SUNDS, or sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome.16 While he wondered how to transform this odd phenomenon into a new horror tale, a solid bump to Craven’s shoulder wrested him out of his dark reverie. He looked at the source of the collision and, as if in a close camera shot, discovered a terrifying face suddenly filling the frame. He seemed, in Craven’s memory, badly scarred, and the image of a burn victim came to mind. We don’t know the name or the background of the man who collided with Craven that day. The director remembered a filthy sweater and battered hat. But what he most recalled was a very quick glimpse of a disfigured face underneath the floppy fedora and the snarl on the man’s face at the suit in his way. The experience left Craven shaken, much more than it should have. In all likelihood, he only imagined the more lurid details of the chance encounter. Whatever the case, the incident became the final ingredient in the grisly cauldron that birthed Freddy Krueger. A Nightmare on Elm Street opened in 1984, less than a week after the nation elected Ronald Reagan to a second term. Fred Krueger, as he’s called through most of the first film, has returned from the grave after the parents of Elm Street lynched and burned him alive, believing him “a filthy child murderer.” In his grungy afterlife, Krueger can enter the dreams of the children of Elm Street. He tortures his prey in the bleakest regions of sleep before ripping them apart in flumes of blood and gore. In Nightmare, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) became one of the templates of the final girl, joining Laurie Strode from Halloween in the growing pantheon of young women who, unlike their friends or their parents, summoned the bravery and bearing to fight a monster. Teenagers being stalked by a murderer certainly offered nothing new. Even the idea of suburban America transforming into a slaughterhouse rather than the destination of whites in flight was previously explored by John Carpenter’s Halloween. But something even stranger happened on the Elm Street of the American mind. The sheer savagery of Krueger, combined with his supernatural origins, set him apart from the slasher films that came before. Tobe Hooper’s postindustrial serial killers deep in the heart of Texas are probably much more frightening. But a decade later, it was Fred Krueger’s origin story and its implications that raised a chill on America’s collective spine. The first film suggests the ambiguity we expect in a post-Watergate world. Are we supposed to trust the story of Nancy’s mother, one of the parents who burned the human Freddy alive? She’s a decidedly low-functioning alcoholic and the living avatar of an unreliable narrator. It’s from her we learn Krueger was a “filthy child murderer.” Nancy’s father (played by John Saxon) is a corrupt police officer who also wants to hide the truth of what happened. The other parents of Elm Street join the conspiracy. They keep the secret from their children, the secret of how they made a monster. The story of Krueger proved popular enough to make the character an icon. Six sequels followed Craven’s original film, the only one he directed, or had very much engagement with at all. Departing from the formula of the first film, Fred Krueger soon became “Freddy,” famous for the corny one-liners delivered as he dispatched his victims, most of them the epitome of excruciating dad jokes if dad guffawed while he ripped open your intestines with razor-sharp knives attached to his scarred fingers. Why did such an unpleasant creature become one of the eighties’ most recognizable images? There’s a sense in which the horror Craven spliced together from moral panic and poverty and a strange footnote to the Vietnam War didn’t fit the eighties. Perhaps the answer is in the inferior sequels. Their churlish use of violence and victims, turning them into little more than props for Freddy to slice and dice, fit into a decade remembered as much for its cruelty as for Thriller and John Hughes comedies. The callous attitude of the sequels pervaded America’s Elm Streets throughout the decade. Some middle-class Americans held on to and even improved their status from the Reagan to the Bush to the Clinton years. By the 1990s, ignoring restrictions and regulations placed on the stock market during the Great Depression, millions of small investors became miniature Michael Milkens, making tens of thousands while buyouts, the leveraging of credit, austerity measures, and the strip-mining of corporate assets by CEOs shoveled tens of billions into the coffers of a tiny class of Americans. Meanwhile, homelessness exploded. The drop in real wages and the physical destruction of low-income housing accounted for some of those who appeared on sidewalks and under bridges and in private shelters. A peculiar alliance between civil liberty advocates and conservative budget hawks closed institutions and tossed Americans suffering from drug addiction, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and even severe schizophrenia onto the streets. African American men, abandoned in their illness and completely indigent, made up a significant portion of this population. Vietnam veterans accounted for about 10 percent of the homeless population in the 1980s.17 Attitudes toward the homeless and the working poor (often the same population) made Freddy’s woeful appearance a portent and a cause for panic. Notably, many of the monsters who stalked the slasher films of the eighties are portrayed not as handsome well-dressed Ted Bundys, but as workers eager to see your insides. Michael Myers, an escaped mental patient, wore the one-piece overalls of a car mechanic as he wielded his butcher knife. Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th series, dresses in the sequels like a cross between a dirt farmer and bricklayer. This proletariat of monstrosity appears in the tendency of white America to project monstrosity onto its fellow citizens. Ronald Reagan spoke of “welfare queens” taking advantage of the system, parasites that fed off the blood of hard-working Americans. Other conservative writers went further in their use of monstrous imagery, finding language that portrayed the working class and people of color as unnatural terrors. James Q. Wilson called the young urban poor “feral” and “presocial beings.”18 In the same year Craven unleashed his nightmare on America’s Elm Street, the film C.H.U.D. made the subtext of Freddy Krueger the glaringly obvious point. The title, standing for cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers, imagined the homeless population of New York City turned into hideous Lovecraftian horrors that emerged from the sewers to feed on the flesh of luckier Americans. The tagline for the film resounded with Americans nervous about how the country’s class consensus might not survive the growing gap in wealth, even with the increased policing of the urban working class. “They’re not staying down there, anymore!” the film’s posters warned. Crime statistics frightened many Americans in the seventies as the tectonic shifts in the economy caused theft and the violence associated with underground drug economies to flourish. However, despite the general impression most middle-class Americans shared in the eighties and nineties, crime against property in America declined rapidly. It became increasingly unlikely that you’d die at the hands of a stranger made “feral” by “the inner city.” However, between 1980 and 2008, families, friends, and acquaintances murdered one another with prolific enthusiasm, accounting for far more death than “gang-related” murders. During this period, nearly 80 percent of murder victims knew their killer and almost 42 percent of female homicides came at the hands of a romantic partner.19 The Republican right didn’t birth these monsters of the American mind alone. “New Democrats” found an effective issue in portraying themselves as crimefighters who gave police unions anything they asked for, built prisons at an alarming rate to warehouse an enormous portion of the population, and passed federal laws that resulted in brutally lengthy internments for, primarily, African American men. Not unlike in the early twentieth century, white supremacy at home provided a foundation for empire abroad. In the 1980s, the nation continued its fascination with slasher films, fearful of the serial murderer who surely lived on their version of Elm Street. They’d moved to the suburbs hoping to escape the “Black youths” that academics and a racist legal system convinced them terrorized urban centers. The costs of empire on the home front are substantial. The CIA’s inveterate willingness to partner with drug lords made the “war on drugs” an assault on African American communities. Defense spending cannibalized the American GDP and threw the social safety net on the bonfire. While fearful of violence at home, middle-class Americans proved generally willing to acquiesce to the Reagan administration’s policy of strategic homicidal outbursts abroad. Elm Street’s nightmares engulfed the world. 3.Waiting for the Antichrist “‘FROM THE eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother till man exists no more.’ The book of Revelation predicted it all.” So goes a well-known quote from the film The Omen (1976). Many viewers then and now think it is a quote from the Bible. They’d been prepped for the horrors of a satanic apocalypse by an unlikely source. Hal Lindsey appeared to have been grown in the incubation pod that produced every young white male of the sixties and seventies. Foregoing coats and ties and speaking with an easy Southern California accent that rolled words around like they came in and out with the tide, he favored sunglasses, hair just below the collar, and a grandiose moustache. His lean, youthful face always seemed on the verge of telling you to take it easy. His work carried a rather different message. “Imagine, cities like London, Paris, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago—obliterated!” Making free with exclamation marks and proclaiming catastrophe in an “oh holy wow, geez!” style, Lindsey’s 1970 The Late Great Planet Earth told a bleak tale of the coming rise of the Antichrist, explained that the book of Revelation foretold a Soviet invasion of Israel, and predicted “Red China” mobilizing against much of the rest of the world. The Antichrist would arrive on the world scene after Satan staged a mockery of Christ’s resurrection. The ideas in The Late Great Planet Earth seemed new and exciting, a bit like new religious movements such as the Unification Church or “the Jesus People.” In this it resembled another mass paperback best-seller of the era, Erich von Däniken’s Chariots of the Gods? Däniken created an imagined deep past in which, with nothing resembling evidence, he claimed aliens once visited the earth and directed human beings on the path toward civilization, building pyramids and perhaps even giving us a bit of extraterrestrial DNA to ease along our evolutionary climb. Lindsey also created a fantasy, this one about a human future fading into the horizon of otherworldly events. Gods and demons would fight their wars over us rather than give us aid, and the result would be a mass extinction event rather than human progress. Readers who combined a general openness to unsubstantiated claims and felt helpless to understand the tumultuous twentieth century formed a large majority of both Lindsey’s and Däniken’s readership. The short, simply written paperbacks suited the boomers who came of age during the Vietnam years. The need to find your own path, even if that path led to doomsday, combined with a tincture of very real intellectual curiosity circulated ideas meant to, as the slang of the era put it, blow your mind. Unfortunately, critical thinking has not always been a partner in the business of blowing minds. Aliens bearing gifts to ancient civilizations and the Antichrist showing up to end the show became a single mishmash of contradictory conceptions of the world. We should remember the sixties generation as working with SNCC or joining the Black Panthers, Students for a Democratic Society, or the National Organization for Women. We’d do an injustice to them if we ignored the very real changes in law and society their protests and their struggles manifested. But it’s also true that much of this generation watched through Jimi Hendrix’s purple haze while the great American protest movements marched by. Tobe Hooper caught the mood of the boomers in Poltergeist (1982), in a scene in which the family patriarch lies across the bed to smoke a joint and, counterintuitively, picks up where he left off in Ronald Reagan’s campaign biography. The big chill, indeed. Nixon used the term silent majority to suggest a sleeping giant of American conservativism who watched anti-war protests and the Black freedom struggle with disdain. He may have been on to something when he noted that young people who wanted radical social transformation represented a minority, even within the so-called counterculture. Proponents of “do your own thing” often actually meant it. One’s own thing might include political activism but could also mean falling headfirst into LSD rabbit holes, free ranging as an Ayn Randian, or joining “the Jesus People” and becoming the constituency for the modern “casual worship” megachurches. As Kurt Anderson pointed out in his book Fantasyland, “if it feels good, do it” can be a liberatory cry from sexual and emotional repression while at the same time mean that paying yourself four hundred times what you pay your employees is just finding your own truth. Anderson concludes, looking from our contemporary vantage, that the ethos of believing and doing anything you wish “powered the political right more than the political left.”20 In their uncertainty and political immaturity, the baby boomers became seekers who didn’t know where to look, examples of how many of those who wander are actually just really lost. Growing up in the prosperous sixties afforded them the chance to dally with all manner of nonsense. Luckily for American institutions, many of them followed Stokely Carmichael, Fred Hampton, Susan Faludi, Bella Abzug, and Tom Hayden into revolutionary movements for meaningful change. But entering adulthood, the world became more confusing. Aliens built the pyramids and the great monoliths of Easter Island? Maybe. The Bible as a way to interpret the news? Why not. The notions Lindsey’s ideas of Biblical prophecy proffered didn’t originate with him; these underground ideas have been around since the nineteenth century. Renegade religious thinkers in England and the United States first imagined the Bible predicting a series of catastrophic events culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The tree they planted would grow tangled, its offshoots as disparate as American fundamentalism, the Pentecostals, and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. These groups held few beliefs in common—in fact, they tended to see one another as heretical—but they all believed fervently that the world would end, that it would end in a very specific way, and that you could read the signs of the end in your daily newspaper. American fundamentalism exerted significant influence in the South and Midwest for most of the twentieth century. Adherents tended to be rural and lack formal education, marginalized even in moments of American prosperity. Their low-wage labor made capitalism in America work as they fed the nation from their farms, toiled in twelve-hour shifts in Southern textile mills, and worked the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma to slake the petro-thirst of the white-collar class and the American war machine. Some of their leaders rose to prominence as ministers of large Sun Belt churches or seminary professors. But for the most part they lived under the nation’s cultural radar and played much the same role in politics. Why vote when the end was nigh? Major social and cultural changes brought this group to the suburbs in a story beyond the bounds of the one being told here. But Lindsey’s influence on American politics and popular culture gave the most exotic elements of the group’s belief system a fecund pile of theological compost where it could bud and flourish. He succeeded with several gambits that fit the times like a leisure suit. Lindsey had the notion, at once brilliant in execution and sophomoric in intent, of phrasing the rather complicated prophetic schema of fundamentalism in So Cal English. His seeming hatred for language benefitted from the commercially useful side effect of dumbing down complex eschatological notions for the sinners dancing through the decade’s disco inferno. He told them they could find biblical prophecy in the daily paper while searching for a soulmate who loved piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Lindsey casually took his audience by the hand with breezy anecdotes about how sitting out in the warm California evening while tiki torches cast a pleasant glow on the lemon trees and wondering when the dinner party would start was a lot like the desire “from the beginning of time . . . to know what is going to happen in the future.” He promised the return of Christ would be “the ultimate trip.” The use of supernatural power by the Antichrist would allow this incarnation of the devil to become “the Big Cheese” in world affairs.21 Horror films already prepped Americans for the Antichrist, even though they didn’t mean to do it. In 1968, Roman Polanski directed Rosemary’s Baby, a terrifying spoof of a horror film, a self-aware horror film long before Scream. The Satanists who offer a very young Mia Farrow as the devil’s bride are intentionally hilarious. There’s not a black robe in sight among the hokey, upper-middle-class elderly who keep Jokes for the John on a chain in their bathroom. But they are also eager to launch a satanic millennium. In the parody of drive-in Satanism Americans experienced in B-grade features over the last decade, Polanski followed a similar formula to the arty burlesque of The Fearless Vampire Killers of the year before. But the film disturbed many viewers with its mention of abortion and the claustrophobia of Rosemary’s confinement by her controlling husband and his half-baked devil-worshipping friends. Although known for his own poisonous attitudes toward women—a rage fully on display in his violent rape of a thirteen-year-old, which led him to flee the country—Polanski unwittingly made a bleak feminist parable. By 1968, Polanski already displayed an unhealthy interest in the isolation, really the imprisonment, of women by their own “hysteria” in Repulsion (1965). Turning to adapt a novel, he wrote a script that follows Ira Levin’s book very precisely and forced a different meaning to emerge from Rosemary’s Baby. The coven of Upper West Side devil worshippers exercises a paternalist supervision of Rosemary through her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes). The film ends in the brutal breaking of Rosemary, her acquiescence to the value of motherhood even if her offspring does happen to have hooves for feet. It’s a diabolical version of the “feminine mystique” described by Betty Friedan in her 1963 best-seller of the same name. Friedan described the way prosperous white culture in the years after World War II exalted pregnancy and motherhood until “there is no other way [a woman] can even dream about herself.”22 Inaccurately, Rosemary’s Baby would later be noted, or perhaps blamed, for a flood tide of interest in all things occult. The roots of such fascination are deeper and even more peculiar. The alleged “rise of Satanism” owed much to religious conservatives like Lindsey, who believed, as one of his book titles insisted, that Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth. As Lindsey continued to fascinate the world and build a highly profitable media empire that included more books, television, radio, and even comic book adaptations of his apocalyptic imaginings, he increasingly suggested that the end of the world looked a lot like the fears of white, middle-class Americans. “Biblical prophecy,” it turns out, held a special place in its millennialist heart for the American empire. Lindsey’s story of the signs of the end looked a great deal like America’s Cold War–era concerns, giving a vigorous handshake to the far right’s most paranoid fantasies. He writes of visiting an unnamed “large university” near his home and speaks with horror of seeing students distributing literature about the treatment of Palestinians under the Israeli occupation. Lindsey warned grimly that this showed “communist” influence on “‘wars of liberation’ in countries around the world.” What if, he suggested to readers, we see an alliance of “several black African nations” with “the Arabs”? What indeed. Lindsey doesn’t bother to explain, but we know from the rest of his best-selling tract that readers are meant to assume it has something to do with the Antichrist, Satan, and the end of the world.23 Millennial movements have flourished throughout much of Christianity’s history. In most cases, belief in the apocalypse pushed true believers to shed worldly concerns. Around the year 1000, the turn of the millennium convinced many of the devout in western Europe that the end had come. They sold their earthly goods and waited with hope and trepidation for the Kingdom of God. Radical sects during the upheavals of the Protestant Reformation held property together in common, foreswore allegiance to princes and kings, and dissolved marriage ties in anticipation of the end. Even in twentieth-century America, millennial groups sometimes followed the logic of their convictions. The Jehovah’s Witnesses saw World War I as the beginning of judgment on all the nations, including the United States. For this opinion, the group’s leadership cadre faced a prison term of twenty years under the 1917 Espionage Act. In the late twentieth century, the infectious idea of apocalypse created the opposite effect. Americans should, according to Lindsey, continue to worry about the future of capitalism. In the 1970s, Sino-Soviet relations may have been at a low ebb, but Lindsey warned his readers that the goal of both was “total world conquest” that would mean “the total destruction of the capitalist system.” Echoing what would become an American mantra about defeat in Vietnam, Lindsey spread the false claim that the United States fielded a powerful military that “politicians” did not allow it to use. Meanwhile, as if reading from the script of one of the Fu Manchu films, Lindsey told his readers that the battle of Armageddon would come when an “incredible Oriental army of 200 million” tried to destroy Israel.24 America’s geopolitical foes are the bad guys even in the apocalypse. America’s unqualified support for the state of Israel grew out of this period. The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 meant the fulfillment of biblical prophecy for evangelicals. Meanwhile, Israel provided a U.S. foothold in the world’s leading oil-producing region after the Six-Day War and a brief chilliness in its relationship to Saudi Arabia. The end of the world did not mean the end of the empire, and, in fact, Lindsey and his cohort again and again insisted on “America’s special place in biblical prophecy.” Rosemary’s Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen sent screaming demons into theaters all over the United States. The years the devil stalked moviegoers are the very years Lindsey, and soon boatloads of imitators, hawked a similarly terrifying and titillating tale. It told of apocalypse and the coming of the Antichrist, visions of dark prophecy first born in the deserts of the ancient Near East, repackaged to explain how the United States—hell, even its economic system and global military reach—sat at the center of God’s plan for the universe. The growing evangelical movement attached itself to this strange notion that the end was nigh. Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority emerged in the late seventies, a grassroots group of evangelical, and a few Catholic and Jewish, clergy and their congregants who became one of the more effective lobby groups in American politics. Falwell’s message that the 1960s represented a sinkhole of moral depravity grew in part out of his own repudiation of the civil rights movement. He had preached vehemently against the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, called Martin Luther King Jr. a communist, and founded Lynchburg Christian Academy as one of the South’s many “seg academies,” private schools launched in the midst of the integration of public schools in order to preserve “whites only” education.25 Nixon was wrong about a silent majority, but Falwell did tap into the fears of a silent and numerically impressive minority. For them, the rise of second-wave feminism, a stereotyped conception of hippies and young people smoking pot, the gains of the civil rights movement, American defeat in Vietnam, and the very real decline in wages and subsequent economic stagnation all became muddled in their minds as one phenomenon. Falwell gave them a simple explanation, an Appalachian version of Hal Lindsey, telling them the Bible had something to say about all the things that bothered them in the newspaper. Rural evangelicals may have believed the world was not their home and stayed away from the voting booths. Falwell’s Moral Majority brought them out to vote for Ronald Reagan in the hundreds of thousands, contributing to his unprecedented landslide over Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election. Falwell’s message to evangelicals brought together a pied-colored set of ideas that seemed to have little consistency. Christian morality, he believed, called for women to take a subordinate role in marriage and society and for taxes to remain low. The United States had, he claimed, drifted away from God, but this heathen nation also needed to increase its defense spending exponentially. Prayers should begin every day of public school, and America should flex its military might in the Middle East. Conflicting, contradictory, and counterintuitive ideas didn’t matter. The religious right’s worldview fit with Reagan’s message of traditional virtues and America the omnipotent. The backlash against the progressive gains of the 1960s has never really left American politics. The idea of America in decline remained part of the Moral Majority’s message, even as the colossal power of the country touched nearly every corner of the globe. While Americans watched truck commercials from Reagan ally Lee Iacocca that asserted “the pride is back,” evidence mounted that the new president would make sure America’s client states and rivals alike knew that the United States would put boots on the ground and bombers in the air. Reagan wondered aloud in a phone call with an Israeli lobbyist if the end of the world approached and if “the signs foretelling Armageddon” might be true. He certainly wanted to make sure the United States came out on top of any apocalyptic struggle.26 4.Serpents and Rainbows GEORGE H. W. BUSH had, before becoming vice president, called Reagan’s notion of free market adventurism “voodoo economics.” He found the term ready at hand with so much talk of voodoo in the air in the 1980s, so much that it rivaled the American thirties and forties. In American theaters of the eighties, fear of Caribbean dark magic made it seem like the midcentury zombie made an unfortunate comeback. Major films like The Believers, starring Martin Sheen, portrayed Cuban Santeria as a dangerous death cult flourishing in Florida, not unrelated to the American panic of “satanic covens” out to sacrifice everything from your house cat to your kid. An interest in the often frighteningly exploitative cannibal genre shared this imperial view of primitive peoples up to no good. Italian films like Cannibal Holocaust (1980) and Cannibal Ferox (1981) found an audience with the VHS generation. These unwatchable films not only showed buckets of fake gore and some very nasty, and very real, animal cruelty. They also assumed a vile racism that suggested to American viewers that Latin America was lousy with cannibals. Haiti remained a special American obsession. In Angel Heart (1987), Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet dance with the devil in the form of Robert De Niro, who uses New Orleans voodoo to entrap souls. Angel Heart pulled out all the stops in using stereotypes of Haitian voodoo, tying it to depraved sexuality, murder, and a general sensibility of “primitivism” not too dissimilar from what Americans once watched in White Zombie or King of the Zombies. The Wes Craven–directed The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) is a film set in Haiti and loosely, very loosely, based on a popular book by ethnobotanist Wade Davis. The story centers around Bill Pullman, portraying an extremely handsome anthropologist action hero, investigating the possibility of creating a “super anesthetic” from the concoction of powders he believes accounts for the phenomenon of Haitian zombies. Pullman’s character, Alan, arrives in Haiti in the waning days of the regime of “Baby Doc” Duvalier, the dictator of Haiti in the 1980s, long propped up by the United States, as was his father, known as Papa Doc. The Duvaliers ruled Haiti since 1957 and received significant American support. The U.S. Marines trained the Duvalier family’s terrifying Tonton Macoute in 1959. An organization somewhere between a secret police and paramilitary force, utterly loyal to the Duvalier family, they took their name from a frightening Haitian fairy-tale monster that carries off unruly children to cannibalize them in the night. Duvalier’s private army lived up to their name, disappearing political opponents and their supporters in the small hours. Under their vicious commander Luckner Cambronne, who earned the nickname “Vampire of the Caribbean” for his cruelty, they engaged in systemic violence against the Haitian people, murdering as many as sixty thousand Haitians during the Duvaliers’ twenty-nine-year reign. We do not have adequate statistics of the mass rapes or random assaults, mayhem, and murders that made the Macoute deeply feared.27 Papa Doc was followed by his son “Baby Doc” Duvalier, who ruled with the same mixture of fringe Vodun beliefs and political terror, along with an even closer relationship to the United States. Both father and son had, at different times, offered some symbolic statements of independence from the United States and even an attenuated Black nationalism. This posturing hid their role in the American plan to encircle Cuba both economically and geographically. Craven certainly had a great deal to work with in terms of real-world political suppression mixed with the hint of supernatural evil. Vodun had long been an important spiritual tradition in Haiti. But like most spiritual traditions, it can be used as a weapon. The Duvalier dictatorship did just that, encouraging the people to see themselves and the Macoute as Vodun masters (bokor) who would work wicked conjure on anyone who defied the regime. Davis suggested that Duvalier had managed to bring the regional heads of Vodun societies under his sway (bizango) and created what he called “a shadow government” that kept the people frightened and obedient.28 Critics noticed the film’s political subtext. The February 5, 1988, review in The New York Times described the film’s plot as dependent on the crimes of the Duvalier regime and the reputation of “the dreaded Tontons Macoute security force.” The review also offered the important insight that the politics of the film likely felt “confusing” to viewers. The Serpent and the Rainbow is a very different film from White Zombie or other B-grade fare from the earlier decades that offered simple messages of white supremacy. Haitian characters are given personal agency. A Haitian doctor, Marielle Duchamp, assists Pullman’s Harvard botanist in the struggle against the Tonton Macoute leader Peytraud, revealed to be a bokor (literally a wizard who will “work with both hands,” performing good and evil for money) who tortures his own people and, of course, turns them into zombies. Peytraud offered audiences a serious and convincing villain, unlike the many earlier European zombie masters. He’s balanced by Celine, a houngan priest of Vodun who represents the positive aspects of the religious tradition. Although Craven’s liberal impulses are certainly on display, The Serpent and the Rainbow ultimately acts to justify the American empire. Pullman’s Dr. Alan remains the hero throughout and he, not the Haitian houngan, defeats Peytraud at the end and rescues Dr. Duchamp as well. In another poorly considered plot point, Duchamp becomes Alan’s sidekick and lover. This is highly fraught in a context where colonization had always meant sexual exploitation by white men, from the days of enslaved people in the sugarcane fields through the country’s history of invasion and occupation by first French forces in the early nineteenth century and then multiple U.S. interventions in the twentieth. The final scene in The Serpent and the Rainbow shows us a celebration in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, as the people gleefully take their vengeance on the Tonton Macoute. This revolt against Duvalier’s regime did occur in 1986, much to the consternation of the Reagan administration, who had so valued Duvalier’s anti-Cuban, anti-communist stance that it used the American taxpayers’ money to fund his two-million-dollar wedding. The real cost of U.S. support for the Duvaliers had been paid by the Haitian people. Along with backing the Duvaliers’ use of terror, the U.S. agricultural department had called for the killing of the country’s entire pig population after an outbreak of swine flu. Duvalier acquiesced, and Haitian peasants, the majority of the country, saw their tiny incomes evaporate. By 1983, an organized challenge to Duvalier’s regime emerged and a full-fledged uprising occurred in January of 1986. The CIA provided Duvalier with a plan to escape to France with his family, where he went into an early retirement with a fortune of as much as eight hundred million dollars U.S.29 In the climactic celebration of The Serpent and Rainbow, Dr. Duchamp turns to Pullman’s white savior and in the last line of the film says, “the nightmare is over!” The man who had given us an ongoing nightmare on America’s Elm Street perhaps couldn’t be trusted as the most reliable forecaster for the shadowy climate of dream and nightmare. For Haiti, and much of the Caribbean, the American imperial nightmare continued. Lesser, and more explicitly racist, imitators followed. Voodoo Dolls (1991) could have been made in the 1950s, its Black male villain wearing bones around his neck and proving his perfidy by lusting after a white woman. The 1984 Zombie Island Massacre kills its zombie in the first fifteen minutes and largely exists to indulge the decade’s fascination with gratuitous female nudity. Yet, it still made it clear to audiences that the “exotic islands” (maybe the Caribbean, maybe the Pacific) are filled with dangerous native magic threatening to white people. Audiences may have devoured these films and their racist implications right along with their popcorn, not giving much thought to either. But reviewers took notice. The renowned critic Roger Ebert began his 1987 review of The Believers by saying “Here’s another one of those movies where a Caribbean voodoo cult wants to practice a blood sacrifice . . . Can’t they think of anything new to make a movie about?” Ebert went on to confess his own ignorance of the Caribbean religion, and notably he does use the generic American slang voodoo to talk about Cuban Santeria. But he reminded his readers that usually when Hollywood dealt with religion it told a story of “peace and love and friendship.” But this new raft of films “are always about guys with blank eyes who stare at you for 10 seconds and you’re volunteering to wring the chickens’ necks yourself.”30 The return of this subgenre of horror, the Caribbean zombi suddenly as popular as George A. Romero’s apocalyptic hordes, didn’t reflect on American politics. It represented a new funhouse mirror of the dark carnival that legitimized and justified racism at home while weaponizing American power abroad. It distracted from the zombie republics the United States continued to create abroad with the necromancy of corporate and military power. Moreover, the films constructed an ugly fantasy about dangers to the empire’s heartland. The United States, often celebrating itself as a “nation of immigrants,” has also been the nation of anti-immigrant sentiment. Along with the bleak irony of racism toward the forced immigrants of West Africa, distaste for the Chinese people (and Asians more generally) became a feature of nineteenth- and twentieth-century life. Racism directed at Mexican and other Latinx peoples oozed into public life even in parts of the West where Mexicans became “immigrants” only after the United States seized half their nation in the late 1840s and thousands found themselves on the wrong side of their own border. A new round of nativism emerged, particularly focused on Haitians and other Caribbean immigrants. During the 1970s, tens of thousands of Haitians, fleeing the Duvalier regime, arrived in all manner of rickety vessels in an effort to enter the United States. The Coast Guard returned many. Others allowed to enter spent months in detention centers with barbed wire fences, a practice ruled illegal by a federal court in 1982. The year 1980 became the high-water mark of attempted Haitian immigration with about fifteen thousand Haitians entering the country. Detained and not told of their right to request political asylum, they faced racial prejudice and the false belief that the new immigrants bore responsibility for the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The Reagan administration further undercut efforts by immigrants fleeing a catastrophe the United States helped to create by refusing to admit that political repression occurred in Haiti. Indeed, records of discussions in the Reagan White House reveal administration officials taking a hard line against Haitian immigrants, and Caribbean immigrants in general, referring to them in a 1981 memo as “undesirables.”31 American prejudices against immigrants found another focus in the Mariel boatlift (April to October 1980). Slightly improved relations between Cuba and the United States had led Fidel Castro to decree that any Cuban who had a U.S. contact could leave from Mariel Harbor. More than fifteen thousand did so in a few weeks, overwhelming U.S. immigration services. The Cuban government certainly benefitted from this, getting rid of political dissidents, and simultaneously handing the U.S. government an influx of tens of thousands of new immigrants in a short period. Carter used the Coast Guard to blockade the island, but Castro’s goals had been achieved. There’s no doubt that he decided on a “love it or leave it” attitude toward the migrants and found it an effective way to poke at the United States, whose intelligence operatives attempted to assassinate him at least sixteen times between 1962 and 2014.32 The Mariel boatlift, and the ongoing story of the “Haitian boat people,” seemed a new danger to many white Americans. Latin America remained nightmare country in the white supremacist imagination, only palatable when firmly under American imperial control. Puerto Rico continued to be a colony of the United States, and successive Democratic and Republican administrations denied it representation of any kind, including electoral votes. Unlike Hawaii and Alaska, it did not have a white majority. Hollywood responded with all manner of racist caricatures of everything south of Texas and Florida. Angel Heart featured tough-talking detectives referring to Haitians as being “into voodoo and all that shit.” Films like the enormously popular Scarface (1983) may have glamorized Al Pacino’s Tony Montana as the ultimate OG for some. Mainstream audiences read it as a manic coming-to-America story that portrayed Cuban immigrants as vicious, violent criminals. The far right continues to make use of the myth of Castro emptying out prisons and mental institutions, and even sending spies, into the United States. As he began to eye a political career in 2011, Donald Trump repeated the baseless claim and compared it to immigration from Mexico. In the Trump administration, it became a talking point for Stephen Miller, Trump’s speechwriter and advisor who has ties to various white supremacist organizations and leaders.33 5.Ain’t Got Time to Bleed WHITE AMERICANS, agitated by the movies, now worried their island neighbors were zombie-raising witch doctors with a penchant for communism. So they tended to support their government as it flexed its muscles in the Caribbean and Latin America. The 1983 invasion of Grenada received condemnation from around the world even as it elicited cheers at home. Although seven thousand American troops landed on the island, they faced more of a struggle than expected from the tiny number of Cuban soldiers and construction workers. Nineteen American service members died and more than one hundred were wounded in a protracted firefight, some from friendly fire and operational accidents. Cuban resistance brought down nine U.S. helicopters. Despite this deadly misadventure, the military handed out no less than 8,612 medals for the operation.34 “Our days of weakness are over,” Reagan announced in the debacle’s aftermath, “our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall.” This assertion aside, Reagan’s renowned rhetorical powers failed him. At first, he insisted the assault had been “a rescue” rather than “an invasion,” an attempt to get out American medical students who, it turned out, did not want to leave. Reagan tried to shift the story by claiming the island had been on the brink of becoming “a Soviet-Cuban base” that would “export terrorism.” In this version, Reagan could assure Americans they arrived “just in time.”35 Horror films at this time played out such fantasies in a fashion not dissimilar from the horror science fiction of the fifties, featuring Americans tangling with evil forces amid steaming jungles in exotic, nameless lands. The best, or perhaps the worst, example is the film Predator (1987). Arnold Schwarzenegger played a covert ops specialist everyone simply calls Dutch (Ronald Reagan’s nickname in the real world) while Carl Weathers portrayed CIA agent Dillon, who co-opts Dutch’s outfit for a rescue mission “across the border” in an unfriendly, unnamed Latin American nation. (The context and the year essentially tell us covert operations are based in Honduras and entering Nicaragua.) The first forty-five minutes of Predator offers a right-wing black ops fantasy about a dirty war. Dutch and Dillon lead their small band into the jungle and assault a camp of guerillas, slaughtering them with relative ease. Dillon discovers “secret documents” that explain that “Soviet advisors” are on the way. “We got here just in time,” he says, echoing Reagan’s claims after the invasion of Grenada. The film makes numerous visual and direct references to Vietnam. Both Dutch and Dillon are veterans, and Dillon tells the brawny character Blain (played by wrestler and later governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura) that the two had fought together in Vietnam, specifically the costly Battle of Hue. Not only is Blain unimpressed, he spits on Dillon’s boot. It’s an incredibly peculiar moment given the long-lived myth that Vietnam veterans returned to be “spit on by hippies.” In Predator, the black ops soldiers of America’s dirty wars are the ones who spit on Vietnam veterans. Making the scene even stranger, we learn that Ventura’s character had been in Cambodia and up to no good in the 1970s, fighting a secret war with the CIA while the draftees lost in Vietnam. Like most action films in the eighties, Predator burns testosterone like jet fuel with lots of cigar chomping, dramatic hundred-yard stares, and Ventura delivering lines like “I ain’t got time to bleed.” In fact, he finds plenty of time to bleed when the film’s titular monster appears and rips most of his internal organs out of his body. The Predator, which a short scene reveals to be an extraterrestrial, can camouflage himself with invisibility and packs an array of frightening weaponry. It’s the compendium of American fears in Vietnam and other imperial adventures that dates to the wars against First Nations peoples. There’s an enemy striking from the shadows with unrestrained ferocity, and who knows what weapons they might be able to use against us? The film’s setting in an indeterminate jungle places it alongside Bride of the Gorilla and King of the Zombies as films that imagined Americans fighting the good fight against overwhelming odds in frightening and geographically amorphous jungles. Predator received much bigger box office numbers than those films, however, becoming number one in June of ’87 and raking in many times its budget while spawning a franchise of sequels, comics, and video games, one of the latter appearing as recently as 2020. Film critic Dean Lamanna dismissed Predator in Cinefantastique as a “militarized monster movie.” But clearly the America public responded to this fantasy of American foreign policy. Sure, the nightly news might be trying to tell us about U.S.-funded death squads in Central America or the incompetent invasion of a tiny island for reasons even Reagan struggled to explain. But this popcorn flick showed Dutch standing toe to toe with the alien menace in the film’s silly climax and winning. The eighties and nineties represent a continuation of the country’s long belief, stretching back to the Monroe Doctrine (1823), that Latin America belonged in its sphere of influence. The Reagan years became an active convalescence period in which public opinion sought therapy for “the Vietnam syndrome,” a phrase Reagan used to describe an alleged weakness of nerve in American foreign policy after 1975. In a bleak irony, psychiatrists originally used the phrase to describe the snake’s nest of symptoms Vietnam veterans experienced, symptoms defined as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980. The dirty wars of Latin America offered a new jungle to refight Vietnam. Meanwhile, American culture would also find itself in a dirty war at home, its collateral damage igniting similar horrors in American allies and client states. 6.God Is Dead! Satan Lives! TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD ERICKA Ingram of Olympia, Washington, attended a spiritual retreat in the summer of 1988. Many young people in this period, from teenagers to twentysomethings, became attracted to what has usually been called Charismatic Christianity, a spiritual movement that emphasizes divine healing, the casting out of demons, and other miraculous spiritual gifts (charismatic coming from the New Testament Greek word for “gifts” rather than from our modern usage). Amid late-night sing-alongs and bull sessions that made the retreat like a Christian summer camp experience, the organizers invited a former stand-up comedian turned minister and alleged healer named Karla Franko to speak. One of the charisms that Franko claimed to exercise was a gift of discernment, a kind of divination allegedly guided by the Holy Spirit. During a worship service, Franko pointed to Ericka and told her she had been molested by her father. Ericka cried but reportedly did not respond to this bizarre assertion. Several weeks after this incident, Ericka and her younger sister Julie accused their father of not only molesting them, but also forcing them to take part in sickening satanic rituals, and even sacrificing victims to the devil and burying the bodies under a barn in the family’s backyard. Local police arrested their father based only on these accusations, but the oddity of the case didn’t end there. Ericka and Julie’s father, Paul Ingram, worked in the Thurston County Sherriff’s Office for nearly seventeen years, headed the local Republican Party, and served as a stalwart member of the family’s fundamentalist congregation, the Church of Living Water. Ingram himself slowly began to believe that he had, in fact, done precisely what his daughters accused him of and gave a meandering, contradictory confession. What happened in the apparently happy household? Did the head of a satanic cult viciously abuse his daughters then hide in plain sight as one of Olympia’s most respected citizens? Had Satanists, as Ingram’s daughters suggested, infiltrated a police department and the entire community?36 None of these sensational claims held even a trifling amount of truth. Forensic experts did not find bodies concealed under the old barn. Both daughters proved unreliable witnesses with increasingly erratic accusations about judges, police, and social workers who also belonged to their father’s satanic cult. Ericka claimed to be scarred over much of her body from years of abuse, but a medical exam revealed no evidence of physical trauma—a fact she explained away by suggesting Satan made the wounds invisible. Paul Ingram’s “confession” was in part suggested to him by the family’s pastor, who urged him to believe he’d been possessed by demons and could not recall the hideous acts committed through him. Ingram would remain in prison until 2003 and was forced to register as a sex offender at the time of his release.37 The Ingram daughters, though morally and perhaps legally culpable for a series of false accusations, became victims of a national fantasy. Like millions of Americans, they were utterly convinced that satanic covens operated freely in Reagan’s America. A satanic panic had seized up the country’s central nervous system. The origins of the satanic panic are complex. Rumors of Satanists mutilating cattle became common in the 1970s. Tales of mysterious cattle mutilation had long been a feature of ranch life in the American West. Cows are, of course, rather low on the world’s food chain, frequently victims of wolves, coyotes, or venomous snakes. Smaller predators then devour the softer bits of the corpse in a way that makes it appear “mutilated.” Such acts were often blamed on Native American people and later, after the forties and fifties, flying saucer mania, as evidence of extraterrestrial activity. Satan’s new role as box office star gave the legend a plot and a script. Rosemary’s Baby, meant as a parody of social conventions about pregnancy, left many convinced of the reality of satanic covens, believing that even your neighbors could be in on the plot. Horror films dealing with the devil have played a powerful and unconventional role in shaping what Americans are willing to believe. The Exorcist made parish phones ring off the hook all around the country after 1973. The Omen, despite borrowing only selectively from Hal Lindsey and his readers’ end-of-the-world fetish, confirmed that the devil and his offspring prepared for the final conflict, a phrase that became the subtitle of the third sequel. An obsession with murderous cults further shaped the Satanism scare. The Manson murders were ascribed to devil worship in all manner of public accounts of the crimes, even if Satan did not play a particularly important role in Charles Manson’s peculiar blend of mysticism and murder. However, both Ed Sanders and Maury Terry, with no evidence but the lack of evidence they were wrong, helped spread this notion. In fact, Terry’s career of misinformation recently received a popular, highly cynical, “true crime” documentary on Netflix called The Sons of Sam in which we hear his meandering conceptions of links between Manson, David Berkowitz, and murderous gangs of devil-worshippers presented in a slick fashion likely to confuse a new generation of Americans. These ideas may have remained in the hazy twilight world of pop theology, what contemporary people think they know about religion from what they see at the movies, nervousness about those damn hippies, and a very generalized fear of social change in the sixties. But the political climate of the 1980s, one in which religion mixed indiscriminately with governance and the president felt comfortable calling our nuclear rival “an evil empire,” allowed the ancient concept of Satan to seem very real. Anxiety about empire played a larger role in the Satanism scare than historians, modern folklorists, and sociologists have conceded in the past. Like ancient Rome panicking over the frenzied cult of the Bacchae, Americans whispered tales of evil cults, serial killers, and secret covens. Roman angst over the worship of the Greek god Dionysus came, like their fear of Christianity, from a sense that foreign, evil influences could introduce chaos into the machinery of empire. In eighties America, the idea of an omnicompetent Satanist conspiracy tied together a vast number of fears, anxieties, and hatreds related to the changing role of women, the sexual revolution, the Cold War, and the American empire walking with a noticeable limp in the post-Vietnam era. And so the United States experienced a mass delusion. Across the country, claims of a well-organized criminal network of Satanists seized the darkest parts of the religious imagination. Books appeared like Michelle Remembers, whose author claimed her psychiatrist (and later husband) Lawrence Pazder enabled her to recover memories of a childhood filled with the most bizarre forms of sexualized, ritualized abuse. Other influential books followed, many by evangelicals who suddenly became “occult experts.” Accusations that children fell victim to satanic covens exploded, especially at day care centers. The McMartin preschool case in Manhattan Beach, California, became the longest trial in American history. Law enforcement and a covey of evangelical ministers encouraged parents in the belief that their children had been victims of Satanists who used the preschool as a front. In hundreds of communities, rumors of Satanists holding Black Mass in the woods sometimes brought out armed posses of citizens on a hunt for the alleged coven.38 In 1988, police in Jamestown, New York, contended with a massive rumor panic that led to attacks on a warehouse used as a practice space for local bands, armed vigilantes showing up at a local park, and the rumor that a Satanic cult planned to sacrifice a blue-eyed, blonde virgin on Friday the thirteenth. In the local paper, law enforcement insisted they found no evidence of any kind of secretive, criminal activity, which further incited the panic. Locals saw police denials as an odd sort of proof that either they did not wish to panic the community about a real threat, or that the police were in fact part of the conspiracy. But, as often as not, American law enforcement fanned these flames. One exhaustive study of police involvement in the satanic panic called Occult Cops found many law enforcement officers setting themselves up as “occult experts.” Almost all fit a basic template: male, white, deeply conservative, born-again Protestants aggrieved at their inability to rise higher in the law enforcement hierarchy, careers often dead-ended by their own lack of interest in the nuts and bolts of basic police work. Many of these men played some role in the prosecution of anti-war protestors and Black freedom struggle organizations in the sixties and seventies.39 The “occult experts,” often collaborating with evangelical leaders who also pretended knowledge of a vast Satanist conspiracy, held enormous influence over public perception and even the training of police. In 1987, Greenville County, South Carolina, law enforcement took a training course in combatting Satanism. Along with a description of occult symbols clearly borrowed from films, officers received a course in fundamentalist theology. The manual accused Christian churches of having not taken the existence of the devil seriously. The course provided absolutely no information, except in the most general terms (“reports from around the country”), that human sacrifice, particularly of children, was taking place on a large scale.40 The support of local officials and police departments linked with a surprising number of therapists and social workers now attached to the notion of Satanic ritual abuse, or SRA, as a social and psychological phenomenon. Although today rejected by mental health professionals, the idea created a surprisingly large network of supporters and sometimes made for the oddest of political alliances. Gloria Steinem believed stories of “ritual abuse” and, as late as 1993, published an issue of Ms. magazine with the cover story demanding the reader “BELIEVE IT! Cult Ritual Abuse Exists.”41 We’ve barely touched on the hundreds of local outbreaks or the related moral panic over heavy metal music and Dungeons & Dragons. Luckily, the era of “the satanic panic” has received a significant amount of attention and for good reasons. Except for America’s cyclical “red scares,” a moral panic that at least found some basis in the rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union, no other falsehood in U.S. history became so widely believed. In some quarters, to raise doubts about the existence of a powerful satanic conspiracy became proof you were in on it. American imperial power assured that Satanism scares in the metropole slithered into the colonies and client states abroad. The reverberation of the satanic panic was seen around the world, nowhere more than in parts of Africa where the United States maintained a strong military and, for a century, missionary presence. American special forces and the CIA engaged in covert operations all over the continent of Africa in the seventies and eighties, just as they had in the earlier days of the Cold War. The United States supported a South African invasion of Angola to end a civil war there when the leftist National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) seemed on the verge of winning on the ground and in the hearts and minds of Angolans. A declassified National Security Council document, though heavily redacted, shows Henry Kissinger and President Ford discussing an arms package to Angola’s right-wing guerrillas and their South African supporters. The document raises the possibility of allowing the state of Angola to collapse rather than take a socialist turn. Ford later attempted to change the narrative of America’s involvement by explaining that the United States intervened only after Fidel Castro sent Cuban forces to aid FNLA, a claim that does not match the timeline of events. Other declassified documents reveal that Kissinger urged an air strike against Cuba for aiding African revolutionaries.42 As U.S. money, arms, and assets swarmed over the continent, evangelical missionaries brought an American brand of Christianity, and an American terror of Satan, to the continent. “Charismatic” churches in particular took their emphasis on deliverance from demons and combined them with an African worldview of a universe throbbing with various kinds of supernatural powers. These variants of American Christianity saw exponential growth in numerous African nations, with scholars even referring to a “Pentecostal explosion” on the continent.43 Apartheid South Africa had long been viewed as an important Cold War American ally. Desperate to defend the racist social structures that penned Black South Africans into “homelands,” the white supremacist government of South Africa also proved reliably anti-communist. Thanks to a series of arms deals with Israel, it also formed an alliance with the bulwark of U.S. policy in the Middle East.44 America also gave South Africa a bad case of the satanic panic. Not surprisingly, it appeared in a highly racialized form. As the system of apartheid increasingly came under attack and global support flowed to the imprisoned Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress, white South Africans (Afrikaners) became convinced that Satanic rituals, which they often conflated with traditional African religious practices, threatened their children with “rape, murder, cannibalism and all manner of atrocities.”45 The white-dominated government started an Occult Related Crimes Unit, headed by evangelical Christian Adriaan Vlok. The unit would later be broken up and replaced by essentially the same organization with a more rational-sounding name, the Harmful Religious Practices Unit. Since 2012, this police organization kept the satanic panic alive by claiming to investigate “vampirism,” cases of possession, and that perpetual obstacle to the rule of law . . . “astral coercion.” America’s satanic panic made its way to Africa as mass culture as well. A film produced with the help of Charismatic missionaries became popular in Nigeria in the early 1990s. Living in Bondage took African folklore and combined it with Western notions of Satan. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the book Snatched from Darkness became a best-seller. The evidence-free screed closely followed the template of American evangelicals in claiming a large satanic conspiracy, brewed dangerously with some traditional African beliefs about witchcraft and evil spirits. Over the decades, the cost to the people of Africa has been enormous, with tens of thousands executed for witchcraft, and Christian leaders in, for example, Uganda fighting for legislation that would make being an LGBTQ person a crime punishable by death.46 The imperial dimension of America’s Satan obsession also appeared, not surprisingly, on the troubled southern border. The United States had long seen Mexico as a source of anxiety, sending invading armies across the Rio Grande to make amphibious assaults at Veracruz, or alternatively trying to wall off their neighbor. “So far from God, so close to the United States,” runs the weary Mexican joke. In 1989, Americans latched on to a horrific story that coiled together their nervousness about the border and the satanic panic. An American college student, Mark Kilroy, went missing while spring breaking in Matamoros, a province just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Local authorities discovered his body, along with fourteen others, buried in a mass grave. All the corpses bore evidence of torture. American media reported the death of Kilroy as the work of “a drug cult” or a “satanic cult.” Even the restrained reporting of The New York Times quoted Brownsville officials claiming an “occult” group sought to create “a magical shield” around themselves with “a twisted blend of sacrificial and black magic practices from Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica.” The Mexicans had sacrificed a fresh-faced American youth to Satan.47 The facts of the case are no less grisly than fans of the satanic panic believed, though the truth does not fulfil their strange fantasies. Adolfo Constanzo, the head of the drug ring responsible for the murders, did present himself to natives of the region, and some of his own henchmen, as a practitioner of “black magic.” However, not unlike a miniature version of the Duvalier regime, he claimed supernatural power only to inspire fear and obedience. And his inspiration for this idea? A horror film fan, he particularly enjoyed The Believers (1987), which mixed its Hollywood schlock and shock with a smattering of ideas stolen from traditional African religions in Cuba. In the feedback loop of the satanic panic, America produced films about evil cults that provided fodder for drug lords, whose actions in turn fueled Satanism fever.48 7.Norman Rockwell Is Burning in Hell THE SATANIC panic offered the Reagan administration a perfect Greenbaum effect. Not unlike the illusory notions about flying saucers and invading aliens, the panic made Americans open to all manner of false conspiracy theories. Much like the 1950s, these public obsessions allowed actual conspiracies to flourish. Once again, Americans proved themselves willing to listen to baseless assertions, and express some belief in them, even as the national security state and the executive branch hatched more complex, but very real, intrigues to further the demands of the American empire. During this era, Corydon Hammond, at one time a leading figure at the University of Utah School of Medicine, made a career with his tales of the satanic Greenbaum, a wandering Jew with ties to Nazism. He often insisted to his rapt listeners that he feared assassination for the “secrets” he shared. Hammond managed to draw NASA and the Mafia into his League of Super Evil Evildoers.49 The deluded ideas of QAnon have the DNA of Hammond’s claims, particularly his insistence that satanic kill squads kidnapped, programmed, and sometimes sacrificed kids on American army bases. These same groups, Hammond told therapists, also made money from drugs and arms sales. Such notions offered a gift to America’s intelligence community. There may have been no Satanists involved in gunrunning, but the CIA and the Reagan administration certainly sold armaments for advantage and security interests, sans the black robes and pentagrams. In a century’s worth of criminal behavior on behalf of the American empire, the Iran-Contra affair (1985–1987) stands out. Its reality is dark enough. The fact that it did not become a new Watergate and instead set the stage for open, unpunished criminality at the highest levels of government makes the story feel all too contemporary. The Sandinista National Liberation Front seized power from the far-right and deeply repressive Somoza regime of Nicaragua in 1979. They named themselves after Augusto Sandino, who had led opposition to an American invasion of Nicaragua in the late twenties and again in the thirties. The Sandinista regime became largely popular in Nicaragua, instituting rural health care and a major literacy program. In 1984, the country held a free election that consolidated Sandinista power. Most Americans were not aware of the events in Nicaragua, and few probably cared. But the Reagan administration held the absolute conviction that, against a great deal of evidence, the Soviets turned Nicaragua into a satellite. The CIA trained anti-government forces across the border in the client state of Honduras. These forces, the Contras, started as a ragtag group of mercenaries and criminals. American handlers turned them into something much more lethal. The CIA urged the guerrillas to attack “soft targets”—rural schools and medical clinics—that would endanger Sandinista popularity. Duane “Dewey” Clarridge, American liaison on the ground, admitted to Congress that the Contras executed doctors, nurses, teachers, and judges. “After all,” he said of these illegal covert operations against civilians, “this is a war.”50 The Reagan administration funded these horrors in secret, hidden from the American people and Congressional oversight. Congress passed the Boland Amendment in 1982 forbidding the funding of anti-Sandinista forces. The Reagan administration circumvented Congress. A secret enclave within the administration and the intelligence community used hundreds of millions in loans from American ally Saudi Arabia and raised hundreds of millions more in illegal arms sales to Iran. In their view, the secret arms deal with Iran paid double dividends, raising money for the Contras and securing the release of American hostages held in Lebanon (though religious extremists in Iran quickly took more hostages for future collateral against the United States). Cash now flowed to the Contra leadership through the hands of drug traffickers (including CIA asset Manual Noriega) and various non-state actors. These covert operations allowed the United States to stage-manage a Nicaraguan “civil war” that otherwise would not have existed. Israel, which joined the United States as one of the world’s leading arms dealers, even participated in the effort, doing business on behalf of the United States with its sworn enemy Iran.51 Oliver North, a marine who suffered severe trauma in Vietnam and subsequently turned to fundamentalist Christianity for succor, directed much of the program, coordinating with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and the CIA. North gathered a remarkably unsavory group of drug dealers, including Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and Félix Rodriguez, an international terrorist and CIA asset who exploded a bomb on a civilian Cuban passenger jet in 1976 that killed seventy-three people. Rodriguez worked with the CIA since the Bay of Pigs invasion and aided Bolivian authorities in the murder of Che Guevara in 1967.52 In October of 1986, a young Nicaraguan soldier downed an American cargo plane with a ground-to-air missile launcher. Nicaraguan investigators discovered the plane packed with sophisticated weapons systems intended for the Contras. The survivor of the downed aircraft, former marine and CIA agent Eugene Hasenfus, sang like a bird at daybreak about the entire story of arms for hostages, illegal fund transfers, and the role of some of the worst international terrorists on the planet in the Unites States’ effort to stage a civil war.53 The Iranian government, as Reagan’s advisors should have realized, proved more than happy to tell the world their side of the story. A special counsel launched an investigation, as did Congress. Reagan’s advisors George Shultz and James Baker warned the president from the beginning that the plot constituted a textbook example of an impeachable offense.54 CIA director William J. Casey and George H. W. Bush reassured Reagan but the evidence of “high crimes and misdemeanors” grew exponentially. After learning that, without the knowledge of Congress and even other branches of the armed services, the CIA had mined Nicaragua’s harbors, right-wing stalwart Barry Goldwater angrily denounced the administration’s actions. The infamously fiery Goldwater declared himself “utterly pissed off” that the United States had broken international law and committed an act of war.55 The outcome of the scandal—it rivaled and perhaps surpassed Watergate in its breadth—reveals much about America in the 1980s. Fourteen administration officials received federal indictments and the courts convicted eleven for a range of crimes that sound like a laundry list of charges appropriate for a RICO case leveled against organized crime figures rather than a political scandal. Twelve indictments of major government figures followed, North himself facing sixteen counts of felony. Yet, Bush I survived the controversy to win the presidency in 1988, and by then, Iran-Contra ceased to be an issue. Bush as president pardoned everyone convicted in the conspiracy. North became a right-wing celebrity complete with book deals and eventually a profitable relationship with Fox News.56 Writer-director Mick Garris (Sleepwalkers, Nightmare Cinema) once summed up the horror films of the seventies and eighties as “Norman Rockwell goes to hell.” These films responded to an American empire whose citizens felt powerless and baffled as the luckiest enjoyed the fruits of citizenship in a country that ran the world. Tens of millions of people bought into the idea of a detailed conspiracy of satanic networks controlling the media, the UN, and law enforcement but could not be bothered to thoughtfully examine the details of a conspiracy of arms, drugs, and Bond-level villains responsible for the death and maiming of tens of thousands.57 But, in the Reagan years, keeping America’s large and ever-growing sphere of influence toeing the line was not enough. Full-spectrum dominance, much like the dreams of the aeronautics industry and sci-fi films from the fifties once imagined, needed to include outer space. 8.Space, the Wild Frontier ROBERT A. HEINLEIN drifted into a strange solipsism in the seventies and eighties. In the 1960s, his novel beloved by the Manson Family, Stranger in a Strange Land, became required reading for the counterculture. They found its themes of polyamory and individualism attractive without exactly realizing the far-right politics that attended the call to hedonism. Okay, boomer. After the success of this novel, Heinlein’s work became increasingly mystical. By the eighties, his books exhibited a stream-of-consciousness quality and a narrative voice that made them read less like novels than papal encyclicals on limited government, religion, and sexuality. Indeed, Heinlein fans listened to his pronouncements as if they came ex cathedra. Even his admirers found these works produced from about 1980 until his death in 1988 barely readable, as if the philosophical underpinnings of Heinlein’s worldview began to take over his authorial voice. His libertarianism became metaphysical. The stories ceased to be stories and became elaborations of the inner self known to the world as Robert A. Heinlein. The results proved not only awful, they are pitiable. The Number of the Beast (1980) solves its plot problems with the intervention of Glinda the Good Witch, a deus ex malefica as laughable as it is pompous. Even good ideas like Job: A Comedy of Justice (1984), which promised a rollicking parody of organized religion, inflicted on readers a ghastly plod in which the narrator himself, who is essentially Heinlein, seems to believe he’s God. To Sail Beyond the Sunset (1987) suggests that smoking a joint represents the height of moral depravity, while a father having sex with his daughter might be fine, depending on context. If his writing faltered in a morass of narcissism, Heinlein remained politically committed at a time when his dreams of a scrawny social contract but a muscular military seemed to have come true. In 1980, he served on the rather harmless-sounding Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy along with protégé Jerry Pournelle. The Department of Defense had given the working group significant influence to help outline space policy for the Reagan administration. This would have costly and frightening implications. Since the Kennedy administration, many Americans held an idealistic image of NASA, and the space program more generally, as dedicated to science and exploration. These ideals had certainly been part of NASA’s conception of itself. But the agency was also tied irrevocably to the nation’s burgeoning national security state. Beginning in 1957 with the Soviet launch of the first satellite, Sputnik 1, American efforts to rocket orbital vehicles and eventually humans into space entwined with the Cold War and American imperial hopes. It chilled CIA officials to the bone that Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first man in space, sent greetings to the national liberation movements in Africa as he passed over the continent. The United States had been up to its elbows in some earthbound dirty tricks of gunrunning and assassination to try to suppress these very movements now being hailed from orbit on the Vostok 1. The national security state organized NASA in 1958, creating it literally in the shadow of Sputnik. From the moment of its inception, the organization cooperated closely with the military. A series of documents appeared in 2015 that showed that, at its inception, NASA worked closely with the CIA. Acting CIA director and air force general Charles P. Cabell contacted administrators of the space program regarding intelligence sharing even before Congress officially brought NASA into existence. Satellites ostensibly collecting data on weather, geological activity, and oceanic patterns also harvested any data they could on the Soviets. The space agency even aided the CIA in analyzing that raw intelligence. NASA officials meanwhile helped float cover stories for CIA projects like the U-2 and the A-12 jets, both agencies insisting that the spy planes served only scientific purposes.58 The relationship among covert operations, NASA, and the American search for imperial invincibility came together in the desire to militarize space. Heinlein’s vision of space marines exterminating the enemy with extreme prejudice was not far off the mark. After Sputnik, the United States made threatening moves against the Soviets by placing missiles in Italy and Turkey. Meanwhile, NASA not only worked hand in glove with the CIA but earned a place at the budgetary table by joining the Pentagon’s effort to develop rocketry able to deliver a heavier payload of nuclear mayhem. Heinlein’s protégé Jerry Pournelle not only continued as a prolific author of sci-fi horror but also became part of the national security establishment with his West Point textbook on strategy in the nuclear age. Although some of his ideas for America’s aerospace/military industrial complex seem like plot summaries for his science fiction novels (such as his involvement in a group wanting to send paramilitary American colonists into space in hive-like colonies), he would have outsized influence on the new Republican administration that brought the country closer to the brink of nuclear holocaust than any time since the 1960s. Pournelle supported not only Reagan’s well-known social conservatism but also his desire to expand American military might—not only across the world but very literally into orbit. In the early eighties he joined his fellow sci-fi writer Dean Ing in publishing a book that revived the right-wing fantasy of the United States creating orbital superweapons. Entitled Mutually Assured Survival, it carried an endorsement from Reagan himself. The actual text, sci-fi author Thomas M. Disch wrote in The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World, reads like the specs for “the technological background” of one of Pournelle’s own “space operas.” The book called for, among other weaponry technologically impossible at the time, laser cannons that would use orbital mirrors to rain destruction down on the Soviets or the Chinese. In this dystopian vision, satellites would become little more than weapons stations that used “kinetic energy” to destroy America’s enemies.59 This might seem like the harmless rantings of sci-fi writers who managed to claw a blurb out of the president’s press secretary. That is, if the Reagan administration had not sought out Pournelle to help advertise precisely the kind of superweapons imagined in his fiction. Pournelle worked closely on the policy and the rhetoric of Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), dismissed as “Star Wars” by Senator Ted Kennedy. Reagan offered the perfect vessel for sci-fi militarists. J. Hoberman makes the case that, given his background in Hollywood, no president better understood how the movies nestle close to our worldviews, shaping politics and personal identity. In the summer of 1981, with Raiders of the Lost Ark owning the box office, American F-14 fighters brought down two Libyan jets in a show of force against a North African nation known for its support of attacks on Americans. After receiving the news, Reagan pantomimed a performance of Indiana Jones pulling his revolver and shooting dead an Arab swordsman that American audiences were currently applauding in theaters. “Reagan isn’t our movie,” Hoberman wrote at the time, “we are his: America the movie.”60 Right-wing writers of violent science fiction thus found the Reagan administration generally amenable to the cinematic possibilities of taking war into space. The president’s own understanding of the universe outside our atmospheric bubble largely seemed shaped by movies he’d seen. He once asked Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze if the Soviets would work with the United States against an alien threat. Even more bizarrely, he raised the issue with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1985 Geneva arms reduction talks. Colin Powell admitted that Reagan’s “little green men” interest was well known and thought it came from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).61 Pournelle and his confederates found their guy when it came to the imperial fantasy life. Thirty billion dollars would be thrown at SDI, part of the reason that the United States tripled its budget deficits by the end of the Reagan years. Ideas for an orbital ballistic missile system went so far as to imagine a system of lasers guiding advanced rockets to strike down Russian warheads while still in orbit. Pournelle worked as a part-time speechwriter for Reagan on the issue of SDI. He also provided a crucial link with the aerospace industry, which added to the billions they already made in government contracts for expensive, highly technical weapon systems.62 SDI always remained more of a political fantasy and a public relations stunt than an actual military initiative. But it proved an expensive, and enduring, fantasy. In order to sell the idea, NASA produced “computer models” that essentially used video game technology to create a scenario in which orbital war platforms took out Soviet ICBMs like a teenage arcade wizard. In fact, it’s hard not to see these presentations as heavily influenced by WarGames (1983), a film that imagines a similar scenario and that fascinated Reagan. But these were not representations of technology that actually existed. They were quite literally, as news reports often noted with either delight or cynicism, the “stuff of science fiction.” As Reagan himself lost interest in a program that no reputable scientist believed would ever work, the vision of full-spectrum American dominance slowly transmogrified into an idea for a limited anti-ballistic missile system that made the rounds during the George W. Bush administration. The right wing of science fiction, started by Heinlein but now really led by Pournelle, remained active. Under their influence, the most extreme conservatives became some of the space program’s strongest advocates. Newt Gingrich, the powerful Speaker of the House through most of the Clinton years, had a soft spot for using sci-fi weapons to destroy the monsters he saw threatening America. He coauthored a book with conservative science fiction writer David Drake, one of the practitioners of the “space marine” genre. Their Window of Opportunity: A Blueprint for the Future featured an introduction written by Pournelle and a call for colonizing space with American capitalism and militarism—what Pournelle called a practical application “of the principles that make this nation great” that “proves that we can all get rich” off of space. In 1994, the year the Republican-controlled Congress imposed severe austerity programs on America’s already macerated social programs, Gingrich told readers in his book To Renew America that “aerospace engineer and science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle” had assured him that “space tourism” would become a normal part of American life by 2020. How this would be possible in an America where Gingrich’s, and to a large degree his nemesis, moderate Democrat Bill Clinton’s, slash-and-burn approach to social welfare had caused tens of millions to hurtle below the poverty line is never explained. Their “tough on crime” rhetoric increased the incarceration of Americans, especially African Americans. For-profit prisons became the reality of the American future and not Gingrich’s claim that “honeymoons in space” would be “in vogue” in the year I write these words. Perhaps it’s pleasing to him that a few billionaires funding jumps into orbit, rather than letting their wealth “trickle down” or “create wealth,” has become a new pastime.63 Heinlein died in 1988 but his progeny sallied forth to spin violent survivalist fantasies, slaughtering aliens and humans alike who threatened libertarian values. William R. Forstchen, a ghostwriter for Newt Gingrich, published Star Voyager Academy in 1994. Directly plagiarizing ideas from Heinlein, particularly from Starship Troopers and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Forstchen imagined a new American revolution in which colonists on the moon revolt against Earth over high taxes. Pournelle wrote a popular series of space marine novels, the Falkenberg’s Legion series, that are thinly disguised tracts for some of his more savage political views. Gingrich himself attempted an alternative history called 1945 that imagines a world in which Hitler wins and the United States must race against time to develop the atomic bomb before the victorious Nazi state. Alternate histories of World War II (and most every major historical event) have created some sci-fi masterpieces, most notably Philip K. Dick’s 1962 The Man in the High Castle. Gingrich found a way to make the scenario boring. The Republican lawmaker’s book made the case for the mantra of nineties Republicans, and plenty of the era’s “new Democrats,” that “big government” had to come to an end. Gingrich’s 1945 turns into a fictionalized plea for the United States to give away billions to the aeronautics industry but offer no supervision or regulation for what the John Galt–ish entrepreneurs do with the money. The political hectoring may have been only part of the book’s problem. Like so much of the Heinlein fanfic published over the decades, 1945 may disdain big government but it loves big weapons in an exceptionally weird fashion. In one passage so purple it feels like a bad bruise, the superweapons of Gingrich’s fantasy world are “dark” and “compelling” but give the military tech enthusiast who created them the feeling of “being aroused by a woman one despised.” Gingrich has continued to trouble the world with sci-fi and historical fiction, including racist reimaginings of the Civil War and paranoid delusions about Pearl Harbor. Such ramblings would be beneath notice except that he, like so many other authors of murderous science fiction, kept exceedingly odd involvements with the American military that went beyond his role in the House. Gingrich has frequently taught at the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks and in fact has been the long-serving member of the Joint Warfighting Committee that’s supposed to sharpen the strategic thinking of officers preparing to serve at the Pentagon’s highest echelons. Other than his long-standing desire to strip-mine outer space and kill anything that resists, it’s unclear what kind of strategic thinking Gingrich brought to the table. 9.They Live THE 1980S can feel like a 1950s remake, if perhaps even more paranoid. A new red scare, and deep anxiety over the use of atomic weapons, followed Reagan’s hard-nosed approach to the Soviets. The movies often reflected such notions, in films like Predator but also in other genres. Heartbreak Ridge (1986) starring Clint Eastwood presented an utterly false picture of the Grenada invasion. Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) quite literally refought (and won) the Vietnam War. Mass culture seemed on the side of Reagan’s worldview. But horror’s taste for the subversive slithered around since its origin point in the 1920s. There are hundreds of examples of horror as escapism or horror managing to buttress Americans’ myopic view of the world and their place in it. This makes efforts in the rather conformist decade to ask fans to question the basic values of empire even more exceptional. Larry Cohen’s The Stuff has become an independent horror classic, with restored editions appearing more than thirty years after its 1985 release. The Jewish director, horrified by his family’s tales of the Holocaust and his own sense of alienation in America, already used horror to question America’s obsessions with its children and its willingness to destroy the environment with the murderous infants of his It’s Alive! series. Eclectic and inventive, he’d worked on Black cinema classics like Bone and Black Caesar while using horror to make an early “defund the police” statement in Maniac Cop (1988). The Stuff makes a nightmare of American militarism and its relation to corporate power. The actual stuff of the title turns out to be a self-aware parfait that everyone in America needs very badly. Cohen fills the strange film with commercials so real they transcend parody. The titular weird goop became the ultimate commodity fetish. Americans needed it. Americans needed to eat it. Consuming the stuff, as much as they could muscle into their gullets, became a kind of moral imperative, a duty of citizenship with ads assuring people that it will “give a new order to life.” At a time when Reagan urged Americans to believe in “the magic of the marketplace,” The Stuff suggested that there’s a dark gramarye at work and the consumer is being consumed. Cohen succeeded in questioning America’s effort to bring its nightmare of consumption to the rest of the world with the character Colonel Spears, who seems unaware the United States lost the Vietnam War. George A. Romero’s Day of the Dead (1985) came amid the second Reagan administration’s full-throated support for counterrevolution in Nicaragua and years of anti-Soviet rhetoric that continued the polyphonic themes of the Soviet Union as “an evil empire” and the United States as the primary force for good in the world. Day of the Dead, though it received less attention than the earlier Romero zombie films, became the most biting satire of the trilogy. In it, the American military are maniacal bullies, little more than aspirant warlords in a ruined America. At a moment when SDI suggested that science, industry, and the Pentagon could work together to produce a defensive shield for an invulnerable nation, Romero made the scientists either utterly insane or placed them at contretemps with the violent, undisciplined military. The film turned out to be the only commercial failure in Romero’s first zombie trilogy. A yuppie America didn’t care for this approach given the new fetish for the military even in the aftermath of Vietnam. “Horror is radical,” Romero told an interviewer, “[it can] rattle your cage and say, wait a minute—look at things differently.” Americans did not want to see such films in a decade when even geopolitical nightmares like the possibility of a foreign invasion, such as in Red Dawn (1984), are given a soporific ending.64 In 1988, John Carpenter directed They Live, now a cult classic that offers the most intriguing horror movie of the eighties in terms of creating a compelling plot while wearing its politics on its sleeve. In the film, a homeless construction worker named Nada (“nobody” or “nothing”) comes into possession of a pair of high-tech specs that allow him to see America for what it really is. The earth, we learn, has been secretly invaded by aliens who have lived among us for some time. The shades Nada wears reveal the actual messages received from billboards and magazines, all commands from our unseen masters. An advertisement for a vacation that shows a sultry woman in a bathing suit stretched languorously on the beach really says MARRY AND REPRODUCE. Looking at a magazine rack, the covers splashed with gadgets, cars, and supermodels, Nada’s glasses show him they order the reader to OBEY, STAY ASLEEP, and simply SHOP. Meanwhile the president, who Nada discovers is also an alien trying to keep people “asleep” with consumerism, not only looks but sounds like Reagan. “It’s a new morning in America. Fresh Vital,” he says, directly alluding to the 1984 Reagan commercial “Morning in America.” Carpenter described They Live as his response “to the Reagan years” and in particular to “the unrestrained capitalism of the era.” Popular culture acquiesced to Reaganomics and American foreign policy. At the time, Carpenter remembers, Michael Douglas could deliver his famous line “Greed is good” in the 1987 film Wall Street, which read to many as a motto instead of a parody. “I wanted to make some political statements,” Carpenter recalled, during a time when “everybody is proud to be an American if they can make money at it.”65 The coming of the 1990s did not bring a new social consciousness. The efforts of cultural critics working in numerous fields—the writing of Noam Chomsky, the activism of Cornel West, and the satirical horror of Carpenter and Romero—found little purchase. Romero, Cohen, and Carpenter used horror to ask questions and, especially in the case of Carpenter, demand a response. But few listened. Americans entered a new era in which the small footprint of the American empire became a heavy boot on the world’s face, even as the social contract at home continued to unravel. The explosive violence of America’s empire not only continued its lethal trajectory, its velocity accelerated. The end of the Cold War did not bring a “peace dividend.” Facing no conceivable rival on earth as the Red Army disappeared into history’s mists after 1991, the Pentagon and its enormously wealthy corporate partners did not stand down. The United States developed and sold new weapons technologies, built more military bases to control more points on the globe, and developed Space Command as a joint project of all the armed services, dedicated to creating killer satellites and cyber war capabilities. Few Americans even knew about Space Command, a forerunner of today’s Space Force, even though it receives mention in the 1996 film Independence Day. Horror awakened dormant nightmares in the nineties, an era that didn’t seem too bad if you were white and enjoyed relative economic prosperity. Amity Island felt okay, really just fine. But the chain saw brattled in the century’s twilight.",

      "content": "1.Do You Like Scary Movies? HORROR TOOK a holiday in the 1990s. Maybe. There’s a consensus that horror’s golden age of the seventies and eighties withered in the more optimistic decade of tech start-ups and stock market ebullience. George A. Romero’s zombies shambled off the stage after 1985’s Day of the Dead, not rising again until the twenty-first century. Critics prematurely declared the slasher film dead, forgetting that the monster always returns. Stephen King remained a best-selling author, though fantasy, science fiction, and realism became the genres most attractive to many of the same fans who had once voraciously read Salem’s Lot, The Stand, Pet Sematary, and Christine. The Green Mile (1999), a wistful story of supernatural healing and redemption, became King’s big hit at the box office. Devoted fans will remind you of some of the new directions taken by classic directors and a new conception of paranormal and gothic horror that suited the fascination with unquiet spirits, demons, and indeed angels that haunted, infested, and flitted around the echoing portal of a new millennium. Apocalyptic films gained some popularity, often mixing genres as in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle End of Days (1999), in which the action hero goes after the Antichrist, guns ablazin’, a crossover event between Die Hard and The Book of Revelation. But Forrest Gump, not Freddy Krueger, won the hearts of Americans in the 1990s. Sentimental and nostalgic, the film reimagined American history and blended it with magical realism to spin a sugared confection of innocence, goodness, and the easily falsifiable notion that there is a God who looks out for fools and little children. The story of a mentally challenged white Southerner with naivete matched only by his gift to align the universe with his wishes, the film takes us on a highly redacted tour of almost fifty years of American history. Audiences left the film charmed as Tom Hanks became an avatar for tens of millions who remained as befuddled as the protagonist about American life. Gump becomes an unsophisticated witness to desegregation, the Vietnam War, and numerous political assassinations. He maintains his innocence through it all and emerges from the bloodbath of history unscathed. Meanwhile, his friends drop like flies. Following the stereotype of so many of the era’s horror films, the Black guy dies first. Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson), a fellow Alabamian who bears the curse of becoming close to Gump in Vietnam, dies with his hands full of his own viscera. The graphic scene in this PG film would have been excised from the era’s slasher films that the Motion Picture Association often threatened with the new NC-17 rating. Shrimp-loving Bubba Blue is far from the film’s only sacrificial offering. The love of Gump’s life, Jenny, also dies in the 1980s. She has been “promiscuous” and done some drugs during the sexual revolution and so dies of an unnamed “disease.” This apparently references the decade’s AIDS epidemic that killed nearly ninety thousand Americans before the Reagan administration even acknowledged its existence in 1988. Again, as with the popular reading of slasher movies, dare to enjoy sex outside of marriage and it’s one, two, Freddy’s coming for you. Gump, meanwhile, becomes wealthy by being an early investor in what he refers to as a “fruit company” called Apple. This gives him the time to sit on park benches and explain to people trying to catch a bus to their low-wage, labor-intensive jobs that “life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.” “It takes a heart of stone to love Forrest Gump,” wrote Mark Edmundson in his book from the nineties and about the nineties called Nightmare on Main Street. This may seem far harsher than even my own judgment of a film still much-beloved after almost thirty years. But, as Edmundson points out, there’s something truly hateful about the sentimental film. What we see in that film is white America blissful in its own ignorance, a kind of blind cruelty in grasping at a vision of the world only possible to citizens of an invincible empire. Edmundson insists that the narrative is not about the adorable Gump. It’s a story about how the United States “despite a few wayward incidents, is still a grand place to live.” At a moment in American history when the gap between wealth and poverty yawned wider than at any time since the 1890s, Edmundson rightly says that the film represented the dangerous idea “that dull virtue in tandem with humble, unresenting poverty is well rewarded.” A decade in which the United States carried out violent interventions that killed thousands of civilians, and corporations joined in the mass incarceration of young Black men in the creation of for-profit prisons, does not suggest a world that’s a box of candy.1 The success of the saccharine film perfectly twinned a politically drowsy decade. Americans, white Americans at least, proved willing to forgive and forget the “wayward incidents” of their country’s past. Despite the 1980s’ reputation for conservatism, well-earned in many respects, the decade also featured the powerful grassroots Nuclear Freeze movement, the Sanctuary movement that sheltered Latin America refugees, and protests against U.S. intervention in Nicaragua and El Salvador by groups such as Witness for Peace. Many of these movements withered after Iran-Contra and the end of the Reagan administration. More important, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a sense of optimism among the white middle class that rose throughout the decade, charging ahead alongside the super-heated stock market driven by Clinton’s international trade deals. This somnolence among the body politic belied the strenuous military adventurism of the decade. The pattern first appeared in the Bush years as a new incarnation of Reagan’s efforts to end the alleged Vietnam Syndrome. In 1989, Bush’s Operation Just Cause removed the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Little reporting appeared in the mainstream press to explain the necessity of this sudden military intervention that amounted to the kidnapping of a foreign leader. Neither did major news outlets give much space to the even more mysterious fact that Noriega had long been an asset of the CIA, receiving up to two hundred thousand dollars in personal funds. He was kicked off the agency’s payroll under the Carter administration (1977–1981) but immediately began receiving funding again in 1981 with the influence of former CIA director George H. W. Bush.2 Operation Desert Storm (1991) often now simply called the “first invasion of Iraq,” set the tone for the decade, one that had its roots in the first stirrings of America’s empire after World War I and would have consequences deep into our future. A truly ludicrous affair, the rise of twenty-four-hour news, particularly CNN, made the conflict in the Gulf into one of the most popular wars in American history. Public opinion, unhindered by facts and context, discovered another “good war,” a simple struggle between good and evil. If the invasion of Grenada had been a slightly off-kilter Broadway show with decidedly mixed reviews, the Gulf War became a multi-billion-dollar special effects–laden blockbuster, rivaling Jaws and Star Wars in the cineplex of the American mind. Iraq and Saddam Hussein’s journey to becoming a new monster to replace the Soviet Union had more than a few dramatic twists and turns. Hussein had ruled Iraq as a despot since 1979. He kept no particular ideology, other than what he crazy-quilted together from a vague socialism and a strident nationalism peppered with an occasional reference to the Qur’an. His utter malice toward any opposition became the dominant characteristic of his regime, his dictatorship leading Iraq into a devasting war with Iran that lasted most of the eighties. He cultivated an increasingly absurd cult of personality, creating statues and images of himself that rivalled Stalin’s mania for similar official accolades. A joke among Iraqis, told quietly in a country where the ruler’s security services killed a quarter of a million people between 1979 and 2003, ran that the population of the country recently burgeoned to thirty-four million people . . . seventeen million Iraqis and seventeen million portraits of Hussein.3 Hussein may have been a son of a bitch, but from the standpoint of America’s national security establishment, he was our son of a bitch. Donald Rumsfeld, then serving the Reagan administration as special envoy to the Middle East, made two personal visits to Hussein at a time when the United States provided Iraq with billions in agricultural credits, making Iraq the fourth largest recipient of U.S. aid in the world.4 Support for Hussein in his war against Iran went beyond foodstuffs. The Department of Defense, working hand in glove with the CIA, provided Iraq with satellite photography surveillance of Iranian military movements. Even more damning, the DOD sold Iraq chemical precursors to produce mustard gas and sarin gas. Retired senior intelligence official Colonel Walter P. Lang asserted that the United States would not countenance the use of chemical weapons against civilians but that, in the Iran-Iraq war, “[their] use against military objectives was seen as inevitable.” In 1988, Hussein did use deadly chemicals against the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq. Neither the CIA nor American armed forces played a direct role in this attack and the Reagan administration officially condemned it. Then Vice President Bush argued against continuing chemical weapon precursors to Iraq. But a full investigative report in The New York Times revealed real dissension in the administration over continued support for Hussein even after he made it clear he was a genocidal monster.5 Hussein could claim limited success in his war with Iran, despite enormous casualties and crippling debt to the small oil emirate of Kuwait, which aided him in buying arms and rebuilding infrastructure. Rather than paying the debt, Hussein threatened Kuwait, insisting that the tiny enclave of wealth was long a natural part of Iraq and existed only because of British imperialism. Even murderous megalomaniacs sometimes get their facts straight. Britain had drawn the lines separating the two new states they carved out of the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after the Great War. The process had been so thoroughly dominated by the British Empire that the puppet rulers of both states in 1920 had been confused, and indeed had to constantly badger British foreign secretaries for the precise boundaries of their jury-rigged states. In 1990, Hussein flexed his muscles against Kuwait while also criticizing U.S. support for Israel, the dominant military power in the region. His decision to mount an invasion of Kuwait may have come from mixed signals from American diplomats, who carried a warning about the deployment of troops on his southern border while also assuring that the United States understood his economic problems and that America had “no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts.” Certainly, a sociopath would see this muddled message as two big thumbs up. And he did.6 The successful prosecution of the war against Iraq, with few American casualties, set off a curious wave of celebration, curious in both its symbolism and scale. The National Victory Celebration, the largest military parade since the Second World War, featured not only the march of eight thousand troops but also what the Associated Press called a “swarm” of Apache helicopters landing on the National Mall. CBS News noted that a “patriot missile” received “the loudest applause of the day.” No fewer than eighty-two aircraft filled the airspace over D.C., including the deadly F-117 stealth bomber. Bush crowed, “By God, we’ve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all,” and the raw militarism of the National Victory Celebration, replicated in cities and small towns across the country, suggested just that.7 But something was wrong. The Gulf War quickly passed out of popular consciousness. Two years later, the American public yawned when the United States bombed Iraq again. America experienced a pretty good war all in all, prepared for them by an administration and a military/public relations complex that, as commanding general of U.S. forces Norman Schwarzkopf said, “knew how to package an historic event.” Schwarzkopf played an important role in winning media hearts and minds, finding himself christened Stormin’ Norman and generally lionized even as he restricted press coverage of both American and Iraqi deaths.8 Had Americans become bored of their “walk-on parts in a monster documentary”? Had the dark carnival left town forever? 2.Ignoring the Tales from the Hood WHILE BUSH busily kicked the Vietnam Syndrome, millions of Americans did not share in America’s nineties fantasies. White supremacy ensured that, at home and abroad, the horror would continue to take shape. But the Black community did not accept their victimization. Ernest R. Dickerson made his first grad school film with Spike Lee. Joe’s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads told a story of community and violence at a local barbershop. Joe’s shop offered a gathering spot for Black men to talk plainly and profanely about the mysteries of their lives. It also became a contemplation of both violence from within economically walled-off Black communities and brutalities inflicted by the state. A renaissance of Black film occurred in the 1990s. Author and activist Michael Eric Dyson goes so far as to suggest that Black films emerged from a “cultural nationalism” that sought to oppose the era’s “escalation of racist hostility.” Notably, this included a rediscovery of the possibilities of Black horror films to explore the horror of Black history. John Singleton, Matty Rich, the Hughes brothers, Lee, and Dickerson forced audiences to look at their bleak visions of the American past and present.9 Many of these filmmakers worked traditional elements of horror into their films, sometimes directly using tropes of demon possession and zombiism. Lee’s Jungle Fever features a skin-crawling scene of a drug-addicted son confronting his father over money with a gloomy dread that remained with many viewers, myself included, ever since we witnessed it in theaters in 1991. Dickerson would make the cult favorites Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight and Bones, stories of demonic powers and ferocious spirits that intermingled with the realities of mass incarceration and the fate of abandoned urban centers. Unlike white filmmakers, who could still engage with the imperial fantasies of voodoo and cults from abroad, Black filmmakers of the era focused almost entirely on the frayed social structures of urban life, the terror inherent in Black history, and the death of the dreams of Black Pride and Power. By the early seventies, many Black workers, while still segregated from white suburbs, began to join the middle class into which the G.I. Bill and friendly mortgage-lending practices launched whites during the 1950s. A generation after the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South into Northern and Southern cities, men of color in particular found good union jobs in manufacturing with secure employment and a living wage. The new economic options collapsed as soon as they appeared. The deindustrialization of America left the emerging Black middle class an empty shell in many parts of the country, especially in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles where disappearing jobs created wastelands out of formerly vibrant communities. By the 1990s, the outsourcing of American jobs hammered the coffin’s final nail for the traditional American working class. This particularly affected the Black community, and fatalistic discussions of “a permanent underclass” became common despite the irony of American economic hegemony abroad.10 The empire wielded its weapons at home. A spigot of cash to local police departments meant, as a New York University Law Review article noted, rising “costs of coercion” as local police invested in electronic surveillance equipment (once controversial even for the FBI) and purchased military-grade tactical equipment. Under a 1997 program, police departments did not even have to purchase the war material. Instead, they received gratis military surplus that included grenade launchers and armored vehicles called MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush protected) later used in Iraq and Afghanistan. After 2001, police access to battlefield weaponry grew when the new Department of Homeland Security provided block grants for police, even in tiny rural communities, to create “counterterrorism units.”11 The plan for a war on America’s internal troubles needed the legitimacy required of its many wars abroad. John Dilulio, a conservative Princeton professor, provided it when he coined the term superpredator in 1995 to describe an alleged wave of juvenile crime on the rise (in fact, crime of all kinds continued to decline in the 1990s). The term immediately had a racial coding, and Dilulio used phrases like “black inner-city neighborhoods” to heighten an alleged connection. Hillary Clinton made the term infamous when, in a 1996 campaign speech for her husband, she claimed that “superpredators” who had “no conscience, no empathy” emerged in “gangs” across the country. “We need to take these people on,” she said, in contrast to less influential voices that called for direct economic aid, practical job training, and various therapies to aid people whose class location might, in a very direct way, force them into criminal activity.12 Like a fighter all but spent in the early rounds, the Black working class continued to be caught cold by the rain of blows from above. The now infamous Clinton Crime Bill of 1994 lengthened sentencing for nonviolent crimes, providing incentives for dying rural communities to build more prisons to indefinitely detain Americans often convicted for simple possession, and allowing the Department of Justice to send billions of dollars to states who distributed the money to local police departments with no oversight. The 1992 film Candyman captured a host of the Black community’s real-world terrors. Based on a short story by white horror author Clive Barker and made by white director Bernard Rose, the film entered Black consciousness in its brutal portrayal of the daily horrors of systemic racism. American police violence and substandard public housing, gentrification and highways that cut apart communities, and white people who care too much and then turn murderous are all present. The monster, the Candyman, comes out of the violent past, the victim of a lynching on the frontier of empire. The supernatural threat of a powerful Black man, his body ribboned to carrion by white violence, became a powerful totem in the scrying power of hip-hop’s language. Jordan Peele, who produced Nia DaCosta’s elegantly terrifying remake in 2021, said he “[loves] the original Candyman” because “it broke us out of the box. A Black monster was pretty revolutionary. If there was no Candyman, I don’t know that there would be a Get Out.” The Candyman as an image of both power and horror goes hand in glove with Michael Eric Dyson’s discussion of the new culture of Black power that emerged in the 1990s and continued to assert itself in the twenty-first century. From Travis Scott sampling Philip Glass’s soundtrack of the film to Kendrick Lamar’s intentionally threatening “Just say his name,” the Candyman remained a specter of the past that lives out the horrors of the Black present. Billie Jasmine Powell, in her research on horror, hip-hop, and Black life in 1990s America, discovered no fewer than twenty-two references to Candyman in the work of artists ranging from Tupac to Wu-Tang Clan to Pusha T.13 Candyman premiered, in an eerie accident, the same year as what’s sometimes called the Los Angeles riots. South Central LA offers a compellingly cruel example of the systemic destruction of a Black community, slashed apart like the Candyman himself. South Central had become a term of conjurer’s art, words that “tough on crime” pols could repeat to summon the horrors of the superpredator. Although South Central geographically refers to a section of the once middle- and upper-class Central Avenue dotted with prosperous Black-owned businesses, the term came to include imaginary boundaries that went as far as Compton and Watts in the south and stretched westward into Crenshaw and Inglewood. Born in Watts, writer and activist Wanda Coleman described growing up in “the fabulous fifties” of what had become known as Historic South Central. The invidious “neighborhood covenants” had become less common and Coleman lived in an integrated neighborhood. But the city of Los Angeles seemed determined to destroy this vibrant community. During an economic downturn in the 1960s, LAPD police chief William Parker systematically raided Black businesses on Central Avenue. The city’s insistence on building the I-10, the Santa Monica Freeway, split traditional neighborhoods in two or three segments, leaving wastelands of rubble behind and even wrecking part of the Sugar Hill neighborhood, perhaps the most historic and architecturally important Black neighborhood outside of Atlanta and Harlem. Inner city, a term that the Urban Institute designates as a rhetorical device rather than a geographical description, appeared in discussions on both the right and left. In the 1980s, the idea of the “plight of the inner city” took on an increasingly unhelpful moral shading. Rather than thinking systemically about the ways in which specific policies caused urban poverty to accelerate, social commentary frequently framed the issue as a moral problem. The emerging power of Black horror films seldom made direct connections to the imperial role the United States played in the world. Rusty Cundieff, who later contributed his expertise to the edgiest sketches of Chappelle’s Show, made Tales from the Hood (1995). The film doesn’t even glance outside urban centers and instead profiles an understandable obsession with police brutality, politicians with inherently racist agendas, and intracommunity violence. The full-scale assault on the Black community since the 1970s meant that Black horror, much like Black social movements, placed the emphasis on the white supremacy at home rather than abroad. Black critiques of the American empire did exist as an important part of the freedom struggle before the 1980s. Underreported at the time and subsequently ignored in too many textbook accounts of the Black freedom struggle, the assassination of Congo leader Patrice Lumumba ignited a 1961 protest beginning in Harlem that breached the United Nations itself. The Congolese leader’s death had been a joint American-Belgian covert op that, like so many American-led secret operations, absolutely everyone knew about. The United States replaced Lumumba with an acquiescent dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, who became one of the wealthiest men in the world from his burn-and-plunder approach to his own country’s rich raw materials.14 The protest set off an international wave of public demonstrations in Paris, London, parts of the Soviet Union, and Tokyo. James Baldwin wrote a searing op-ed in The New York Times that referenced the killing of Lumumba and the subsequent protests. He warned whites that what was becoming an “Afro-American” struggle meant that Black people wanted much more than to sit down with white people for “the consumption of overcooked burgers and tasteless coffee at various sleazy lunch counters.”15 In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. tied the Vietnam War to segregation at home. The Black Panther Party had suggested that racism and economic power depended on, and simultaneously supported, the American empire abroad. In the well-researched and intensely important book Black Against Empire by Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, we learn that the FBI, in cooperation with local and state law enforcement, systematically destroyed the Panthers, at least in part because of this international agenda. Black history remained Black horror and empire shaped the conditions that Dickerson, Cundieff, and Lee exposed in their films. In the nineteenth century, westward expansion created a “cotton kingdom” as far west as Texas. Four million African Americans worked as chattel property. Segregation and economic immiseration shaped American attitudes toward people of color around the world. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, as mass incarceration became “the new Jim Crow,” racism at home continued to shape American imperial policy. American intervention abroad continued to exhibit the dire inclinations that Black Power advocates had seen for decades. The United States could not, for example, leave Haiti alone, continuing the obsession begun in the early twentieth century. U.S. troops landed in September of 1994 to return Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. This action in the Caribbean was, unlike in Grenada, sanctioned by the UN. However, the decision to invade the country for the second time came about because of the Clinton administration’s concerns over a new wave of Haitian immigrants fleeing a military junta the United States placed in power in 1991. Giants sometimes reel drunkenly with the weight of their own power. This had been the case with the murky meddling of the United States in Haitian affairs. Although it was arguably a defense of democracy to return Aristide to power (and thus the UN sanction), the CIA had trained operatives in the Haitian security services to invalidate Aristide’s election in the first place. To bury the man, that a (once) top-secret report dismissed as “the leftist priest,” the agency created the false story that Aristide received “psychiatric treatment” in Canada. After the Clinton administration decided to deal with Aristide instead of the immigrants, CIA director R. James Woolsey had to explain away his agency’s campaign against the Haitian president-in-exile’s claims on live TV, all the while insisting that the CIA had done nothing wrong.16 The American empire’s continuing creation of zombie republics abroad seeded lethal repercussions at home. CIA assets engaged in trafficking cocaine did, as a matter of public record, help flood South Central and other American communities with drugs. CIA operatives received protection in Columbia, Honduras, and Panama in return for their help with the covert war in Nicaragua. When this fact is remembered at all, it’s disparaged as “urban folklore” about the CIA trying to destroy the Black community. CIA assets did not peddle crack on the corners, nor did they directly supply those who did. But any false conspiracy beliefs hide what the Los Angeles Times called “a different, but equally scandalous truth.” That is, the CIA couldn’t care less about how their actions on behalf of empire affected marginalized Americans while they struck deals with predators across Latin America.17 Martin Luther King Jr. said, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” Tensions in South Central LA exploded in the LA uprising of 1992, a response to the acquittal of police officers responsible for the vicious beating of Rodney King, a troubled guy with a drug problem who found himself alone on one of the shadowy battlefields of America’s war on crime. King’s beating received the most press attention as the trip wire for the sudden eruption of rage. What happened within weeks of the King incident has been too frequently ignored. A store owner in Koreatown shot the Black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins in the back of the head for allegedly attempting to shoplift a $1.79 bottle of juice. Harlins died almost immediately. The woman responsible received a suspended sentence and community service from a white judge. A week later, a Black male resident of Glendale received a tougher sentence from the same judge for kicking a dog. The eruption of anti-police riots left the ruins of South Central in flames and too many whites wondering, while being uninterested in learning, what the people who’d lived in South Central for generations were so damn angry about. Horror, like hip-hop, offered a language of anger. Yet mainstream critics often received efforts to tell the African American story through horror with contempt. Though now lauded as a classic that presaged work by Jordan Peele, Gerard McMurray, Lena Waithe, Nia DaCosta, and Little Marvin, Tales from the Hood (1995) was described by The New York Times as “crudely written and acted.” The reviewer dismissed its critique of American white supremacy as a “political cartoon.” Meanwhile, the Times described the silly white savior fantasy Bulworth, starring Warren Beatty learning to be comfortable saying a racial slur because the film gives him a Black love interest in Halle Berry, as “jubilant political satire” with “chutzpah.” White audiences ignored the tales from the hood, what their country continued to do to Haiti, and systemic efforts to control African American communities through militarist policing. However, it turned out many Americans did care about reliving 1950s alien invasion fantasies and the self-referential gaze of a horror film about horror films. 3.The Rules TWO HORROR films, radically different in their premises and approach and yet both shaped by the military interventions of the 1990s, suggested that Americans wanted to consume violence that catered to their worldview. In 1996, a new Wes Craven venture breathed a peculiar afterlife into the slasher film with Scream. The same year marked the arrival of the summer blockbuster Independence Day, an overstuffed explosion fest that constituted a remake of nearly every alien invasion horror of the 1950s and featured many of Hollywood’s major male stars of the nineties. Both films elicited the nostalgia that would soon become a defining feature of America’s culture industry. Scream became part of a flood tide of movies, and forms of entertainment more generally, that are both aware of their own origins and talk about them incessantly. Craven’s story of murders in a world where everyone knows about slasher films and endlessly references Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street earned the sobriquet meta. Now part of the slang of knowingness, it appeared first in classrooms and the academic cult of the postmodern. More thoughtful analysis attributed this style to postindustrial capitalism’s information economy tendency to script “metanarratives,” a critical mass of logorrhea that finally resulted in talking about the idea of talking about something. The popularity of the Seinfeld approach (“a show about nothing”) and the rise of young hipsters wearing nostalgic clothing or enjoying anachronistic hobbies “ironically” represent the less offensive results of these impulses. In this way of imagining pop culture, the relentless search for profit forged a style of production, advertising, distribution, and consumption that’s the cultural equivalent of a snake swallowing its own tail. The idea appears in simple forms like making sneakers that are self-aware of their status as cool sneakers or films that are conscious of the tropes they march toward audiences in orderly rows. The fascination with the remake and the reboot, though long an element in the history of film, reached market saturation in the early twentieth century. It’s an outlet in the arcades of modern life just adjacent to the nostalgia industry. You can purchase remakes of your memories and reboots of your dreams. Some in academia still take pride in postmodern theory that does little more than put simple, or sometimes demonstrably false, ideas in abstruse terms. But, while the emperor may appear without clothes in the classroom, it’s certainly true that movies about movies, movies that knew they were movies, held a special appeal to audiences as the century closed. In a decade of rising paranoia, it felt good to watch a horror film that let you in on the alleged “rules” of the genre. It gave the same frisson as what Kurt Andersen, in his 2017 book Fantasyland, calls “the X-Filing of America.” Moreover, for a generation that made Kurt Cobain’s discordant hymns of rage their soundtrack, the inescapable maze of violence and commentary on that violence suited their sense of helplessness, anger, and angst. Craven sensed this about the nineties just as he’d understood Freddy Krueger as the nightmare companion to the eighties American dream. The audacity of Craven’s approach remains startling. Scream spills enough blood that producer Bob Weinstein called in all his favors to prevent the box office poison of an NC-17 rating. Yet, unlike the grainy film stock most slasher fans had become inured to, Craven’s masterpiece has the high-gloss look that’s reminiscent of the decade’s self-consciously trashy thrillers (Basic Instinct, Wild Things) and high-concept action films (Total Recall, Starship Troopers). Courteney Cox, beloved by the tens of millions of fans of the sitcom Friends, played a major role along with David Arquette, Rose McGowan, and Neve Campbell. Recognizable names and faces, a cast of absurdly pretty people in which even extras appear to have walked out of an Abercrombie catalog, made the film’s nihilism and sheer bloodlust obsessively interesting to look at. Horror culture received an indelible mark from Scream. Directors could continue the work Alfred Hitchcock began with Psycho. They could force audiences to accept they were watching a film, that they would have to deal with unreliable narrators and see the seams in editing so that entire backstories stayed out of focus until the climax. Over the next decade the inability to know the full story helped create a whole genre of “whodunit horror,” and in some cases “what the hell just happened” horror, in films like The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, Hide and Seek, The Others, and the entire oeuvre of M. Night Shyamalan. Often seen as films that delivered surprise endings, they primarily offered surprise editing. David Fincher’s Fight Club (1999) and Mary Harron’s American Psycho (2000) probably represent the apotheosis of this effort, but Craven opened the final Hitchcockian door, letting audiences in on the secret that the camera had the power to edit the reality they experienced. Did Scream feature much political meaning? In some respects, the film’s only real interest is in itself. In this way, it’s a sheer expression of angst. The bundled anxiety at work in the film even appears in the costume designed for the murderous Ghostface. The totem eschews the blankness of the masks of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers and the open wound that passes for Freddy Krueger’s face and instead evokes the bleak wail of Edvard Munch’s 1893 masterpiece. My apolitical generation may have worried over its own anxiety and shown a tendency to go AWOL from reality, just as social commentary and films like Richard Linklater’s Slacker and Kevin Smith’s Clerks said they did. But the forces of the culture industry helped shape a tendency, easily mated with a love for false conspiracies, toward the gnostic belief that Gen X knew “the rules” of genre, that Craven’s genius in using an overused formula as an actual plot device could also mean that the formulaic could be enjoyed for its own sake. This attitude made MTV’s shamelessly entitled The Real World immensely popular and encouraged the post-Vietnam generation to believe, as had the youth of the roaring twenties, that they invented irony. Scream may have purposefully gazed at its own cinematic navel. But the cultural imperatives that made Craven’s work a hit have an unexamined relationship to Operation Desert Storm. A generation raised by parents who fought in Vietnam or watched it unfold over a decade’s worth of TV dinners and nightly newscasts watched the defeat of Iraq over forty-two days of pizza and beer. Their dawning awareness of current events and their hours playing PC games and Nintendo collided in a conflict often referred to as “the video game war.” A generation’s acquiescence may have appalled aging activists of the anti-war movement of the late 1960s. But Vietnam did not have Desert Storm’s public relations team or high production values. Throughout the twentieth century the U.S. government frequently sought to avoid showing Americans the ruined face of war. But there’s never been such obvious effort to show a false reality of combat as the first invasion of Iraq. The Pentagon carefully crafted palatable and triumphal images the new, content-hungry twenty-four-hour news cycle could release to the American public. Rather than young Americans uncertain of their fate, the public saw images of Patriot missiles striking targets reminiscent of a screenshot of the popular arcade game Missile Command. Only on one or two occasions did actual images seep through, often to suddenly disappear from both public memory and discussion. On February 13, 1991, two guided missiles struck a camouflaged civilian shelter and killed about five hundred people. Dick Cheney, then secretary of defense, declared that it was no mistake and that the shelter had been “plugged into Saddam’s communications network,” whatever that might mean. Even fewer Americans learned about the so-called Highway of Death, a convoy of thousands of retreating Iraqi vehicles bombed and strafed by A-6 Intruders, Apache helicopters, and all manner of American artillery. Perhaps as many as five hundred Iraqi soldiers died in what became more massacre than military operation. These images failed to compete with the satisfying competency of Patriot missiles knocking the dread Scud missiles out of the sky and CNN graphics, complete with sound effects, that entitled the round-the-clock coverage “Showdown in the Gulf.”18 Reality had been thoroughly redacted. Soon after the conflict, documentary film maker Ken Burns asked, rather plaintively, how an event can be remembered with so few photographs. Burns wrote with exasperation that the war seemed a series of “distracting theatrics,” staged in a way that we could see them as if “the war itself might be a wholly owned subsidiary of television.”19 In fact, not remembering the details became the point. The conflict could join the invasion of Grenada and the strike against Panama as a simple story of the last empire standing in the ruins of the twentieth century able to deliver a killing blow against any adversary. If the console game generation’s memory became dazed and confused, they could simply play Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf or the mentally disturbed 8-bit Storm Over the Desert, where tiny American tanks turn a gigantic Saddam Hussein into mush. Nintendo seemed to believe that this was, in fact, a video game war. A Gulf War veteran’s Game Boy (a handheld gaming device), melted into slag, appeared on display in Nintendo’s New York store in 2014. Scream assayed to give us a controllable formula for the slasher film. Americans also considered themselves well-versed in the rules of global slaughter. The extent to which this became true explains why America could become fascinated with a horror movie about horror movies. But even more Americans crowded into theaters to watch a star-spangled, big-budget adaptation of every alien invasion movie ever made. During a moment in the nineties when few Americans could tell you where their country currently intervened in the world, Independence Day opened to a one hundred-million-dollar week. 4.Let’s Nuke the Bastards “EVERY STATION’S making like it’s the 1950s,” exclaims a character in Roland Emmerich’s Independence Day. The line refers to TV screens around the world empty but for a snowstorm of stray signals, interference caused by alien invaders dickering with satellites. It’s also a nod to the film’s fifties roots, as are visual references like the one working television playing The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).20 Emmerich took some big risks. The seemingly invincible alien ships destroy all the major landmarks in Washington, D.C., from the Capitol Building to, in a shot that became iconic, the White House itself. In a dreadful presaging of events already in motion the year the film released, the shadow of the mothership stretches menacingly across the Twin Towers. Emmerich borrows these moments from the exceptionally well-done effects of Ray Harryhausen in Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), but the sensibilities of the 1990s and the post–Jurassic Park power of computer-generated imagery (CGI) made the effect startling.21 Audiences knew that the United States would strike back. American moviegoers brought to the film an attitude shaped by the triumphalism that came with the end of the Cold War and the utter humiliation of the Iraqi army, touted by the Pentagon in a weird reverse propaganda campaign as “the world’s third largest military.” The first act of the film reassures audiences of American prestige with establishing shots of patriotic images that we won’t see destroyed in the film, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Marine Corps War Memorial, and shots of crisp, rather outsized America flags snapping angrily in the wind. Most films that want to make the kind of box office numbers Independence Day did must offer a consensus narrative. That is, they can’t offer political diatribes for either the left or right. The heroic president played by Bill Pullman is presented to us as neither a Republican or Democrat, his youthful optimism and experience as a pilot in the Gulf War making him a mash-up of what people liked about Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush while transcending the many failings of both. Will Smith’s role as a Marine pilot seemed a quick salute to growing conversations about diversity even if there’s no allusion to racism in the film. Smith, extremely popular with white audiences for his accessible hip-hop and his sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, acts the role of the top gun who helps save the day. The film’s producers never even considered Chuck D, Ice Cube, or anyone that signified real political meaning in Black culture. In fact, white actor Ethan Hawke was the only other star in the running. Even UFO conspiracy buffs found something in the film for them, as we inevitably go back to Roswell (the latest round of books on the topic had just appeared) to learn that the government cover-up was real and that the alien ship captured in the fifties will help America carry out the president’s wish to “nuke the bastards.” Cover-ups are important and maybe keeping the American public out of the loop wasn’t right but, hey, at least it saved America (and, of course, prevented a mass extinction event). Two aspects of Independence Day made it especially appealing in the aftermath of the Gulf War. In a reiteration of audience expectations shaped by the video game war of 1991, the film celebrated the American military but, visually and in dialogue, put more focus on America’s hardware, much as the Patriot missiles became the heroes in the war with Iraq. There are some American heroes on screen but, as with the Gulf War, they are never detached from their weapons of mass destruction. F-18 fighters, tactical nuclear weapons, stealth bombers, helicopter gunships, and even an early allusion to cyber warfare . . . almost all weapons Americans had met and applauded in the “crisis in the Gulf” are rolled out in Independence Day. Mimicking CNN, the film shows attacks on the aliens on the same green-hued night-vision screens that created what looked like, but wasn’t, a bloodless fireworks show over Baghdad. Second, the film’s use of the terminology and American mentality of the Gulf War goes far beyond these cues. Independence Day helped shape the summer blockbuster’s penchant for catastrophic yet bloodless violence. Emmerich’s catastroflick includes an unhinged moment in which the president’s chief military advisor assures him that a plan to explode nuclear missiles all over the United States to take out the invaders is basically sound. The cities have all been deserted, he tells the president, and confidently announces that “civilian casualties should be down to a minimum.” There’s nothing in the film that breaks the spell by questioning this bullshit. Finally, George H. W. Bush’s feeling that the Vietnam Syndrome had been “kicked” gets a troubling reiteration in Independence Day. Randy Quaid plays Casse, an alcoholic and generally clownish veteran of Vietnam. Volunteering to fly against the alien ships in one final effort to “nuke the bastards,” Casse announces, in a sepulchral-sounding echo of his generation’s disastrous war, “Hello, boys, I’m back.” He sacrifices himself to save Gen X and their children, a deeply cruel suggestion that perhaps he should have made such a noble sacrifice in Southeast Asia thirty years before. Independence Day represented slack-jawed awe at American military power, at times evoking some of the worst angels of our nature, and joined an established cinematic tradition of portraying Vietnam veterans as troubled, dangerous, and disposable (The Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Rambo: First Blood). Independence Day outdid Forrest Gump in both ticket sales and its indifference to the wounds it reopened and the ideas it celebrated. Horror science fiction in American culture soon took new and more interesting turns, asking some of the philosophical questions Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke offered in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Soviet science fiction pondered for decades (Solaris, 1972). American sci-fi horror turned toward political satire that held a frightening mirror to America’s role in the real world (Annihilation, Arrival, District 9, Sunshine, Moon). These films avoided simplistic tales of aliens as marauding invaders or peaceful “space brothers.” This change owed a lot, more than has been credited, to a director known for over-the-top films that made exploitation mainstream and a satirical reading of a Robert A. Heinlein classic the late grand master had meant with deadly seriousness. 5.Very Pretty Space Fascists DUTCH DIRECTOR Paul Verhoeven believes strongly in using violence in film. In his view, a refusal to show violence did more to inure the public to real-world violence than hiding what the mangled and dead human form looked like. He once told James Cameron that whenever a filmmaker suggested his work “too violent,” he told them their movies probably “weren’t violent enough.” Verhoeven had blended graphic sex with over-the-top mayhem and served it with slapdash social commentary since the 1970s. The nineties seem the decade American cinema was ready for him . . . sort of. Basic Instinct (1992) did become a (kind of) cultural touchstone, setting off a craze for neo-noir psychosexual thrillers—Alfred Hitchcock meets the grind house. The director’s Showgirls (1995) became a touchstone of a different kind, a schlocky farrago of a movie that won seven of the satirical Golden Raspberry Awards given for “the worst films of the year.” Subsequently, the film won some grudging respect for its willful banality, its intentionally superficial obsession with Vegas glitz, bad music, and sentimental outbursts. What film critic Naveen Kumar calls the “deliberate mess” of the film echoed the vacuity of nineties white American culture. Verhoeven’s post-Showgirls decision to adapt Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers may seem highly peculiar. Actually, it made perfect sense. Graphic violence must play a role in any nod to Heinlein’s orgiastic celebration of patriotic genocide, fulfilling the 1950s cinematic traditional assumption that the alien must be destroyed and that a scientific and military elite could band together to do it. These are the “rules” that Verhoeven followed but, perhaps more diligently than Wes Craven in Scream, he subverted these prescriptions. What if, he wondered, I made a sci-fi movie about “fascists who aren’t aware of their fascism”?22 Starship Troopers did for shoot-’em-up science fiction what Scream did for slasher films. Verhoeven saw in Heinlein’s work exactly what Heinlein wanted his readers to see in 1959, a message about discipline, violence, and the glories of a militarized state. Verhoeven, too bored by Heinlein’s novel to finish it, combined that message with his own experience as a youth in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and his belief that militarism seeped into the groundwater of American entertainment, opinion, and corporate power. The result is a film in which the characters feel empty because they are. The monsters are silly because the real monsters are the young, lovely, unthinking death dealers who never question orders or even question why they are not questioning orders. The enemies that Earth has long been at war with for reasons that remain unclear are the Bugs. This designation recalls American racist tropes directed at Japanese soldiers that, combined with the Japanese sense of their own cultural superiority, created the utter savagery of the Pacific War. The exposition we receive that frames the film, videos posted on some future version of the internet, are Big Brother fireside chats presented in a soothing male AI voice. Indeed, the point seems to be that fascism will come in such a pleasantly instructive fashion that you’ll barely feel the boot in your face forever. Roger Ebert complained that Verhoeven created “the most violent kiddie movie ever made.” He does admit the film contains some “sly satire” but found it off-putting that the main characters seem unable to reflect on why they are at war with the Bugs and appear “soulless.” He then makes what could only be described as an invidious comparison to George Lucas’s universe, certainly a poor juxtaposition not only because they are very different films but because the bad guys in the Star Wars universe are barely disguised fascists themselves.23 One of America’s most respected critics missed that Verhoeven wanted to play it straight in hopes of making audiences appalled at the film’s attractive heroes who unthinkingly accept the violent logic of fascism. The actors are carved out of the shiny polymer of youthful sexuality and include the nineties platonic ideal of male heteronormative fantasy, Denise Richards. These pretty space Nazis remain secure in their rancid xenophobia, utter devotion to the state, and passion for violence to the very end. Perhaps the film’s time simply had not come. David Roth wrote about the cult classic for The New Yorker in 2020 and noted that the theme of endless and indecisive war describes the last two decades of American life. Critic Phil Coldiron called it “one of the greatest of all anti-imperialist films.” Calum Marsh described the film in the November 2013 issue of The Atlantic as undermining Heinlein’s “saber-rattling” with “archetypes on loan from teen soaps and young-adult fiction.” Verhoeven’s satire remains controversial with science fiction and horror fans. The director used a machete to dig into the divided mind of sci-fi, a violent corpus callosotomy that left synapses dangling but still vibrating painfully. Heinlein defenders saw the film as a betrayal. They failed to recognize that Verhoeven’s parody worked because he took the book literally. Another arguably much larger group of fans knew exactly what the film did and grew up with a sense that sci-fi could wield the chain saw too. 6.Unadorned Butchery THE HORROR of a war without meaning against monsters of our own making had been examined by Joe Haldeman in The Forever War. Like so many Vietnam veterans, Haldeman felt no desire to go to war. A pacifist, he had been studying at the University of Maryland pursuing his twin interests in physics and astronomy, disciplines to which he’d later add an MFA. His interest in creative writing baffled his professors, who urged him to take more courses in advanced differential equations. Telling them he had an interest only in “garden variety differential equations,” he did some of his first writing and published a story later adapted by the eighties Twilight Zone reboot. After graduating in 1967, he was drafted to serve as a combat engineer. His family was in Montreal when his Selective Service notice arrived. He and his wife discussed staying in Canada, moving to Sweden, or possibly even accepting a prison sentence. He decided against these options because of a lifelong dream of working for NASA that resisting the draft would destroy. He said he always wanted “to be a spaceman.”24 Haldeman would never achieve this in a literal sense, and he probably knew that as he dropped into a so-called hot LZ (a landing zone under fire). The author remembers forgetting everything he thought he’d learned from war movies and simply running in the direction he heard English being spoken. But he mostly recalled the smell of the dead. Like veterans of every industrialized mass murder of the last century, his memory became a cubist painting that ignored linear space and insisted that the eye read its surroundings as one simultaneous explosion of visual excess. Haldeman’s own synesthesia of violence included the smell of nearby bodies that he would forever associate with roadkill and noticing the way that one of the corpse’s feet twisted at uncomfortable-looking angles. It would not be Haldeman’s last experience with the dead stacked after combat. The pacifist left Vietnam with a Purple Heart and an even stronger distaste, if deeper understanding, of military adventurism. The Forever War became the science fiction classic Haldeman ensorcelled from the chaos of his experience. First published in 1974, it won essentially every single award for achievement in science fiction. It told a story recognizable to readers of Robert A. Heinlein but one that drew very different conclusions. Private William Mandella shares the same fictional DNA as Heinlein’s space marines but fights with an awareness that he knows little about Earth’s Tauran enemies other than the fact that they must be destroyed. He calls the first encounter he takes part in “murder, unadorned butchery . . . We had just herded them up and slaughtered them.” By the end of the novel, we learn that Earth’s military industrial complex fought what becomes a thousand-year conflict because a militarized society promised big defense contracts. At some point over the centuries, not unlike the illogic of the American empire, the economy simply became a war economy. Life without the war became unimaginable.25 Haldeman has called his work “social satire” but disavowed the idea of being a sci-fi prophet. In the late 1990s, he wrote a follow-up to The Forever War, a much more optimistic and even spiritual work called Forever Peace. It never received the recognition of his earlier work, perhaps because he had, in fact, been too much of a prophet. Discussions of a war without end waged for confusing reasons opened the American empire’s new century. 7.Apocalypse, Right Now HOPEFUL PROPHETS of the 1990s promised “the end of history.” This chilling phrase actually expressed some of the more optimistic assertions about the post–Cold War world, particularly the belief that free markets and democracy would work in tandem to end ethnic conflict and political authoritarianism. R.E.M.’s anthem “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” seemed like the cue music for the whole decade. But not everyone was so sure or felt especially fine. Horror certainly took an apocalyptic turn. Independence Day played with the idea, but so did films of mass destruction like Deep Impact (1998) and the straightforwardly named Armageddon (1998). Both films imagined destruction on a global scale. Deep Impact, about a meteor creating an extinction-level event that wipes out the East Coast of the United States, showed viewers images of the leveling of cities that horror films, traditional disaster movies, and even superhero franchises soon made a commonplace of cineplex entertainment. Such images battered us so incessantly after 9/11 that Village Voice film critic Bilge Ebiri could say of the unending flood tide of CGI catastrophe, “It’s the end of the world as we know it—and I feel tired.”26 Roland Emmerich, meanwhile, parlayed the success of Independence Day to direct what he hoped would become the ultimate monster disaster film, a nineties iteration of Godzilla for American audiences. The 1954 classic imagined a creature of primeval history roused from the seabed by American nuclear tests. Japan, the target of the only atomic weapon attacks in history, must suffer again at the hands of a monster created by Americans. That version of the story disappears in Emmerich’s hot take. It’s an illegal test by the French government that awakens the creature, making the United States, with its world-destroying nuclear arsenal, a victim of European maleficence when the creature finally makes its way to American shores. Cue massive explosions and catastrophic destruction, violence both impossible to comprehend in scale yet bloodless in representation. After all’s said and done, the United States wins big. While apoco-disasters in the form of dread cosmic events or monsters rising out of the sea increasingly invested in more and more entertainment real estate, religious fears reminiscent of the satanic panic continued to thrive in the decade. Omen IV appeared and a reboot of the original Omen, slightly updated, went into the works. Demonic children proliferated at an alarming rate, some of them born to become the Antichrist. End of Days, The Devil’s Advocate, and Bless the Child appeared, or went into production, in the late nineties and all shared the basic theme of the devil’s interest in destroying the world. These films reflected the enormous popularity of the Left Behind series, a set of novels that attempted to dramatize the evangelical conception of the end of time using the techno-thriller tricks and tropes of a Tom Clancy tale. Like Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth in the seventies, the books had a reach and a popularity that went far outside the fold of the faithful. The series became a franchise worth hundreds of millions of dollars with films, PC games, and spin-off series in its train. This all seems a bleak side to the promises of nineties cultural functionaries that the world would be shinier and happier. But the fascination with the world’s end, often more stridently asserted and deeply feared than the very real apocalyptic possibilities of the passé Cold War, emerged from roots in the growing divide in American culture. Political, economic, and even cultural power ballooned to such proportions since 1945, and in some respects since 1918, that individuals felt little sense of autonomy and agency. Political apathy abounded while, by the beginning of the twenty-first century, consumption driven by massive debt and inflated real estate equity reached levels unprecedented in human history. The nineties, more than any other decade, encapsulates the disempowerment of Americans, their role as walk-on extras in Theodor Adorno’s “monster documentary.” End-times fiction shared the assumption that most people are either unaware or incapable of dealing with the real horror of the time. Social movements and the organizations that hardwired them went into decline. Voting rates continued a decade-long slide. By 1994, only about a third of eligible voters went to the polls for the midterm elections. In 1996, less than half of registered voters bothered with the presidential contest. Things would probably be fine.27 Five years later, when explosions shook the ground and bodies floated down from the sky as dust and ash, some Americans felt like they were in a movie, or at least watching one. Minutes after the second aircraft slammed into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, devastated eyewitnesses could only say, “It looks like a movie!” The scriptwriter of Armageddon found that the footage of the attack, so similar to the film, gave him “the creeps,” and the director of Die Hard reflected with horror that it looked like one of his movie posters.28 The America that woke up on September 12, 2001, wanted to see itself as a profoundly different epoch, see the change in date as more than simple chronology, chronos, but an emergence of the Greek concept of kairos, ripe time, deep time, time bursting open with meaning, a crack in the geological strata of history that demanded decisive action. Commentators went so far as to suggest that human communication would have to do without irony after the experience. Others suggested that good and evil as categories had come back (as if they’d ever gone away). American culture would be “Rockwellian” again, a reference to the maudlin paintings of Norman Rockwell that featured happy and humorous scenes of a bygone, very white America of soda fountains and sentimental references to family, church, childhood, and dogs. Horror would rip the stitches off this attempt at cultural revanchism. Films that dealt directly with 9/11 failed at the box office. Meanwhile, some of the goriest, most disturbing, and intentionally subversive horror films ever made began to, as Victoria McCollum wrote, engage politics to such a degree that they “vigorously [pummeled] at the audience’s skull with the viciousness of each new atrocity.”29 Eli Roth’s Hostel (2005) generally gets slated into the category of “torture porn,” a phrase so gruesome it seems to have a bad odor wafting out of it. Hostel is much more than this though, a film that, like James Wan’s Saw franchise, sponged up the era’s paranoia and fed it back to audiences as a hellbroth. At a moment when American culture could actually conduct a public debate about the legality of torturing suspected terrorists, suspected accomplices of terrorists, and people suspected to know something about terrorists and their accomplices, the film stripped audiences of their sympathy for young, pretty Americans abroad who themselves became targets of torture. Whatever you think of the ethics of such a gory display, it’s impossible to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of the boundary-busting film. Dominick Suzanne-Mayer wrote in 2016 that Hostel became a hit with millennials like himself, as it seemed to fit the bizarre tone of the times when “Lee Greenwood’s ‘Proud to Be an American’ could be piped in over crackling junior high school PA systems for months on end, daily, and nobody ever really stopped to interrogate how surreal the whole thing was.”30 Audiences walked away from Roth’s disturbing masterpiece with complex feelings about what they had seen. Foreign places are dangerous, un-American, and to be disdained. Yet the film also conveyed the sense that the Americans who walked around like they owned these places got everything they deserved. Suzanne-Mayer says this may have been little more than the feeling that “the rest of the world is scary, huh?,” but this at least left more space for rumination than the president of the United States saying things like, “I’m amazed that . . . people would hate us. I, like most Americans, I just can’t believe it, because I know how good we are.”31 Horror increasingly made the point that we had little to brag about. Films such as Rob Zombie’s The Devil’s Rejects (2005) not only questioned American exceptionalism, they suggested the worst of us maybe understood the world we’d made much better than the millions who bought a Toby Keith CD to hear him serenade the globe with lyrics like, “we’ll put a boot in your ass / It’s the American way.” The Devil’s Rejects follows up Zombie’s macabre blood carnival of a tribute to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre called House of 1000 Corpses. But Rejects stands on its own in many respects, part outlaw western and part thrill-kill horror. The Firefly family are the Manson commune if “the Family” actually cared about one another. Indeed, the character Otis makes use of Tex Watson’s LSD-induced proclamation “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business” during one nearly unwatchable sequence. It’s so truly violent that it’s a difficult film to endure with some especially egregious scenes that the actors and Zombie himself struggled to film. The whole thing seemed to make critics feel dirty. Reviewers rattled away at their keyboards in a blood-vessel-popping rage about the film’s nihilism in a nation that, only a year before, looked at images of physical and sexual torture from Abu Ghraib prison, where American soldiers had done something witchy with detainees. It’s more of a commentary on America than the film itself that critics could suggest that The Devil’s Rejects had no social and cultural meaning because of its “sickening, socially irresponsible glorification of depraved and sadistic behavior.” Had they been keeping up with the news? Did they know that the image of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi standing hooded on a box, electric wires inserted all over his body, arms extended as if in preparation for crucifixion, went from confrontation with human evil to an offensive meme on American social media platforms within days? Zombie could have replied to critics with the words of his idol Tobe Hooper, “it’s really about America.”32 “Sickening” films like The Devil’s Rejects offered a way to speak about what had become of America’s imperial endeavors at a time when the public square demanded consensus and obedient acceptance to the oddly named “war on terror.” Roth and Zombie offered relief from relentless images of America as victim and vengeful crusader. This construction of the world allowed for the unspoken assumptions of American power since 1945 to become fully public. Hours after the September 11 attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent a memo to aides that proclaimed it time to “go massive—sweep it all up, things related and not.” The attempt to twist the world completely to American wishes defined the next two decades of American life.33 8.Al-Qaedzilla THE TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY American empire made no excuses. Bush said it out loud, telling a graduating class at West Point that the United States must always remain “ready for preemptive action” against “unbalanced dictators.” This enthusiasm for unilateral invasion became the so-called Bush Doctrine, the assurance that the United States would take military action against any power in the world that might threaten the American order of things. War became, as Mark Danner describes it in his important book Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War, “unbounded in space and time.”34 The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have proven disastrous. Perhaps as many as two hundred thousand civilians have been killed in Iraq alone. “Regime change” created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of ISIS and the intervention of Russia on behalf of Syria’s brutal Assad regime. The dead zone of Iraq has strengthened the hand of Saudi Arabia, arguably the world’s most repressive regime, an autocratic monarchy with economic and territorial ambitions that has successfully linked itself to the United States. The withdrawal from Afghanistan fulfilled an agreement with the Taliban made by President Trump in February 2020. Most Americans are unaware that U.S. troops continue to dominate much of the Middle East with no fewer than twenty-three air and naval bases and an unknown number of “black sites” maintained by the CIA in the former Soviet republics. Some of these bases are like small, heavily armed American cities. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar hosts eleven thousand U.S. troops, ensures near total dominance of airspace across most of the region, and features amenities that include two movie theaters, a huge swimming pool, most major American fast-food chains, and lounges with names like the Kasbah, the Zink, and the Fox Sports Skybox. Like Fort Laramie in the nineteenth century and Guantanamo Bay in the twentieth, Al Udeid announces that America is here to stay.35 America would kill all the monsters that threatened “the homeland.” Horror films sometimes attended to the need to assure the public this was so. As a filmmaker, Steven Spielberg was always eager to comfort the zeitgeist. Since Jaws he has been frightening Americans to make them feel better, producing films that even massaged dire historical realities into buddy movies and family dramas. Alien invasions became friends visiting from the stars. Schindler’s List allowed the Holocaust, as critic Akiva Gottlieb put it, to be told in a story about a “Nazi who has a change of heart.”36 War of the Worlds (2005) continued this pattern amid a ruined landscape that magnified the destruction of 9/11 beyond all imagining. And yet, Spielberg ends the film with a virus ex machina that kills the aliens. J. J. Abrams’s Cloverfield (2008) also told a tale of mass destruction by an enormous but shadowy horror. The Village Voice noted that the film’s avalanche of ruin could have come “from the CNN archive,” an attack from what the reviewer snarkily called “al-Qaedzilla.” America the allegedly indomitable had come under the attack of nameless, faceless, and vague entities. No one who watches the carnage of Spielberg’s aliens or Abrams’s kaiju worries about “blowback.” There’s no cause, we are the victims, they must hate our freedoms, and nothing but apathy and hoping for the best can be done. 9.Ghosting in Spook Country THE CONTOURS of empire may not have changed that much in the twenty-first century. But the ways in which the United States defended its global system did. As journalist and historian Nick Turse writes, the State Department, presidential administrations, and even political candidates have bragged for years about the cyber warfare capabilities of the United States. Turse describes “the military’s secret military,” the enormous, and growing, phenomenon of cyber warfare units, drone bases, and special forces.37 William Gibson’s Spook Country (2007) may be the only kind of spy novel that matters in the age of imperial cyberspace. Dead drops and the occasional GRU assassination might still make news, but the world of espionage could no longer exist without a humming digital homunculus, a hive of hundreds of millions occupying almost every single gigabyte of technology’s white zones. A simple phone conversation by Gibson’s protagonist summons possibilities more chilling than “the call is coming from inside the house” analog terror of When a Stranger Calls. Sitting in a Starbucks, she is “afraid to trust her own phone and the net stretching out from it, strung through those creepy fake trees . . . the net of telephony, all digitized, and all, she had to suppose, listened to.” Cloaks and daggers had been replaced by bots and malware. The attacks of 9/11 transmogrified the heady predictions of life online from dreams of an interconnected world to a nightmare of illusion, surveillance, and loss of self. Independence Day gave us the new notion of computer viruses imagined as the key to defeating an alien invasion. When the film launched in 1996, only a little over 30 percent of American households featured a personal computer. A decade later, the danger of viruses to everything from bank accounts to political stability became a common problem, so common it did not always receive the public discussion it deserved. Unless you bricked your computer in 2007 by opening a file that claimed to be a breaking news story, you may not remember Storm Worm. Originating in Russia, Storm Worm compromised ten million personal computers in six months. The email subject lines that duped computer users are themes from the darkest fantasies of the internet, including “British Muslims Genocide” or “Radical Muslim drinking enemies’ blood!” Even the more mundane subject lines the virus used, like “Re: Your text” proved impossible to ignore. The subject line appeared utterly chilling in an age when relationships and careers could end with ill-considered words typed into the ether. Ghost has become a common verb in America’s online vocabulary. Drawn from the idea of a spirit world where restless souls appear and then wink out into the black, to be ghosted means that another person has disappeared from your life—messages unread, texts unreturned, and the seeming community of social media a false front behind which lies a vast ruin. Family, friends, and romantic partners can all ghost, can become hidden from sight in the disconnections of digital interfaces. You can be “unfriended” in an almost ritualistic manner, a combination of public shaming and sacral excommunication. The psychological costs are impossible to tabulate in such an online world where relationships of all kinds can acquire a surprising intensity only to vanish and become weightless, shadows with no mass or circumference. We use the language of horror to describe the connections we hope never to make in the interconnected world. There are those who become ghosts, leaving behind nothing but strange half memories in a deleted files folder. Or we might also face a troll lying in wait beneath the virtual infrastructure of the web. These encounters can range in viciousness from nasty snark aimed at strangers to bullying, stalking, and attempting to destroy another person’s finances or reputation. Although tales from old salts on the cyber sea are rare, and unconfirmed, the idea of “mermaiding” suggests wily women out to use their siren song, by which I mean the offer of nude pics, to monetize their social media accounts. The fear of this possibility draws on the horror of the sea creature cuteified beyond recognition but taken back to its frightening roots in films like Night Tide (1963) and Robert Eggers’s The Lighthouse (2019). You can even meet a zombie online, or at least someone can zombie you. In a peculiar reenactment of the Freudian horror of “the return of the repressed,” romantic attachments gone missing in the digital ossuary suddenly reappear. Perhaps having ghosted you before, they suddenly return to frightful life, wanting to recreate some virtual version of a past connection, a dead thing living inside the synthezoid brain of your hard drive. People have always abandoned one another. Ghosting could, at one time, simply mean refusing to pick up the phone. But there are very real differences, largely shaped by the ease of online contact. A feeling of freedom, of anonymity, of the sense that it’s your gothic double that acts for you in online interactions, allows for a sense of weightlessness to relationships, that they are ephemeral and ethereal. This offers a heady brew for people hungry for, and afraid of, intimacy. It’s the absolute desiderata for sociopaths. But are the intricacies of human relationships really damaged on a large scale by such behavior? After many discussions of online life “eroding empathy” or the dangers of “screen time,” are we more likely to objectify people now rather than earlier periods when economic elites grew fat off of World War I or the Industrial Revolution? Genocide had become a method of state-building long before the personal computer, much less social media. There’s not a clear answer, yet, to whether personal devices have rewired our brains in a “post-human,” or maybe sub-human, experience of the world. But we do know the digital world of ghosts and zombies have affected social institutions and political consciousness. Meeting up with a troll or a mermaid online could have terrifying personal consequences. But cyber life’s uncanny mixture of solitude and intimacy, connections with people that appear to have depth but can be brutally voided in a text or DM, and its ability to make fantasy into a hyperreality have very real implications for the United States as both a nation-state and an empire. The titans who have made vast fortunes and exert extraordinary power over much of the world’s resources implicitly understand that the digital world has become empire’s new frontier. Even the games we play carry this lethal message. 10.Zombie Black Ops UNRELENTING HORDES march from all directions. They are an unstoppable threat to American power. In fact, you will die trying to kill them. There’s not a way to win and you know the endless army of the dead will take you. This does not describe a particular scenario in the revival of the zombie apocalypse film after 9/11, a renaissance that included an aging George A. Romero doing some of his best work since the seventies. Instead, it’s the most popular gaming mode of the Call of Duty series, a cultural phenomenon since 2003. Beginning with a popular first-person shooter (FPS) approach to World War II, Activision updated the game almost every single year since its inception. The zombie mode has appeared in almost every new version of the game, players sometimes staging minor online revolts against the developers when they don’t receive it. The insistence on supernatural zombies and horror film scenarios in what has over the years aimed at being in other respects a stomach-churningly realistic military simulation seems to require some explanation. We could chalk it up to the sheer popularity of zombie films, novels, TV shows, and comics in the twenty-first century. Does putting a military shooter together with zombies simply represent peanut butter and chocolate logic, the simple math that two things we like are better than one? Maybe. But only if Call of Duty had not become the most egregious example of what at least one scholar has called “games of empire.” It’s a series designed to reenact, and ruthlessly celebrate, the extension of American power all over the globe. The killing of monsters, by the hundreds and even by the thousands, has become the game’s trademark. So has a devotion to give an outlet for one set of political views, redacting history to explain away imperial maleficence. The use of horror, especially in the unstoppable waves of the undead, assumes a frightening role in the real world of empire.38 Gaming might appear very far removed from the realities of political and ethical life. You will find a troll or two in online gaming, a stranger who deems you a “noob” and expresses some profane opinions about your mother’s morality and their supposed overfamiliarity with her. But there’s more happening than the occasional ill-natured gamer, including the serious matter of cyberbullying. Beyond these interpersonal cruelties, gaming online has often acted as manservant to the aims of empire, an infomercial for some of the worst ideological assumptions in American life. Resident Evil became, in the late twentieth century and continuing to today, the most popular survival horror franchise and one of the most popular console and PC games period. Spawning nine films and sixteen games (depending on how you count the various remakes, reboots, and episodic content), it gave players a way to live out their apocalyptic zombie fantasies while introducing some real-world ideas including biological weapons, corporate maleficence, and the American government’s addiction to weapons of mass destruction. In the original title, produced in Japan in 1996, the evil Umbrella Corporation produced the bioweapon known as the T-virus for its major client, the U.S. government. The T-virus outbreak in the ludicrously named town of Raccoon City leads to a missile strike that annihilates the zombified town in an homage to Romero’s critique of corporate and government villainy in his film The Crazies (1973). Subsequently, the series frequently celebrates American military power. Heroic special forces units are dispatched later in the series to deal with outbreaks. In the 2009 game Resident Evil 5, a heavily stylized “Africa” becomes another foreign geography in which square-jawed white Americans (in this case a government agent named Chris who mingles frat boy Aryanism with a linebacker physique) fight off hordes of enmonstered African bodies hurled against them, an update of some nineteenth-century colonial stand-off in Sudan or South Africa. The imperial assumptions of the game take us back to the racism of the Hollywood “jungle adventure.” Like the zombie republics imagined by Hollywood throughout the last hundred years, the gamer visits an ill-defined and homogenized Africa, an unnamed state that geographically appears sub-Saharan and politically recently gained independence from its colonial rulers. The latter point seems important in the game only because it can inject into the narrative the idea of African nations being unable to care for themselves and in need of a living action figure like Chris, whose military skill set serves a bizarre trinity of global powers. Chris is a well-armed agent of, I kid you not, the U.S. government, the UN, and the American pharmaceutical industry. Resident Evil 5 appeared at a time when the United States took an increased interest in numerous African nations. Since the end of the Cold War, and the end of widespread Soviet and Cuban influence in much of the continent, America sought to flex its muscles. Under Clinton, the United States offered economic incentives to countries with “a market-based economy that protects private property rights.” Neoliberal think tanks developed an economic and political Geiger counter that used seventeen different indicators that would allow an African nation a favorable trade relationship with the United States. Some of these indicators sound benign and even idealistic, like “political pluralism” and “equal protection under the law.” Other mandates the United States sought to impose are far less disinterested, including “the elimination of barriers to United States trade and investment” as well as a much more generalized demand that no participating nation “engage in activities that undermine United States national security or foreign policy interests.”39 In the early years of the Obama administration, American operations in Africa sent thousands of highly trained Chrises all over the continent through the auspices of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The interservice effort, born in the 1980s, has become integral to uniting all the country’s covert war-fighting capabilities. Operating with no regard to international boundaries and cooperating with agencies that include the CIA, the NSA, and even the FBI, members of SEAL Team Six and Delta Force have killed or kidnapped alleged terrorists with impunity. Journalist Jeremy Scahill in his book Dirty Wars insists that the Obama administration “let JSOC off the leash” in a way that the Bush administration never did. The lack of oversight built into the interagency effort made removing the harness from the dogs of war no more complicated than the stroke of a pen.40 In the dirty wars of the twenty-first century, Call of Duty has a popularity even beyond Resident Evil. Its zombie component makes it something of a survival horror game that also assures players of the power and virtue of the American empire. Once the early games moved beyond the era of World War II, they increasingly focused on the geopolitical present in the “Modern Warfare” series. The premise of Call of Duty, particularly in its “Black Ops” iteration, has been that the protection of ill-defined American interests requires extralegal action and what we might call a broad sense of morality. In other words, a legitimation for how the American empire already behaves. In 2020, Call of Duty made more explicit claims for its real-world relevance in Black Ops Cold War. Using the tag line “Know your history,” the game received criticism for its triumphalist take on America in the Cold War. In its single-player story line, the narrative bundles the Reagan administration’s support for Latin American death squads and the highly illegal Iran-Contra arms pipeline into a realpolitik of “saving the free world.”41 If you don’t get the message, Ronald Reagan appears in the game to reassure you, the late president eerily rendered so that his recognizable voice seems to echo to you, a lonely cowboy dirge carried by the winds across the uncanny valley. Reagan not only grants immense levels of moral latitude to the players, the dead president’s avatar explains to the devoted player that he has been the one to set his imprimatur on the many past adventures of the Black Ops team. “You have been given a great task,” Reagan’s avuncular tone explains, “protecting our very way of life from a great evil.” This sounds like a Reagan remix, his language about empires of evil and the threat of the Soviet Union laid across the repetitive bass beat of a utopian conception of free markets. But Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War pumps up the volume. It offers a platform to an eighties conspiracy theorist who has played such an important role in forming the idea of alt-right that extremist YouTubers have celebrated his appearance in the game.42 Yuri Bezmenov defected from the Soviet Union in the early seventies. Working for a time for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he became best known for publications in the 1980s of various books supposedly outlining the KGB’s interest in so-called active measures that destabilize the culture and the economy. Obviously, most espionage services engage in such actions. But Bezmenov used this truism to make an argument about American domestic politics. He suggested that the Soviets favored the support of feminism and the civil rights struggle to damage their enemy from within. In a 1984 interview, Bezmenov insisted that “hippies” represented rot from within that would prepare the way for a real-world Red Dawn. He railed against the strides for what he called “civil rights for homosexuals,” a movement that gathered power in the eighties but that Bezmenov insisted the KGB crafted to distract the American public. He classed both feminism and the civil rights movements as American failings that the KGB could use to “soften up” the country.43 A redacted version of this interview appears in the teaser for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Also featured are scenes of social unrest that are given no political context. It’s a bizarre commercial for the game to include given the source, especially when there’s really no lack of strident anti-communist speeches from the likes of Churchill, JFK, and Reagan himself. So why choose a right-wing star to narrate the alleged “unrest” of the eighties? Call of Duty developers have a history of building bridges with the far right. In 2014, they enlisted Oliver North as a consultant for the game Black Ops II and featured him as a voice actor playing himself in a segment of the game. North also appeared in an infomercial for the game that adopts the tone of a documentary, in which the disgraced Marine lieutenant colonel worries about a future in which “America’s enemies” use its own high-tech weapons against it. This seems shameless given North’s role in, and conviction for, selling American weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to guerillas in Nicaragua. Shameless and yet also entirely inductive given the peculiar role that Call of Duty has played in relation to the internal life of the American military. Since the beginning of the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, the army has worked actively with military FPS games to use them as tools for recruitment. In 2014, Dave Anthony, a writer for the Call of Duty series, left his job in the video game industry to become a consultant at the Pentagon in order to encourage, in his own words, “outside-the-box thinking.” One example of such thinking is his suggestion that covert ops groups go in deep cover at American high schools in order to prevent terrorist attacks. The Pentagon returned the favor and built a beneficial relationship with game developers. The Pentagon allowed members of SEAL Team Six to provide consultation and even write dialogue for Call of Duty.44 And the zombies keep coming. In the context of what Roger Stahl has called “militainment,” the zombies might feel like an afterthought. In fact, they replicate Call of Duty’s basic premise: the American nation-state must employ overwhelming force of all kinds, legitimize any violence, and generally stride the world as a colossus because America’s enemies surge in overwhelming hordes. There’s no way to finally “win” the enormously popular zombie maps. The player must face wave after wave of the undead, finally succumbing. The point, as with the whole franchise, is to rack up body count. Call of Duty’s most popular mode of play easily slides into the real-world aspects of the game. It’s all zombie mode in a way, indiscriminate slaughter in which “saving the free world” and “keeping America safe” are the only rules of engagement. The game instructs its players that the monsters will keep shambling toward you and you have to keep killing them. It’s Bill Clinton’s Operation Infinite Reach, George W. Bush’s Operation Infinite Justice, or more simply Joe Haldeman’s idea of “a forever war.” There’s no conceivable endgame. How could the American empire eliminate evil, particularly with evil understood as destroying every possible challenge to American power? The zombies that stumble toward us forever in Call of Duty are there to shoot, their mindlessness reflecting the equally thought-free logic of FPS games. The games not only give legitimacy to empire’s crimes, they encourage players to see the world the way an empire sees it. The U.S. military fought for the United Fruit Company, to enforce free market principles on global trade, and to control the flow of petroleum from Latin America, the Middle East, and the Caspian Sea. But, at a certain point, all these individual goals transformed into a single unending struggle for American dominance. Defense contractors, politicians, and average Americans came to believe they are fighting enemies in infinite mode and that, as in Haldeman’s The Forever War, they are propelled by nothing more than the purblind logic of terminal velocity. We sit in front of our screens, absorbing it all, tacitly saying yes to the power of national security states that ask not just for obedience, but for our enthusiasm. 11.Digital Demons THIS IS not the world we were supposed to live in. If you listened to the evangelical heralds of tech globalization, the boundless optimism of the eighties and nineties taught you to believe Silicon Valley created, in the parlance of the era, “an information superhighway.” Marshall McLuhan may be best known for his claim in the 1960s that a convergence of technologies insured that “the medium is the message.” However, he also gave us that well-worn term global village in his 1962 book The Gutenberg Galaxy to describe the interconnection made viable by technology. But it’s a phrase very much out of step with the internet’s rhetoric about itself. For McLuhan, the global village meant a loss of privacy, of sophistication, of separating fact from reality through careful reading and contemplation, a digital return to what Marx called “the idiocy of rural life.” But now the provincial hamlet is your favorite social media platform or the bubble of commentary and commerce that you hermit into. The dark carnival rolled into the global village in the small hours, and few knew what lay behind the sideshows and blowoffs, the games and the gags. The barkers made as if the world could be bought for a dime, and they seduced us with partial truths. John Sculley, Apple’s CEO, perhaps came the closest to understanding the meaning of the wireless connected world. It will be, he said in mythic language, “the mother of all markets.” Sculley made his comments at a gathering of personal computer entrepreneurs in New York City in the summer of 1992, a moment when the corporate entities soon to become world powers on the digital landscape decided to invest their energy into “a handheld box operated by pen, or even voice commands.” Such a revolutionary device might be called, these soon-to-be billionaires suggested, “wireless widgets,” “wallet computers,” or “digital information appliances.”45 We are aware that such devices have taken over our lives. There are 290 million smart phones in the Unites States. When we subtract users of burner phones and young children using parental devices from the remaining number of outliers, we are clearly a country thoroughly wired. We’ve all been, in the threatening-sounding dialect of the nineties, “jacked in.” Much-needed attention has been paid to the emotional and existential costs of this kind of lifestyle. Horror stories of the real dangers posed by cyber life have been documented, cautionary tales and “what if?” scenarios that can make logging on to an app feel like agreeing to meet a stranger in a dark, secluded place. We’ve also become aware of the dangers online life offers to an increasingly fragile democracy in the American nation-state. It’s incorrect to talk of the possible “destruction of democracy” in the nation, as democracy has always been tentative. Its promises have been limited to the fifty fully annexed and highly gerrymandered states. Black ballots have not counted for most of American history; the votes of women did not count until 1920. Some of the most lethal “active measures,” to use Bezmenov’s phrase, being pursued against American democracy right now are efforts to restrict voting by state legislatures. But even the sorry state of democracy in a country that disenfranchises nearly seven hundred thousand people in the District of Columbia can be exacerbated. There’s no evidence that Russia “hacked” the election in 2016 or tried the same in 2020. The work of foreign operatives on social media proved much more serious and effective than risking digital fingerprints on a full-scale voting fraud effort, one that might make cybersecurity experts aware of vulnerabilities that could be used at a later time. Evidence shows that two military units of the GRU, the Russian espionage service, hacked into personal servers of the Democratic National Committee, its volunteers, and even high-ranking Democratic leaders such as John Podesta. Malware harvested over seventy gigabytes of data from a single server in April 2016. In the summer of 2016, Russian security contracted out espionage to a hacker working under the handle Guccifer 2.0 (also known as Fancy Bear). He scored perhaps the most significant data breach of the DNC and began publishing the materials through Facebook, Twitter, and a WordPress blog. In fact, right-leaning Americans met redacted and decontextualized information gleaned from Instagram posts, YouTube channels, Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts. Although they claimed to be sites seeking to defend “Second Amendment rights” or to have an affiliation with state Republican parties, they frequently were simply trolls contracted by the Russian secret service. An investigation by Vietnam Veterans of America produced evidence that troll farms in Macedonia created “Vets for Trump” sites of various platforms while targeting veterans more generally on social media with “Islamophobic” and “xenophobic” sentiments. The organization even found evidence that foreign, and some domestic, actors used their names and logos to support the Trump campaign.46 Shadowy Russian affiliates such as the Internet Research Agency (IRA) even created shell sites that labeled themselves as advocacy platforms for LGBTQ+ rights and the Black Lives Matter movement, and then flooded the page with pro-Trump information or general discouragements to vote. The IRA purchased about four thousand Facebook ads for these and similar sites, amounting to about one hundred thousand dollars. By 2017, Facebook had identified 470 accounts run by the company. The GRU and its partners achieved the equivalent of opening a digital sewage valve that flooded American online life with half-truths and absurdities. Perhaps online horror culture unwittingly helped prepare the country for what American intelligence called “the troll farm” that played a highly significant role in 2016. We certainly became accustomed to real-life horror portrayed online, to horror cultures that expressed anxiety about digital life, and to imagining false horrors that help us ignore the very real terrors of a cyber empire. Both mainstream and independent horror films have maintained a persistent interest in the haunted house becoming the haunted computer, or more likely the haunted source code. At least since 1981’s Evilspeak, our screens as portals to hell have been an obvious metaphor. Unfriended, #Horror, Searching, The Den, The Host, Countdown, Followed, Cam, and Friend Request imagine either supernatural evil or serial murderers coming at you through your phone or your desktop. Unfriended may be one of the more interesting examples of this trend as a film, basing itself on the premise that the audience has basic social media literacy and will watch ninety minutes of footage that allows us to see only what the characters see on their digital devices. It’s horror where we are trapped in McLuhan’s global village where none of us asked to live. These films are a conversation about everything we fear from life online: the possibility of an end to privacy, the sense that every stranger who seems aggressive on social media might be something even worse, and the dread of our own digital personas acquiring a life of their own. Since 2016 and the revelation of a massive cybersecurity threat to American elections, the demonic stalkers of Dark Web and Friend Request have taken on an additional viscous layer of dread, oozing out of our screens. Unfortunately, such films have often shared the American solipsism that hides behind its own borders, the tendency to try and sever the natural relationship between the personal and the political. The narcissism of the world of likes and loves and retweets has made these stories even more apolitical, or at least they pretend to be. Friend Request (2016) offers an example of this strenuous self-involvement, illustrated by the film’s insouciance about its own ghastly assumptions. The first few minutes introduce us to the prettiest, most popular, and wealthiest students at an unnamed college, their friendship, romantic life, and adventures performed for the watching world on social media. The single character with some trace of human feeling makes the mistake of offering a modicum of kindness to a black-clad, unattractive outcast with eccentric ideas about personal hygiene. What may have wanted to be a ham-handed parable about cyberbullying fails even at that. Indeed, it seems to encourage the mistreatment of people on the margin of the American class war when they dare seek to connect on social media. The film goes so far as to make the odd-looking goth girl an actual and fairly terrifying witch whose demonic powers can turn computer code into eldritch glyphs, possess Facebook pages, and even turn you into an abandoned social outcast if you dare befriend her. Friend Request even seeks to raise the tension with jump-scare shots of the protagonist’s friends and followers count dropping precipitously. There’s a very real politics of class at work even in an ephemeral film like this one. It wanted to “say something” about social media and, paradoxically, said more than it knew. The wounds of class are often highly visible on American social media. The assumption of economic and cultural capital is behind the power of social influencers and monetized platforms that encourage you to learn “lifestyle hacks,” some not available to tens of millions of American whose low-wage employment denies them the tech and the time. The believability of theatrical posts that render the happiness of home, family, personal success, or travel depends very much on class and status. That such material exists alongside utter howls of tweeted and posted rage offers a clue to the seething sense of grievance that one often finds in online life. Tens of millions of Americans in economic and personal distress are staring through their phone screens and consuming performative happiness enjoyed by those who can afford to stage garish social functions, vacations to exotic locales, images of dinners unaffordable to minimum-wage workers, and romantic relationships perfected, perhaps made possible, by disposable income. McLuhan told IBM in the sixties, when they produced computers mainly to help businesses run payroll, they had entered “the information business” and that the “dossier” maintained in bytes would create for humanity “one big gossip column.” In the world still living outside the screens, Big Brother would depend less on easily recognizable propaganda and more on the democratic impulse dying the death of a thousand distractions. The “one big gossip column” might have led Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to change their famous formulation to “social media and bombs” as the alliance that kept Americans desensitized. When we do look away from a social influencer paid to sell us face soap or the schadenfreude that comes with the digital downfall of a celebrity, we find that the world of cyber warfare tells its tales as simple parables that are easily graspable. In the age when empire has gone online, the defense establishment has encouraged the idea of the United States as victim, unprepared yet fully expecting an online Pearl Harbor. This possibility caused much public handwringing in the national security establishment after 2016. Lieutenant General Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said at a 2019 conference on cybersecurity held in Aspen, Colorado, that such a full-scale cyber assault on the United States had become “kind of the thing that keeps me up at night.”47 There are definitive holes in America’s cybersecurity plans, and a massive and disruptive hack by U.S. adversaries is likely. But much of the public discussion hides the fact that American imperial ambition has made our own cyber offensives the most poorly kept secret in national intelligence. In fact, the United States planned to use computers as war machines even before the internet became a reality. As early as the 1950s, CIA’s Operation Minerva gave the United States the codes for encryption machines sold by the Swiss-based company that produced the clunky coding apparatus that looked like the mating of a fifties cash register and a typewriter. This allowed for spying on a number of Latin American nations and U.S. allies. In 1993, the agency became the major shareholder in the company.48 Obviously, analog coding proved of little use after the PC revolution and the widespread civilian use of the internet. In 2021, it became general knowledge, at least among cybersecurity experts, that Chinese servers had long been targeted by “Trojan” viruses, as well as direct hacks to websites, apps, and online information related to state and military matters. Many of these acts came to light after a major if little-known cyber offensive against Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran in 2018. These actions, even if the public decided not to know about them, are described in some detail in a U.S. Department of Defense official release simply called “Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.” U.S. intelligence services have a similar long history of cyber attacks against Iran, including sallies against civilian and military infrastructure close to the time of writing. Before 2019, a phantasm-like malware called Stuxnet disabled elements of Iran’s nuclear program. Begun under George W. Bush and fully developed in the first year of the Obama administration, the insidious digital package replicated itself beyond its original intention in such a way that thousands of hackers could code it anew and unleash it to proliferate.49 Horror wears a technological mask because the online American empire operates in William Gibson’s “spook country.” But that doesn’t mean the macabre has been reduced to a meme. Our dark carnival allows for plenty of terror IRL. In fact, horror films increasingly melt the walls between fact and fiction. 12.Purging “My God, how did it get to this?” —The Purge: Election Year THE AMERICAN empire’s cyber-ops campaigns do not change the reality or the danger of foreign powers dealing another blow to an already wobbly democracy at home. It does place such disinformation in a broader context. Moreover, as Richard A. Clarke warned in his 2010 book Cyber War, the United States, since the 1990s, put all its efforts into offensive tactics and strategy. In a 2012 interview with Smithsonian magazine, he insisted that the United States had made no real preparations to defend its digital infrastructure. It was as if the United States launched the equivalent of several D-Day landings while enemy paratroopers floated into American backyards. This, of course, should have been received as a sobering assessment from the man who warned two uninterested administrations of the danger posed by Al-Qaeda.50 But there’s been far more changes brought to the American metropole by online life than an extension of imperial ambition into cyberspace. Amid the ghosting and trolling and the occasional troublesome zombie, a terribly dark thing has found it can attach itself to the nervous system of the internet and become a truly viral infection. You might have dodged forgettable films about satanic witches sending you friend requests or even the bots that emerge from the internet’s noosphere offering sex and companionship. You didn’t join a popular Facebook page called Heart of Texas in 2015, a false front for Russian intelligence that began an experiment with social media that ballooned into the fire hose of misinformation that drove the upcoming election cycle. But what happened on 4chan, or Reddit, didn’t stay there. The violence of rhetoric online transformed internet forums into strategy meetings for an online coup. Horror, as has so often been the case in American history, refused to stay on the screens. Horror franchises that aimed for satire sometimes took on a documentary quality rather than a prediction of dystopia to come. The popular The Purge series occupies a very peculiar place in the culture of horror. It’s not a paranormal possession trip or a slasher flick. It’s not a creature feature or a ghost story. The Purge sometimes employs the terror of home invasion that Michael Haneke made infamous in Funny Games (1997; 2007). But the horror is just as likely to find you in the streets. Its “near future” setting even keeps it from nestling easily into our current fascination with social apocalypse. The Purge films and the adjunct television series are their own genre.51 The terrorists have won in 2013’s The Purge. They are the ruling party of the United States and call themselves the New Founding Fathers (NFF), right wing and white supremist. An economic crash, not unlike the real-world death spiral of 2008, has splintered America. But the NFF has brought economic prosperity and the crime rate down to near zero. Popular opinion gives the credit to the annual “purge,” a twelve-hour period in which robbery, rape, and murder are allowed, civilization unleashes all its discontents, and the Freudian id goes a-wilding. In this first iteration, Ethan Hawke and his family are part of the one-percenters who can afford to live behind massive security gates. But he and his privileged brood find themselves targeted when they help a Black man screaming in the street and find their fortress invaded by a mob who wants the man—whom they call “a dirty homeless pig” who “exists only to fulfill our need to purge”—turned over to them. The politics of The Purge turned more explicit as the series advanced. The Purge: Anarchy features the emergence of a resistance, who look and dress a lot like the Black Panther Party of the sixties and seventies, taking over state broadcasts to launch jeremiads at a country that “[worships] at the altar of Smith and Wesson” and uses violence to “[redistribute] wealth upward.” The gloves are really off with 2016’s The Purge: Election Year, which bore the tagline “Keep America Great.” Director James DeMonaco, known for his anti-gun politics, created a scenario in which the regime’s armed death squads, who look like real-world tactical police units executing no-knock warrants, actively work with neo-Nazis. Appearing the year before torch-bearing mobs marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, under a new administration unwilling to condemn them, DeMonaco’s film seemed like prophecy rather than simple prescience. DeMonaco’s effort at creating a 2018 prequel, The First Purge, imagined the NFF beta testing the carnival of murder on Staten Island, assuming an armed and violent hoi polloi would purge the hell out of themselves. The director solved the plot hole that most people would simply leave the island for the night in a most American way: monetize violence. The state offers residents who will stay checks for five thousand dollars with more compensation if they “purge.” This is life-changing money for many Americans outside the frame. Although accused of “fashionable wokeness,” DeMonaco had been urging horror film audiences to think about wealth inequality since the Obama administration when neither Republicans nor Democrats wanted to talk much about it. The First Purge’s use of Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright,” an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement and Fight for $15, suggests a willingness to engage directly with the American empire’s need to wage war against internal dissent. Perhaps what’s truly become “fashionable” is the cynicism that assumes political awareness always represents a “pose.” Indeed, it seems a confirmation of John Carpenter’s message in They Live that there are so many messages everywhere to “Stay Asleep” that the decision to “Stay Woke” can be dismissed by film critics.52 13.Like Something Out of a Zombie Movie VIOLENCE HAS been celebrated in American life for centuries. The nation’s fascination with the West meant that the empire always hungered for new frontiers, across the Pacific world, in the Middle East, in Vietnam, and even by weaponizing the Earth’s orbit. We’ve remembered the Alamo, Wounded Knee, My Lai, and Spahn Ranch while not learning any of their lessons. We’ve forgotten, or never been told about, the mass murder at Sand Creek, the slaughter of Filipino freedom fighters and civilians in Luzon, the tens of thousands killed by the CIA in Operation Phoenix, the Highway of Death in Desert Storm, or the drone massacre in North Waziristan, Pakistan. We doomscroll through our newsfeeds and shake our heads with bewilderment at the latest atrocity in Yemen or Afghanistan. But then we are surprised when, as Malcom X controversially described the Kennedy assassination, “chickens [come] home to roost.” On January 6, 2021, an aggrieved collection of right-wing groups, incited by a lame-duck president and his enablers, attempted an insurrection. It could have been worse. The hundreds who stormed the Capitol could have killed more police. The mob that chanted “Hang Mike Pence!” could have found the vice president and his family and hauled them to the gallows built outside. The sadist fantasies that ooze out of the internet could have emerged from the shadows, online doxing becoming rape, torture, murder. Not the first purge, and not the last either. All of this could still happen because the structures of American life allow for it. You can’t build an empire on violence and then wonder about the causes of violence. Our fictions have been broadcasting this truth for years. The lives of millions of Americans have reflected it for centuries. Its ugliest face floats out of the idea that the assertion of raw power reshapes reality, controls the fact as well as opinion. Republican congressmen since January 6, 2021, have sounded a bit like my theoretically inclined profs in grad school, with their talk of “constructing narratives.” Some House Republicans speak as if they took a Derrida seminar and accepted the notion that “there is nothing outside the text.” Given the nature of political gangsterism since The Prince, they understand the brutal corollary well-meaning academics often dismiss: all that matters is who controls the texts. It looked like a horror film to many who watched in shock as the mob breached the Capitol. One of the most famous moments in George A. Romero’s Dawn of the Dead features female lead Fran asking her partner, Stephen, “What are they doing? Why do they come here?” Surveying the ruined mall where zombies putter about, some comically stumbling on escalators or flailing about in fountains, Stephen says that perhaps it was “instinct.” Driven only by a vicious hunger, they go to “an important place in their lives.” The insurrectionists weren’t zombies. The oncoming horde that trampled some of its own did have leaders, little Murder Legendres who mastered them with tales of stolen elections and Satanists in high places. Perhaps that’s why some of the more striking images of the day fall into two categories: murderous frenzy, or aimless wandering through the halls and offices of the Capitol, somnolent crowds moving as one only to halt their shamble to take selfies or place MAGA hats on statues in the rotunda. The involvement of leaders from QAnon, the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Boogaloo Boys, and a variety of MAGA stalwarts meant that the mob would do more than fumble about and break some windows. At least one photographer with a close view of what he called “hordes” of rioters jamming into windows while overrunning police and overturning barricades described it as “like something out of a zombie movie.”53 One of the most popular memes of the COVID era became a picture of an angry mob, an image captured by Joshua A. Bickel at the Ohio Statehouse. Anti-mask, anti-quarantine, and mostly pro-MAGA, they attempted to force their way into the statehouse, pressing against the glass doors in such a way that it looked painfully like every zombie fiction’s portrayal of the undead seeking to get at the flesh of the living. The memes created from the image featured predictable titles like “Return of the Brain Dead,” “Dawn of the Dumb,” and the clever, if weary, “Wow, this season of The Walking Dead sucks.” Bickel had mixed feelings about the uses to which his photograph has been put. In an interview not long after the meme went viral, he worried over the portrayal of people as zombies. This makes a great deal of moral sense, especially when some of the memes made the cruel joke that the protestors would likely become the actual “infected” of their own personal horror films. Though seeing their behavior as irresponsible, Bickel told his interviewer that we had no idea what dreadful paths brought fearful, broken, and possibly mentally ill people to such a pass. “These people aren’t zombies,” he said.54 Giving monstrous qualities to human beings does have a terrible stench in America’s history; the photographer has a point. Moreover, in the game of enmonstering, everyone gets to play. During the January 6 insurrection, among the MAGA hats, “Don’t Tread on Me” flags, and signs emblazoned with “Q,” there also appeared caps that read “U.S. Zombie Outbreak Response Team” (USZORT being their preferred acronym). USZORT is an actual organization. It does not foreground politics, though it does go beyond harmless memes into encouraging “doomsday prepping” with the idea that adding zombies puts the fun into preparing for “anything from a person infected by a pandemic outbreak to a crazy nut job . . .” A visit to the USZORT website suggests the group is mostly harmless, despite loose talk of how “a zombie” could be a “gangster” (obvious racial coding) or a “terrorist” (also obvious racial coding). As of January 18, 2021, the forums have been mostly quiet, and posts are either seemingly lonely inquirers looking for “Zombie Preparedness Training” in their state or spam from male performance enhancement products. But the dangers of such a mindset, fear of a natural disaster or mild civil unrest lurching into stockpiling weapons, are pretty plain. Kelly J. Baker, a scholar who studies both horror and white supremacy, describes the unusual links between right-wing violence, doomsday prepping, and zombie obsessions in her excellent book The Zombies Are Coming. These connections include a fascination with military-grade weaponry and viewing people of color as a “horde” shambling toward them to take life and property. In the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, the desire to purge seems to have grown stronger among some segments of American society. Indeed, rather than bothering to see their enemies as monsters, some rightist ideologues have suggested they will become monsters themselves. In the online journal American Greatness, supposedly launched to provide intellectual heft to Trumpism’s meandering grievances, Jack Kerwick urged readers to “become the stuff of nightmares.” In a chilling call to arms, he wrote that “the good man must spare not a moment to train, in both body and mind, to become the monster that he may need to become . . .”55 Is this how the empire collapses into the troubled nation-state? The Soviet Union, seemingly a juggernaut with imperial outposts and interests around the globe, died between 1989 and 1991. Crony capitalism attended the rise of Russia while the Soviet Union collapsed not only into a failed state but a collection of failed states. Putin’s Russia emerged as a threatening regional power, though one able to create chaos in cyber warfare like even smaller, more isolated nations like Iran and North Korea. Has the same process set in here? Does political polarization mean eventual balkanization? Will the extreme right get the civil war it wants? The second decade of the century taught Americans about the unruliness of history. The obvious failures of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us that of the many things empires can do, one thing they’ve always done is decline and fall. The insurrection certainly harmed America’s reputation for invincibility abroad. After a drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, more American military personnel occupied the Capitol in the next week than served in all the Middle East. The forever war had come home. The world watched the monster documentary. Did the wars without end exhaust American military and economic power while a meandering and inhumane foreign policy sputtered and failed? Has the death of manufacturing not only destroyed the working class but left America’s economic grip over much of the world in tatters? One hundred years after the beginning of its ascent to global power, has American hubris ended the American century? Some of the biggest promoters of empire think so. Historian and foreign policy analyst Max Boot, who once made a famous “Case for American Empire,” rather bravely left the Republican Party in 2016 to protest the internal rot of Trumpism. To his credit, Boot worried that his compatriots enabled a drift into authoritarianism. But his primary concern over Trumpism was its know-nothing approach to what he called “the world order created by the greatest generation in the 1940s.”56 Boot understands American global power and its limits well enough to know that a landing by U.S. Marines and/or a regime change supported by the CIA isn’t possible in the way it had been in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s. Adventurism has been more likely to result in the indictments of Iran-Contra, the debacle of Black Hawk down, the confusion of “humanitarian” bombings in the Balkans, ill-considered meddling in the politics of Libya, or the catastrophe of Iraq and Afghanistan. And these are the best-case scenario. The first twenty years of the new century have been a lesson in America’s limited ability to impose its will. Of course, maybe what’s bad for the empire is good for democracy at home. In the American past, imperial overreach did inspire social change. The violence visited on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the sixties inaugurated the anti-war movement that then forged links with the Black freedom struggle, second-wave feminism, and the first efforts toward gay liberation. The same could happen again and the transformations wrought could change our fate. A generation who does not recall a time their country did not wage wars on other peoples could use the streets and the ballot box to effect structural change. The people could demand Congress reclaim its constitutional powers to make war from imperial presidential administrations, now largely made up of unelected proconsuls of empire. They could demand laws that regulate corporate power and campaign finance laws in ways that cripple the national security state forever. History is not an oracle. We don’t actually learn from the past and save ourselves from the doom of repeating it. History is just what happens. It’s a place where, because of atavism, apathy, and greed, the worst possible thing is true. “Empires do not last,” Chalmers Johnson warned, “and their ends are usually unpleasant.”57",

      "content": "EPILOGUE Scattered Like Tombstones THE PRESENT “This country is seeking to be whole. Stretching out its arms . . . and consuming all it can. And we merely follow.” —A CANNIBAL EXPLAINS AMERICA’S MANIFEST DESTINY, Ravenous (1999) IT STARTED at the Fleetwood Manor apartment complex in South Carolina in August 2016, as summer faded and attention turned to the national election. Children convinced their parents that clowns skulked out of the woods, wandered our highways in vans with blacked-out windows, called to us from the shadows, and lurked at the edges of their playgrounds, urging them to come and play. This dark fairy tale led anxious male residents to wander into the piney woods behind the rows of identical saltbox units, at times firing randomly into the forest at any shape that might presage a sinister harlequin.1 The strange sightings metastasized across the country, the way they have in earlier periods of change and political discord. In the 1980s, “clowns in a black van” sightings in urban areas tracked with the fraying of the social safety net, the influx of crack cocaine, and the general sense of chaos. Clowns are savage failures, the smell of alcohol and sawdust and sweat a rancid undertone to the dark carnival’s proffered bouquet of fried treats and cotton candy. Clowns never really had a moment of when they “turned bad,” says folklorist Benjamin Radford, “for they were never really good.” Even in late antiquity, Christian bishops worried about the Roman, or Roman-influenced, carnival clown that triggered a Dionysian explosion of rage and horror. Mr. Punch appeared in English marionette theater as a clown prone to extraordinary violence.2 What they all have in common are a poisonous rage, one distinctly masculine in quality. Their efforts to make you laugh are strained, goofy, and unsettling. For small children, they are a threat because it’s not clear what they will do or why they so badly want you to laugh. The brief but intense 2016 clown panic coincided with critics from the left, right, and center describing Trump as a “clown” or “a rodeo clown.” American Horror Story: Cult, a mostly failed effort to satirize Trumpville, made the interesting decision to feature an alt-right imitation of the Manson Family dressed as terrifying clowns. The popularity of the 2017 It remake prompted a New Yorker cover titled “October Surprise” of a pederast clown hiding behind a tree to allude to Trump’s unexpected win. Independence Day of 2018 found the New York Daily News sounding a sensationalistic tocsin by making its entire front page a mock-up of the president slathered in clown makeup. Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone wrote an anti-Trump screed, though a damn good and well-researched screed, entitled Insane Clown President. Memes of Trump as a clown online are numerous. I stopped counting at exactly 126 separate images.3 “It’s hard to get any word in with this clown,” Joe Biden said in his first debate with Trump in September of 2020, “excuse me, this person.” On one level, it’s an easy insult. On another, it’s a realization that the dark carnival is here and cannot be ignored, that its after-midnight jaunts to Haiti, Chile, the Philippines, Vietnam, and most of western Asia brought the violence home. Therefore, Victoria McCollum writes, the horror genre received the attention it did in the Trump years. Horror became less about comforting us, making us think about how we are glad we aren’t at the business end of our nation’s gun, and instead demanding we look at the empire’s homeland. Sometimes, McCollum tells us, it does this with the subtlety of “an amplified death rattle,” even if most films of the Trump era are, as always, commodities and not simply political manifestos.4 It’s impossible to see the clown terrors of recent years as anything but the realization that a bleak and angry nihilism has sunk into the bone and blood of the country. Even the ultimately disastrous American involvement in South Asia, productive of so much evil, had its beginnings in a cockeyed idealism. The empire doesn’t pretend anymore. Under Trump, the United States drew close to neo-fascist regimes in India, Hungary, and Brazil while pondering giving the theocratic House of Saud nuclear weapons. You can’t trust a clown. They might do anything to you. Are they circling economically marginalized neighborhoods in black vans? So goes the legend. But the horrors are verifiably filling the skies with matte-black drones and deadly Apache helicopters, and the dark carnival rolls on its steel wheels to a town near you. “We are living in a horror film,” wrote columnist Charles M. Blow in July 2020, “one starring Donald Trump.”5 Blow wrote at a moment when the United States led the world in numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, 3.2 million of the former and 135,000 of the latter. Three states, California, Texas, and Florida, accounted for 20 percent of all global infections. Two months later, the number of dead surged close to 200,000. Six months later, that number doubled to 400,000 dead, a projection many health officials in the spring of 2020 suggested as a worst-case scenario if the virus raged unimpeded. I’m writing this in 2021. The death toll surges toward 800,000 people, exceeding American deaths in the Second World War and closing in on the combined American deaths in both world wars.6 President Donald Trump’s inaugural speech, three years before the outbreak, will forever be remembered for his evocation of “American carnage” and his reference to the country as a landscape of “tombstones.” In an angry sixteen minutes, he avoided the soaring phrases and the nods to American idealism that mark most inaugurals. “America first! America first!” he railed at the crowd, many of those in the instantly identifiable red MAGA hats in no need of convincing. A fifty-year-old white man who spoke to The Guardian that day saw the whole world turning on its axis, with Brexit, Trump, and, he vainly hoped, the triumph of Marine Le Pen in France. Asked what he felt he gained by these events, he simply said, “I’m a white male who owns firearms. At least for the next four years I get to keep my guns and my balls.”7 While the core adherents of Trumpism grasped at their guns and balls, the rest of us have often been aghast at ourselves as much as the daily newsfeed. A motley crew of white liberals, leftists, centrists, libertarians, and not a few conservatives have gravely worried about authoritarianism degrading democratic norms, even though a cursory knowledge of history reveals that democracy has never been the norm in the American experience. Lies about voter fraud used to legitimate voter suppression have their roots in the white terrorism that ended Reconstruction in the 1870s. Southern states, and parts of the rest of the country, moved to forestall the effect of Black and Latino votes in the aftermath of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The grand old American tradition of holding election day between seven and seven on a Tuesday, the time when working people are, of course, working—but also dealing with childcare, transportation issues, and caring for elderly relations—presents one of the greatest obstacles to the basic right to vote. For much of American history, only white men—and in a few states, only white men who owned property—had the right to vote or hold office. Moreover, the South ignored the Fifteenth Amendment. The 1965 Voting Rights Act, meant to reanimate that much-ignored part of the Constitution, has lain in tatters after a series of decisions by the conservative extremists who today hold the balance of power on the Supreme Court and in state legislatures. Since 2010, twenty-four states enforced restrictions ranging from voter ID laws to criminalizing early balloting, all measures intended to restrict Black voting and the working-class vote more broadly. In 2021, the state legislatures of Arizona, Texas, Florida, and Georgia continued the historic American practice of legislating votes out of existence. The Supreme Court for all practical purposes legitimated this decision in the summer of 2021, much like the high court had given state laws that enforced Jim Crow its imprimatur in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision. Given these facts, what, exactly, have been the “democratic norms” of the United States? Still, many of us spent the Trump years eager to “go back to normal.” Such thoughts plagued us before a global pandemic started killing millions. For some, normal meant a time when the daily news, and even issues we cared about, didn’t really affect us or the emoluments received for being white, male, and gainfully employed in America. In other words, we have been waging a quiet, deeply solipsistic campaign to make our America great again. While worrying over the reach, power, and explosive violence of an empire that people like me benefit from, I haven’t wanted things to change much. Viet Thanh Nguyen searingly noted that the Western left has, for decades, been able to voice their support for “resistance” and even “revolution” without having to face what it means for the dispossessed to claim power and use it in the institutions in which these white comrades have built their careers and their security. Rightist trolling on social media would no doubt diagnose me with Trump Derangement Syndrome, a term that aspirant edgelords began using to “own the libs” after 2016. And maybe they’d be right if they agreed that the whole culture suffered some form of this illness. Rick Perlstein labelled the period between 1965 and 1972 “Nixonland.” Recent years, perhaps since 2012, have decidedly been Trumpville. It’s a place at least as pathological as Nixonland, but even more suffocating in its bitterness and paranoia. The nation-state, still a military behemoth abroad, has built a sideshow on the precipice of calamity, flirting with sickly sweet madness. We’ve seen how horror continues to articulate fears of both empire and nation-state. The clowns of the summer of 2016 became a weird reminder of wars waged out of uncontrollable temper tantrums or America’s past sins coming to their logical conclusion in a foreign policy slaved to multinationals and the oligarch class that controls them. But not everyone agrees. Plenty of scholars of the American empire think the con is over and decline has set in. A few despised Trump for precisely that reason. Many, maybe most, “Never Trump” Republicans, and more than a few Democrats, join Max Boot in despising Trump because he may have accelerated the decline of the United States as the hyperpower. The harming of relationships with “allies,” who have largely been subservient to the United States through NATO, has been a primary complaint. Some criticism, of course, focused on climate change denialism that strained alliances to the breaking point after America’s unilateral withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. But various national security experts have mostly been aghast at Trump’s know-nothingism in response to new battlefield technologies, especially artificial intelligence and cyber ops, while not worrying so much about his desire to lash out at whatever seems vulnerable, whether that be the environment or people.8 The particular brand of nationalism that Trump and MAGA represented suggests what looks at first like contradictory impulses. A significant drawdown of troops in the Middle East, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and gutting what little the United States offers its people as a social safety net looks exactly like what many conservatives and liberals see as the worst aspects of Trumpism: narcissistic impulse disguised as aggressive leadership, a pulling in from the periphery of American interests abroad to the core of the nation-state, and a breach with almost a century of policy directed by a rational design of building American corporate and military power. But in many respects, Trump simply stripped America’s imperial project of its pretensions about humanitarian intervention and nation-building. Trump spent an inordinate amount of time over his public career railing about foreign aid, and in the first years of his presidency, he attempted to cut funding to USAID by 30 percent. Meanwhile, the Trump administration lashed out with one of the most powerful tentacles of American power: gunrunning. Trump drew close to the Hindi nationalist regime of India with the sale of the deadly AH-64 Apache gunships. By the summer of 2019, India used its new weapons systems in its provocative move into the disputed region of Kashmir.9 An arms deal with the repressive regime of Saudi Arabia worth 110 billion opened the Trump presidency. Despite significant tension due to the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, the Pentagon sent advanced Patriot missile systems to the kingdom and, in an underreported episode, Trump’s acting secretary of defense Mike Esper ordered 250 American military personnel to train the Saudi military in the use of the systems. In 2019, despite bipartisan attempts in Congress to restrain him, Trump used a declaration of “national emergency” to offer 8 billion in weapons to the Saudis. In early 2020, amid the emerging public health catastrophe, the administration deployed 2,500 new troops to the Prince Sultan Air Force Base in Riyadh. It also approved 290 million dollars in smart bomb sales, aware they’d be used against civilians in Yemen.10 In 2018 and 2019, Trump green-lit two licenses for nuclear technology benefiting the Saudis. Not only did he act without congressional approval, the Committee on Foreign Relations asked for information about these licenses and was met with a two-month silence.11 In the age of empire with the gloves off, the perennial conservative ambition of militarizing space returned, the imperial fantasy of the final frontier, born from a sad and silly combination of Buck Rogers serials and the work of Robert A. Heinlein on Project Moonbase and Starship Troopers. In 2018, the Trump administration’s demand for a new branch of the military called Space Force took much of the public by surprise. Indeed, many perceived it as a tweet-driven ignis fatuus. In fact, it brought to fruition decades of right-wing conceptions of expanding the American empire and capital into space and expanding the global reach of America’s already sturdy surveillance net, one that went back to Wernher von Braun’s fantasies of orbital weapons platforms. Few Americans paid much attention when Trump signed it into existence in 2020. In 2021, the sixteen-thousand-member cadre, under the command of the Air Force, has a proposed budget of more than fifteen billion dollars.12 Heinlein, Manson Family hero, would be pleased. He’s getting his starship troopers. Has the United States chosen the chain saw or the shark, horror as the nightmare unsettling the American unconscious or as the tranquil dreams of our spoiled national id? What does horror have to say right now about how Americans consider their empire abroad and their troubles at home? It seems we punched our ticket to ride or die, gored by the predatory teeth of both. We are settling in with horror films that feel constrained to offering some comment about American life, even American history and its violence. Audiences have come to accept horror as a serious genre, “elevated” or “smart” in the sense of having something to say. And yet, for a true mainstream blockbuster, we must have heroes willing to destroy the global village to save it, to turn monster island into Amity Island. Kong: Skull Island (2017) offered a peculiar collage of very American notions set on precisely one of those “definitely not American” places that so often lived at the margins of empire. A big, loud, summer blockbuster with easy-on-the eyes cinematography, star power (Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston), and dripping CGI off the screen, the flick has more of the chain saw to it than you would expect. In production four decades after the fall of Saigon, that lost war broods over this actioner in ways that may seem confusing to foreign audiences and even young Americans for whom America’s journey into the heart of darkness seems as distant as the Second World War. For a popcorn flick that dealt with one of the world’s most recognized monsters, the film’s need to turn Skull Island into a complicated political allegory surprises. Sent on a mission to aid scientists when they thought they’d be headed home from South Asia, an Air Cav unit finds itself slaughtered in another jungle. Notably, they bring to the small Pacific island the same heavy ordnance, high-caliber guns, and chemical weapons used in Vietnam. Several shots reference images of napalm exploding in the jungle that are an homage to Apocalypse Now, itself borrowing images from military film footage. “This is one war we get to win,” insists Jackson’s Colonel Packard, the Kurtz/Ahab of the film, who is angry the war ended without an American victory and is just as happy to kill King Kong if the United States won’t let him slaughter Viet Cong anymore. The monster gets napalmed in this film, the burning jelly searing swaths in his fur, just in case we are still trying to avoid the subtext. Packard dies, in true Melvillian fashion, at the hands of the monster and his own conflagration. When Steven Spielberg created Jaws, he wanted any reference to contemporary politics expunged from the source material of Peter Benchley’s novel. Kong: Skull Island tells us it’s 1973 at the beginning of the film, in case we want an exact date. In Warner Bros.’ related films, Godzilla (2014) and Godzilla King of the Monsters (2019), the filmmakers make it clear that their monsters are born in American imperial history, with numerous references not only to American nuclear testing (“we woke them up”) but to actual historical tests such as Operation Castle Bravo in 1954, which had a much higher radioactive yield than expected. Fallout drifted from the Marshall Islands to India and Australia, and eventually to the United States itself. To be clear, the popular films are not kaiju for readers of Howard Zinn. At best, they show we are a long way from the nineties revival of Godzilla, when the disruption of his ancient sleep could be blamed on the French. And yet Kong: Skull Island also doesn’t question, in any fashion, the basic premise that U.S. troops can land in an “un-American jungle” anywhere in the world, explode tons of ordnance, and find themselves welcomed and befriended by the Indigenous population. Monarch, a super-secret organization that seems a lot like a CIA tasked with killing monsters, are the human protagonists of all Warner Bros.’ monsterverse flicks. The film’s logic assumes that if only meddling and morally suspect Congressional oversight committees would stop sticking their noses where they don’t belong, then Monarch could get on with their work without the burdens of accountability, operating out of black sites all over the globe. These popular films don’t bother to narrate empire, as did the original King Kong. They assume it. Both Democrats and Republicans who feared that Trump’s American carnage meant the end of empire watch these big-budget popcorn flicks for solace. Americans, even in their most escapist entertainments, assume their armed forces, black ops units, and mercenaries (“civilian contractors”) can go anywhere in the world and kill anything that moves. In fact, in a bizarre confirmation of how much America’s culture industry can globalize its historical obsessions, much of Kong: Skull Island was filmed in northern provinces of Vietnam, showing the war against the monster fought in the gorgeous provinces of Ninh Binh and Quang Ninh. The Vietnamese government happily cooperated and granted the film’s director status as “tourism ambassador,” the first person not of Vietnamese descent to ever receive this title.13 Films and bombs. But also films about bombs used against a monster, produced in a country with millions of tons of still-unexploded ordnance hurled into the country’s body and bones for nearly fifteen years. These terrible relics have maimed and killed tens of thousands of civilians since 1975. But the power of America’s “industry of memory” can sell a country a horror allegory about a war that killed millions of their people, seen from the standpoint of the aggressor, and make them like it.14 Empires stand alone. There’s so often an immense loneliness at the heart of contemporary horror films, the stories leeching out our inner poisons, replaying for us the terrors of living in a fortified nation-state. Even before the pandemic of 2020, themes of blindness, deafness, and, above all, isolation saturated contemporary horror in films like Bird Box, A Quiet Place, The Silence, Hush, Here Alone, It Comes at Night, The Wind, and Don’t Breathe. Empire’s apocalypse has come to mean suffering alone, a peculiarly haunting echo of the failed promises, and the horrors, of the global village. The writer Linh Dinh, in his novel Love Like Hate, admits that Vietnam, especially his beloved Saigon, is a disaster, but he adds that at least one doesn’t die alone in the desolation, the “solitary nightmare” of America. Americans are “so cool” they manage to be “quiet about their desperation.”15 Isolation may seem a strange condition at empire’s twilight. Perhaps it’s the pondering of the aftermath of the world we made that horror plays with now. The clowns are terrifying, the sound of the calliope tingles the spine with its weirdness, the music of the carousel jangles, its Wurlitzer tune broken and serrated. But once something wicked coming this way has passed, what does it leave behind? Is our insatiate need to victimize, or at least glamorize those who victimize in our name, part of the reason for our polarizations and isolations? American myths adore the loner and the rogue, the quiet man of action. Teddy Roosevelt tore a canal into Panama and Ted Bundy tore apart sorority girls. John Wayne buried his kills by old Red River and John Wayne Gacy laid his to rest in the crawl space at 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Speaking softly and carrying a big stick has been the American way, as has using that stick to bludgeon others into paralysis and death. It’s lonely at the top of the bone pile. Have Americans chosen the chain saw or the shark? The last hundred years suggest they’ve wanted both. The certainty that the monsters waiting in the deep can be slain by American tough-guyery means we are never afraid to wade back into the water. We still fear the saw but refuse to let its blind roar unsettle our sleep. We can even reimagine it, a weapon we make our own, Ash of the Evil Dead films putting a chain saw on his bloody stump of an arm and marching against an army of darkness with panache, even a John Wayne swagger. War stories are difficult. War stories are so often horror stories that try to ignore their own tropes. Too often when the lights go up, you think “war is hell” but also damn exciting and “has to be done.” But look at it. It’s also the sport of empire that demands full cooperation—your taxes, your apathy, your willingness to hate what you see in the floating gunsight that ranges across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific world. Horror movies, fiction, and games draw on these poisoned waters and reimagine these piles of corpses. In a country that taught itself to become history’s most powerful war machine while keeping less than 1 percent of its population under arms, horror offers one of the few places where the true war story can be told. The truth of war is not about what happens on the front lines. It’s a story about what Americans consume, what we are willing to allow our government to do so we can keep bingeing, and whether we are willing to all play at answering the call of duty, becoming a nation of first-person shooters, most of whom will never have to pick up an actual rifle unless it’s to kill other Americans out of rage and frustration. Instead, the working-class avatars we’d call the cops on if they walked through our neighborhood do the killing for us. We’ll just wrap ourselves in the softer side of empire, tales of soldiers in our wars “defending our freedoms,” and not the truth that they are pawns in a larger game of taking what belongs to others. The war story of America has become the very apotheosis of Aislinn Clarke’s dictum about horror: the worst thing is true. The twenty-first century looms in front of us in darkness, moraines of debris at its base, cobalt vitriol burbling out of its peak, the thunders and lightnings imagined of Sinai casting a phosphorus glow over its seven rucks. Will the stars and stripes appear on its peak, naked power subduing another century? Or could we perhaps become a people rather than an empire? Better angels and all that? There’s nothing in our history or the history of the world that assures us it will be so. We may want war stories that give us a tale of redemption, maybe a bit of survival and glory. But history and its horror refuse to reassure us. The mountain rears up, disappearing into a horizon of fathomless darkness. The tinny sounds of the carnival carry on the hot winds, heard in the quiet of the small hours.",

      "content": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I KNOW we are supposed to use this space to thank everyone in our own lives who made the book possible. I’ll get to that. But first, perhaps more than in the writing of my books, I’ve been profoundly aware of the influence of people central to American horror culture, some living and some dead, a few of them acquaintances and most total strangers. Whatever the case, I could not have written this book, or have the life I do, without them. So thank you Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, Rusty Cundieff, Larry Cohen, Roy Thomas, Ray Bradbury, George Romero, Heather Langenkamp, Tony Todd, Deborah Hill, Victor LaValle, Robert Eggers, Kevin Smith, Laird Barron, John Langan, Rob Zombie, Angela Carter, Larry Fessenden, Neve Campbell, Mike Mignola, Jordan Peele, Tom Savini, Robert Englund, Grady Hendrix, Stephen Graham Jones, Wes Craven, Maila Nurmi, Fangoria magazine, Axelle Carolyn, Paul Tremblay, Steve Niles, and, above all, James Whale. Your films, performances, books, and images haunt my best dreams. Two of my former students’ research contributed to this work and I want to give them some praise here as I did in the main text. Billie Jasmine Powell’s work on Candyman introduced me to the hip-hop obsession with the film I otherwise would not have encountered. Olive “Diz” Beck’s research on the American left and science fiction proved invaluable for my discussion of that topic. This is my fourth book with Counterpoint Press and also my fourth working with Dan Smetanka as my editor. As the press has grown, Dan’s continued attention to detail and time spent on an individual manuscript amazes me. His passion for books keeps a burgeoning publishing house centered on its author’s visions. Many thanks for the same treatment from Laura Berry and to an excellent copy editor, Elana Rosenthal. Collectively, they saved me from a number of embarrassing mistakes and, I assure you, any that remain are my own. My agent Deidre Mullane has worked with me on four original works and one revised edition. Her friendship, support, and attention to every detail of the process means more to me than she knows. Beth Phillips really makes everything I do possible with her love and friendship. I am certain I love her more than, say, even James Whale. This book is dedicated to my parents, living witnesses to many of the “true events” of the bleak world covered in this book. They taught me more about how to understand and respond to that world than they realize, and I love them both very much.",

The press did little to cover this scandal and details have primarily emerged by the work of later historians. The most meaningful and detailed contemporary critique of the practice appeared in the generally ignored pamphlet by George Breitman, Wartime Crimes of Big Business (New York: Pioneer Publishers and the Socialist Workers Party, 1943). Much more than the Marxist origin of the detailed investigation doomed it; the Socialist Workers Party was a Trotskyite organization and so allowed no oxygen, paradoxically, because the United States allied in the war effort with Stalin’s Soviet Union. Around the same time, Hollywood produced the film Mission to Moscow (1943), which followed the pro-Stalin journals of Ambassador Joseph E. Davies, including a difficult-to-watch celebration of the 1930s show trials that condemned Trotsky as a Nazi collaborator.

For some examples, see Lacy K. Ford Jr., “Making the ‘White Man’s Country’ White: Race, Slavery, and State-Building in the Jacksonian South,” Journal of the Early Republic 19, no. 4 (1999): 713–37. 3.It’s important for the reader to know that my interpretation not only rests on the consensus view of historians of Haiti but also evidence that the period press spoke openly, and often in a celebratory manner, of the U.S. invasion.

Gates, “War-Related Deaths in the Philippines, 1898–1902,” Pacific Historical Review 53, no. 3 (1984): 367–78.

Moreland’s big break came with a series of films in the thirties and forties, often in roles that were demeaning (then and now). However, his humor often struck a chord with Black audiences, and even today it’s possible to read his burlesque style as a running commentary on the often clueless white characters around him. In King of the Zombies, he is the only character who fully understands the threat and attempts to warn his compatriots. Before his death, he became a regular on the Hallmark Hall of Fame series and appeared in the cult horror film Spider Baby (1968) with Lon Chaney Jr. Spike Lee paid tribute to him in Bamboozled (2000), which showed Black actors carving out spaces of dignity for themselves in Jim Crow Hollywood. 11.Mary A.

The claims here are based on Alfred W. McCoy’s The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (New York: Harper & Row, 1972). McCoy’s claims have never been seriously disputed. In 1981 conversations with Jonathan Mirsky, a former CIA agent who worked closely with General Pao, McCoy confirmed the Hmong’s entanglement with the opium trade. While I am not able to confirm it and so take a different view for now, former CIA agents have also suggested that Air America pilots did carry refined heroin, though without their knowledge. See William E. Colby and Jonathan Mirsky, “Heroin, Laos, and the CIA,” New York Review of Books, November 22, 1990. 43.An official CIA report, classified on its first release, noted that CIA policy forbade transport of “large quantities” of illegal drugs aboard Air America. But the report also admitted it may have happened in smaller quantities in an accidental fashion.

Appy notes that theft and corruption proved so rampant that nearly half of these commodities disappeared. South Vietnamese men and women, for starvation wages, provided the labor behind military bases, often with elaborate services for officers and enlisted men alike that included swimming pools, ice cream shops, maid service, nightly films, and brothels. Private American companies made hundreds of millions of dollars supporting the war, most infamously Brown & Root. This engineering and construction firm became so notorious that GIs regularly referred to them as “Burn and Loot.” Appy, American Reckoning, 108–111. 5.Interview with Tom Savini in Smoke and Mirrors (2015). 6.Savini, Grande Illusions, 12; and interview, Smoke and Mirrors. 7.Al Santoli, Everything We Had: An Oral History of the Vietnam War (New York: Random House, 1981), 63. 8.W.

It’s not even a little surprising that that trade paper of America’s ruling class blamed the plight of American cities on high taxes and bloated city government rather than the glaringly obvious reasons for unemployment and decay of the city services, the latter of which the limousine liberals and conservatives that populate the paper’s op-ed pages regard as government waste. 11.“Examining Chrysler’s 1979 Rescue,” All Things Considered, NPR, November 12, 2008, www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96922222. 12.Tommy Beer, “Top 1% of U.S. Households Hold 15 Times More Wealth Than Bottom 50% Combined,” Forbes, October 8, 2020. 13.Joe Williams, “Show Me the Movies,” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 17, 2005, C1. 14.The Clinton administration’s assumption that what Joshua B.

Emma Tomalin (New York: Routledge, 2015). One of the more troubling aspects of this discussion, first produced at the London School of Economics as a paper, concerns the suggestion that Pentecostalism might allow for the stealth justification of free market economics. The argument is convoluted but involves Pentecostalism in conjunction with “innovation” to bring on neoliberal change to the “worldview” of African peoples. Marx was right. 44.Under Kennedy and Johnson, the United States expressed support for ending apartheid and even linked it to changes in American society under the civil rights movement. However, Nixon reversed policy and the United States became increasingly weak willed on the subject under Ford and Carter. Increasing pressure from a multitude of sources mounted on the Reagan administration to reverse U.S. support, but the administration proved recalcitrant. Congress finally passed a comprehensive package of sanctions in 1986 . . . however, it survived only after a second supermajority vote overrode a presidential veto. 45.Nicky Falkof, “‘Satan has come to Rietfontein’: Race in South Africa’s Satanic Panic,” Journal of Southern African Studies 38, no.4 (2012): 753–67. 46.“Mapping Anti-Gay Laws in Africa,” Amnesty International UK, May 31, 2018, www.amnesty.org.uk/lgbti-lgbt-gay-human-rights-law-africa-uganda-kenya-nigeria-cameroon. 47.Peter Applebome, “Drugs, Death, and the Occult Meet in Grisly Inquiry at Mexico Border,” New York Times, April 13, 1989. 48.Victor, Satanic Panic, 21. 49.Richard Ofshe and Ethan Watters, Making Monsters: False Memories, Psychotherapy, and Sexual Hysteria (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 188. 50.“CIA-assisted ‘contras’ murdered Sandinistas, Official Reportedly Says,” Knight-Ridder, October 20, 1984; accessed January 23, 2019, www.newspapers.com/newspage/120079409/. 51.“Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair,” House of Representatives, November 13, 1987, archive.org/details/reportofcongress87unit/page/n11/mode/2up.

The allusion becomes more inexplicable given that, in Independence Day, nukes save the United States and, in the logic of the film, the world. 21.It’s worth noting that, while Jurassic Park does have a well-earned reputation for unleashing CGI on the world, the film used a number of practical effects later cleaned up on the green screen.

      "content": "PROLOGUE Carnival and Empire WHO WILL survive America? Sound and smells and manic lights draw us in. Maybe we will see something forbidden? The curtain desires a hand to open it. A skull bathed in a nauseating red glow invites us to take the haunted ride. But what happens if we go to the dark carnival and wander the grounds while barkers call us to see their sideshows and the faces around us turn ghastly in the sodium-pale light? It seems a place of banal cruelties. The soda pop toss, the baseball throw, the shooting range are all rigged. The sideshows transform human beings into abominations for our pleasure, freaks conscripted to help us feel normal. The rides are assembled with haste and indifference, and anyone who wants a whirligig or to take a plunge on the roller coaster bets on bad odds. The clowns sweat through their face paint. They are trying so hard to make us do something, to make us laugh. We cringe because they look like they’re hurting one another in their perverse play, wielding giant hammers and what we hope are only plastic pistols rigged to explode into a little flag . . . BANG! Their brutal campaign leaves us with the deep unease that we have been abused but are unable to articulate how or why. The dark carnival incites and titillates. The sawdust of the carnival has dried up and blown away in the winds of modernity. State fairs are perhaps the closest we come anymore to the sights, the sounds, and the fetid smells of those strange, compelling spaces. Even in the age of colossal theme parks run by Warner Bros., Disney, and Universal Studios, the carnival seems more enticing precisely because it’s not a safe place—you might get hurt, you might see something you can’t unsee. There lives, somewhere in our psyches where it has crouched on its haunches since the earliest human experience, a yearning for the taboo and the terrible. Our dark carnivals are, then, a place to visit, an experience desired only because we can leave it behind. But, in truth, we cannot. If you live in the United States, you are a denizen of the dark carnival. Horror is the lingua franca. Horror defined the American century. Horror provided the legitimacy, the justifications, and the bread and circuses of American empire. Yet, over the last few decades, horror has attempted to shake us out of our sleep, to understand the kind of world we have made, to discover that something wicked isn’t coming . . . it’s already here. The United States briefly resisted the subtle temptations of monsters from the dark after the very real carnage of World War I (1914–1918). Just as the once-great powers of Europe began to recognize the influence the United States would now have in global affairs, their cultures produced unnerving tales of revivified corpses, hallucinatory fever dreams, and crime lords with hypnotic powers of manipulation. Americans watched slapstick comedies and westerns. One of the most popular films of 1919 starred Lon Chaney in The Miracle Man, a romantic drama. By the late 1920s, frightening fictions startled the American public like a relentless, unexpected pounding on the door at three in the morning. Master of makeup effects Lon Chaney, no longer connected to romance and uplifting drama, terrified audiences in The Phantom of the Opera (1925), his cadaverous head unveiled in a moment that, to this day, makes the viewer feel they’ve been forced to hear a hideous secret about the world. Chaney’s villains—deluded masterminds, vampires, and violent sadists—delivered a skittering chill up the collective spine of what was becoming the most powerful country on earth. His extraordinary skill with makeup effects made him the master of mutilation, his criminals and creatures distorted by suffering, amputation, and scar tissue. Darkness came with unexpected speed, the light of the sun spelunking into a black pool of night. Bela Lugosi glided ominously through the opera of terror that was Dracula (1931). The same year, British war veteran James Whale directed Frankenstein, presenting Mary Shelley’s monster as a very literal embodiment of a conflict that the German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg called “a corpse factory.” For almost twenty years, America danced the monster mash for the World War II generation and their children, making the squared cranium of Frankenstein’s monster and the lonely yet threatening howl of the Wolf Man two of the most recognizable menaces of America’s mass culture. Horror fictions clashed with the way much of America wanted to understand itself. The Great Depression had, ironically, plagued the decade that invented the term the American Dream. James Truslow Adams, a popular historian, coined the term in a 1931 book called The Epic of America, which asserted that the country offered “opportunity for each according to ability or achievement” even as millions stood in bread lines and a quarter of Americans found themselves unemployed. A bewildering optimism among American opinion makers of the era seemed irrepressible. In 1941, Henry Robinson Luce, the powerful founder of both Time and Life magazines, crafted the term the American century. In perhaps one of the most influential editorials in U.S. history, published eight months before Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, Luce worried that in certain quarters a “sickness” had taken over American life, a sickness something like a geopolitical malaise. “We Americans,” he wrote, “are unhappy . . . The future doesn’t seem to hold anything for us except conflict, disruption, war.”1 But did it have to be this way? Absolutely not, Luce insisted. He fervently believed the United States had a burden to carry for the world, what he referred to as a “manifest duty.” The phrase he chose consciously echoed the nineteenth-century idea of “manifest destiny,” a quasi-religious notion popularized by politicians and the press that saw the United States as chosen to civilize, colonize, and exploit the continent of North America. Luce argued that the sad giant must now take on a new destiny. The country had “grown up” and must do something more than defend its geographical borders. American “prestige” had to be weaponized so that the world could be safe for what Luce considered the country’s superior values. Those values had less to do with democracy than with capitalism, even if Luce chose not to put the matter so bluntly. It was time for the country to become an empire. Historians have used the idea of “the American century” not in the spirit of Luce’s cheerleading, but to describe the country’s military and political dominance. It’s been an elastic term, used to describe more than a simple chronology and applied not only to the twentieth century proper but to the hundred years following the end of the Great War, the bloodiest, deadliest, and most frightening century in human history. The bloody wake left by America’s ascent into empire has been legitimized by the notion of American exceptionalism. The idea has deep roots; in fact, the image of America as a nation with a special identity and destiny can be found among both the makers and observers of America’s war for independence. It’s only been in the last few years that some of the basic tenets of American exceptionalism have been questioned. As recently as 2010, a USA Today/Gallup poll found that fully 80 percent of respondents believed the United States to be “the greatest nation on earth.” Two-thirds believed this gave the country a special mission to lead the globe, essentially Luce’s claim about the country.2 But things have changed. Another USA Today poll in 2020, conducted just before the strangest Fourth of July in many years, found only 32 percent of Americans willing to assert without qualification that the country was the greatest on earth, while another 28 percent cautiously, one almost wants to say wistfully, suggested their country might be “one of the greatest.” In perhaps a much more telling response, nearly 70 percent of respondents wearily told pollsters that the United States had fallen into decline or was simply “headed in the wrong direction.”3 The dark side of American exceptionalism became a common phrase as we entered a new decade. But why has this gone so long unaddressed? Defeat in the Vietnam War would seem to have summoned the death knell of the notion. It did not. Ronald Reagan won a presidential election with a weirdly jolly assertion of American greatness given the tenor of the times. Other countries might “cling to the stale past,” Reagan beamed, but “we create the future, and the world follows us into tomorrow.”4 Today, grasping at the idea that the United States has a special destiny seems almost a kind of psychosis after the sacrifice of almost seven thousand American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tomorrow the world might follow us into appears distinctly dystopian. Almost twenty concurrent years of U.S. intervention and the death, dismemberment, and mental trauma of American soldiers left the region in catastrophic decline. Meanwhile, there have been close to one million civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq alone. But the lure of the myth remains powerful. As late as 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized Barack Obama for holding a nuanced view of American exceptionalism. Romney bragged that he “held his shoulders a little higher” when he traveled abroad since as an American, he had “a special gift.”5 Then we began to get sick. Chinese officials in the province of Hubei first warned of a novel coronavirus that caused severe respiratory problems in December of 2019. By February of 2020, the Centers for Disease Control recorded fourteen instances of the virus in the United States. In a February 25 news briefing, Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called for the cancellation of events and used the now familiar phrase social distancing. “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare,” she said, “in the expectation that this could be bad.”6 Two days later, President Donald Trump told a raucous rally in South Carolina that COVID-19 was “a hoax” and accused his enemies of “politicizing” the issue. Parsing the meaning of the forty-fifth president’s words offers an exercise in frustration. In the most sympathetic reading, Trump did not claim that the virus didn’t exist, only that its effects had been overemphasized by a press in, to use his words, “hysteria mode.” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic advisor, insisted that the virus had been “contained” and posed no danger to the economy. “I don’t think it’s going to be an economic tragedy at all,” Kudlow said.7 The virus has proven a human tragedy on a massive scale. At the time of writing, the national death toll totals nearly eight hundred thousand people, more deaths than the United States suffered during World War I and II and far higher than all combined American casualties in global wars since 1945. The number of new infections stands at more than one hundred thousand a day, nearly twice the numbers of the most serious hot zones of the spring of 2020. Most of the countries in the world have yet to even reach that number in total. My insides coil in dread when considering how these numbers appear as you hold this book in your hands. One assumes it became worse. We thought we didn’t have to worry about such things. The cheery outlook favored by American officials since the mid-twentieth century convinced the nation that infectious disease would have even less chance against the country than a foreign military incursion. In an era that celebrated scientists as key parts of the much-vaunted American military machine, Americans took solace in the idea that penicillin ended the terror of wasting plagues like the 1918 influenza pandemic. COVID-19 exposed the absurdity of claiming any kind of exceptionalism for a nation with basic social and economic weaknesses unknown in much of Europe, Japan, and East Asia. South Korea and Vietnam have so far led the world in containing the virus. President Trump appealed to South Korea for medical equipment even while attempting to bully them into large cash payments to maintain American troops at their border. Taiwan sent the United States PPE equipment, in fact, to my own county in South Carolina that currently has zip codes with some of the highest infection spikes in the country.8 The effect of the virus has baffled Americans convinced of their special destiny and special character and forced many to face hard truths about American power. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March of 2020 that “the United States has long stood out as the land of denial and death.” Even before the exponential spread of a novel coronavirus, the United States had one of the lowest life expectancy rates in the developed world.9 Though frequently called into question, the idea of the American century, the ideal of American exceptionalism, and the certainty that the United States is and has always been “the greatest nation on earth” still remain deeply rooted in American politics. They echo in the desperate and angry snarls to make America great again, bleating that sounds more like the cries of an injured animal than the confidence of a society that understands its values and practices them. But it also appears in the self-satisfied insistence that the United States is already great, thank you very much. Whether greatness lost or preponderance of power maintained, the idea of the American century continues to thrive. Is there a lonely crossroad where the nightmares of horror and the American century meet? Of course, horror and politics may seem as unrelated as raincoats and ice cream. The night you watch a horror movie is not the night you settle in with a history book or catch up on current events. You order pizza with friends and huddle together for the whirligig ride that jitters and jolts you. Ruined faces appear at rainy windows; the tension builds as a door creaks slowly into a vacuum of silence that suddenly erupts with screams. The whole flick comes in at just under ninety minutes and features a paranormal force unleashed by inebriated Gen Zs playing with that wicked old Ouija board or some comparable occult gadget. Or maybe a knife-wielding automaton will victimize the same age group for being at the worst possible place at the worst possible time. It’s escapist fun. You startle reflexively at the jump scares, something terrible suddenly filling the frame. Then you laugh at yourself and your friends, happy with your own terror. Someone makes jokes about being scared to go to bed that no one takes seriously. After all, no one takes horror seriously. Well, that’s no longer quite true. Over the last decade, as Americans became more acquainted with the twisted nature of their alleged exceptionalism, a clutch of horror films have given audiences more to think about than the dumb fun of a scare flick. Ari Aster’s Hereditary and Midsommar martialed complicated anxieties related to family, relationships, and social class. Aster jokingly called Hereditary “just a little family drama” when in fact it’s a crucible that burns the very concept of middle-class American family life to cinders, leaving behind a taste of its ashes. Similarly, Aster called Midsommar a “breakup movie,” but if you know the grotesque denouement, that’s like referring to Scorsese’s 1976 Taxi Driver as a classic boy-meets-girl drama. Aster knows his films cut to the bone and leave us questioning everything we think we know about even the most intimate expectations we have for the American good life . . . romance, success, money, home, and family. Aster tells a story of American dreams grounded in trauma that then becomes inestimably worse, descending into insane violence. Jordan Peele’s Get Out addressed racism in a “post-racial” society that maintains vast economic inequality and allows murderous police action against Black men and women. Peele’s film can be funny, horrific, and obsessively watchable. But in the meantime, it’s a devastating measure of white supremacy, a bleak miracle of a movie that addresses everything from the heritage of slavery to racist policing to the way social class informs a variety of racism just as brutal as you’d find in a lynch mob. Zadie Smith called the film a “compendium of black fears about white folk,” both in terms of cultural symbolism and historical legacy. In Peele’s ability to bring his gift of “comic reversals” to horror, Get Out becomes a film that “contains its own commentary” by making audiences understand that African Americans look fearfully on everything from “white women who date black men” to “well-meaning conversations about Obama” to “nostalgia for slavery” and, of course, “slavery itself.”10 Peele’s follow-up film, a complex tale of social class, race, and an unseen horror that undergirds all of American history, may be the most politically confrontational horror film ever made. As Sezin Koehler noted in a strenuous essay written during 2020’s nationwide protests against racist policing, economic structures, and public symbolism, Peele’s Us addresses “the fundamental toxicity of whiteness, white privilege, and its intersection with all kinds of violence.”11 In the wake of these films, a horrorsaince of social relevance, a debate between fandom and a relatively small number of cultural critics exploded across several social media platforms and resulted in a welter of dueling essays. Steve Rose set the cat among the pigeons first in his much-derided Guardian think piece “How Post-Horror Movies Are Taking Over Cinema.” In it, he described the traditional horror film using former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld’s infamously obtuse phrase known unknowns. Rose meant that while horror films proffered suspense, in reality every fan knows the accepted “rules” of the genre. He argued that, in general, horror movies are actually “one of the safest spaces in cinema” since a fan’s knowledge of what to expect provides them with a “flashlight” for the darkest corners a director might lead them to. These claims are untenable with just a glance at the long history of horror, reaching back to Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), which undermined audience expectations. In 1922, two World War I veterans produced Nosferatu as a reflection of “the great dying” of the war in which they and their countries had suffered. Rose avoided this history, skipping the silent era in America and Europe, the introduction of supernatural horror to America in the 1930s, and its terrifying revival in the 1960s and ’70s. In those decades, films like Hitchcock’s Psycho shocked audiences and critics into anger at the director himself. The butchering of Janet Leigh in the shower became the focal point of audience angst. But fans also hated, and loved, the film’s weight of dread that suggested you could not trust the director, that he might show you something etched like some cursed rune into your brain stem. George Romero assaulted his audiences with the gore his ghouls consumed (thanks to a Pittsburgh butcher friend who donated the day’s leftovers from his shop) and his introduction of a controversial Black male lead in the cataclysmic year of 1968. In 1973 documentarian William Friedkin made The Exorcist, a film that triggered such a convulsive reaction that Time magazine spoke to psychiatrists and theologians in an effort to make sense of why theaters in LA and New York had to begin running the film as early as 8:00 a.m. to handle crowds that stretched around entire city blocks.12 Rose ignored all this because he had to in order to claim our entrance into an age of post-horror, a phrase that obviously suggests something that has come after and replaced horror. The peculiar phrase, peculiar partially because it fails to communicate any meaningful information, is probably borrowed from the overused notion of “postmodern.” It also performed the job the author wanted it to in inciting fan outrage and hundreds of thousands of shares and likes, the cryptocurrency of online social capital.13 We could easily, too easily, write off Rose’s “post-horror” category as a provocative hot take, the current nomenclature for an undeveloped notion hurled like a hand grenade from the pillbox of a social media platform. But this idea has found wide support, especially among critics who found themselves drawn to the meaning of aesthetic documents that used horror commonplaces to make their point. The term elevated horror began to make the rounds among these critics in 2018. “Ugh. I’m not even much of a horror fan, but I can smell the condescension and the dissembling that’s baked into this awful phrase,” film critic Alonso Duralde told Indiewire. Jordan Peele felt it necessary to tweet simply that “‘Us’ is a horror movie” at the time of its release, possibly just to shut down what he considered a pretty pointless discussion. Influential critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted the obvious: calling a film “elevated horror” is a bit like calling a cheeseburger elevated. You’d simply be saying it’s a next-level cheeseburger and “if it’s delicious, no one will care what adjective you put in front of it.”14 Much of the conversation about “post-” or “elevated” horror (or other descriptors like “art horror” and even “smart horror”) glossed over the issue really being debated. Even unfriendly critics who probably want to see most horror tossed onto pop culture’s trash heap are attempting, maybe poorly, to articulate the meaning of horror. Ultimately then, the question has been less about whether horror films are good and more a question of whether they matter. The aforementioned horror films force us to see that there’s always been something deeply political about twentieth-century horror, all the way back to its roots as a cry of anger and despair in the aftermath of the Great War’s savagery. Arguably the late 1940s and much of the ’50s had been one of the most politically charged eras of the horror film. A generation sat through popular Main Street theaters for most of their Saturdays as flying saucers and mad scientists justified American military might in the face of an outside threat, transformed people of color around the world into monstrous beings and cruel villains, and offered a worldview fraught with paranoia and hair-trigger rage. Perhaps, and I stress perhaps, no deep philosophical questions emerged from Wes Craven’s The Last House on the Left or Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And yet both films were a punch in the gut. Jump scares and gore aren’t important to either film. Despite its reputation and title, you’ll see more viscera in an episode of your favorite TV police procedural than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. What directors, authors, comic artists, and even game designers want is to hit the audience with a cultural roundhouse. There’s no way to do that effectively without pushing political buttons to overstimulate the most delicate nerve endings of personal belief, ideology, patriotism, gender roles, and unexamined hatreds. Movies are not alone in having this effect, and so a full examination of how our monsters claw their way toward some of America’s deepest assumptions must speak broadly about horror culture. Best-selling novelist Paul Tremblay writes that horror really works only when it “push[es] and prod[s] at moral boundaries” and forces its audience to “confront personal and societal taboos.” In fact, he suggests that horror films need a “progressive” vision to really pull us out to sea on a dark tide. An attempt at a “conservative” horror tale that allows for an unambiguous happy ending fails to horrify the audience.15 Writer and director Aislinn Clarke doesn’t use the phrase elevated horror. But she has suggested that a difference does exist between something being “scary” and true, lingering horror. The creation of horror depends on upending convention and, she suggests, should “punch up” against those in power rather than “merely making monsters of those at the bottom.”16 Her masterful, thoughtful, and real damn scary 2018 film The Devil’s Doorway tosses more than a few matches at the incendiary questions of religion, sexual abuse, and misogyny. Rather than creating a possession/exorcism tale with a generic setting, she intertwines it with the legacy of Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries, which imprisoned unwed mothers, the mentally ill, or women who simply did not conform to social expectations. In Clarke’s film, there are jump scares, the suggestion of possession, and other tricks of the trade that pay homage to the exorcism drama. But the black wave that rolls over us after the credits roll, a feeling akin to grief as well as fear, comes from the complex evils we’ve encountered, the intractable horrors perpetrated, as Clarke notes, by both the church and the state. However, horror can also seem remarkably obtuse in how it attempts to critique or even resonate with the real world’s terrors. Award-winning science fiction and fantasy author Sam J. Miller told Wired magazine that the first episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which opened with televised footage of Donald Trump and his surprise 2016 election night victory, took a “ham-fisted” approach to politics, attempting to juice audience reactions by “reveling in the horror of our moment.”17 So does horror ask us to stop thinking or to start? Is it inherently political or simply a set of illusions that has perfected a way to play with our brain chemistry? If it does have a politics, are they progressive or reactionary? Is horror a red state, blue state, or the ultimate swing voter genre? The dark carnival of American history and horror does not offer a simple answer, at least one that we want to hear. Once we’ve read discussions about “elevated horror” and pondered what “post-horror” could mean, we are left with the simple fact that horror tells us more about the world than we want to know. Aislinn Clarke simply calls horror “the slow, dawning realization that the worst thing is true.” Historian and essayist Michael Parenti calls the horrors hidden by fantasy “dirty truths.” By this, he does not mean uncomfortable ideas that are debated. He means ideas that lack respectability to such a degree that you don’t mention them in polite company. They exude such an aura of unreality that they seem to besmirch even the people who tell you about them. Yet, they are still truths. If we grapple with the idea of horror and how it works, we also have to wrestle with the idea of empire. I’m aware it might seem bizarrely tendentious to refer to the United States as an empire. How can a democracy also be an empire? Don’t empires hold vast, extraterritorial colonies? Hasn’t the United States intervened only at moments of crisis when outside forces threatened the nation-state and generally chosen an “isolationist” approach? Haven’t even our worst mistakes in foreign policy come from a desire to make the world a better place? We are the greatest country on earth, aren’t we? It’s understandable that any American citizen would feel this way. Many of our grade school textbooks leave the impression that we are always and everywhere the good guys. So do many of our films, in so many ways the repository of popular memory. This book uses a simple definition of imperial power as the exercise of military, economic, and cultural dominance beyond the geographical borders of the homeland or nation-state. This has looked different in different eras; empire worked differently for the British than it did the Romans. The American empire works differently from both. Here, policy makers became increasingly skilled at shaping the world the United States would dominate while convincing us that something entirely different had happened. So what if the American dream is a nightmare? What if, at the bottom of an ill-smelling barrel brimming with secrets coiled like snakes, we find a terrible truth? It’s the truth of the dark carnival. Borrowing the image Ray Bradbury gave us, did something wicked this way come in the middle of the American night? Did only a few silent sentinels, watching at that dangerous hour of 3:00 a.m., hear the mechanical striving of a train on the tracks, pulling the sideshow acts, the automata, the game booths, and the scurrilous pranksters who will make it all spin and whirl and explode and pop? Did they really set it all up overnight, this tent city of bright reds and pearl whites that looks like so much fun as long as you don’t look too closely? This is a book about the kinds of stories we choose to tell, and why horror has become our story. This is a book of horror because it’s a book of war stories. We think we know what this means. Tim O’Brien told us what it means in, well, “How to Tell a True War Story,” a chapter from his award-winning The Things They Carried. In it, he claims “war is hell” but also “mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love.” These “contradictory truths” are at the heart of the experience that only those who wage war can begin to understand properly.18 I can’t follow O’Brien’s template and, more important, I think he is wrong. I have never been a soldier. I came perilously close to becoming one in the late nineties, having conversations with a Marine recruiter in grad school. My father, a working-class kid from the Carolina Piedmont who found himself in the Marines and then the Navy in the catastrophic years of 1967–1970, told me he’d feel nothing but disappointment if I did this. I’m grateful to him for this, as for many things, since becoming a reservist on the eve of 9/11 would have changed my life in ways I cannot imagine. The only time I heard shots fired in anger was in January of 1986 when I found myself part of a well-intended, if spectacularly ill-conceived, aid project in Haiti. In Saint-Marc and Gonaïves, the rattle of automatic weapons fire left me oddly unaffected, the invincibility in the face of history that only a white American fifteen-year-old can ever feel. But this experience matters in the war stories I have to tell you. Combatants are a relatively small part of any meaningful war story. Veterans fear being forgotten, but often their anxiety is that they be remembered in the right way. The ongoing concern known as “America, United States of” wants them remembered in specific ways too. Warriors, not soldiers. Effective killers but never rapists or plunderers. Figures on a stele or names on a wall but never human beings who are victimized and victimizers, unable to tell their stories because their throats are choked with rage, bearing the memories of the times the empire told them to mutilate, depressed, strung-out, addicted, suffering psychosis or the symptoms of chemical agents that cause heart problems, nerve damage, and cascading organ failure. The dirty wars of empire have to be submerged so that, paradoxically, the fighting can go on and on. This is why so much of the truth of the last one hundred years survives not in museum exhibitions or patriotic celebrations or lengthy documentary treatments but in horror films. It is a place where one does not expect war stories. The “holiness” that O’Brien thinks is somehow part of war can’t be found in horror. Horror as an art film, a silly film two clicks from porn, a novel, or a role-playing experience, all remind us of Lugosi’s strange moment in Dracula when he sighs, “there are far worse things awaiting man than death.” O’Brien says, “war can make you a man” and “war can make you dead.” But it can do worse. War is hell because we don’t want to die. But the military Moloch of empire doesn’t just want our deaths. It wants our need to murder, to rape, to pillage. It wants us maimed and raped and all our values desecrated. It has no interest in your masculinity crisis. If you can’t raise a flag and salute, it thinks your apathy will work just as well. It wants to build an empire on our bones. Most of us see this carnival’s garish illumination from a safe distance. The sounds of screams and clattering reveries of an organ grinding away take wing in the October air to thrill us and chill us. But we have more to learn about what kind of midnight ride the United States really is and the collective trauma its violent traveling circus has visited on the world.",

      "content": "PROLOGUE Carnival and Empire WHO WILL survive America? Sound and smells and manic lights draw us in. Maybe we will see something forbidden? The curtain desires a hand to open it. A skull bathed in a nauseating red glow invites us to take the haunted ride. But what happens if we go to the dark carnival and wander the grounds while barkers call us to see their sideshows and the faces around us turn ghastly in the sodium-pale light? It seems a place of banal cruelties. The soda pop toss, the baseball throw, the shooting range are all rigged. The sideshows transform human beings into abominations for our pleasure, freaks conscripted to help us feel normal. The rides are assembled with haste and indifference, and anyone who wants a whirligig or to take a plunge on the roller coaster bets on bad odds. The clowns sweat through their face paint. They are trying so hard to make us do something, to make us laugh. We cringe because they look like they’re hurting one another in their perverse play, wielding giant hammers and what we hope are only plastic pistols rigged to explode into a little flag . . . BANG! Their brutal campaign leaves us with the deep unease that we have been abused but are unable to articulate how or why. The dark carnival incites and titillates. The sawdust of the carnival has dried up and blown away in the winds of modernity. State fairs are perhaps the closest we come anymore to the sights, the sounds, and the fetid smells of those strange, compelling spaces. Even in the age of colossal theme parks run by Warner Bros., Disney, and Universal Studios, the carnival seems more enticing precisely because it’s not a safe place—you might get hurt, you might see something you can’t unsee. There lives, somewhere in our psyches where it has crouched on its haunches since the earliest human experience, a yearning for the taboo and the terrible. Our dark carnivals are, then, a place to visit, an experience desired only because we can leave it behind. But, in truth, we cannot. If you live in the United States, you are a denizen of the dark carnival. Horror is the lingua franca. Horror defined the American century. Horror provided the legitimacy, the justifications, and the bread and circuses of American empire. Yet, over the last few decades, horror has attempted to shake us out of our sleep, to understand the kind of world we have made, to discover that something wicked isn’t coming . . . it’s already here. The United States briefly resisted the subtle temptations of monsters from the dark after the very real carnage of World War I (1914–1918). Just as the once-great powers of Europe began to recognize the influence the United States would now have in global affairs, their cultures produced unnerving tales of revivified corpses, hallucinatory fever dreams, and crime lords with hypnotic powers of manipulation. Americans watched slapstick comedies and westerns. One of the most popular films of 1919 starred Lon Chaney in The Miracle Man, a romantic drama. By the late 1920s, frightening fictions startled the American public like a relentless, unexpected pounding on the door at three in the morning. Master of makeup effects Lon Chaney, no longer connected to romance and uplifting drama, terrified audiences in The Phantom of the Opera (1925), his cadaverous head unveiled in a moment that, to this day, makes the viewer feel they’ve been forced to hear a hideous secret about the world. Chaney’s villains—deluded masterminds, vampires, and violent sadists—delivered a skittering chill up the collective spine of what was becoming the most powerful country on earth. His extraordinary skill with makeup effects made him the master of mutilation, his criminals and creatures distorted by suffering, amputation, and scar tissue. Darkness came with unexpected speed, the light of the sun spelunking into a black pool of night. Bela Lugosi glided ominously through the opera of terror that was Dracula (1931). The same year, British war veteran James Whale directed Frankenstein, presenting Mary Shelley’s monster as a very literal embodiment of a conflict that the German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg called “a corpse factory.” For almost twenty years, America danced the monster mash for the World War II generation and their children, making the squared cranium of Frankenstein’s monster and the lonely yet threatening howl of the Wolf Man two of the most recognizable menaces of America’s mass culture. Horror fictions clashed with the way much of America wanted to understand itself. The Great Depression had, ironically, plagued the decade that invented the term the American Dream. James Truslow Adams, a popular historian, coined the term in a 1931 book called The Epic of America, which asserted that the country offered “opportunity for each according to ability or achievement” even as millions stood in bread lines and a quarter of Americans found themselves unemployed. A bewildering optimism among American opinion makers of the era seemed irrepressible. In 1941, Henry Robinson Luce, the powerful founder of both Time and Life magazines, crafted the term the American century. In perhaps one of the most influential editorials in U.S. history, published eight months before Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, Luce worried that in certain quarters a “sickness” had taken over American life, a sickness something like a geopolitical malaise. “We Americans,” he wrote, “are unhappy . . . The future doesn’t seem to hold anything for us except conflict, disruption, war.”1 But did it have to be this way? Absolutely not, Luce insisted. He fervently believed the United States had a burden to carry for the world, what he referred to as a “manifest duty.” The phrase he chose consciously echoed the nineteenth-century idea of “manifest destiny,” a quasi-religious notion popularized by politicians and the press that saw the United States as chosen to civilize, colonize, and exploit the continent of North America. Luce argued that the sad giant must now take on a new destiny. The country had “grown up” and must do something more than defend its geographical borders. American “prestige” had to be weaponized so that the world could be safe for what Luce considered the country’s superior values. Those values had less to do with democracy than with capitalism, even if Luce chose not to put the matter so bluntly. It was time for the country to become an empire. Historians have used the idea of “the American century” not in the spirit of Luce’s cheerleading, but to describe the country’s military and political dominance. It’s been an elastic term, used to describe more than a simple chronology and applied not only to the twentieth century proper but to the hundred years following the end of the Great War, the bloodiest, deadliest, and most frightening century in human history. The bloody wake left by America’s ascent into empire has been legitimized by the notion of American exceptionalism. The idea has deep roots; in fact, the image of America as a nation with a special identity and destiny can be found among both the makers and observers of America’s war for independence. It’s only been in the last few years that some of the basic tenets of American exceptionalism have been questioned. As recently as 2010, a USA Today/Gallup poll found that fully 80 percent of respondents believed the United States to be “the greatest nation on earth.” Two-thirds believed this gave the country a special mission to lead the globe, essentially Luce’s claim about the country.2 But things have changed. Another USA Today poll in 2020, conducted just before the strangest Fourth of July in many years, found only 32 percent of Americans willing to assert without qualification that the country was the greatest on earth, while another 28 percent cautiously, one almost wants to say wistfully, suggested their country might be “one of the greatest.” In perhaps a much more telling response, nearly 70 percent of respondents wearily told pollsters that the United States had fallen into decline or was simply “headed in the wrong direction.”3 The dark side of American exceptionalism became a common phrase as we entered a new decade. But why has this gone so long unaddressed? Defeat in the Vietnam War would seem to have summoned the death knell of the notion. It did not. Ronald Reagan won a presidential election with a weirdly jolly assertion of American greatness given the tenor of the times. Other countries might “cling to the stale past,” Reagan beamed, but “we create the future, and the world follows us into tomorrow.”4 Today, grasping at the idea that the United States has a special destiny seems almost a kind of psychosis after the sacrifice of almost seven thousand American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tomorrow the world might follow us into appears distinctly dystopian. Almost twenty concurrent years of U.S. intervention and the death, dismemberment, and mental trauma of American soldiers left the region in catastrophic decline. Meanwhile, there have been close to one million civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq alone. But the lure of the myth remains powerful. As late as 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized Barack Obama for holding a nuanced view of American exceptionalism. Romney bragged that he “held his shoulders a little higher” when he traveled abroad since as an American, he had “a special gift.”5 Then we began to get sick. Chinese officials in the province of Hubei first warned of a novel coronavirus that caused severe respiratory problems in December of 2019. By February of 2020, the Centers for Disease Control recorded fourteen instances of the virus in the United States. In a February 25 news briefing, Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called for the cancellation of events and used the now familiar phrase social distancing. “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare,” she said, “in the expectation that this could be bad.”6 Two days later, President Donald Trump told a raucous rally in South Carolina that COVID-19 was “a hoax” and accused his enemies of “politicizing” the issue. Parsing the meaning of the forty-fifth president’s words offers an exercise in frustration. In the most sympathetic reading, Trump did not claim that the virus didn’t exist, only that its effects had been overemphasized by a press in, to use his words, “hysteria mode.” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic advisor, insisted that the virus had been “contained” and posed no danger to the economy. “I don’t think it’s going to be an economic tragedy at all,” Kudlow said.7 The virus has proven a human tragedy on a massive scale. At the time of writing, the national death toll totals nearly eight hundred thousand people, more deaths than the United States suffered during World War I and II and far higher than all combined American casualties in global wars since 1945. The number of new infections stands at more than one hundred thousand a day, nearly twice the numbers of the most serious hot zones of the spring of 2020. Most of the countries in the world have yet to even reach that number in total. My insides coil in dread when considering how these numbers appear as you hold this book in your hands. One assumes it became worse. We thought we didn’t have to worry about such things. The cheery outlook favored by American officials since the mid-twentieth century convinced the nation that infectious disease would have even less chance against the country than a foreign military incursion. In an era that celebrated scientists as key parts of the much-vaunted American military machine, Americans took solace in the idea that penicillin ended the terror of wasting plagues like the 1918 influenza pandemic. COVID-19 exposed the absurdity of claiming any kind of exceptionalism for a nation with basic social and economic weaknesses unknown in much of Europe, Japan, and East Asia. South Korea and Vietnam have so far led the world in containing the virus. President Trump appealed to South Korea for medical equipment even while attempting to bully them into large cash payments to maintain American troops at their border. Taiwan sent the United States PPE equipment, in fact, to my own county in South Carolina that currently has zip codes with some of the highest infection spikes in the country.8 The effect of the virus has baffled Americans convinced of their special destiny and special character and forced many to face hard truths about American power. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March of 2020 that “the United States has long stood out as the land of denial and death.” Even before the exponential spread of a novel coronavirus, the United States had one of the lowest life expectancy rates in the developed world.9 Though frequently called into question, the idea of the American century, the ideal of American exceptionalism, and the certainty that the United States is and has always been “the greatest nation on earth” still remain deeply rooted in American politics. They echo in the desperate and angry snarls to make America great again, bleating that sounds more like the cries of an injured animal than the confidence of a society that understands its values and practices them. But it also appears in the self-satisfied insistence that the United States is already great, thank you very much. Whether greatness lost or preponderance of power maintained, the idea of the American century continues to thrive. Is there a lonely crossroad where the nightmares of horror and the American century meet? Of course, horror and politics may seem as unrelated as raincoats and ice cream. The night you watch a horror movie is not the night you settle in with a history book or catch up on current events. You order pizza with friends and huddle together for the whirligig ride that jitters and jolts you. Ruined faces appear at rainy windows; the tension builds as a door creaks slowly into a vacuum of silence that suddenly erupts with screams. The whole flick comes in at just under ninety minutes and features a paranormal force unleashed by inebriated Gen Zs playing with that wicked old Ouija board or some comparable occult gadget. Or maybe a knife-wielding automaton will victimize the same age group for being at the worst possible place at the worst possible time. It’s escapist fun. You startle reflexively at the jump scares, something terrible suddenly filling the frame. Then you laugh at yourself and your friends, happy with your own terror. Someone makes jokes about being scared to go to bed that no one takes seriously. After all, no one takes horror seriously. Well, that’s no longer quite true. Over the last decade, as Americans became more acquainted with the twisted nature of their alleged exceptionalism, a clutch of horror films have given audiences more to think about than the dumb fun of a scare flick. Ari Aster’s Hereditary and Midsommar martialed complicated anxieties related to family, relationships, and social class. Aster jokingly called Hereditary “just a little family drama” when in fact it’s a crucible that burns the very concept of middle-class American family life to cinders, leaving behind a taste of its ashes. Similarly, Aster called Midsommar a “breakup movie,” but if you know the grotesque denouement, that’s like referring to Scorsese’s 1976 Taxi Driver as a classic boy-meets-girl drama. Aster knows his films cut to the bone and leave us questioning everything we think we know about even the most intimate expectations we have for the American good life . . . romance, success, money, home, and family. Aster tells a story of American dreams grounded in trauma that then becomes inestimably worse, descending into insane violence. Jordan Peele’s Get Out addressed racism in a “post-racial” society that maintains vast economic inequality and allows murderous police action against Black men and women. Peele’s film can be funny, horrific, and obsessively watchable. But in the meantime, it’s a devastating measure of white supremacy, a bleak miracle of a movie that addresses everything from the heritage of slavery to racist policing to the way social class informs a variety of racism just as brutal as you’d find in a lynch mob. Zadie Smith called the film a “compendium of black fears about white folk,” both in terms of cultural symbolism and historical legacy. In Peele’s ability to bring his gift of “comic reversals” to horror, Get Out becomes a film that “contains its own commentary” by making audiences understand that African Americans look fearfully on everything from “white women who date black men” to “well-meaning conversations about Obama” to “nostalgia for slavery” and, of course, “slavery itself.”10 Peele’s follow-up film, a complex tale of social class, race, and an unseen horror that undergirds all of American history, may be the most politically confrontational horror film ever made. As Sezin Koehler noted in a strenuous essay written during 2020’s nationwide protests against racist policing, economic structures, and public symbolism, Peele’s Us addresses “the fundamental toxicity of whiteness, white privilege, and its intersection with all kinds of violence.”11 In the wake of these films, a horrorsaince of social relevance, a debate between fandom and a relatively small number of cultural critics exploded across several social media platforms and resulted in a welter of dueling essays. Steve Rose set the cat among the pigeons first in his much-derided Guardian think piece “How Post-Horror Movies Are Taking Over Cinema.” In it, he described the traditional horror film using former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld’s infamously obtuse phrase known unknowns. Rose meant that while horror films proffered suspense, in reality every fan knows the accepted “rules” of the genre. He argued that, in general, horror movies are actually “one of the safest spaces in cinema” since a fan’s knowledge of what to expect provides them with a “flashlight” for the darkest corners a director might lead them to. These claims are untenable with just a glance at the long history of horror, reaching back to Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), which undermined audience expectations. In 1922, two World War I veterans produced Nosferatu as a reflection of “the great dying” of the war in which they and their countries had suffered. Rose avoided this history, skipping the silent era in America and Europe, the introduction of supernatural horror to America in the 1930s, and its terrifying revival in the 1960s and ’70s. In those decades, films like Hitchcock’s Psycho shocked audiences and critics into anger at the director himself. The butchering of Janet Leigh in the shower became the focal point of audience angst. But fans also hated, and loved, the film’s weight of dread that suggested you could not trust the director, that he might show you something etched like some cursed rune into your brain stem. George Romero assaulted his audiences with the gore his ghouls consumed (thanks to a Pittsburgh butcher friend who donated the day’s leftovers from his shop) and his introduction of a controversial Black male lead in the cataclysmic year of 1968. In 1973 documentarian William Friedkin made The Exorcist, a film that triggered such a convulsive reaction that Time magazine spoke to psychiatrists and theologians in an effort to make sense of why theaters in LA and New York had to begin running the film as early as 8:00 a.m. to handle crowds that stretched around entire city blocks.12 Rose ignored all this because he had to in order to claim our entrance into an age of post-horror, a phrase that obviously suggests something that has come after and replaced horror. The peculiar phrase, peculiar partially because it fails to communicate any meaningful information, is probably borrowed from the overused notion of “postmodern.” It also performed the job the author wanted it to in inciting fan outrage and hundreds of thousands of shares and likes, the cryptocurrency of online social capital.13 We could easily, too easily, write off Rose’s “post-horror” category as a provocative hot take, the current nomenclature for an undeveloped notion hurled like a hand grenade from the pillbox of a social media platform. But this idea has found wide support, especially among critics who found themselves drawn to the meaning of aesthetic documents that used horror commonplaces to make their point. The term elevated horror began to make the rounds among these critics in 2018. “Ugh. I’m not even much of a horror fan, but I can smell the condescension and the dissembling that’s baked into this awful phrase,” film critic Alonso Duralde told Indiewire. Jordan Peele felt it necessary to tweet simply that “‘Us’ is a horror movie” at the time of its release, possibly just to shut down what he considered a pretty pointless discussion. Influential critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted the obvious: calling a film “elevated horror” is a bit like calling a cheeseburger elevated. You’d simply be saying it’s a next-level cheeseburger and “if it’s delicious, no one will care what adjective you put in front of it.”14 Much of the conversation about “post-” or “elevated” horror (or other descriptors like “art horror” and even “smart horror”) glossed over the issue really being debated. Even unfriendly critics who probably want to see most horror tossed onto pop culture’s trash heap are attempting, maybe poorly, to articulate the meaning of horror. Ultimately then, the question has been less about whether horror films are good and more a question of whether they matter. The aforementioned horror films force us to see that there’s always been something deeply political about twentieth-century horror, all the way back to its roots as a cry of anger and despair in the aftermath of the Great War’s savagery. Arguably the late 1940s and much of the ’50s had been one of the most politically charged eras of the horror film. A generation sat through popular Main Street theaters for most of their Saturdays as flying saucers and mad scientists justified American military might in the face of an outside threat, transformed people of color around the world into monstrous beings and cruel villains, and offered a worldview fraught with paranoia and hair-trigger rage. Perhaps, and I stress perhaps, no deep philosophical questions emerged from Wes Craven’s The Last House on the Left or Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And yet both films were a punch in the gut. Jump scares and gore aren’t important to either film. Despite its reputation and title, you’ll see more viscera in an episode of your favorite TV police procedural than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. What directors, authors, comic artists, and even game designers want is to hit the audience with a cultural roundhouse. There’s no way to do that effectively without pushing political buttons to overstimulate the most delicate nerve endings of personal belief, ideology, patriotism, gender roles, and unexamined hatreds. Movies are not alone in having this effect, and so a full examination of how our monsters claw their way toward some of America’s deepest assumptions must speak broadly about horror culture. Best-selling novelist Paul Tremblay writes that horror really works only when it “push[es] and prod[s] at moral boundaries” and forces its audience to “confront personal and societal taboos.” In fact, he suggests that horror films need a “progressive” vision to really pull us out to sea on a dark tide. An attempt at a “conservative” horror tale that allows for an unambiguous happy ending fails to horrify the audience.15 Writer and director Aislinn Clarke doesn’t use the phrase elevated horror. But she has suggested that a difference does exist between something being “scary” and true, lingering horror. The creation of horror depends on upending convention and, she suggests, should “punch up” against those in power rather than “merely making monsters of those at the bottom.”16 Her masterful, thoughtful, and real damn scary 2018 film The Devil’s Doorway tosses more than a few matches at the incendiary questions of religion, sexual abuse, and misogyny. Rather than creating a possession/exorcism tale with a generic setting, she intertwines it with the legacy of Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries, which imprisoned unwed mothers, the mentally ill, or women who simply did not conform to social expectations. In Clarke’s film, there are jump scares, the suggestion of possession, and other tricks of the trade that pay homage to the exorcism drama. But the black wave that rolls over us after the credits roll, a feeling akin to grief as well as fear, comes from the complex evils we’ve encountered, the intractable horrors perpetrated, as Clarke notes, by both the church and the state. However, horror can also seem remarkably obtuse in how it attempts to critique or even resonate with the real world’s terrors. Award-winning science fiction and fantasy author Sam J. Miller told Wired magazine that the first episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which opened with televised footage of Donald Trump and his surprise 2016 election night victory, took a “ham-fisted” approach to politics, attempting to juice audience reactions by “reveling in the horror of our moment.”17 So does horror ask us to stop thinking or to start? Is it inherently political or simply a set of illusions that has perfected a way to play with our brain chemistry? If it does have a politics, are they progressive or reactionary? Is horror a red state, blue state, or the ultimate swing voter genre? The dark carnival of American history and horror does not offer a simple answer, at least one that we want to hear. Once we’ve read discussions about “elevated horror” and pondered what “post-horror” could mean, we are left with the simple fact that horror tells us more about the world than we want to know. Aislinn Clarke simply calls horror “the slow, dawning realization that the worst thing is true.” Historian and essayist Michael Parenti calls the horrors hidden by fantasy “dirty truths.” By this, he does not mean uncomfortable ideas that are debated. He means ideas that lack respectability to such a degree that you don’t mention them in polite company. They exude such an aura of unreality that they seem to besmirch even the people who tell you about them. Yet, they are still truths. If we grapple with the idea of horror and how it works, we also have to wrestle with the idea of empire. I’m aware it might seem bizarrely tendentious to refer to the United States as an empire. How can a democracy also be an empire? Don’t empires hold vast, extraterritorial colonies? Hasn’t the United States intervened only at moments of crisis when outside forces threatened the nation-state and generally chosen an “isolationist” approach? Haven’t even our worst mistakes in foreign policy come from a desire to make the world a better place? We are the greatest country on earth, aren’t we? It’s understandable that any American citizen would feel this way. Many of our grade school textbooks leave the impression that we are always and everywhere the good guys. So do many of our films, in so many ways the repository of popular memory. This book uses a simple definition of imperial power as the exercise of military, economic, and cultural dominance beyond the geographical borders of the homeland or nation-state. This has looked different in different eras; empire worked differently for the British than it did the Romans. The American empire works differently from both. Here, policy makers became increasingly skilled at shaping the world the United States would dominate while convincing us that something entirely different had happened. So what if the American dream is a nightmare? What if, at the bottom of an ill-smelling barrel brimming with secrets coiled like snakes, we find a terrible truth? It’s the truth of the dark carnival. Borrowing the image Ray Bradbury gave us, did something wicked this way come in the middle of the American night? Did only a few silent sentinels, watching at that dangerous hour of 3:00 a.m., hear the mechanical striving of a train on the tracks, pulling the sideshow acts, the automata, the game booths, and the scurrilous pranksters who will make it all spin and whirl and explode and pop? Did they really set it all up overnight, this tent city of bright reds and pearl whites that looks like so much fun as long as you don’t look too closely? This is a book about the kinds of stories we choose to tell, and why horror has become our story. This is a book of horror because it’s a book of war stories. We think we know what this means. Tim O’Brien told us what it means in, well, “How to Tell a True War Story,” a chapter from his award-winning The Things They Carried. In it, he claims “war is hell” but also “mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love.” These “contradictory truths” are at the heart of the experience that only those who wage war can begin to understand properly.18 I can’t follow O’Brien’s template and, more important, I think he is wrong. I have never been a soldier. I came perilously close to becoming one in the late nineties, having conversations with a Marine recruiter in grad school. My father, a working-class kid from the Carolina Piedmont who found himself in the Marines and then the Navy in the catastrophic years of 1967–1970, told me he’d feel nothing but disappointment if I did this. I’m grateful to him for this, as for many things, since becoming a reservist on the eve of 9/11 would have changed my life in ways I cannot imagine. The only time I heard shots fired in anger was in January of 1986 when I found myself part of a well-intended, if spectacularly ill-conceived, aid project in Haiti. In Saint-Marc and Gonaïves, the rattle of automatic weapons fire left me oddly unaffected, the invincibility in the face of history that only a white American fifteen-year-old can ever feel. But this experience matters in the war stories I have to tell you. Combatants are a relatively small part of any meaningful war story. Veterans fear being forgotten, but often their anxiety is that they be remembered in the right way. The ongoing concern known as “America, United States of” wants them remembered in specific ways too. Warriors, not soldiers. Effective killers but never rapists or plunderers. Figures on a stele or names on a wall but never human beings who are victimized and victimizers, unable to tell their stories because their throats are choked with rage, bearing the memories of the times the empire told them to mutilate, depressed, strung-out, addicted, suffering psychosis or the symptoms of chemical agents that cause heart problems, nerve damage, and cascading organ failure. The dirty wars of empire have to be submerged so that, paradoxically, the fighting can go on and on. This is why so much of the truth of the last one hundred years survives not in museum exhibitions or patriotic celebrations or lengthy documentary treatments but in horror films. It is a place where one does not expect war stories. The “holiness” that O’Brien thinks is somehow part of war can’t be found in horror. Horror as an art film, a silly film two clicks from porn, a novel, or a role-playing experience, all remind us of Lugosi’s strange moment in Dracula when he sighs, “there are far worse things awaiting man than death.” O’Brien says, “war can make you a man” and “war can make you dead.” But it can do worse. War is hell because we don’t want to die. But the military Moloch of empire doesn’t just want our deaths. It wants our need to murder, to rape, to pillage. It wants us maimed and raped and all our values desecrated. It has no interest in your masculinity crisis. If you can’t raise a flag and salute, it thinks your apathy will work just as well. It wants to build an empire on our bones. Most of us see this carnival’s garish illumination from a safe distance. The sounds of screams and clattering reveries of an organ grinding away take wing in the October air to thrill us and chill us. But we have more to learn about what kind of midnight ride the United States really is and the collective trauma its violent traveling circus has visited on the world.",

      "content": "PROLOGUE Carnival and Empire WHO WILL survive America? Sound and smells and manic lights draw us in. Maybe we will see something forbidden? The curtain desires a hand to open it. A skull bathed in a nauseating red glow invites us to take the haunted ride. But what happens if we go to the dark carnival and wander the grounds while barkers call us to see their sideshows and the faces around us turn ghastly in the sodium-pale light? It seems a place of banal cruelties. The soda pop toss, the baseball throw, the shooting range are all rigged. The sideshows transform human beings into abominations for our pleasure, freaks conscripted to help us feel normal. The rides are assembled with haste and indifference, and anyone who wants a whirligig or to take a plunge on the roller coaster bets on bad odds. The clowns sweat through their face paint. They are trying so hard to make us do something, to make us laugh. We cringe because they look like they’re hurting one another in their perverse play, wielding giant hammers and what we hope are only plastic pistols rigged to explode into a little flag . . . BANG! Their brutal campaign leaves us with the deep unease that we have been abused but are unable to articulate how or why. The dark carnival incites and titillates. The sawdust of the carnival has dried up and blown away in the winds of modernity. State fairs are perhaps the closest we come anymore to the sights, the sounds, and the fetid smells of those strange, compelling spaces. Even in the age of colossal theme parks run by Warner Bros., Disney, and Universal Studios, the carnival seems more enticing precisely because it’s not a safe place—you might get hurt, you might see something you can’t unsee. There lives, somewhere in our psyches where it has crouched on its haunches since the earliest human experience, a yearning for the taboo and the terrible. Our dark carnivals are, then, a place to visit, an experience desired only because we can leave it behind. But, in truth, we cannot. If you live in the United States, you are a denizen of the dark carnival. Horror is the lingua franca. Horror defined the American century. Horror provided the legitimacy, the justifications, and the bread and circuses of American empire. Yet, over the last few decades, horror has attempted to shake us out of our sleep, to understand the kind of world we have made, to discover that something wicked isn’t coming . . . it’s already here. The United States briefly resisted the subtle temptations of monsters from the dark after the very real carnage of World War I (1914–1918). Just as the once-great powers of Europe began to recognize the influence the United States would now have in global affairs, their cultures produced unnerving tales of revivified corpses, hallucinatory fever dreams, and crime lords with hypnotic powers of manipulation. Americans watched slapstick comedies and westerns. One of the most popular films of 1919 starred Lon Chaney in The Miracle Man, a romantic drama. By the late 1920s, frightening fictions startled the American public like a relentless, unexpected pounding on the door at three in the morning. Master of makeup effects Lon Chaney, no longer connected to romance and uplifting drama, terrified audiences in The Phantom of the Opera (1925), his cadaverous head unveiled in a moment that, to this day, makes the viewer feel they’ve been forced to hear a hideous secret about the world. Chaney’s villains—deluded masterminds, vampires, and violent sadists—delivered a skittering chill up the collective spine of what was becoming the most powerful country on earth. His extraordinary skill with makeup effects made him the master of mutilation, his criminals and creatures distorted by suffering, amputation, and scar tissue. Darkness came with unexpected speed, the light of the sun spelunking into a black pool of night. Bela Lugosi glided ominously through the opera of terror that was Dracula (1931). The same year, British war veteran James Whale directed Frankenstein, presenting Mary Shelley’s monster as a very literal embodiment of a conflict that the German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg called “a corpse factory.” For almost twenty years, America danced the monster mash for the World War II generation and their children, making the squared cranium of Frankenstein’s monster and the lonely yet threatening howl of the Wolf Man two of the most recognizable menaces of America’s mass culture. Horror fictions clashed with the way much of America wanted to understand itself. The Great Depression had, ironically, plagued the decade that invented the term the American Dream. James Truslow Adams, a popular historian, coined the term in a 1931 book called The Epic of America, which asserted that the country offered “opportunity for each according to ability or achievement” even as millions stood in bread lines and a quarter of Americans found themselves unemployed. A bewildering optimism among American opinion makers of the era seemed irrepressible. In 1941, Henry Robinson Luce, the powerful founder of both Time and Life magazines, crafted the term the American century. In perhaps one of the most influential editorials in U.S. history, published eight months before Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, Luce worried that in certain quarters a “sickness” had taken over American life, a sickness something like a geopolitical malaise. “We Americans,” he wrote, “are unhappy . . . The future doesn’t seem to hold anything for us except conflict, disruption, war.”1 But did it have to be this way? Absolutely not, Luce insisted. He fervently believed the United States had a burden to carry for the world, what he referred to as a “manifest duty.” The phrase he chose consciously echoed the nineteenth-century idea of “manifest destiny,” a quasi-religious notion popularized by politicians and the press that saw the United States as chosen to civilize, colonize, and exploit the continent of North America. Luce argued that the sad giant must now take on a new destiny. The country had “grown up” and must do something more than defend its geographical borders. American “prestige” had to be weaponized so that the world could be safe for what Luce considered the country’s superior values. Those values had less to do with democracy than with capitalism, even if Luce chose not to put the matter so bluntly. It was time for the country to become an empire. Historians have used the idea of “the American century” not in the spirit of Luce’s cheerleading, but to describe the country’s military and political dominance. It’s been an elastic term, used to describe more than a simple chronology and applied not only to the twentieth century proper but to the hundred years following the end of the Great War, the bloodiest, deadliest, and most frightening century in human history. The bloody wake left by America’s ascent into empire has been legitimized by the notion of American exceptionalism. The idea has deep roots; in fact, the image of America as a nation with a special identity and destiny can be found among both the makers and observers of America’s war for independence. It’s only been in the last few years that some of the basic tenets of American exceptionalism have been questioned. As recently as 2010, a USA Today/Gallup poll found that fully 80 percent of respondents believed the United States to be “the greatest nation on earth.” Two-thirds believed this gave the country a special mission to lead the globe, essentially Luce’s claim about the country.2 But things have changed. Another USA Today poll in 2020, conducted just before the strangest Fourth of July in many years, found only 32 percent of Americans willing to assert without qualification that the country was the greatest on earth, while another 28 percent cautiously, one almost wants to say wistfully, suggested their country might be “one of the greatest.” In perhaps a much more telling response, nearly 70 percent of respondents wearily told pollsters that the United States had fallen into decline or was simply “headed in the wrong direction.”3 The dark side of American exceptionalism became a common phrase as we entered a new decade. But why has this gone so long unaddressed? Defeat in the Vietnam War would seem to have summoned the death knell of the notion. It did not. Ronald Reagan won a presidential election with a weirdly jolly assertion of American greatness given the tenor of the times. Other countries might “cling to the stale past,” Reagan beamed, but “we create the future, and the world follows us into tomorrow.”4 Today, grasping at the idea that the United States has a special destiny seems almost a kind of psychosis after the sacrifice of almost seven thousand American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tomorrow the world might follow us into appears distinctly dystopian. Almost twenty concurrent years of U.S. intervention and the death, dismemberment, and mental trauma of American soldiers left the region in catastrophic decline. Meanwhile, there have been close to one million civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq alone. But the lure of the myth remains powerful. As late as 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized Barack Obama for holding a nuanced view of American exceptionalism. Romney bragged that he “held his shoulders a little higher” when he traveled abroad since as an American, he had “a special gift.”5 Then we began to get sick. Chinese officials in the province of Hubei first warned of a novel coronavirus that caused severe respiratory problems in December of 2019. By February of 2020, the Centers for Disease Control recorded fourteen instances of the virus in the United States. In a February 25 news briefing, Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called for the cancellation of events and used the now familiar phrase social distancing. “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare,” she said, “in the expectation that this could be bad.”6 Two days later, President Donald Trump told a raucous rally in South Carolina that COVID-19 was “a hoax” and accused his enemies of “politicizing” the issue. Parsing the meaning of the forty-fifth president’s words offers an exercise in frustration. In the most sympathetic reading, Trump did not claim that the virus didn’t exist, only that its effects had been overemphasized by a press in, to use his words, “hysteria mode.” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic advisor, insisted that the virus had been “contained” and posed no danger to the economy. “I don’t think it’s going to be an economic tragedy at all,” Kudlow said.7 The virus has proven a human tragedy on a massive scale. At the time of writing, the national death toll totals nearly eight hundred thousand people, more deaths than the United States suffered during World War I and II and far higher than all combined American casualties in global wars since 1945. The number of new infections stands at more than one hundred thousand a day, nearly twice the numbers of the most serious hot zones of the spring of 2020. Most of the countries in the world have yet to even reach that number in total. My insides coil in dread when considering how these numbers appear as you hold this book in your hands. One assumes it became worse. We thought we didn’t have to worry about such things. The cheery outlook favored by American officials since the mid-twentieth century convinced the nation that infectious disease would have even less chance against the country than a foreign military incursion. In an era that celebrated scientists as key parts of the much-vaunted American military machine, Americans took solace in the idea that penicillin ended the terror of wasting plagues like the 1918 influenza pandemic. COVID-19 exposed the absurdity of claiming any kind of exceptionalism for a nation with basic social and economic weaknesses unknown in much of Europe, Japan, and East Asia. South Korea and Vietnam have so far led the world in containing the virus. President Trump appealed to South Korea for medical equipment even while attempting to bully them into large cash payments to maintain American troops at their border. Taiwan sent the United States PPE equipment, in fact, to my own county in South Carolina that currently has zip codes with some of the highest infection spikes in the country.8 The effect of the virus has baffled Americans convinced of their special destiny and special character and forced many to face hard truths about American power. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March of 2020 that “the United States has long stood out as the land of denial and death.” Even before the exponential spread of a novel coronavirus, the United States had one of the lowest life expectancy rates in the developed world.9 Though frequently called into question, the idea of the American century, the ideal of American exceptionalism, and the certainty that the United States is and has always been “the greatest nation on earth” still remain deeply rooted in American politics. They echo in the desperate and angry snarls to make America great again, bleating that sounds more like the cries of an injured animal than the confidence of a society that understands its values and practices them. But it also appears in the self-satisfied insistence that the United States is already great, thank you very much. Whether greatness lost or preponderance of power maintained, the idea of the American century continues to thrive. Is there a lonely crossroad where the nightmares of horror and the American century meet? Of course, horror and politics may seem as unrelated as raincoats and ice cream. The night you watch a horror movie is not the night you settle in with a history book or catch up on current events. You order pizza with friends and huddle together for the whirligig ride that jitters and jolts you. Ruined faces appear at rainy windows; the tension builds as a door creaks slowly into a vacuum of silence that suddenly erupts with screams. The whole flick comes in at just under ninety minutes and features a paranormal force unleashed by inebriated Gen Zs playing with that wicked old Ouija board or some comparable occult gadget. Or maybe a knife-wielding automaton will victimize the same age group for being at the worst possible place at the worst possible time. It’s escapist fun. You startle reflexively at the jump scares, something terrible suddenly filling the frame. Then you laugh at yourself and your friends, happy with your own terror. Someone makes jokes about being scared to go to bed that no one takes seriously. After all, no one takes horror seriously. Well, that’s no longer quite true. Over the last decade, as Americans became more acquainted with the twisted nature of their alleged exceptionalism, a clutch of horror films have given audiences more to think about than the dumb fun of a scare flick. Ari Aster’s Hereditary and Midsommar martialed complicated anxieties related to family, relationships, and social class. Aster jokingly called Hereditary “just a little family drama” when in fact it’s a crucible that burns the very concept of middle-class American family life to cinders, leaving behind a taste of its ashes. Similarly, Aster called Midsommar a “breakup movie,” but if you know the grotesque denouement, that’s like referring to Scorsese’s 1976 Taxi Driver as a classic boy-meets-girl drama. Aster knows his films cut to the bone and leave us questioning everything we think we know about even the most intimate expectations we have for the American good life . . . romance, success, money, home, and family. Aster tells a story of American dreams grounded in trauma that then becomes inestimably worse, descending into insane violence. Jordan Peele’s Get Out addressed racism in a “post-racial” society that maintains vast economic inequality and allows murderous police action against Black men and women. Peele’s film can be funny, horrific, and obsessively watchable. But in the meantime, it’s a devastating measure of white supremacy, a bleak miracle of a movie that addresses everything from the heritage of slavery to racist policing to the way social class informs a variety of racism just as brutal as you’d find in a lynch mob. Zadie Smith called the film a “compendium of black fears about white folk,” both in terms of cultural symbolism and historical legacy. In Peele’s ability to bring his gift of “comic reversals” to horror, Get Out becomes a film that “contains its own commentary” by making audiences understand that African Americans look fearfully on everything from “white women who date black men” to “well-meaning conversations about Obama” to “nostalgia for slavery” and, of course, “slavery itself.”10 Peele’s follow-up film, a complex tale of social class, race, and an unseen horror that undergirds all of American history, may be the most politically confrontational horror film ever made. As Sezin Koehler noted in a strenuous essay written during 2020’s nationwide protests against racist policing, economic structures, and public symbolism, Peele’s Us addresses “the fundamental toxicity of whiteness, white privilege, and its intersection with all kinds of violence.”11 In the wake of these films, a horrorsaince of social relevance, a debate between fandom and a relatively small number of cultural critics exploded across several social media platforms and resulted in a welter of dueling essays. Steve Rose set the cat among the pigeons first in his much-derided Guardian think piece “How Post-Horror Movies Are Taking Over Cinema.” In it, he described the traditional horror film using former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld’s infamously obtuse phrase known unknowns. Rose meant that while horror films proffered suspense, in reality every fan knows the accepted “rules” of the genre. He argued that, in general, horror movies are actually “one of the safest spaces in cinema” since a fan’s knowledge of what to expect provides them with a “flashlight” for the darkest corners a director might lead them to. These claims are untenable with just a glance at the long history of horror, reaching back to Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), which undermined audience expectations. In 1922, two World War I veterans produced Nosferatu as a reflection of “the great dying” of the war in which they and their countries had suffered. Rose avoided this history, skipping the silent era in America and Europe, the introduction of supernatural horror to America in the 1930s, and its terrifying revival in the 1960s and ’70s. In those decades, films like Hitchcock’s Psycho shocked audiences and critics into anger at the director himself. The butchering of Janet Leigh in the shower became the focal point of audience angst. But fans also hated, and loved, the film’s weight of dread that suggested you could not trust the director, that he might show you something etched like some cursed rune into your brain stem. George Romero assaulted his audiences with the gore his ghouls consumed (thanks to a Pittsburgh butcher friend who donated the day’s leftovers from his shop) and his introduction of a controversial Black male lead in the cataclysmic year of 1968. In 1973 documentarian William Friedkin made The Exorcist, a film that triggered such a convulsive reaction that Time magazine spoke to psychiatrists and theologians in an effort to make sense of why theaters in LA and New York had to begin running the film as early as 8:00 a.m. to handle crowds that stretched around entire city blocks.12 Rose ignored all this because he had to in order to claim our entrance into an age of post-horror, a phrase that obviously suggests something that has come after and replaced horror. The peculiar phrase, peculiar partially because it fails to communicate any meaningful information, is probably borrowed from the overused notion of “postmodern.” It also performed the job the author wanted it to in inciting fan outrage and hundreds of thousands of shares and likes, the cryptocurrency of online social capital.13 We could easily, too easily, write off Rose’s “post-horror” category as a provocative hot take, the current nomenclature for an undeveloped notion hurled like a hand grenade from the pillbox of a social media platform. But this idea has found wide support, especially among critics who found themselves drawn to the meaning of aesthetic documents that used horror commonplaces to make their point. The term elevated horror began to make the rounds among these critics in 2018. “Ugh. I’m not even much of a horror fan, but I can smell the condescension and the dissembling that’s baked into this awful phrase,” film critic Alonso Duralde told Indiewire. Jordan Peele felt it necessary to tweet simply that “‘Us’ is a horror movie” at the time of its release, possibly just to shut down what he considered a pretty pointless discussion. Influential critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted the obvious: calling a film “elevated horror” is a bit like calling a cheeseburger elevated. You’d simply be saying it’s a next-level cheeseburger and “if it’s delicious, no one will care what adjective you put in front of it.”14 Much of the conversation about “post-” or “elevated” horror (or other descriptors like “art horror” and even “smart horror”) glossed over the issue really being debated. Even unfriendly critics who probably want to see most horror tossed onto pop culture’s trash heap are attempting, maybe poorly, to articulate the meaning of horror. Ultimately then, the question has been less about whether horror films are good and more a question of whether they matter. The aforementioned horror films force us to see that there’s always been something deeply political about twentieth-century horror, all the way back to its roots as a cry of anger and despair in the aftermath of the Great War’s savagery. Arguably the late 1940s and much of the ’50s had been one of the most politically charged eras of the horror film. A generation sat through popular Main Street theaters for most of their Saturdays as flying saucers and mad scientists justified American military might in the face of an outside threat, transformed people of color around the world into monstrous beings and cruel villains, and offered a worldview fraught with paranoia and hair-trigger rage. Perhaps, and I stress perhaps, no deep philosophical questions emerged from Wes Craven’s The Last House on the Left or Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And yet both films were a punch in the gut. Jump scares and gore aren’t important to either film. Despite its reputation and title, you’ll see more viscera in an episode of your favorite TV police procedural than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. What directors, authors, comic artists, and even game designers want is to hit the audience with a cultural roundhouse. There’s no way to do that effectively without pushing political buttons to overstimulate the most delicate nerve endings of personal belief, ideology, patriotism, gender roles, and unexamined hatreds. Movies are not alone in having this effect, and so a full examination of how our monsters claw their way toward some of America’s deepest assumptions must speak broadly about horror culture. Best-selling novelist Paul Tremblay writes that horror really works only when it “push[es] and prod[s] at moral boundaries” and forces its audience to “confront personal and societal taboos.” In fact, he suggests that horror films need a “progressive” vision to really pull us out to sea on a dark tide. An attempt at a “conservative” horror tale that allows for an unambiguous happy ending fails to horrify the audience.15 Writer and director Aislinn Clarke doesn’t use the phrase elevated horror. But she has suggested that a difference does exist between something being “scary” and true, lingering horror. The creation of horror depends on upending convention and, she suggests, should “punch up” against those in power rather than “merely making monsters of those at the bottom.”16 Her masterful, thoughtful, and real damn scary 2018 film The Devil’s Doorway tosses more than a few matches at the incendiary questions of religion, sexual abuse, and misogyny. Rather than creating a possession/exorcism tale with a generic setting, she intertwines it with the legacy of Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries, which imprisoned unwed mothers, the mentally ill, or women who simply did not conform to social expectations. In Clarke’s film, there are jump scares, the suggestion of possession, and other tricks of the trade that pay homage to the exorcism drama. But the black wave that rolls over us after the credits roll, a feeling akin to grief as well as fear, comes from the complex evils we’ve encountered, the intractable horrors perpetrated, as Clarke notes, by both the church and the state. However, horror can also seem remarkably obtuse in how it attempts to critique or even resonate with the real world’s terrors. Award-winning science fiction and fantasy author Sam J. Miller told Wired magazine that the first episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which opened with televised footage of Donald Trump and his surprise 2016 election night victory, took a “ham-fisted” approach to politics, attempting to juice audience reactions by “reveling in the horror of our moment.”17 So does horror ask us to stop thinking or to start? Is it inherently political or simply a set of illusions that has perfected a way to play with our brain chemistry? If it does have a politics, are they progressive or reactionary? Is horror a red state, blue state, or the ultimate swing voter genre? The dark carnival of American history and horror does not offer a simple answer, at least one that we want to hear. Once we’ve read discussions about “elevated horror” and pondered what “post-horror” could mean, we are left with the simple fact that horror tells us more about the world than we want to know. Aislinn Clarke simply calls horror “the slow, dawning realization that the worst thing is true.” Historian and essayist Michael Parenti calls the horrors hidden by fantasy “dirty truths.” By this, he does not mean uncomfortable ideas that are debated. He means ideas that lack respectability to such a degree that you don’t mention them in polite company. They exude such an aura of unreality that they seem to besmirch even the people who tell you about them. Yet, they are still truths. If we grapple with the idea of horror and how it works, we also have to wrestle with the idea of empire. I’m aware it might seem bizarrely tendentious to refer to the United States as an empire. How can a democracy also be an empire? Don’t empires hold vast, extraterritorial colonies? Hasn’t the United States intervened only at moments of crisis when outside forces threatened the nation-state and generally chosen an “isolationist” approach? Haven’t even our worst mistakes in foreign policy come from a desire to make the world a better place? We are the greatest country on earth, aren’t we? It’s understandable that any American citizen would feel this way. Many of our grade school textbooks leave the impression that we are always and everywhere the good guys. So do many of our films, in so many ways the repository of popular memory. This book uses a simple definition of imperial power as the exercise of military, economic, and cultural dominance beyond the geographical borders of the homeland or nation-state. This has looked different in different eras; empire worked differently for the British than it did the Romans. The American empire works differently from both. Here, policy makers became increasingly skilled at shaping the world the United States would dominate while convincing us that something entirely different had happened. So what if the American dream is a nightmare? What if, at the bottom of an ill-smelling barrel brimming with secrets coiled like snakes, we find a terrible truth? It’s the truth of the dark carnival. Borrowing the image Ray Bradbury gave us, did something wicked this way come in the middle of the American night? Did only a few silent sentinels, watching at that dangerous hour of 3:00 a.m., hear the mechanical striving of a train on the tracks, pulling the sideshow acts, the automata, the game booths, and the scurrilous pranksters who will make it all spin and whirl and explode and pop? Did they really set it all up overnight, this tent city of bright reds and pearl whites that looks like so much fun as long as you don’t look too closely? This is a book about the kinds of stories we choose to tell, and why horror has become our story. This is a book of horror because it’s a book of war stories. We think we know what this means. Tim O’Brien told us what it means in, well, “How to Tell a True War Story,” a chapter from his award-winning The Things They Carried. In it, he claims “war is hell” but also “mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love.” These “contradictory truths” are at the heart of the experience that only those who wage war can begin to understand properly.18 I can’t follow O’Brien’s template and, more important, I think he is wrong. I have never been a soldier. I came perilously close to becoming one in the late nineties, having conversations with a Marine recruiter in grad school. My father, a working-class kid from the Carolina Piedmont who found himself in the Marines and then the Navy in the catastrophic years of 1967–1970, told me he’d feel nothing but disappointment if I did this. I’m grateful to him for this, as for many things, since becoming a reservist on the eve of 9/11 would have changed my life in ways I cannot imagine. The only time I heard shots fired in anger was in January of 1986 when I found myself part of a well-intended, if spectacularly ill-conceived, aid project in Haiti. In Saint-Marc and Gonaïves, the rattle of automatic weapons fire left me oddly unaffected, the invincibility in the face of history that only a white American fifteen-year-old can ever feel. But this experience matters in the war stories I have to tell you. Combatants are a relatively small part of any meaningful war story. Veterans fear being forgotten, but often their anxiety is that they be remembered in the right way. The ongoing concern known as “America, United States of” wants them remembered in specific ways too. Warriors, not soldiers. Effective killers but never rapists or plunderers. Figures on a stele or names on a wall but never human beings who are victimized and victimizers, unable to tell their stories because their throats are choked with rage, bearing the memories of the times the empire told them to mutilate, depressed, strung-out, addicted, suffering psychosis or the symptoms of chemical agents that cause heart problems, nerve damage, and cascading organ failure. The dirty wars of empire have to be submerged so that, paradoxically, the fighting can go on and on. This is why so much of the truth of the last one hundred years survives not in museum exhibitions or patriotic celebrations or lengthy documentary treatments but in horror films. It is a place where one does not expect war stories. The “holiness” that O’Brien thinks is somehow part of war can’t be found in horror. Horror as an art film, a silly film two clicks from porn, a novel, or a role-playing experience, all remind us of Lugosi’s strange moment in Dracula when he sighs, “there are far worse things awaiting man than death.” O’Brien says, “war can make you a man” and “war can make you dead.” But it can do worse. War is hell because we don’t want to die. But the military Moloch of empire doesn’t just want our deaths. It wants our need to murder, to rape, to pillage. It wants us maimed and raped and all our values desecrated. It has no interest in your masculinity crisis. If you can’t raise a flag and salute, it thinks your apathy will work just as well. It wants to build an empire on our bones. Most of us see this carnival’s garish illumination from a safe distance. The sounds of screams and clattering reveries of an organ grinding away take wing in the October air to thrill us and chill us. But we have more to learn about what kind of midnight ride the United States really is and the collective trauma its violent traveling circus has visited on the world.",

      "content": "1.Empire of Horror HORROR IS the dream life of American empire. Since the nineteenth century, the United States acted as an imperial power. The young nation seized land, killed Indigenous peoples, and battered to death any dissenters from its aggressive economic system. Once crowded into thirteen contentious little colonies that hugged the Atlantic, an empire born in blood emerged when these settler societies conquered most of Mexico and annihilated hundreds of small native nations that once lived from the Tennessee hills to the California coast, from Massachusetts Bay to the Ohio Valley. Many of the survivors of this genocide are today packed into hundreds of reservations, scattered across the continental and noncontiguous United States, where they sink below the poverty line at more than double the rate of the rest of America.1 The American empire slipped the confines of its continent in the early twentieth century. The new power’s shadow darkened Latin America and the Pacific, talons clawing for resources in East Asia. The Mexican War (1846–1848) doubled the size of the country. Hawaii and Alaska came next, along with the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, and a multitude of Pacific possessions. None would become states except for Hawaii and Alaska, and only after white men became the dominant political force in each region. Delivering a fatal blow to the decrepit Spanish imperium in the Spanish-American War (1898) allowed this rogue state to seize ports of call from the Caribbean to the doorstep of China. Cuba offered an experiment in which, after a military occupation from 1898 to 1902, a “republic” could come to life on the island so long as its government agreed to allow unilateral intervention, at any time, by the United States. The American military did occupy the country twice more and handpicked its leaders until the Cuban revolution in 1959. The United States never accepted that repudiation and continues to maintain a needlessly cruel economic boycott lingering now more than thirty years after the end of the Cold War. American presidents, military leaders, and captains of industry collaborated to create this new style of empire. The government could hold military bases in the Philippines without having to tangle any longer with the Indigenous insurgency that lasted more than a decade. U.S. Marines could protect business interests in Haiti during a nineteen-year occupation without having to administer it as a traditional colony. The U.S. military could run the Dominican Republic while keeping up the pretense of its independence. By the 1930s, Standard Oil (now Chevron) fully tied together American corporate and foreign policy interests by helping adjudicate an alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia that endures, profitably for both country’s ruling classes, into the present. Not only would oil interests benefit from the unlikely alliance. The partnership subsequently provided the United States with military bases in the region and the basis for an expanded network of bases in Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the United States officially structured its imperial holdings around the policy of “containing” communism. A new leadership cadre emerged in Washington, D.C., under the control of the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the cliques of unelected national security advisors that huddle around the country’s increasingly powerful executive branch. Closely linked to defense contractors with assets in the hundreds of billions, a relatively small and unsupervised economic and foreign policy elite waged secret wars, staged coups, and placed free-market-friendly dictators in power in Greece, Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Uganda, Iran, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Iraq. The end of the Cold War in 1991 changed none of this. The United States did not stand down with the dissolution of the Soviet Union—it launched invasions of both Panama and Iraq when their autocratic regimes, both longtime puppets of U.S. foreign policy and recipients of American arms and cash, stepped out of line. “Humanitarian interventions” into Haiti, Somalia, and the Balkans by the Clinton administration developed new military doctrine, tested weapons systems, and, in Kosovo, allowed for the building of enormous military bases to guard hoped-for oil pipelines that would bypass Russia and Iran. In the twenty-first century, the United States achieved a hegemony undreamt of by past imperial powers. Nearly 750 military bases, and hundreds of CIA black sites, are controlled by the United States around the globe. The majority of the world’s countries play host to American troops and weapons systems, 154 countries in 2020.2 U.S. covert ops does their work with impunity in nearly every country on earth. Regularly ignoring and sometimes even mocking the United Nations, American presidential administrations for fifty years have been breaking, amending, or simply ignoring multilateral treaties related to the UN Genocide Convention, the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, its own nuclear nonproliferation and test ban initiatives, and the International Criminal Court. The United States’ domination of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank gives the empire nearly limitless economic power over the debt of the world’s smallest and poorest nations. The Hollywood-McDonald’s-Disney industrial complex controls much of the global culture industry. Drone technology allows the United States to launch violent incursions in foreign nations that would have been considered acts of war in earlier times. Preemptive, bloody strikes in Sudan, Syria, Pakistan, and the Philippines have received limited news coverage from American media and a bored yawn from the American public. In November of 2021, news that American commanders kept secret a 2019 airstrike in Syria that killed eighty women and children spent only several hours as a top story for The New York Times online edition while no major news network provided coverage that lasted more than one minute. American power, covert and overt, over much of the globe leads analysts to describe the United States as a “hyperpower” rather than using the older language of superpower. The United States is also an empire whose culture industry makes horror films grossing more than half a billion dollars every year, many of them low-budget and highly profitable. Streaming services are cluttered not only with traditional horror films but with “true crime” documentaries that explore the most gruesome murders ever committed in surgical detail. Death’s own holiday, Halloween, has become a multi-billion-dollar affair that America has exported to other countries. It’s not paradoxical that an empire built on very real horror consumes horror as part of its regular entertainment. However, horror plays more than one role in the empire’s entertainment industry. Americans have, as Daniel Immerwahr described in his 2019 book How to Hide an Empire, worked assiduously to disguise their imperial design, even from themselves. Thus, some of our tales of terror are more oblique because we’d rather see ourselves as the shining city on a hill and not a global behemoth. So we tell horror stories that allow us to forget, that tell us of monsters beyond our borders and heroes that destroy them for us. And yet, horror also offers a shadowy mirror. It reveals truths and poses questions, tells us that we are the monsters that ignore borders in our insatiable hungers. The white American notion of the self—ruddy, open-faced, a bit innocent as it determinedly undertakes its mission to be what former secretary of state Madeleine Albright called “the indispensable nation”—stares into the glass only to find something twisted and not quite sane staring back. Despite the differences in horror fictions, despite how they offer radically different versions of the American dream, they always center violence. One kind of horror makes us yearn to turn the lights on and the other keeps the lights on the whole time for us. But both explore or exploit the violence of empire, critiquing it or imagining it as necessary for the preservation of the most prosperous, most dangerous nation on earth. The realities come to us in our cultural REM state. Our dependence on various sadisms to maintain the nation’s hegemony has caused two different dreams to emerge in the American unconscious. Both dreams have a darkness, even if one represses its cruelest assumptions. The first is a dream of safety and security. Most American citizens do not think of themselves as living in an empire but instead in a great nation that mostly does good things. The occasional failing, like the toppling of a government in a violent coup or the murder of civilians in an air strike, is “not who we are.” The world may be full of enemies of our freedom, but walls fashioned by the national security state, and actual concrete, protect us from “blowback.” This term, first coined in a secret history commissioned by the CIA and introduced to the public by former cold warrior turned critic of empire Chalmers Johnson, refers to unintended and unplanned consequences of the American empire’s most secret crimes. These actions are unknown to American citizens but unforgotten and unforgivable to its victims in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. When we screen the sunnier side of imperial assumptions, the horror film offers monsters marked for death from the beginning. Film or folklore predicates their existence on the monsters’ eventual destruction. Our heroes, often dealing with creatures who emerge from islands and maelstroms beyond the borders of America’s cordon sanitaire or violate U.S. airspace in their flying saucers or with their leathery wings, defeat the evil that threatens our safety and our sanity. These films, these dreams of innocence, tell us that the monsters are not unlike the psychos who attacked the Twin Towers on 9/11. Their motives are unclear, they are “evildoers” who have apparently attacked us for our inherent goodness. This book explains that Americans’ love of this iteration of horror comes from the same root as their acquiescence to the violence that made America. The jump scares and the gore, the evil cabals and paranormal activities, all allow us to imagine that evil comes from demonic principalities or masked killers, that it happens to innocent Americans in their allegedly safe homes. Violence is not what is done in our name, by fresh-faced young people we’ve hired to kill for us, in places we can’t find on a map. Violence is done to us and we fight back and we win—we always win. By the time the credits roll, these films assure us that everything is okay, that the evildoers have been punished and the American way of life, and the piece of it you’ve broken off for yourself, will not change even a little. Another kind of horror film denies us security and comfort, even as it refuses to let us believe we are the legitimate heirs of imperial privilege. These films demand we recognize how the American dream has been assembled from the night terrors of the world. They pose questions about how we won our comforts. They often leave us gobsmacked, muddled, and dazed as we try to bring ourselves to sensibility of what we thought was the real world. These are films that end with corpses everywhere and the survivors wearing their dead friends’ insides. The evil has not come from without, from empire’s frontier. It’s a violence we made, that we’ve either become or accepted, as the price of our privileges. These films critique the American dream by showing us the mounds of corpses it’s built on. These films are often aggressive with the audience, refusing to play by the rules of the genre. Commenting on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Mick Garris described it as a film that ignored old-school “somethings behind the door” scares in favor of “coming after you in fucking clown paint.” The thing coming at us in “fucking clown paint” has a lot more power than popular understandings of Aristotle’s notion of catharsis. The idea that horror films, especially ones that show body-rending violence, are palliatives for anxiety has been best summarized by Richard Rhodes as “taking the psychic garbage out.” Of course, as Maggie Nelson asks in The Art of Cruelty, where does this “psychic garbage” go? Who ends up with it? Is there any evidence that this “catharsis” is taking place, she asks, if “‘catharsis’ now means ‘tune in next week’”? Perhaps, as Nelson herself suggests, something deeply political, not simply psychological, works in our stories of violence. If we consume hour after hour after hour of innocence being corrupted or killed by monstrosity but watch our heroes annihilate the monster just before the credits roll, it’s soothing repetition and not catharsis. But horror also confronts us with unsettling dread that opens new possibilities. Horror directors like John Carpenter make films that, in his own words, critique “unrestrained capitalism.” George A. Romero could make a zombie film in 2005 that has Dennis Hopper standing in for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. These films follow the brutal logic of Eugene Ionesco’s famous assertion, sometimes in a very literal way, that “to tear ourselves away from the everyday, from habit, from mental laziness which hides from us the strangeness of reality, we must receive something like a real bludgeon blow.” These nightmares come from the irreconcilable contrasts of what Americans hope, or believe, the world to be and its bleaker reality. This is the reason so much of what spooks us in horror depends on sensory uncertainty, experience suddenly taking a dreaded turn, a past suddenly revealing its true meaning or a future lost. Horror lets us know that how we expected the world to act has been indefinitely cancelled. What appeared to be simply a shadow on the wall moves in a way nothing should. We are certain we are alone in a dark room when something brushes against us. The sunlight of a spring day suddenly dies as thunderheads trick out the sky in a sickening orange and Leatherface charges across a peaceful pasture, chain saw roaring, ready to teach us that you “DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS.” This is the precise opposite of entertainment as escapism, the wish to ignore reality. Michael Moorcock once attacked J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth fantasies as escapism that encouraged a Tory view of the world. Tolkien rebuked the young Marxist, saying that “jailers always hate escapism.” Moorcock famously replied that actually jailers love escapism—what they hate is an actual jailbreak. Many of our frightful fictions want us to contemplate a jailbreak from the American consensus. The horror film that demands we attend to the history of American violence does not simply reflect the culture. Its buoyant sadisms can restage the violence this country visits on the world and insist we look, that we see through lies and renounce the cant, the mental laziness, and the political nihilism. Americans can fight for tickets to the opening of Saw (2004) and Hostel (2005), infamously labelled “torture porn,” in the same cultural moment as the revelation that physical and sexual violence had been deployed by American soldiers against the detainees of Abu Ghraib prison. The tendency of our least comfortable filmmakers to try to bludgeon us says nothing about audience reaction or the meaning accrued to a specific film. This book does not suggest that audiences leave a horror film pondering geopolitics or the cost of American empire. Nor do they leave a simple monster-hunt story thinking about how good it is to live so well in a country like the United States. But they do leave the theater or close their streaming app with either a feeling of the rightness or wrongness of the world. They’ve been asked to question the story they tell themselves about reality. They’ve been asked to pay attention or they’ve been told to go back to sleep, everything’s okay. In the troubled sleep of empire, both dreams may come. In this book we will experience both fantasies and the political conviction that grows out of the worldview each assumes. We’ll see the predator who swims from sea to shining sea until slain by a working-class hero who’s trying to defend our amity. And we’ll have to watch a more excruciating vision, a murderous dance on the frontiers of American power, a roar of industrialized murder shattering the silence of purple mountains majesty. In the troubled sleep of empire, we meet the chain saw and the shark. 2. American Massacres TOBE HOOPER, his round, boyish, bespectacled face beaming with an easy smile, eased back in his chair as he responded to a question about the real meaning of his classic, and infamous, 1974 film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He laughed nervously, like a modest kid embarrassed by winning a prize at school, as he talked about his story of hippies finding some real bad trouble in the Texas hinterland. “I think what it’s trying to say,” Hooper quipped, as if giving credit to someone else for the eighty-minute nightmare, “is that this is America.”3 Hooper created a revisionist western, the myth of the American frontier that outdid The Wild Bunch in its unforgiving brutality. Hooper’s Wild West is not John Wayne facing down desperate men with the truest of grit. Hooper’s frontier rots like Katherine Anne Porter’s Texas dirt farms, so gone to seed that the clans that clustered there had to go to work at the local slaughterhouse. But, in the moribund heartland of seventies America, even the slaughterhouse has gone out of business. The evil demon presiding over the times in which the film first flickered on drive-in screens made the celluloid carnage appear a documentary. The first few minutes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre are staccato edits of unburied bodies. An edged, metallic riff tears the soundscape. Hooper, who spent a year chopping and scoring the film, created a whole library of unsettling sounds he could draw on. He achieved the grating sound of metal ripping apart by tearing apart a tambourine and dragging a saw across the threads so the seams busted like metal ripping flesh. So much for the sounds of the decade when Hooper came of age, when young, hopeful Americans wanted to hear Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for them. Hooper joined each serrated edit with the droning of a news anchor . . . murders, accidents, Nixon, and Vietnam. It’s a cacophony of horrors. The news reports, just like the unending stream of malignancies that greet us in our contemporary doom scrolling, report global and local carnage. The catalog of disasters continues as Hooper shows us exhumed graves in a small Texas town where some hippie kids drop by to ask directions to the old homeplace. The old men standing around, escapees from an Erskine Caldwell novel, are delighted by the women’s short-shorts and bemused by the bell-bottomed paramours the pretty girls prefer to John Wayne. We meet our heroes in this unquiet graveyard. Sally and Franklin are brother and sister, a duo living in different cultural time zones of the sixties and seventies. Sally is a liberated advocate of peace and love, while Franklin uses a wheelchair and is filled with an unendurable combination of sniveling self-pity and rage. The rest of the group are largely embodiments of the counterculture. Pam is a sultry astrology maven. Jerry and Kirk are floating clouds of cannabis eager to learn more about sultry astrology mavens. They’ve hit the road like Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters in part to find Sally and Franklin’s family home. Hooper told a story of a new kind of settlers. They are the children of the Age of Aquarius, but Pam warns that the times they are a-changing; Saturn has ascended. The monster who devoured his own children will become the new America. The Hitchhiker, no name provided, introduces us to the realities of American history that purblind patriotism would have us ignore. The blood is the life for the Hitchhiker and his family. They had worked for generations at a nearby slaughterhouse that fired them when it started using high-powered air guns. “The hammer was better,” the Hitchhiker assures his new friends, a gruesome observation but one that resonated with Americans who’d been hearing a new word on the evening news: deindustrialization. For the working class this meant, above all, unemployment as manufacturing jobs disappeared and the country began its arc toward today’s information and services economy. Sweaty, kinetic, and seemingly opposed to bathing, the Hitchhiker causes the kids to quickly become wary because, as Franklin puts it, they may have “picked up Count Dracula” from “a whole family of Draculas.” The Hitchhiker’s interest in blood, his own and others, suggests Franklin might be on to something. The film starts as a story about finding the family farm, the old dream of the homestead, the West that became the first frontier of the American empire. But it quickly becomes a fright tale that questions the sanity of any audience that would watch it and, by extension, the sanity of anyone who would believe the western fantasy of deserts inexplicably fecund and settlers moving peacefully across the landscapes, covered wagons like little puffs of cloud drifting along in an orderly row with the breeze of the American dream nudging them along. In place of a little house on the prairie, the kids find riverbeds dry as ash when they want to swim and, in the age of rural poverty, a crumbling Victorian farmhouse leering over the landscape. One by one, the hippie kids find themselves on meat hooks in scenes that are weirdly bloodless while evoking absolutely brutal violence. A man-child in a skin mask lays out Jerry in a single, spine-crunching blow from a slaughterhouse mallet. By the end of the film, only Sally remains, captive of the strange, male-only family of cannibals. The Hitchhiker, we learn, is part of this family, which includes the Cook; the murderous, if childlike Leatherface; and Grandpa, a desiccated corpse that comes to life only at the smell of blood and meat. All gather at what looks to be Sally’s last supper, the table piled high with offal and sausage, which we assume are pieces of her friends or other unlucky travelers in the heartland. The film ends without the now well-known figure of the “final girl” triumphing over the monster. Well, not exactly. We bear witness to another kind of America with a final girl less gritty and confident than we’ve come to know her. Sally, avatar of the last living hip sixties beauty, jumps through a window and runs for her life, slathered in blood and screaming, escaping to whatever fate awaits her in the back of a passing pickup truck. As she flees, Leatherface dances a gruesome ballet with his chain saw. A guttered western sun spreads a brown glow over the waterless landscape, a John Ford shot that would have suited Red River. Filming the movie had been a terror trip. The Texas summer broiled in 1973, making the shoot as miserable as all the characters seem to be on screen. Thirty-two days of temperatures at 95 to 100 degrees and sixteen-to eighteen-hour days made cast and crew hate each other and become dangerously accident-prone. The set almost became an actual chain saw massacre more than once. Gunnar Hansen, a Swedish poet who played the murderous Leatherface, later admitted that he became a bit too enthusiastic about trying to kill Marilyn Burns, Sally in the film. Indeed, swinging the chain saw, he came close to eviscerating more than one cast member and once Hooper himself. Burns later said that when she seems to lose her mind and have a complete psychotic break as she tries to escape at the end of the film, “that wasn’t acting.”4 Director, cast, and crew found the American past and present in Texas apocalypseland. Hooper’s camera moves listlessly across abandoned barns, rusting tractors, and a broken landscape that looks like a bone protruding from sand; rainless, the color of the earth is bright but harsh, baking the eyes of the viewer. Art director Robert A. Burns discovered a dead armadillo on the highway early in the shoot. Burns took it home, read a book on taxidermy, and sewed the animal into a Frankensteined version of its former self. An image of decay lying on the side of the road, vaguely portentous and, as Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) chairman H. Rap Brown said about violence, “as American as cherry pie.” The Texas Chain Saw Massacre appeared just as the crimes of the Nixon administration came slowly to light. The bodies buried in the American landscape had been exhumed, not unlike the harrowing scenes in the film’s opening moments. The house of the dead on Pennsylvania Avenue whispered ill-kept secrets: attempts to subvert a democratic election, the use of the FBI as an internal security force hardwired into Nixon’s presidium of corrupt advisors, and secret wars being waged in Cambodia and Laos that only a few in the Pentagon, and no one in Congress, knew anything about. Facing eminent impeachment, Nixon resigned in disgrace in the last weeks of the summer of ’74. In less than a year, Americans found themselves facing defeat in Vietnam. In late spring of ’75, families watched over TV dinners as the evening news showed the fall of Saigon in real time and the last Americans fleeing ingloriously in a helicopter off the rooftop of their embattled embassy. The most famous images showed hordes of South Vietnamese, who had worked with or for the Americans, being turned away at a makeshift helipad atop a downtown Saigon hotel turned CIA headquarters. During this year of the macabre, millions of Americans unexpectedly went to see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, first in drive-ins and grungy theaters and then on every screen that wanted to make a buck. The film reels turned on squeaky, stained, smoke-encrusted projectors for most of ’74, the movie’s dark reputation growing. The opening titles of Hooper’s film, a crawl that told of “the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history,” convinced some viewers that they were watching a true story, a companion piece to 1974’s controversial documentary that indicted American violence against the Vietnamese, Peter Davis’s Hearts and Minds. Tobe Hooper conjured the family of murderers from childhood tales of the Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, the grave robber, deer hunter, and taxidermist who lived his own gruesome vision of America. To Hooper’s consternation and delight, fans actually argued with the writer and director for decades about whether his film was a documentary or not. They were wrong about Hooper giving them an early example of a true crime murderama/docudrama. But more than childhood tales of Gein’s mayhem influenced the filmmaker. When he was walking on the UT Austin campus in August 1966, a cop screamed at Hooper to get his head down because “someone is shooting from the tower.” Hooper simply stared at the officer for a moment, maybe a little high and certainly oblivious to the mayhem swirling around him. Hooper sobered considerably when bullets ventilated the officer’s major organs.5 Charles Whitman had come to UT Austin to perpetrate one of the most savage mass murders, outside of covert warfare, in American history. Hooper hid behind cars and trash cans along with hundreds of others as the ex-marine fired from the twenty-eighth-floor observation deck of the Main Building. For ninety-six minutes the shots exploded, stopping only so Whitman could meticulously reload the arsenal of weapons he’d lugged up to his aerie. When police finally brought Whitman down, he had killed fifteen people and wounded thirty-one others. Earlier in the day, he enjoyed a quiet lunch with his mother and then stabbed her to death. He then drove home and stabbed his wife three times before heading to the campus. Like Hooper’s brutalist western, Whitman’s story is another tale that’s really about America. 3.I Wish They All Could Be California Girls BOOGEYMEN ALREADY haunted American dreams as the seventies became a turning point for empire. Tex left the ranch late, just as midnight came on and the campfire waned after dinner. He packed a .22 Buntline Special. Colt’s Manufacturing Company (founded in 1855) named the gun after Ned Buntline, the man who created the dime novel western. Wyatt Earp supposedly carried the same long-barreled smoke wagon to every killing he’d ever graced with his presence. Tex hit the trail to play his part in what became known as the Manson murders, despite Charles Manson’s limited role in the actual labor of killing. The importance of “Helter Skelter,” and Vincent Bugliosi’s archetypal 1975 true crime novel of the same name, has carried cultural weight out of proportion to the actual event. Bugliosi told readers a story not unlike he told jurors in 1970. Manson held a series of interconnected beliefs based on an exotic blend of white supremacist ideology folded in with bits and pieces of Scientology, Robert A. Heinlein, and the book of Revelation, all cooked in acid until fully homicidal. Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) proved a particular obsession to the group. It’s unclear whether Manson ever read it, but someone in the Manson Family did. When a child was born as a result of the group’s perpetual orgy, he was named Valentine Michael—a tribute to the alien fascist who’s the hero of Heinlein’s novel, a cult leader who enjoys patriarchal polyamory and “disincorporating” his enemies. Manson could relate. Heinlein, meanwhile, would go on to play an all too important role in the story of the American empire, endorsing policies that murdered more people than his psychotic admirers in the Manson Family could imagine offing in their most extravagant death fantasies. Reading Heinlein can teach you a lot about Manson and about postwar America. But it was Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter that became the book everyone had to read regarding the Tate-LaBianca murders, joining Ann Rule’s The Stranger Beside Me as the template for the true crime genre. It still keeps that reputation after half a century. Ed Sanders, poet and member of the Merry Prankster folk band the Fugs, also won a hearing with his 1971 book, The Family. It’s a wonderfully strange and byzantine mess, a true farrago of diary, reportage, memoir, fact-free rumination, political commentary, and occasionally a very detailed guide to the geography of the Southern California desert. It’s always classified as “true crime,” which is a bit like categorizing Robert Graves’s The White Goddess as classics. Sanders understood that the Tate-LaBianca murders had meaning beyond the actual event and would continue to accumulate meaning in the way of historical events. Joan Didion wrote in her famed essay “The White Album” that “many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969.” Greil Marcus insisted that “Manson’s shadow is everywhere” and suggested that the thrill kills of the Family had something to do with Woodstock, at least symbolically. But he couldn’t have conceivably meant such bum steer bullshit. He must have been upset, in the same headspace as Steve McQueen, when, out of the conviction that death cults might come for all the pretty people of new Hollywood, he packed a revolver to Sharon Tate’s funeral.6 Sanders saw another kind of connection. What made Charles Manson so different from Richard Nixon? What was the meaning of Manson gleefully holding the headline that read MANSON GUILTY, NIXON DECLARES? Why did Manson mock Nixon as late as the eighties and nineties and, in the stygian depths of his psychosis, how was he certain that he, Jesus, and the devil all in one package had actually been responsible for Nixon’s downfall? Maybe all that’s a story about America and not Manson. Maybe we needed Manson in 1969 and have continued to need him for the last half century. “I’m just your mirror” Manson was fond of saying to the throngs who interviewed him in prison; “you see in me what you need to see.” Even a broken, criminally insane clock can be right once or twice. Maybe the theatrical violence, the horror aesthetic that riveted the nation on 10050 Cielo Drive, had its corollary in an awareness of American imperial horrors? Did those two nights in the LA hills become a way to forget, or remember, how murder is done in our name? The Manson murders, many critics of the Vietnam War noted, had brought the war home. Perhaps this American massacre, and our reaction to it, showed our immense moral hypocrisy when it came to the crimes carried out on our behalf. Ed Sanders made this connection by comparing Manson to another figure accused of ordering a mass murder, Lieutenant William Calley. Calley became infamous as the officer who led Charlie Company, Twentieth Infantry Regiment of the “Americal” Division, into My Lai village, slaughtering as many as five hundred people, raping and mutilating as they proceeded. The army at first attempted to cover up the event but then put Calley on trial about one month after the Tate-LaBianca murders. No higher officers, including Captain Ernest Medina, who ordered the foray, faced conviction.7 Around the time the officer who led Charlie Company and Charles Manson came to national fame, Sanders had become the main man on the Tate-LaBianca beat for the Los Angeles Free Press, a countercultural lodestone known just as the Freep. Giving any nuanced view of the fascination with Manson got you in trouble in 1970, just as it does now. But after telling those who accused him of defending Manson to “go make motions of unification with a weather balloon,” Sanders proposed that the country that “perfected the concept of the ‘freefire zone’” in Vietnam and found fragmentation bombs amenable to the spirit of suburbia’s “well-kept lawns” possibly suffered a hypocrisy problem.8 In January of 1971, he forced readers back into the jungle with Calley. He didn’t believe Manson was innocent but insisted that “if you kill Manson you have to kill Calley.” He was not alone in seeing the correspondence. Allen Katzman of The East Village Other wrote that if Manson’s followers slaughtered the Vietnamese rather than Tate and her friends, Manson and his followers would have been “just following orders and obeying the ten commandments.” Even National Lampoon and Mad magazine made the connection, with Lampoon imagining a boxing match between Manson and Calley, won by the latter because of the quick intervention of Richard Nixon. Nothing made this point more brutally graphic in all meanings of the term than Tom Veitch and Greg Irons in one of their “comix” (underground, and very adult, work that emerged in the sixties often associated with Robert Crumb) entitled The Legion of Charlies. The opening page provides two top panels with Lieutenant “Kali” (a Hindu goddess associated with death) telling his troops “we’re gonna hafta wipe um all out.” The bottom two panels feature Manson demanding that “piggies must die . . . let’s get ’em.” The satire gets weirder as the U.S. government decides legions of Manson followers can kill and cannibalize with more speed and panache than the U.S. military. “We’ve taken the logic inherent in today’s news,” Veitch wrote, “and taken it to absurdity.” That’s just peacenik rhetoric, right? Sure it is. But that doesn’t change the fact that, as Manson had ordered his family “to do something witchy,” Calley ordered Charlie Company to do much the same. There’s nothing in the official army records that vindicates or even mitigates what happened that day. Moreover, as explored later in this book, the incident reads as a microcosm of the larger American war-fighting plan in which the United States would behave like a brutal confused schizophrenic, offering the Vietnamese people largesse to win hearts and minds while raining down hell and destruction in nearly incalculable tonnages of bombs and chemical weapons. Long before Calley and Manson, Horace Greeley’s injunction to “Go west, young man” became both the rallying cry and an epithet for a country determined to manifest the fuck out of its destiny. There’s a vicious subtext of violence and rapine in the tendency of American history textbooks to describe the opening of the West. The image suggests a flower opening to sunlight, but darker images await. Settlers violently “opened” the West; prospectors, frontier start-up entrepreneurs, saloon keepers, and, most of all, soldiers tore their way across the continent to make the first American empire. Ed Sanders thought “the Family” had, like Tobe Hooper’s clan of the chain saw, headed west to grow up with the country, an acid nightmare of violence becoming how the West was won. If only Joan Didion had brought the sensibility of her essay “John Wayne: A Love Story” to her epithet for the sixties. Maybe Gay Talese could have pressed his metaphors further in his famous March 1970 Esquire piece “Charlie Manson’s Home on the Range.” As things turned out, it proved easier for the liberal intelligentsia and the American ayatollahs of the eighties right-wing backlash to declare the death of a fragile period of experimentation with social justice than to see 10050 Cielo Drive as a hyperreal theme park of the American empire, an allegory of the dream of an ever-expanding West, a corollary to a brutal war in East Asia where kids nursed at the man-teat of John Wayne and talked about “playing cowboys and Indians” in the jungle of the new frontier, and an aging Wayne himself tried to shore up the fantasy in his ludicrous 1968 pro-war film The Green Berets. Americans loved reading about Manson and still do, but the millions of Asian corpses didn’t move them. Richard Nixon may have declared Manson guilty, but he declared Lieutenant William Calley innocent. In April of 1971, Nixon ordered Calley released from the custody of military police, pending his sentencing. Calley remained under house arrest for three years until federal court judge J. Robert Elliott overturned his conviction. Sanders was wrong. If you convict Manson, you can actually let Calley go free. Elliott even attended Calley’s wedding. Plenty of mythmakers, across the political spectrum, have found in Manson a seething symbolism. Culture warrior Senator Ted Cruz seemed worried about his ghost voting from prison as late as 2020. Depending on who you read, Manson “killed” or “weaponized” or “embodied” the sixties. Manson had the power to make Americans believe in him, and through successive interviews over decades with everyone from Geraldo Rivera to Ronald Reagan Jr., he successfully became the boogeyman. He started this in his trial, where spoke of “these children who come at you with knives.” A damn good line used to describe three not-children who came not for their parents but for an emerging actor and her friends at a Norman-style chateau in the Hollywood Hills that once belonged to Lillian Gish. The little crook his followers called “The Wizard” scried up the perfect storm. Cultural critics insisted on calling his Family “the cult” and “the commune,” turning Manson into “the Dark Hippie,” the sum of all the half-mythical silent majority’s entirely mythical fears. Rolling Stone saw this coming in June of 1970. Manson would become the bourgeoise bugaboo, “the long-haired devil you loved to hate.”9 What was not to hate? Manson had taken the life of Tate, America’s new beach beauty, even as she’d been on the brink of becoming an oddly political sex symbol—a Jane Fonda who’d never let our boys down. She’d been a real sweet girl from Texas, Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas 1943. A military brat, Tate lived in Texas, California, and even Italy because of the work of her father, Colonel Paul Tate, who later served as an intelligence officer in Vietnam. She was the all-American girl who only in your most grandiose of fantasies lived next door. Almost exactly eight years before being butchered in the Hollywood Hills, the icily gorgeous Tate, a Catherine Deneuve for Grand Ole Opry Fans, posed for the Atomic Frontier Days in Richland, Texas. Feet shod in boots, wearing shorts that revealed her lengthy tanned shanks kissed by the Texas sun, she straddled a Nike-class surface-to-air-missile, cowboy hat on her head. This was four years before Stanley Kubrick used the image of Slim Pickens bronco-busting a missile in Dr. Strangelove. The event celebrated the local plutonium manufacturing plant and its role in America’s system of mass destruction. Floats paraded down Main Street Richland reading THE WEST, NEW AND OLD, the atomic missile and the six-gun, the arms race and the cattle drive, the hope that the commies would go down like the Mescalero Apache. She continued to be a strange icon of American power. A few years later, Tate appeared mostly unclothed in a ham-handed attempt by Esquire to parody Mao’s Little Red Book, his turgid quotes juxtaposed with Sharon in wet T-shirts and bandoliers. Today, it looks more like a self-own, a parody of Esquire’s stated commitment to what they described as “the capitalist way of things” when they introduced Tate’s spread in the summer of ’67. Tate became a symbol of all kinds of things before the ’69 murders, just as she would after. Glamour, a rags-to-riches story, the ingenue that might become a star, something sexy and American. Her anti-communist wet T-shirt photos and willingness to rail on a missile seemed to make sense among baby boomers for whom “do our own thing” could mean the perpetual contact high of living in Haight-Ashbury or marching in an anti-war demonstration or growing old enough to support Donald Trump while believing QAnon and the Pentagon Papers bear the same level of meaning—the generation so certain of both the power of crystals and the danger of “chemtrails.” Can you dig it? After all, the world lost Tate because, while some women of the sixties founded and fought for the work of the National Organization for Women (NOW), a few female boomers lived in a biblical patriarchy with a hirsute, death-obsessed little goblin who played the guitar well enough that he attracted the attention of Byrds producer Terry Melcher and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Lynette Fromme, Leslie Van Houten, Linda Kasabian, and a host of others went California dreaming with a man who hobnobbed with new Hollywood while building weaponized dune buggies to fight Black Panthers in the San Fernando Valley. A very American story. So maybe the children were coming for an older America with knives out? Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman seemed scary, if not as utterly terrifying in the middle-class imagination as Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. For most of the white American mainstream, Manson served a useful purpose. The silent majority could silently nod as their president called this diminutive fright wig of a guy “guilty, directly or indirectly” of the murders of eight people. This just felt right, being so afraid that you felt an extra dopamine rush of satisfaction at the dark messiah’s sentence. It felt wrong to be upset over the hundreds of Vietnamese dead at the contested borders of the American empire. Fantasizing about the intruders, Manson’s Lugosi-eyes floating in mist above them, entering the Tate-Polanski home felt so much better than picturing young American soldiers raping and murdering an entire village at a leisurely pace, the hours it took to terrorize and butcher and burn becoming so wearing that most of Charlie Company took a lunch break before resuming the slaughter. Certainly no one wanted to think about how My Lai represented only the tip of the bloody spear in Vietnam, how tens of thousands of civilians died in the Mekong Delta during Operation Speedy Express or how “free-fire zones” made such massacres a tactical imperative. Lieutenant William Calley claimed he was just following orders. But rather than pondering the implications of that story about America, why not dwell on Tex Watson announcing to Sharon Tate and her coffee heiress friend Abigail Folger that “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business”? Better yet, let’s imagine that Manson said it. Let’s imagine the sixties revealed their true meaning on a single night in Benedict Canyon. Let’s forget the end of an era occurred in the Mekong Delta or at Kent State or with the Christmas bombings. Horror makes it easier to live in an empire. Except when it doesn’t. Tobe Hooper wanted the chain saw to show Americans a story about their country. George A. Romero described himself as “pissed off” that the promised “revolution” of the sixties had never truly come. Could his flesh-eating ghouls be the only kind of revolution that could endure? Could they at least interject chaos into the new American consensus that made meaningful change seem impossible by the 1980s?10 A fascination with horror, and the hope that horror can be so shocking that it burns this motherfucker down with the sound of a chain saw roaring in the distance, tells us about more than just the American seventies. It’s a history that has something uncomfortable to say about being a citizen of the American empire at this moment. The horror con that becomes an actual blood bath or the Halloween theme park where you are stalked and slaughtered by very real psychopaths appears in films like Blood Fest, Haunt, The Houses October Built (1 and 2), Hell Fest, and No Escape Room. Each ask the viewer to consider what horror actually means in a society where it’s everywhere. Awash in uncountable podcasts, documentaries, wikis, tribute websites, and books about “true crime,” how have we come to understand violence? When what counts as news has also taken on the tincture of hyperreality, a drop here and a drop there of rage and calamity, what do we mean by horror? Chain saw horror always comes as a crisis of knowledge. The portal opens when spells are whispered in some dark, forgotten tongue. What was not known is revealed and—uh oh—it’s something we never should have learned. Or maybe it’s better to know, to find the text or the amulet or the buried body to end the terror? We need the chain saw if we want to understand how America works. The slaughterhouse that calved a thousand maniacs means learning that everything you thought was true is wrong. Understanding politics and ideology means taking apart the assumptions that live like parasites in our minds. Chain saw horror does that. It doesn’t worry about the relationship of map and territory. It assumes the map has been lost, or drawn with malevolent purpose, and the territory is a place where you are about to die. 4.I Used to Hate the Water NOT EVERYONE in the United States wanted to turn the American myth into a slaughterhouse on a Texas homestead, or a California one. By the summer of 1975, another film seduced an even wider audience. The American public showed its Janus face by turning out in droves for a summer fairy tale with a monster in it, even as catching a midnight showing of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre remained a whispered dare, teenagers and adults watching with guilt and delight. Jaws came to swallow the entertainment industry whole. At a moment in the history of Hollywood and the United States when the national success story seemed to have ended with screams and the ear-splitting sound of a chain saw, the blockbuster, for the first time, became a perennial part of summer. The term referred to a film so popular, and so mainstream, that hopeful viewers lined up around whole city blocks waiting for their tickets. Steven Spielberg started the trend of Hollywood making an endless summer of high-concept films that sold tickets, tubs of popcorn, and colas by the tens of millions. Spielberg came of age with Tobe Hooper but took a different set of lessons from both film school and the America of the fifties and sixties. It’s impossible to imagine the young, thin enfant terrible saying his blockbuster Jaws was a movie about America, even though it inadvertently shows an even more frightening side of the country’s shadowy self than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It’s a story of American innocence and ability to triumph, a bloody companion piece to his friend and sometime collaborator George Lucas’s American Graffiti (1973). Huge crowds loved Jaws and shoveled 260 million dollars into ticket booths during a recession (1.2 billion in current dollars). No film had ever performed like this before, both at the box office and in a new world of movie merchandizing with iron-on Jaws T-shirts, books, and even a board game. Spielberg conjured an alternative vision of reality to Hooper’s dark Massacre. Awash in vivid blues, Jaws combined horrific death with a hopeful message about a can-do America. Anecdotes tell of American audiences breaking out in a home-team-scores-a-touchdown cheer as the monster goes KABLOW! after a million-to-one shot from Roy Scheider’s rifle to an oxygen tank the shark has ingested. In the final scene, Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss have blown the shark to bits and swim off into a sunset on a makeshift raft, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer of the seventies. Everybody is safe. Amity Island, the focus of the creature’s attacks, seems more like a mild, quiet suburb than an island facing off with a monster. Before the giant shark comes along, the biggest worries are kids “karate chopping picket fences.” It’s more than a geographical island—it’s an island out of time, America’s dream of itself in the fifties, a place where you’d never know Vietnam or Watergate ever happened. Everyone is inexorably middle class and happy until the shark shows up to ruin it. But then our heroes kill it and America can go on dreaming the dream of itself. Chain Saw and Jaws, appearing at the same cultural turn, are the twin poles of American imagination at a crucial moment in the country’s history. Jaws offered a nightmare, but one met on the way to a dream come true. It’s a film manifesto for an America where men with square jaws destroy monsters. It’s not Tobe Hooper’s warning about the monsters hatched from the dragon’s teeth America sowed in its own soil, about what had been and about what was coming, what was coming for all of us. Who could go watch Jaws and cheer while the country faced defeat, economic decline, and maleficence at the highest level of government? Didn’t Hooper’s dark vision make more sense? A film like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre becoming so intensely popular needs no explanation; it suited the times. But the sun-drenched seascapes of Amity Island are straight out of a fifties creature feature, and they promised escape from very real fears. How could such different films become so popular in the same country? To understand this is to understand the nature of the American empire and its citizens’ profound lack of interest in confronting that reality. It’s different from every imperial power that’s come before it. It pretends not to exist. It’s willing to use lethal violence or to celebrate it uproariously, and then to forget it, to imagine its consequences are less important than they are. The public goes along—except when they suddenly don’t—but then reveal once more their genius for moderation, simplistic thinking, and unwillingness to face the truths of the world that gives them the iPhone and The Bachelor, golf carts and local breweries, Whole Foods selling you fresh fruits out of season and delivery services that bring an insane variety of goods—unimaginable bounties for 99.9 percent of humans who have ever lived—to your door within hours. The horror emerges and then subsides, the corpse appears only to vanish, the past surfaces and then gets a premature burial, the shark attacks but a hero blows it to chum. America, and Americans, lighted on an innovative way of being imperial. We see this in our horror fictions and we find it in the difficulty many Americans exhibit, especially those who thrive most within its system, of even thinking of their country as an empire. The hard truths remain waiting, even when ignored. The story of empire traces its way down the centuries, leaving eerie glyphs not always easy to decipher. The facts never have the tensile strength of memory’s fiber-optic cable. We tell our stories to distort the real story. Although this book explores horror and the empire’s influence on the present cultural moment, it also questions what we think we know about the deeper past. It puts the idea that we are the white hats under a hot light in a dark room. It asks whether we are telling the truth when we look at some atrocity and say, “this is not who we are.” Once, the chain saw and the shark tried to make a movie together. Poltergeist (1982) joined the murderer’s row of classic horror films. It took a switchback path to production, creating confusion about who exactly shaped the film, Spielberg the producer or Hooper the director. The confusion at one point became a legal dispute, and it was not only fans who took sides. The Directors Guild of America ultimately awarded Hooper a cash settlement and accused Spielberg and MGM of downplaying the indie horror director’s role while celebrating the film as another triumph by the maestro of the mainstream. Apparently, Poltergeist had its beginning, sort of, when Spielberg wrote a script called Watch the Skies. When Hooper came on as director, he scrapped the plot that catered to the renaissance of alien obsessions from the fifties that dominated the seventies. Hooper worked since the release of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre on a film about the supernatural and the secret history of the suburbs, and that’s largely the film he made. Poltergeist follows the Freeling family into a home built in a “planned community,” an old idea but a much more common phrase in the 1980s. It’s the quintessential American no-place, an LA suburb called Cuesta Verde, following Californian and Floridian real estate in its habit of taking banal phrases and making them “exotic” by translating them into Spanish. The sprawl is advertised as “where dreams comes true.” In a Hooper film we need no further warning that this is nightmare country. Cuesta Verde incarnates apex Southern California just as Southern California acts as avatar for apex America. The fictional neighborhood could be Chula Vista in its infancy or anywhere in Orange County. Hooper set his night terror in the middle of what poet and essayist Alice Bolin called “the insanity of LA’s epically unsustainable urban development” with the unspeakable secret being that “it was all on purpose.” She’s commenting on Joan Didion’s 1990 observation that LA embodied “a new kind of city, one that would seem to have no finite limits, a literal cloud on the land.” Didion and Bolin could be describing the whole of U.S. history. A booming sprawl of an empire never contained by borders, each crucial, misguided step in its manifest destiny fully planned and mysteriously financed, with Americans ever after squinting at the spiraling chaos and asking how we got here. Hooper embraced that chaos, and we are in his dark dream of America, despite the widespread belief that Spielberg took the reins from his director. It’s evident Spielberg’s enthusiasms are there. It is truly very frightening, and yet you can tell Hooper pulls his punches. The spookiness is decidedly PG. Spielberg did create, by Hooper’s own account, a pointless sequence involving a child and an astral journey to the afterlife that bloated the film by twenty minutes. He possibly held the idea that she would end the haunting in a cloudbank of “and a little child shall lead them” schmaltz—a trope that is to Spielberg as inscrutable as endangered blonde women are to Hitchcock. But Hooper brought the chain saw to mainstream audiences. He happily included political commentary, showing boomers with a hippie, or at least a doobie-filled, past that are really starting to dig Reagan. This is distinctly un-Spielbergian, as he made sure to erase any references to current American politics, and drug use, from Peter Benchley’s script for Jaws. The closest we get to politics in the war on the Great White is the vague suggestion that small-town mayors in bad ties are often insouciant. More importantly, Hooper did what Spielberg never would; he placed the horror in the cold guts of the American home. In the Spielberg-verse, the inhuman never threatens the security of American domestic spaces in films, never making it beyond the shoreline. The uncanny comes as space brethren, poorly disguised Christ figures, ETs, and close encounters. They are either cuddly friends or quite literally messianic messengers who’ll soon have you joyously sculpting your mashed potatoes and then going to live with them in the mothership. Hooper’s vision is far bleaker. The dénouement is pure chain saw, in fact recalling the opening frames of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This time it’s not the sandy loam of Texas that regurgitates its dead. It’s the family swimming pool. The whole Freeling family runs screaming from their home in the night while an eldritch portal pulls their house into Hades and part of the planned development where dreams come true goes down into the dark. We will enter that darkness. The phantoms of a thousand Native American massacres are roused throughout this book. The roots of America’s wars are about what happened in 1965 or 2001, but also in 1918, 1898, and before. Beware how the roots of history clutch and call us back to a past as criminally deranged as the present. Empire’s shadow even blankets the golden haze of World War II, that supposed “good war.” It’s all a story about America, the chain saw, and the shark. 5.Built on Top of a What?? THE ROOTS of American power, memory, and historical amnesia are deep, reaching back through the centuries when a handful of violent settler societies with their minds set on commerce seized lands belonging to the Pequot, the Yamasee, and the Powhatan, some of the earliest Native American peoples destroyed in conflict with colonies in New England, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Clinging to a narrow band of colonial outposts from Georgia to Massachusetts, white settlers began the slow and steady conquest of a continent, killing Indians, felling trees, slaughtering animals, and fencing open land in a “new world” that previously held no concept of private property. By contrast, the Europeans developed a concept of property so expansive as to include human beings. The enslavement of African people in Virginia began early in the seventeenth century, more than 150 years before the American Revolution. Colonies like the Carolina settlement included the right to own African people in their charters. Early in colonial America, some poor whites worked without wages as indentured servants. The practice died out, however, and indentured servants eventually earned their freedom. Colonial law regarded African men and women as chattel, literally “movable property” like a cow or a wagon. White supremacy became more than a domestic institution. Racism played the central role in the creation of the American empire. Its shadows whisper all around us in the present, a nightmare from which the world has never roused. Horror films have dealt with the memory of America’s imperial beginnings by turning to the trope of the haunted Indian burial ground, a notion so well-worn that it has acquired the acronym IBG. The Amityville Horror (1979), The Shining (1980), Pet Sematary (1989), and the Poltergeist series (1982–1999) all deal in various ways with the idea that, as the famous line from Pet Sematary has it, “the sour ground” became a place of darkness because of its history. Both Colin Dickey and Shea Vassar describe how, somewhere at the edge of white awareness, there lurks the realization that American capital built an empire on the remains of the dead. The idea has become so deeply imbricated into American culture that in Poltergeist (1982), the unlucky Freelings seek reassurance that their extraordinarily haunted house is not built on an Indian burial ground. Even The Onion hasn’t been able to leave the idea alone, in 2011 using the darkly funny headline “Report: Economy Failing Because U.S. Built on Ancient Indian Burial Grounds.” Empire’s beginnings are soaked in blood, in genocide. Many know about the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, in part because of the American Indian Movement’s (AIM) insistence that the country face it in 1973. Few know that hundreds of massacres resulting in tens of thousands of deaths (and often the enslavement of survivors) occurred from the period of earliest settlement. English settlers murdered and enslaved Powhatan people in a 1609 war of extermination. In 1704, for example, Governor James Moore of the Carolina colony marched a volunteer militia all the way to northern Florida to slaughter one thousand Apalachee people and enslave two thousand more. This was one of dozens of such incidents that occurred before the American Revolution and the beginning of expansion across the continent. Frontier mercenaries known as “rangers,” early America’s version of “civilian contractors,” slaughtered the Cherokee in Georgia and East Tennessee and did the same to the Shawnee of the Ohio Valley. Several early presidential administrations (often cliques of land speculators who stood to make fortunes as the settlers moved west) gave themselves “plausible deniability” about some of the worst atrocities. In the seventy years after the United States became a nation, almost continuous warfare carved out a continental empire, killing hundreds of thousands of Native peoples and turning those who survived into colonial subjects penned in apartheid-style homelands. Massive fortunes accrued to white elites, and plantation slavery spread southwest. The psychopathic violence of counterinsurgency masterminds like Andrew Jackson made political careers. Jackson prepared himself for the presidency by ruthlessly destroying the Red Stick rebellion in the spring of 1814, a group of guerrilla fighters who received their nom de guerre from their crimson spears. In what is now northern Alabama, the so-called Battle of Horseshoe Bend made way for the creation of the states of Alabama and Mississippi, both slaveholding strongholds. This battle amounted to nothing more than a massacre of eight hundred Muskogee, Shawnee, and African insurgents who fought as “red sticks.” Like the décor fashioned from human skin, and the mask of Leatherface himself in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Jackson’s troops stitched saddles and horse bridles from the skin of their enemies and delivered scalps of fighters, of children, of old men, as souvenirs for “the women of Tennessee.”11 In the next century, because of the American empire’s overwhelming preponderance of military power, the United States and the world wandered through the dark carnival. Wars of extermination on the empire’s frontier were only the beginning. The human catastrophe the history textbooks file under “westward expansion” served only as precursor for the global violence of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 6.Horrors, Foreign and Domestic HARRY TRUMAN seemed to have a fine time of it when he served as an artillery officer in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. His letters home to Bess Truman are a peculiar cocktail of saccharine sentiment, blockheaded observations, and sheer bloodlust. Amid sweet nothings, he casually mentioned his pleasure at helping to lob “1,800 shells at the Huns.” All in all, Truman declared World War I a “terrific experience,” a sentiment only a young American of below-average intelligence could hold in 1917–1918. He did regret, as he said in one of his idiosyncratic love letters, that the warring powers signed the armistice when they did. The peace that settled on the blood lands of the western front on November 11, 1918, meant Truman would miss out on the chance to “detonate Germany and cut off a few of the Dutch [common slang for German] kids’ hands and feet and scalp a few of their old men but I guess it will be better to make them work for France and Belgium for fifty years.”12 Truman wore the uniform of a country about to become the next great power. The American home front suffered nothing in comparison to every other major participant in the global war, really almost nothing on its own terms. However, American combat troops suffered horrific casualties, especially given the short period the AEF engaged the German army: 116,000 dead and 266,000 wounded, a number that does not include the hundreds of thousands the war traumatized mentally. American culture simply did not respond to the cataclysm of the war the way much of the rest of the world did. While France, Britain, and Germany built cyclopean ossuaries to hold the mangled dead (Menin Gate, Douaumont, Tannenberg), statues of cheerful and brave doughboys littered America. In fact, even when it came to recalling the broad-gauge murder of the World War I, the business of America was business. E. M. Viquesney, originally of Spencer, Indiana, proved equal parts talented sculptor and virtuoso advertising shill with his The Spirit of the American Doughboy. In 1921 he sculpted a monument of America’s soldiers of the Great War that presented one of them emerging onto an imagined battlefield, the statue’s hollowed-out limbs made of cheap sheet bronze advancing toward an unseen enemy, right arm raised and left arm holding a Springfield rifle. Viquesney mass-produced the image, and city halls and civic groups across the country purchased the adventuresome-looking sculpture to place in front of courthouses, on major thoroughfares, in front of Veterans of Foreign Wars or American Legion halls, and on college campuses. In fact, the first appeared on the campus of Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, where it aged poorly in weather, nearly forgotten for a century. Finally, its shoddy condition caused enough embarrassment that the college replaced it.13 The emerging American consumer economy of the 1920s allowed individuals to break off a piece of Great War memory and take it home with them. Along with monuments for purchase by civic groups, Viquesney manufactured twelve-inch miniature figures of the statue and even a version of the statue in which the doughboy’s triumphantly extended right arm held . . . a light bulb. Advertising copy for this desktop ode to the American fighting man promised the piece would serve to memorialize “the intrepid Doughboy’s part in raising the hope-inspiring light of democracy for a world in darkness.” You could select a shade in “decorated parchment” or “elaborate silk.” There was no need to worry if you, like so many Americans in the twenties, found yourself low on cash but high on patriotism. You could buy on credit. The ad, in full caps, offered the unintentionally chilling phrase, “WE FINANCE YOU.”14 Viquesney never became immensely wealthy from The Spirit of the American Doughboy, but he made enough—partially from investment in local projects in Indiana—that he weathered the crash of ’29 with panache. But despite his promise that the spirit of the doughboy carried “a hope-inspiring light,” he himself suffered from depression exacerbated by personal loss and poor health. He asphyxiated himself in his garage in the autumn of 1946. The Spirit of the American Doughboy kept marching without his maker. In fact, he’s marching on a hundred years later. Since 1918, when, as is sometimes said, the British Empire won a war through suffering a horrific defeat, the island nation slowly began to lose the world it built for itself. America inherited that world and its problems but came up with new solutions . . . insidious solutions. But first, the muscular nation needed to secure the home front. Too many of America’s own citizens, including those denied the basic rights of citizenship, would not get with the program of shifting from an erstwhile republic into an economic and military empire. So the bleak world the United States built after the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 not only wreaked havoc around the globe. Americans, the working class, people of color, any dissenters, all suffered as their nation-state became a global leviathan. The foot soldiers of the new empire suffered first. While Viquesney made them archetypes in bronze, actual veterans returned home in 1919 with no economic prospects, having served a government unwilling to provide aid. World War I veterans anticipated what had popularly become known as a bonus payment from the government. The bonus, in the past paid in land as well as money, represented an imagined difference between what the soldier could earn at home as opposed to the pittance made as doughboys. For many, it embodied a kind of social covenant and a safety net that aided veterans after the economic disruption of military service.15 President Calvin Coolidge dismissively referred to the idea of the bonus as “patriotism which is bought and paid for,” though Congress overrode his veto and granted more than three million bonus certificates to veterans that they could redeem over time or borrow against. After the beginning of the Great Depression in ’29, President Herbert Hoover effectively rescinded this plan. Unemployed and deeply embittered, twenty-five thousand veterans marched on Washington with over ten thousand men and their families setting up Hooverville in Anacostia Flat, a muddy river bottom of the Potomac. The Senate declined to pass a bill paying out the bonus, and Hoover sent regular army troops, tanks, and machine guns to clear the tent city. The aggressive move resulted in one hundred injuries and wounds. Some veterans attempted to set up camp again, and this time Washington police fired on them, killing William Hushka and Eric Carlson. Both are buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Much-reduced bonus payments would eventually come in 1936. Some former doughboys took the route of many European Great War veterans and became the muscle for the new right-wing nationalisms that flourished like a sward of noxious weeds in the twenties. The boys back from France, especially those associated with the wealthier, upper-middle-class leadership of the American Legion, followed the lead of Mussolini’s veteran “Blackshirts” in seeking to stamp out even the hint of homegrown socialism. The head of the American Legion praised Mussolini’s war on “Bolshevism.”16 Admiration for Il Duce sometimes led to directly copying the violence of the Italian fasci. Such mob violence certainly did not limit itself to horror film screenings. On the first anniversary of the armistice in 1919, members of the American Legion attacked a hall belonging to the Centralia, Washington, branch of the International Workers of the World (the IWW, better known as Wobblies). Members of the organization, already harassed by local authorities and the public mobs who often worked with them, had the temerity to fight back. In the running gunfight that followed, ranging all over the streets of Centralia, they killed four legionnaires.17 Centralia authorities, aided by a posse, arrested eleven of the Wobblies. On November 12, members of the Legion cut the town’s power lines and used the thick darkness to break into Centralia’s jail and seize one of the imprisoned IWW members, Wesley Everest, himself a Great War veteran. The lynch mob murdered him in an especially ghastly fashion, then let his corpse lie on the river bottom overnight. Everest’s killers retrieved the corpse the next day, dropping it like a rag doll on the floor of the local jail, a rope still around its neck. Everest had become an IWW member soon after the war. Like many of his comrades, he returned home to a sluggish labor market at a time when a small number had made enormous fortunes, including some whose businesses had boomed because of the war. Furious at how the lumber barons reduced his fellow workers to penury and a nomadic, essentially homeless existence, he came to believe deeply in the IWW radical program to dismantle capitalism in America. His murder offered a lethal response from the freebooting barons of American industry. The country’s economic power brokers faced down open and violent dissent before. During the railroad, coal, and steel phase of the industrial revolution, the nation’s ruling class made use of brutal paramilitary contractors like the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, the recently reformed National Guard, and even the U.S. Army itself to break strikes, hunt down labor leaders, and respond with lethal force against striking workers. States deployed the National Guard one hundred times between 1886 and 1893 alone. A few months before the Great War began in 1914, National Guard troops and a private paramilitary force deployed by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (part of the Rockefeller empire) machine-gunned and burned to death whole families of striking workers who lived in a tent city raised outside the company-owned town of Ludlow.18 The American empire abroad thrived in a bloody permaculture fertilized at home. The idea that America is a democracy and not an empire simply doesn’t square with the facts. Denial of the right to vote has been a continuing theme in American history. Disenfranchisement of African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and even the white working class has been a political reality backed by violence. Individual states in the Cold War passed laws restricting the rights of Americans who joined “communist-front” organizations and then created their own blacklists. Meanwhile, even before the digital age, the national security state practiced counterinsurgency at home as well as abroad. Since a 1978 law that allowed the FBI to continue spying on American citizens, the bureau asked for thirteen thousand warrants with only one ever denied.19 The Great War triggered the repressive power of government and corporate interests to coalesce. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the slightest peep out of dissenting political groups often led to power brokers responding with the bludgeon of a mailed fist. Seattle experienced a general strike in February of 1919, though one in which workers made exceedingly minor demands. The mayor received the aid of the U.S. Marine Corps to squash the effort. In the fall, police in Boston went on strike with the simple demand that city government allow them to join the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a moderate and arguably even conservative labor organization. Public officials around the country used terms like agents of Lenin and Bolshevik nightmare to describe their action. The threat of an intervention by the army again crushed the strike.20 Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer’s raids against suspected radicals are well known. The incidents of mob violence and local repression that accompanied them have not become a part of American memory. A Connecticut salesman spent six months in prison for praising Lenin’s intelligence. An Indiana jury acquitted a man for killing an immigrant who had said “to hell with the United States” a bit loudly and in public. The rule on Amity Island has always been to never bring up the shark, especially on the Fourth of July.21 Official acts of repression also unleashed lynch mobs against African American communities and individuals. The fear of political subversion made a poison alliance with white supremacy. The violence visited on sharecroppers in Alabama and Arkansas who attempted to unionize provides an example. But, with savage irony, mobs also targeted Black communities if they became cradles of small-scale capitalism, havens for an emerging Black middle class behind what W. E. B. Du Bois called “the veil” of Jim Crow. The pogrom against the “Black Wall Street” of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 has become the best known of such incidents. However, white supremacist violence erupted against African Americans in Washington, D.C., as early as the summer of 1919, some of it directed specifically against Black veterans of the Great War. Outside of these large-scale assaults, seventy-eight Black men died at the hands of lynch mobs in 1919, many of them burned alive in public rituals, enacted amid a carnival atmosphere.22 Leaders of heavy industry and finance could afford to act with near impunity against working-class Americans. The United States had been a debtor nation in 1914, but most of the world found itself indentured to the nation by war’s end in 1918. By 1929, Great Britain owed the United States an amount equivalent to one half their national income. Much has been made of the effect of the payment of war reparations by Germany, though the practice had long been a part of European peace settlements. The real story concerns how the United States saw the payment of German marks to Britain and France as crucial to maintaining a credit squeeze on their allies, keeping much of Europe servicing a mortgaged war. One financial writer for The Boston Journal made this plain, crowing triumphantly that, “Europeans must pay tribute for years to come.”23 So emerged the roaring twenties, a state of mind rather than a historical era. Some of the myths of the twenties actually happened. A nation of Gatsbys held parties for the extravagantly wealthy, and bathtub gin, jazz, and short skirts gilded life with glamour even for some of the plebeians. Millionaires became multi-millionaires. Many Americans who bought into the decade’s optimism looked askance at socialists and even organized labor. They believed that captains of industry wrangled their impossible wealth on the frontier of America’s Wild West economy through sheer force of will. Moreover, in this world of new American possibility, they themselves might own at least a small strip of beachfront on Amity Island one day . . . at least a little cottage with oceanfront access so they could go back into the water. By 1929, the entanglement of American money with the international debtor economy led the country into crisis. The shark had started feeding. America coughing caused the rest of the world to die of pneumonia in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. But in truth what historian Eric Hobsbawm describes as the “house of cards” created by the first (but not the last) American effort to shape the world economy had come crashing down.24 7.Weird Mystery Tales THE GREAT Depression represented a crisis for American capitalism and also suggested a crisis of confidence. Left-wing organizations, including a public and popular Communist Party of the United States of America, drew one hundred thousand new members and made allies in labor unions and left-leaning organizations. Many Americans wanted change in the thirties, a period that has become known as the country’s Red Decade. And yet, optimistic images of the American spirit like the unfortunate Viquesney public square monuments and parlor room tchotchkes reveal that much of the nation saw itself as a kind of Amity Island fifty-five years before Steven Spielberg’s Jaws (1975) gave the image to the world. In the minds of many middle-class white Americans, their towns and cities functioned like privately owned resorts, and the country itself could forget that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it had been a battleground of many nations, some European and others native to the continent. Politicians, who represented the interests of the wealthiest Americans and the class that aspired to be like them, could even speak of “isolationism,” a country able to hide behind its two walls of water after having done its part in a world war. Isolationism has largely been a myth that really means “the United States will make unilateral decisions rather than forming meaningful alliances.” During the era isolationism supposedly shaped American standards of international behavior, the country launched incursions into Mexico, occupied two Caribbean nations, toppled the government of Nicaragua, and seized major islands in the Pacific and dozens of small islands for what was rapidly becoming the American tradition of building multiple military bases in every region of the globe. The pretense of isolation extended to culture as well. European veterans scripted, produced, directed, and acted in what would become the first silent horror films, but Americans eschewed the emerging genre. When Variety reviewed Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the entertainment magazine tried to interest American audiences by calling it “a mystery story told in the Poe manner,” though it also warned them “it is morbid.” A much stronger, indeed violent, reaction to the film appeared in the streets of Los Angeles when Miller’s Theatre attempted to premier it in May of 1921. A two-thousand-person-strong protest, ginned up by William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers, prevented the film from being shown. Moving Picture World, a bubblegum guide for movie fans, wrote Caligari off as more evidence of “degenerate German invention.”25 Lingering anti-German sentiment left over from the Great War explains some of the negative responses to a motion picture that would play an important role in reimagining what a film could do, what it could be about, and how it could call forth new emotions. But something even more pungent, part of the bone and marrow of belief in a particular kind of America, called forth these violent responses. Most Americans did not like horror, or more accurately they thought it had nothing but ill intent. In fact, Americans seldom to never used the word horror as an adjective for films, fiction, stage plays, carnival shows, or other entertainment outlets. The use of the word weird in describing most any storytelling that departed from formulaic American flicks featuring action, romance, and comedy (often all at once) predated the Great War. Reviewers often described turn-of-the-century magic shows, especially those that encouraged audiences to view their illusions as the supernatural creeping across the boundaries of the rational, as weird. Any film that suggested mystery, supernatural or not, received the label weird. Early film magazines regularly described the weirdness of comedies that featured humorous ghosts, even when they turned out to be dreams or a kind of Scooby-Doo experience of a human pretending to be a visitant from beyond. The cinema scholar who has written the most about how Americans received and reviewed “weird” films, Kendall R. Phillips, sees a peculiar turn in attitudes toward them. By the time of the Great War, reviewers for magazines like Variety had begun to connect spooky topics on screen with “foreign” productions that are also described as “ghastly” or pretentious. The term weird went, Phillips writes, from being a general term for tales of the fantastic “to connoting films that were decidedly foreign and, ultimately, un-American.”26 Americans wanted their entertainment to let them visit an Amity Island without the shark. Threats to the beautiful heroes of cinema had to be of the criminal, often inept, variety in the 1910s and early ’20s. Americans raised monuments to the happy warriors their doughboys had supposedly been or used the image as peculiar reading lamps or parlor lighting, as the ads for the patriotic saint statues said, “in a world of darkness.” But as they did, large numbers of actual veterans fared poorly in the postwar years, a fact that helps us understand the otherwise inexplicable rage Hearst could stir over the showing of a somewhat challenging German art film that Americans hadn’t exactly clamored to see in the first place. 8.Empire’s Butcher Bill THE SECOND World War accelerated the options opened to the new world power as the United States took control of military bases all over the world. Bases leased from Britain in exchange for U.S. arms marked a kind of formal changing of the imperial guard, the last wheezing gasp of “Rule, Britannia!” An aggressive American foreign policy created flash points of conflict with the Soviet Union that provided numerous opportunities for the United States to extend its reach. Japan and islands seized from it like Okinawa gave the United States far-flung ports of call. West Germany hosted hundreds of U.S. bases during most of the Cold War. But this wasn’t enough and so, sometimes, the United States just took what it wanted without apology. In 1953, the United States seized a sizable chunk of Indigenous lands in Greenland, giving its inhabitants only a brief deadline before the U.S. Army bulldozed their communities. This became a forward base for America’s nuclear triad and is the root of one of the Trump administration’s frequent non sequiturs, a briefly touted plan to “buy Greenland.” The small-footprint empire that the national security state thought it had made had at least as much, perhaps more, destructive effects on the world than earlier powers. The large land and naval empires of the past ruled oppressively but, in cases like Austria-Hungary or the Ottomans, they also held in check and even salved conflicts between the peoples within their borders for hundreds of years. American hegemony had the opposite effect, ginning up older conflicts and even creating new ones. Since 9/11, the contours of the American empire have become increasingly clear. Ironically, President George W. Bush—until 2016 perhaps the chief executive most ill-informed about American foreign policy and one who surrounded himself with a coterie of operatives with decades of secrets to keep—spoke most openly and forthrightly about American imperial imperatives. In September of 2002, what became known as the Bush Doctrine called for preemptive strikes against any nation, at any time, in order to make possible “free and open societies.” It also, for the first time in American history, declared that the United States would not allow any nation to challenge its military preeminence as had the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Karl Rove, often referred to as “Bush’s brain,” announced matter-of-factly that “we’re an empire now . . . we’re history’s actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” An openness about the expansive use of American power continued, transmogrifying under the Trump regime into weaponized tweets that advertised threats, insults, ambitions, and sometimes even explicit initiatives—empire gone viral. The immense popularity of horror, and the violence horror revels in, restages the horror of empire’s reach for screaming audiences and chilled readers, who can’t take their eyes off the mayhem on screen and page. It’s the nature of living in an empire. Life in the empire means, above all, experiencing violence as a way of life. The shape this takes depends very much on whether you are a citizen, a citizen with limited constitutional and cultural protections, or a subject with no rights that the unimaginable colossus of American power sees itself bound to protect. But whether you are part of a wedding party slaughtered by a U.S. drone attack in Yemen or a bored middle-class dad in Kansas flipping between news channels featuring stories about school shootings and footage of explosions in places you couldn’t locate on a map, lethal threat and force are the coin of the imperial realm.27 So it has ever been with empires. The Assyrians of the ancient Near East welcomed you to their cities with monuments made of the skulls of their enemies, stele that celebrated the destruction of whole civilizations and their peoples. The Roman Empire brought its captive opponents in chains to parade them through the streets of their capital. Even Victorian Britain featured carnivals and freak shows that displayed the subjects of the empire as primitive, exotic, and defeated. The British Museum became a warehouse of objects ripped from the hands of colonized peoples. We have horror. It speaks our language of violence and conquest, sometimes to alarm us and sometimes to tell us that daddy vanquished the monster under the bed. Multiple Hugo Award–winner N. K. Jemisin’s now classic The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms featured a scene where the protagonist confronts the way the imperial power that runs her world legitimizes itself through lies, half-truths, and the general assumption of superiority. “They found so many ways to lie about the things they did,” she thinks. “It mocked the suffering of their victims.” It’s become very easy for us to lie about the things we do and to mock our victims’ suffering. Since Rove admitted the United States not only built an empire but could rearrange how the public conceives of reality, few Americans have been aware of the drone strikes that have killed civilians at weddings, at funerals, and in civilian refugee convoys. Living as a citizen of the empire means never having to think about it. Meanwhile, living as a subject, or victim, of the empire means never being able to forget it. Horror films are one of the few places the nature, the violence, and the failure of American power blinks in the unearthly light of the present, a blighted, ugly fog where you can find yourself wandering in a past they didn’t teach you about in school or looking into the abyss of a lost future. In Puerto Rico, you are ignored and disenfranchised with no voice to speak with and no vote to cast after being hit by a catastrophic Category 5 storm like 2017’s Hurricane Maria. In Sudan, your family grocery explodes after a drone strike, killing your brother and his wife because a “person of interest” who may or may not have been associated with Al-Qaeda or ISIS lived a block away. If you are an eighteen-year-old Marine Recon recruit between 2003 and 2021, you hump your way through a desert toward mountains likely hived with caves of Taliban fighters. You are about to become a casualty of a war that started before you were born. Privileged America doesn’t understand all the ways reality differs from their experience of it. There is a shadow moving at the edge of our consciousness, and the maestros of our dreams remind us it waits there. 9.The Thing on the Stairs “AS SOON as I looked up, there it was, and it was horrible.” Ray Bradbury, a little kid in the twenties, experienced waking nightmares of a monster balefully watching him from the top of the stairs. He remembered how the shadowed presence waited for him nearly every night. He would scream, sometimes fall backward onto the floor at the ghastly presence. He could recall, nearly ninety years later, his parents sighing and saying, “Oh my God, here we go again.”28 If a monster haunted the stairwell, a peculiar combination of rockets and dinosaurs filled his dreams with wonder. At the age of five, Bradbury thrilled to The Lost World, a 1925 film based on a novel by Arthur Conan Doyle that imagined explorers finding a land of dinosaurs in a remote part of the Amazon basin. He soon devoured Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. In his teens, he befriended the future genius of stop-motion animation Ray Harryhausen when both joined the Los Angeles chapter of the Science Fiction League. The boys had been enchanted by King Kong (1933), a film both friends claimed they saw hundreds of times. A love and terror of the primal, prehistoric beasts and behemoths from out of time lived in the same heart as an obsession with the future. It was one of the many paradoxes in the life of Bradbury that the man who wrote The Martian Chronicles and predicted everything from earbuds to artificial intelligence hated the internet, refused to type on a computer, did not want any of his work released in electronic format, and never learned to drive. And yet, he has inspired several generations with a dream of the stars. NASA gave the touchdown site of the Mars rover Curiosity the name Bradbury Landing when, on what would have been his ninety-second birthday, it settled into the waterless volcano-born regolith of the red planet.29 As a young teen, Bradbury found relief from his monsters by writing a short story a week in the basement of the UCLA library. Having discovered he could rent a typewriter for ten cents, his fingers began clattering away. Only death chilled them to a halt in 2012. Science fiction and horror are siblings, twins who have always tried and failed to cut a different figure from one another in the world. Dreams of the stars never really banished the terror of Bradbury’s monsters, and some of his anxieties remained decidedly earthbound. While he watched American society descend into political conformity in the 1950s, he wrote Fahrenheit 451 about a not-so-unbelievable near future where the “firemen” burn books because of the danger they present to the social order. Bradbury’s first short story collection, Dark Carnival, appeared in 1947 from Arkham House, a press first created for the sole purpose of publishing the short fiction of H. P. Lovecraft. The stories, many of them later republished in his 1955 The October Country, deal with how a skeleton might decide it could get along without its fleshier parts, how death might play the gentleman caller, and the kinds of things that live in the deep places of the earth. They are his monster at the top of the stairs. He went back to this nightmare land in the 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes, a book he originally called (again) Dark Carnival. Probably known to most for the Disney film adaptation, it’s arguably the best novel of Bradbury’s incredibly prolific career. In it, Cooger and Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to a small town, appearing in the middle of the night. The lights of the carnival draw the townspeople, all dissatisfied with their lives, into halls of mirrors, dark rides, the carnival clown’s uncomfortable laughter, and the call of the barker that offers wonder, mysteries, and something new, something different, if ultimately something as wicked as the title suggests. The small town as the setting for something dark to emerge has haunted the American imagination over the last century. It’s the little California village of Santa Mira where the pod people descend, a place where everyone knows everyone and there’s just the one local doctor in the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In 1960, Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone offered “A Stop at Willoughby,” the story of an anxiety-ridden businessman given the chance at a new life in a little burg. The viewer learns of the true horror of such seemingly anodyne hopes when the dream ends, and we face a more believable bleakness. Tobe Hooper imagined a lethal carnival coming to a little Florida town in The Funhouse (1981), a place where Mom and Dad tranquilly watch Bride of Frankenstein at home while a maniac dons a rubber mask of Boris Karloff’s monster and slaughters their kids in the ultimate haunted ride. In 1984, the nightmare comes to quiet Elm Street when Freddy Krueger extends his serrated glove in murderous rage, or maybe, the film asks us, it already lived in the hearts of the parents and their very eighties fear of the ill-kempt stranger. Stephen King’s Derry, Maine, was a little hamlet of human-made horrors before terrifying transdimensional clowns began croaking out of storm drains in the novel It, the 1990 TV limited series, and the more recent blockbuster films. Simple, staid, and very white America. When the sinister carnival comes, all the fairy tales that have poisoned us come alive and show their teeth. But even then, we’d rather believe the monsters are out there, and not in here with us. Even the most paranoid of Americans have found a way to tell themselves horror stories that are ultimately comforting. 10.The Greenbaum Effect THE WAY of the shark, the story of an innocent America fighting an outside threat, ultimately wants you to believe everything is just fine. Because of the nature of American exceptionalism, and because of the structures of imperial control that hardwire how Americans experience reality, some aspects of horror culture assure the watcher that everything’s okay and, in fact, really, really nice. Horror’s nightmares have not escaped the American dream of consumption and domination. One response to the confrontation with a reality in which “the worst thing is true” has been to amass stockpiles of weapons, suppress Black and Brown Americans, and attempt to exclude, colonize, and even exterminate perceived foreign threats. Don’t worry about the thing on the stairs. If you don’t want to be “woke,” it’s terribly cozy to sleep on peacefully while vast tracts of American horror culture allow you to float in Amity’s warm and woozy dream. But you can hear the chain saw’s death rattle in your dreams. Horror has also whispered about things we did not want to know, would prefer not to hear, about American history. These are stories that, while well-documented, you likely have either not heard of or, if you did, sounded like odd anecdotes. In some cases, you may think some of what you’ll read about can be dismissed as conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories are, like horror, tales of how the worst thing you imagine is true. “You think things are bad? Well, let me tell you, buddy, you don’t know the half of it.” Most readers likely view the conspiracy theorist as someone engaged in a granular drilling into obscure facts helped along by untreated mental illness who then freely dispenses the false information they have cobbled together. The idea of conspiracy has a complicated history, much too complex to relate here. Historians and cultural critics have sometimes viewed the American people as peculiarly vulnerable to false conspiracies. The American colonies premised their war for independence on the idea of a “conspiracy against the rights of Englishmen” among the king’s coterie of advisors. The country’s first partisan election in 1800 found John Adams supporters claiming Thomas Jefferson to be a member of the Illuminati who would confiscate Americans’ Bibles. In the midst of America’s post–World War II red scare, with many Americans certain Bolsheviks hid under their beds, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote his essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics” for Harper’s Magazine. Hofstadter claimed that a “paranoid style” of political rhetoric had been part of the American experience since the early national era and that it infected people across the political spectrum. In the 1950s, it just so happened that the American right had begun to suffer, “afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us,” but also by their “fantasies” about how the world works.30 The way Americans use conspiracy is, of course, not just a matter of the past. Tom Engelhardt wrote in 2015 that white Americans believe themselves the victims of various dark conspiracies by terrorists, even as they enjoy the protection of the most formidable arsenal of conventional and unconventional weapons in history. He notes that at a Trump rally in New Hampshire, audience members told horror stories about “‘training camps’ for terrorists” and a “new holocaust” taking place right there in New England with people “loaded into boxcars” and assassinated by ISIS. Then-candidate Trump said nothing to discourage such talk, as it fit his and his supporters’ “fact-challenged fantasy of a country,” a military and economic colossus somehow being victimized in lurid, gothic terms. Trumpism and its adherents may represent the apogee of what these and many other writers and thinkers have claimed about conspiracy theory. The belief in Qanon, the driving engine of Trumpism’s most devoted followers, seems to confirm America’s special identity as Conspiracy Nation. In order to understand these strange impulses, it appears we are forced to disagree with Hofstadter’s assertion that all of us have to deal with history’s afflictions, while conspiratorial thinkers are what he calls “double sufferers” in facing “the real world” and “their fantasies.” Is this true? What if the fantasies Americans accept as false conspiracy theories protect them from the real world? Perhaps it proved easier in the fifties to think about your government hiding a flying saucer than it is to look into how your country became the first, and so far the only, nation ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population. Or in the 1980s it seemed anything but comforting to tell myths about Satanists who murdered innocents at will. But perhaps it proved more salutary to the mind than the well-documented fact that your country engaged with terrorists, gunrunners, and international drug cartels to funnel arms to a band of mercenaries plotting to overthrow a legally elected government in Central America, or that the nation bears responsibility for brutal dictatorships ranging from the Iranian shah to Idi Amin to the Khmer Rouge? The strange story of Dr. Corydon Hammond and the illusory “Dr. Greenbaum” best illustrates this tendency of false conspiracy theories to add an extra layer of confusion to the nation’s maleficence. Hammond gave us a perfect template for this mythic bait and switch best called the Greenbaum effect. At a major medical conference in 1992, Hammond claimed that a Jewish scientist he identified simply as Greenbaum worked with the Nazis during World War II, teaching them various satanic mind control techniques learned from the kabbalah. After the war, this sinister figure came to the United States, where the CIA recruited him in their efforts to perfect brainwashing techniques. Somewhere in this anti-Semitic super villain fantasy, the highly peripatetic Greenbaum helped build a demonic infrastructure in America made up of, Hammond claimed, “tens of thousands of mental robots” engaged in everything from gunrunning to child molestation rings. All of this, he asserted, had the goal of creating “a Satanic Order that will rule the world.”31 Hammond’s claims call for chilly sarcasm. His use of age-old anti-Semitic tropes and laughable suggestions of satanic influence, however, hide the fact that almost every one of his unsustainable claims has a real-world analogue, a refracted mirror image of his easily falsifiable assertions. For example, we will see in this book that the CIA and the Pentagon did recruit Nazis to work toward American hegemony in the Cold War. The CIA also engaged in experiments with mind control, primarily with LSD, focused on the prison population. Former CIA directors have testified before Congress to this effect, and you can read the official history of the MK-Ultra experiments on the agency’s own website and in declassified documents available from the National Security Agency. And while the perpetual delusions of satanic covens kidnapping and killing children have zero basis in evidence, gunrunning has been a foundation of American foreign policy with a particularly egregious example, the Iran-Contra scandal, coming to light just a few years before Hammond made his claims.32 The Greenbaum effect is the tendency of Americans to choose outlandish and unsupported conspiracy theories while ignoring the conspiratorial actions of political and economic elites that are backed by evidence. It has shaped almost every decade of American life we’ll consider. Hammond’s early-1990s vacation from reality reveals that fictions immunize the public against the dark realities, neutralizing them and causing rational people to question other assertions of conspiracy, actual conspiracies, when they appear based on fact and from reliable sources. If a huge number of Americans are ineptly tangled in conspiratorial beliefs while ignoring actual conspiracies, another and perhaps larger proportion of the country uses conspiracy theory as a term of derision for any suggestion that powerful economic and political elites might collude together for unethical purposes. As this book explores in part 3, the CIA and a very willing American media engaged in a psy-ops campaign in 1968 to damn the ideas of the conspiracy theory and conspiracy theorist. Their conspiracy to spread conspiracy theory worked more thoroughly and quietly than most of their other efforts. One finds even among rational Americans, maybe especially among them, the tendency to use conspiracy theory to describe well-documented facts like the Iran-Contra arms deal, the CIA arming of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the 1980s, and the influence of the petroleum industry over the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. The same well-worn terms are used to describe evidence-free absurdities such as alien crafts being hidden away at Roswell, New Mexico, or a race of lizard people masquerading as the world’s ruling elite. In the meantime, false conspiracies, often weaponized by racism, flourish. Real conspiracies have hidden in plain sight. Now and again, as we’ll see with the flying saucer panic of the 1950s, the praetorians of American empire have seen the utility of the Greenbaum effect, pushing absurd fantasies to hide the empire’s work. This has allowed the American empire to have not only a “small footprint” but also in the lives of most of its citizens, an invisible one. It’s always been easy to sound a little crazy talking about American imperial power. The power of the Greenbaum effect and the public decision to regard some facts as Michael Parenti’s “dirty truths” makes it a risky endeavor to state the obvious. 11.Stranded in a Nightmare CONTEMPORARY AMERICANS feel stranded in their history. Those born in the seventies, eighties, or nineties, they called their grandparents “the greatest generation.” They learned a little about the Vietnam War, mostly from the movies. Something bad had happened there, something that was no one in particular’s fault. The events of 9/11 shocked them into supporting a war that cost them nothing. The upsurge of patriotism in the first Bush administration did not impel these Americans to volunteer for military service; recruiters noted in 2003 that few seemed to want to sign up for an actual war. The president told them to “get down to Disney World in Florida” and “go shopping.”33 But this is no tired polemic about the current generation’s inability to live up to some imagined greatness in the past. For the American generations who were your grandparents or great-grandparents, the world was easier than they admit—if they were white and in a relatively stable economic situation. World War II created the largest and most prosperous middle class not only in American history, but in the history of the world. The G.I. Bill, at least for white veterans, opened up the possibility of home ownership in suburbia and, because of segregation in the form of housing covenants, homogenous neighborhoods. The G.I. Bill allowed the U.S. government to build a white middle class quite literally from the ground up with subsidies for education as well as housing. Wages rose so high for middle-class Americans that they confessed themselves baffled by the changes from the 1930s. And, like the old false dream of the West, indeed like some biblical prophecy, deserts bloomed in California, Nevada, and Colorado after federal damming and irrigation projects. Hydroelectric power brought both light and water to what early white settlers had seen as a wilderness eager to kill them. National Geographic painted an image of the American frontier turned from threat to quiet paradise with “endless farms, all atwinkle, like stars along a manmade Milky Way.”34 Peace and security and more than the hint of the elusive notion of happiness. But, as often in peculiar dreams, many Americans felt a chill and knew something was very wrong. The American horror film that, as early as the 1950s, began to remind us again and again of the dues of empire, attracted fans who experienced these costs in their daily lives. The most escapist of such films, from the sometimes bizarrely optimistic sci-fi of the fifties to Jaws in the seventies, promised the bliss of terror quieted: there are threats, but we will defeat them and you, viewer, are part of that “we” that will benefit from the violence we will execute in your name. We are blowing up the shark for you. But the shark and its death throes offer only horror that comforts the comfortable. The shark is not just the predator gliding in the water out there. Imperial power does not simply do its wet work abroad. White supremacist and class violence have become the cost of maintaining the wealthy, the gated communities, the suburbs, and the illusion of safety. Global economic exploitation begins at home. Shadows purple mainland America, and even those who have thrived in the system see it from the corner of their eyes before quickly looking away. In many rural states, the death rate among infants, especially in marginalized groups, places the United States at thirty-second among the thirty-five wealthiest nations in infant mortality. In a country where everyone from paupers to billionaires report themselves as “middle class,” an aspirational assertion more than anything, one quarter of American households somehow subsist on under twenty-five thousand dollars a year. Many of these households include more than one wage earner, often working an exhausting and debilitating job in construction day labor or the fast-food industry. Nursing home assistants, day care employees, home health care workers, and EMTs are told to see their long and stressful weeks as vocations even as they struggle to pay bills. Tens of millions labor in the often-humiliating worlds of big-box retail, the daily uncertainty of the gig economy, the cubicled call center, or the dangerous, dehumanizing abattoirs of factory farming.35 Tobe Hooper understood this when he made his cannibalistic family out of people destroyed by their work in a slaughterhouse that didn’t need them anymore. Jordan Peele knew the same in 2019 when the film Us (U.S.?) featured the zombie-like “tethered” coming forth from an underground world to destroy the America of showboat SUVs and vacation homes more luxuriant than the houses much of America rents from a landlord, or from a bank. During the last century, the United States has been, writes historian Joshua B. Freeman, “as dominant in the world, in its own way, as Great Britain and Rome had been at the height of their empires.” But Freeman may underestimate American power, or at least what living in the empire has meant for the nation-state’s middle and upper classes. Inequality defends itself against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There’s not a question now of “how the other half lives” within the borders of the nation, what Americans took to calling “the homeland” in the early twenty-first century. Instead of “two halves,” there’s instead now 70 percent of us hustling and striving every day to live on declining wages and limited access to health care, a (relatively) stable and secure 29 percent of us whose privilege is more fragile than we think, and a tiny coterie of tech and investment oligarchs who have utterly unimaginable wealth counted not in the billions and often not even in the tens of billions but in the hundreds of billions. Hooper’s vision, the horror film literally reframing American history in all its primeval savagery, has remained the best and simultaneously the most politically subversive part of the genre. The alleged age of prosperity feared the atom bomb and the invasion of alien forces that would burn the suburbs to the ground, forces that could stand in for Soviets or Black Power advocates. While the country became mired in its violent campaigns in Southeast Asia, George A. Romero created an army of the dead. In the Reagan era, white flight took those who could still afford it from the suburbs to the exurbs, quiet towns now supposedly safe but threatened by unstoppable menaces like Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger. After 9/11, pronouncements of war without end and brutal retaliation against all conceivable enemies brought Romero’s zombies back from the dead while making torture sadism a Roman coliseum of the American mind at the local Cineplex. Horror waits for us at the end of empire’s dreaming.",

      "content": "1.Empire of Horror HORROR IS the dream life of American empire. Since the nineteenth century, the United States acted as an imperial power. The young nation seized land, killed Indigenous peoples, and battered to death any dissenters from its aggressive economic system. Once crowded into thirteen contentious little colonies that hugged the Atlantic, an empire born in blood emerged when these settler societies conquered most of Mexico and annihilated hundreds of small native nations that once lived from the Tennessee hills to the California coast, from Massachusetts Bay to the Ohio Valley. Many of the survivors of this genocide are today packed into hundreds of reservations, scattered across the continental and noncontiguous United States, where they sink below the poverty line at more than double the rate of the rest of America.1 The American empire slipped the confines of its continent in the early twentieth century. The new power’s shadow darkened Latin America and the Pacific, talons clawing for resources in East Asia. The Mexican War (1846–1848) doubled the size of the country. Hawaii and Alaska came next, along with the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, and a multitude of Pacific possessions. None would become states except for Hawaii and Alaska, and only after white men became the dominant political force in each region. Delivering a fatal blow to the decrepit Spanish imperium in the Spanish-American War (1898) allowed this rogue state to seize ports of call from the Caribbean to the doorstep of China. Cuba offered an experiment in which, after a military occupation from 1898 to 1902, a “republic” could come to life on the island so long as its government agreed to allow unilateral intervention, at any time, by the United States. The American military did occupy the country twice more and handpicked its leaders until the Cuban revolution in 1959. The United States never accepted that repudiation and continues to maintain a needlessly cruel economic boycott lingering now more than thirty years after the end of the Cold War. American presidents, military leaders, and captains of industry collaborated to create this new style of empire. The government could hold military bases in the Philippines without having to tangle any longer with the Indigenous insurgency that lasted more than a decade. U.S. Marines could protect business interests in Haiti during a nineteen-year occupation without having to administer it as a traditional colony. The U.S. military could run the Dominican Republic while keeping up the pretense of its independence. By the 1930s, Standard Oil (now Chevron) fully tied together American corporate and foreign policy interests by helping adjudicate an alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia that endures, profitably for both country’s ruling classes, into the present. Not only would oil interests benefit from the unlikely alliance. The partnership subsequently provided the United States with military bases in the region and the basis for an expanded network of bases in Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the United States officially structured its imperial holdings around the policy of “containing” communism. A new leadership cadre emerged in Washington, D.C., under the control of the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the cliques of unelected national security advisors that huddle around the country’s increasingly powerful executive branch. Closely linked to defense contractors with assets in the hundreds of billions, a relatively small and unsupervised economic and foreign policy elite waged secret wars, staged coups, and placed free-market-friendly dictators in power in Greece, Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Uganda, Iran, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Iraq. The end of the Cold War in 1991 changed none of this. The United States did not stand down with the dissolution of the Soviet Union—it launched invasions of both Panama and Iraq when their autocratic regimes, both longtime puppets of U.S. foreign policy and recipients of American arms and cash, stepped out of line. “Humanitarian interventions” into Haiti, Somalia, and the Balkans by the Clinton administration developed new military doctrine, tested weapons systems, and, in Kosovo, allowed for the building of enormous military bases to guard hoped-for oil pipelines that would bypass Russia and Iran. In the twenty-first century, the United States achieved a hegemony undreamt of by past imperial powers. Nearly 750 military bases, and hundreds of CIA black sites, are controlled by the United States around the globe. The majority of the world’s countries play host to American troops and weapons systems, 154 countries in 2020.2 U.S. covert ops does their work with impunity in nearly every country on earth. Regularly ignoring and sometimes even mocking the United Nations, American presidential administrations for fifty years have been breaking, amending, or simply ignoring multilateral treaties related to the UN Genocide Convention, the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, its own nuclear nonproliferation and test ban initiatives, and the International Criminal Court. The United States’ domination of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank gives the empire nearly limitless economic power over the debt of the world’s smallest and poorest nations. The Hollywood-McDonald’s-Disney industrial complex controls much of the global culture industry. Drone technology allows the United States to launch violent incursions in foreign nations that would have been considered acts of war in earlier times. Preemptive, bloody strikes in Sudan, Syria, Pakistan, and the Philippines have received limited news coverage from American media and a bored yawn from the American public. In November of 2021, news that American commanders kept secret a 2019 airstrike in Syria that killed eighty women and children spent only several hours as a top story for The New York Times online edition while no major news network provided coverage that lasted more than one minute. American power, covert and overt, over much of the globe leads analysts to describe the United States as a “hyperpower” rather than using the older language of superpower. The United States is also an empire whose culture industry makes horror films grossing more than half a billion dollars every year, many of them low-budget and highly profitable. Streaming services are cluttered not only with traditional horror films but with “true crime” documentaries that explore the most gruesome murders ever committed in surgical detail. Death’s own holiday, Halloween, has become a multi-billion-dollar affair that America has exported to other countries. It’s not paradoxical that an empire built on very real horror consumes horror as part of its regular entertainment. However, horror plays more than one role in the empire’s entertainment industry. Americans have, as Daniel Immerwahr described in his 2019 book How to Hide an Empire, worked assiduously to disguise their imperial design, even from themselves. Thus, some of our tales of terror are more oblique because we’d rather see ourselves as the shining city on a hill and not a global behemoth. So we tell horror stories that allow us to forget, that tell us of monsters beyond our borders and heroes that destroy them for us. And yet, horror also offers a shadowy mirror. It reveals truths and poses questions, tells us that we are the monsters that ignore borders in our insatiable hungers. The white American notion of the self—ruddy, open-faced, a bit innocent as it determinedly undertakes its mission to be what former secretary of state Madeleine Albright called “the indispensable nation”—stares into the glass only to find something twisted and not quite sane staring back. Despite the differences in horror fictions, despite how they offer radically different versions of the American dream, they always center violence. One kind of horror makes us yearn to turn the lights on and the other keeps the lights on the whole time for us. But both explore or exploit the violence of empire, critiquing it or imagining it as necessary for the preservation of the most prosperous, most dangerous nation on earth. The realities come to us in our cultural REM state. Our dependence on various sadisms to maintain the nation’s hegemony has caused two different dreams to emerge in the American unconscious. Both dreams have a darkness, even if one represses its cruelest assumptions. The first is a dream of safety and security. Most American citizens do not think of themselves as living in an empire but instead in a great nation that mostly does good things. The occasional failing, like the toppling of a government in a violent coup or the murder of civilians in an air strike, is “not who we are.” The world may be full of enemies of our freedom, but walls fashioned by the national security state, and actual concrete, protect us from “blowback.” This term, first coined in a secret history commissioned by the CIA and introduced to the public by former cold warrior turned critic of empire Chalmers Johnson, refers to unintended and unplanned consequences of the American empire’s most secret crimes. These actions are unknown to American citizens but unforgotten and unforgivable to its victims in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. When we screen the sunnier side of imperial assumptions, the horror film offers monsters marked for death from the beginning. Film or folklore predicates their existence on the monsters’ eventual destruction. Our heroes, often dealing with creatures who emerge from islands and maelstroms beyond the borders of America’s cordon sanitaire or violate U.S. airspace in their flying saucers or with their leathery wings, defeat the evil that threatens our safety and our sanity. These films, these dreams of innocence, tell us that the monsters are not unlike the psychos who attacked the Twin Towers on 9/11. Their motives are unclear, they are “evildoers” who have apparently attacked us for our inherent goodness. This book explains that Americans’ love of this iteration of horror comes from the same root as their acquiescence to the violence that made America. The jump scares and the gore, the evil cabals and paranormal activities, all allow us to imagine that evil comes from demonic principalities or masked killers, that it happens to innocent Americans in their allegedly safe homes. Violence is not what is done in our name, by fresh-faced young people we’ve hired to kill for us, in places we can’t find on a map. Violence is done to us and we fight back and we win—we always win. By the time the credits roll, these films assure us that everything is okay, that the evildoers have been punished and the American way of life, and the piece of it you’ve broken off for yourself, will not change even a little. Another kind of horror film denies us security and comfort, even as it refuses to let us believe we are the legitimate heirs of imperial privilege. These films demand we recognize how the American dream has been assembled from the night terrors of the world. They pose questions about how we won our comforts. They often leave us gobsmacked, muddled, and dazed as we try to bring ourselves to sensibility of what we thought was the real world. These are films that end with corpses everywhere and the survivors wearing their dead friends’ insides. The evil has not come from without, from empire’s frontier. It’s a violence we made, that we’ve either become or accepted, as the price of our privileges. These films critique the American dream by showing us the mounds of corpses it’s built on. These films are often aggressive with the audience, refusing to play by the rules of the genre. Commenting on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Mick Garris described it as a film that ignored old-school “somethings behind the door” scares in favor of “coming after you in fucking clown paint.” The thing coming at us in “fucking clown paint” has a lot more power than popular understandings of Aristotle’s notion of catharsis. The idea that horror films, especially ones that show body-rending violence, are palliatives for anxiety has been best summarized by Richard Rhodes as “taking the psychic garbage out.” Of course, as Maggie Nelson asks in The Art of Cruelty, where does this “psychic garbage” go? Who ends up with it? Is there any evidence that this “catharsis” is taking place, she asks, if “‘catharsis’ now means ‘tune in next week’”? Perhaps, as Nelson herself suggests, something deeply political, not simply psychological, works in our stories of violence. If we consume hour after hour after hour of innocence being corrupted or killed by monstrosity but watch our heroes annihilate the monster just before the credits roll, it’s soothing repetition and not catharsis. But horror also confronts us with unsettling dread that opens new possibilities. Horror directors like John Carpenter make films that, in his own words, critique “unrestrained capitalism.” George A. Romero could make a zombie film in 2005 that has Dennis Hopper standing in for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. These films follow the brutal logic of Eugene Ionesco’s famous assertion, sometimes in a very literal way, that “to tear ourselves away from the everyday, from habit, from mental laziness which hides from us the strangeness of reality, we must receive something like a real bludgeon blow.” These nightmares come from the irreconcilable contrasts of what Americans hope, or believe, the world to be and its bleaker reality. This is the reason so much of what spooks us in horror depends on sensory uncertainty, experience suddenly taking a dreaded turn, a past suddenly revealing its true meaning or a future lost. Horror lets us know that how we expected the world to act has been indefinitely cancelled. What appeared to be simply a shadow on the wall moves in a way nothing should. We are certain we are alone in a dark room when something brushes against us. The sunlight of a spring day suddenly dies as thunderheads trick out the sky in a sickening orange and Leatherface charges across a peaceful pasture, chain saw roaring, ready to teach us that you “DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS.” This is the precise opposite of entertainment as escapism, the wish to ignore reality. Michael Moorcock once attacked J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth fantasies as escapism that encouraged a Tory view of the world. Tolkien rebuked the young Marxist, saying that “jailers always hate escapism.” Moorcock famously replied that actually jailers love escapism—what they hate is an actual jailbreak. Many of our frightful fictions want us to contemplate a jailbreak from the American consensus. The horror film that demands we attend to the history of American violence does not simply reflect the culture. Its buoyant sadisms can restage the violence this country visits on the world and insist we look, that we see through lies and renounce the cant, the mental laziness, and the political nihilism. Americans can fight for tickets to the opening of Saw (2004) and Hostel (2005), infamously labelled “torture porn,” in the same cultural moment as the revelation that physical and sexual violence had been deployed by American soldiers against the detainees of Abu Ghraib prison. The tendency of our least comfortable filmmakers to try to bludgeon us says nothing about audience reaction or the meaning accrued to a specific film. This book does not suggest that audiences leave a horror film pondering geopolitics or the cost of American empire. Nor do they leave a simple monster-hunt story thinking about how good it is to live so well in a country like the United States. But they do leave the theater or close their streaming app with either a feeling of the rightness or wrongness of the world. They’ve been asked to question the story they tell themselves about reality. They’ve been asked to pay attention or they’ve been told to go back to sleep, everything’s okay. In the troubled sleep of empire, both dreams may come. In this book we will experience both fantasies and the political conviction that grows out of the worldview each assumes. We’ll see the predator who swims from sea to shining sea until slain by a working-class hero who’s trying to defend our amity. And we’ll have to watch a more excruciating vision, a murderous dance on the frontiers of American power, a roar of industrialized murder shattering the silence of purple mountains majesty. In the troubled sleep of empire, we meet the chain saw and the shark. 2. American Massacres TOBE HOOPER, his round, boyish, bespectacled face beaming with an easy smile, eased back in his chair as he responded to a question about the real meaning of his classic, and infamous, 1974 film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He laughed nervously, like a modest kid embarrassed by winning a prize at school, as he talked about his story of hippies finding some real bad trouble in the Texas hinterland. “I think what it’s trying to say,” Hooper quipped, as if giving credit to someone else for the eighty-minute nightmare, “is that this is America.”3 Hooper created a revisionist western, the myth of the American frontier that outdid The Wild Bunch in its unforgiving brutality. Hooper’s Wild West is not John Wayne facing down desperate men with the truest of grit. Hooper’s frontier rots like Katherine Anne Porter’s Texas dirt farms, so gone to seed that the clans that clustered there had to go to work at the local slaughterhouse. But, in the moribund heartland of seventies America, even the slaughterhouse has gone out of business. The evil demon presiding over the times in which the film first flickered on drive-in screens made the celluloid carnage appear a documentary. The first few minutes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre are staccato edits of unburied bodies. An edged, metallic riff tears the soundscape. Hooper, who spent a year chopping and scoring the film, created a whole library of unsettling sounds he could draw on. He achieved the grating sound of metal ripping apart by tearing apart a tambourine and dragging a saw across the threads so the seams busted like metal ripping flesh. So much for the sounds of the decade when Hooper came of age, when young, hopeful Americans wanted to hear Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for them. Hooper joined each serrated edit with the droning of a news anchor . . . murders, accidents, Nixon, and Vietnam. It’s a cacophony of horrors. The news reports, just like the unending stream of malignancies that greet us in our contemporary doom scrolling, report global and local carnage. The catalog of disasters continues as Hooper shows us exhumed graves in a small Texas town where some hippie kids drop by to ask directions to the old homeplace. The old men standing around, escapees from an Erskine Caldwell novel, are delighted by the women’s short-shorts and bemused by the bell-bottomed paramours the pretty girls prefer to John Wayne. We meet our heroes in this unquiet graveyard. Sally and Franklin are brother and sister, a duo living in different cultural time zones of the sixties and seventies. Sally is a liberated advocate of peace and love, while Franklin uses a wheelchair and is filled with an unendurable combination of sniveling self-pity and rage. The rest of the group are largely embodiments of the counterculture. Pam is a sultry astrology maven. Jerry and Kirk are floating clouds of cannabis eager to learn more about sultry astrology mavens. They’ve hit the road like Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters in part to find Sally and Franklin’s family home. Hooper told a story of a new kind of settlers. They are the children of the Age of Aquarius, but Pam warns that the times they are a-changing; Saturn has ascended. The monster who devoured his own children will become the new America. The Hitchhiker, no name provided, introduces us to the realities of American history that purblind patriotism would have us ignore. The blood is the life for the Hitchhiker and his family. They had worked for generations at a nearby slaughterhouse that fired them when it started using high-powered air guns. “The hammer was better,” the Hitchhiker assures his new friends, a gruesome observation but one that resonated with Americans who’d been hearing a new word on the evening news: deindustrialization. For the working class this meant, above all, unemployment as manufacturing jobs disappeared and the country began its arc toward today’s information and services economy. Sweaty, kinetic, and seemingly opposed to bathing, the Hitchhiker causes the kids to quickly become wary because, as Franklin puts it, they may have “picked up Count Dracula” from “a whole family of Draculas.” The Hitchhiker’s interest in blood, his own and others, suggests Franklin might be on to something. The film starts as a story about finding the family farm, the old dream of the homestead, the West that became the first frontier of the American empire. But it quickly becomes a fright tale that questions the sanity of any audience that would watch it and, by extension, the sanity of anyone who would believe the western fantasy of deserts inexplicably fecund and settlers moving peacefully across the landscapes, covered wagons like little puffs of cloud drifting along in an orderly row with the breeze of the American dream nudging them along. In place of a little house on the prairie, the kids find riverbeds dry as ash when they want to swim and, in the age of rural poverty, a crumbling Victorian farmhouse leering over the landscape. One by one, the hippie kids find themselves on meat hooks in scenes that are weirdly bloodless while evoking absolutely brutal violence. A man-child in a skin mask lays out Jerry in a single, spine-crunching blow from a slaughterhouse mallet. By the end of the film, only Sally remains, captive of the strange, male-only family of cannibals. The Hitchhiker, we learn, is part of this family, which includes the Cook; the murderous, if childlike Leatherface; and Grandpa, a desiccated corpse that comes to life only at the smell of blood and meat. All gather at what looks to be Sally’s last supper, the table piled high with offal and sausage, which we assume are pieces of her friends or other unlucky travelers in the heartland. The film ends without the now well-known figure of the “final girl” triumphing over the monster. Well, not exactly. We bear witness to another kind of America with a final girl less gritty and confident than we’ve come to know her. Sally, avatar of the last living hip sixties beauty, jumps through a window and runs for her life, slathered in blood and screaming, escaping to whatever fate awaits her in the back of a passing pickup truck. As she flees, Leatherface dances a gruesome ballet with his chain saw. A guttered western sun spreads a brown glow over the waterless landscape, a John Ford shot that would have suited Red River. Filming the movie had been a terror trip. The Texas summer broiled in 1973, making the shoot as miserable as all the characters seem to be on screen. Thirty-two days of temperatures at 95 to 100 degrees and sixteen-to eighteen-hour days made cast and crew hate each other and become dangerously accident-prone. The set almost became an actual chain saw massacre more than once. Gunnar Hansen, a Swedish poet who played the murderous Leatherface, later admitted that he became a bit too enthusiastic about trying to kill Marilyn Burns, Sally in the film. Indeed, swinging the chain saw, he came close to eviscerating more than one cast member and once Hooper himself. Burns later said that when she seems to lose her mind and have a complete psychotic break as she tries to escape at the end of the film, “that wasn’t acting.”4 Director, cast, and crew found the American past and present in Texas apocalypseland. Hooper’s camera moves listlessly across abandoned barns, rusting tractors, and a broken landscape that looks like a bone protruding from sand; rainless, the color of the earth is bright but harsh, baking the eyes of the viewer. Art director Robert A. Burns discovered a dead armadillo on the highway early in the shoot. Burns took it home, read a book on taxidermy, and sewed the animal into a Frankensteined version of its former self. An image of decay lying on the side of the road, vaguely portentous and, as Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) chairman H. Rap Brown said about violence, “as American as cherry pie.” The Texas Chain Saw Massacre appeared just as the crimes of the Nixon administration came slowly to light. The bodies buried in the American landscape had been exhumed, not unlike the harrowing scenes in the film’s opening moments. The house of the dead on Pennsylvania Avenue whispered ill-kept secrets: attempts to subvert a democratic election, the use of the FBI as an internal security force hardwired into Nixon’s presidium of corrupt advisors, and secret wars being waged in Cambodia and Laos that only a few in the Pentagon, and no one in Congress, knew anything about. Facing eminent impeachment, Nixon resigned in disgrace in the last weeks of the summer of ’74. In less than a year, Americans found themselves facing defeat in Vietnam. In late spring of ’75, families watched over TV dinners as the evening news showed the fall of Saigon in real time and the last Americans fleeing ingloriously in a helicopter off the rooftop of their embattled embassy. The most famous images showed hordes of South Vietnamese, who had worked with or for the Americans, being turned away at a makeshift helipad atop a downtown Saigon hotel turned CIA headquarters. During this year of the macabre, millions of Americans unexpectedly went to see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, first in drive-ins and grungy theaters and then on every screen that wanted to make a buck. The film reels turned on squeaky, stained, smoke-encrusted projectors for most of ’74, the movie’s dark reputation growing. The opening titles of Hooper’s film, a crawl that told of “the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history,” convinced some viewers that they were watching a true story, a companion piece to 1974’s controversial documentary that indicted American violence against the Vietnamese, Peter Davis’s Hearts and Minds. Tobe Hooper conjured the family of murderers from childhood tales of the Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, the grave robber, deer hunter, and taxidermist who lived his own gruesome vision of America. To Hooper’s consternation and delight, fans actually argued with the writer and director for decades about whether his film was a documentary or not. They were wrong about Hooper giving them an early example of a true crime murderama/docudrama. But more than childhood tales of Gein’s mayhem influenced the filmmaker. When he was walking on the UT Austin campus in August 1966, a cop screamed at Hooper to get his head down because “someone is shooting from the tower.” Hooper simply stared at the officer for a moment, maybe a little high and certainly oblivious to the mayhem swirling around him. Hooper sobered considerably when bullets ventilated the officer’s major organs.5 Charles Whitman had come to UT Austin to perpetrate one of the most savage mass murders, outside of covert warfare, in American history. Hooper hid behind cars and trash cans along with hundreds of others as the ex-marine fired from the twenty-eighth-floor observation deck of the Main Building. For ninety-six minutes the shots exploded, stopping only so Whitman could meticulously reload the arsenal of weapons he’d lugged up to his aerie. When police finally brought Whitman down, he had killed fifteen people and wounded thirty-one others. Earlier in the day, he enjoyed a quiet lunch with his mother and then stabbed her to death. He then drove home and stabbed his wife three times before heading to the campus. Like Hooper’s brutalist western, Whitman’s story is another tale that’s really about America. 3.I Wish They All Could Be California Girls BOOGEYMEN ALREADY haunted American dreams as the seventies became a turning point for empire. Tex left the ranch late, just as midnight came on and the campfire waned after dinner. He packed a .22 Buntline Special. Colt’s Manufacturing Company (founded in 1855) named the gun after Ned Buntline, the man who created the dime novel western. Wyatt Earp supposedly carried the same long-barreled smoke wagon to every killing he’d ever graced with his presence. Tex hit the trail to play his part in what became known as the Manson murders, despite Charles Manson’s limited role in the actual labor of killing. The importance of “Helter Skelter,” and Vincent Bugliosi’s archetypal 1975 true crime novel of the same name, has carried cultural weight out of proportion to the actual event. Bugliosi told readers a story not unlike he told jurors in 1970. Manson held a series of interconnected beliefs based on an exotic blend of white supremacist ideology folded in with bits and pieces of Scientology, Robert A. Heinlein, and the book of Revelation, all cooked in acid until fully homicidal. Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) proved a particular obsession to the group. It’s unclear whether Manson ever read it, but someone in the Manson Family did. When a child was born as a result of the group’s perpetual orgy, he was named Valentine Michael—a tribute to the alien fascist who’s the hero of Heinlein’s novel, a cult leader who enjoys patriarchal polyamory and “disincorporating” his enemies. Manson could relate. Heinlein, meanwhile, would go on to play an all too important role in the story of the American empire, endorsing policies that murdered more people than his psychotic admirers in the Manson Family could imagine offing in their most extravagant death fantasies. Reading Heinlein can teach you a lot about Manson and about postwar America. But it was Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter that became the book everyone had to read regarding the Tate-LaBianca murders, joining Ann Rule’s The Stranger Beside Me as the template for the true crime genre. It still keeps that reputation after half a century. Ed Sanders, poet and member of the Merry Prankster folk band the Fugs, also won a hearing with his 1971 book, The Family. It’s a wonderfully strange and byzantine mess, a true farrago of diary, reportage, memoir, fact-free rumination, political commentary, and occasionally a very detailed guide to the geography of the Southern California desert. It’s always classified as “true crime,” which is a bit like categorizing Robert Graves’s The White Goddess as classics. Sanders understood that the Tate-LaBianca murders had meaning beyond the actual event and would continue to accumulate meaning in the way of historical events. Joan Didion wrote in her famed essay “The White Album” that “many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969.” Greil Marcus insisted that “Manson’s shadow is everywhere” and suggested that the thrill kills of the Family had something to do with Woodstock, at least symbolically. But he couldn’t have conceivably meant such bum steer bullshit. He must have been upset, in the same headspace as Steve McQueen, when, out of the conviction that death cults might come for all the pretty people of new Hollywood, he packed a revolver to Sharon Tate’s funeral.6 Sanders saw another kind of connection. What made Charles Manson so different from Richard Nixon? What was the meaning of Manson gleefully holding the headline that read MANSON GUILTY, NIXON DECLARES? Why did Manson mock Nixon as late as the eighties and nineties and, in the stygian depths of his psychosis, how was he certain that he, Jesus, and the devil all in one package had actually been responsible for Nixon’s downfall? Maybe all that’s a story about America and not Manson. Maybe we needed Manson in 1969 and have continued to need him for the last half century. “I’m just your mirror” Manson was fond of saying to the throngs who interviewed him in prison; “you see in me what you need to see.” Even a broken, criminally insane clock can be right once or twice. Maybe the theatrical violence, the horror aesthetic that riveted the nation on 10050 Cielo Drive, had its corollary in an awareness of American imperial horrors? Did those two nights in the LA hills become a way to forget, or remember, how murder is done in our name? The Manson murders, many critics of the Vietnam War noted, had brought the war home. Perhaps this American massacre, and our reaction to it, showed our immense moral hypocrisy when it came to the crimes carried out on our behalf. Ed Sanders made this connection by comparing Manson to another figure accused of ordering a mass murder, Lieutenant William Calley. Calley became infamous as the officer who led Charlie Company, Twentieth Infantry Regiment of the “Americal” Division, into My Lai village, slaughtering as many as five hundred people, raping and mutilating as they proceeded. The army at first attempted to cover up the event but then put Calley on trial about one month after the Tate-LaBianca murders. No higher officers, including Captain Ernest Medina, who ordered the foray, faced conviction.7 Around the time the officer who led Charlie Company and Charles Manson came to national fame, Sanders had become the main man on the Tate-LaBianca beat for the Los Angeles Free Press, a countercultural lodestone known just as the Freep. Giving any nuanced view of the fascination with Manson got you in trouble in 1970, just as it does now. But after telling those who accused him of defending Manson to “go make motions of unification with a weather balloon,” Sanders proposed that the country that “perfected the concept of the ‘freefire zone’” in Vietnam and found fragmentation bombs amenable to the spirit of suburbia’s “well-kept lawns” possibly suffered a hypocrisy problem.8 In January of 1971, he forced readers back into the jungle with Calley. He didn’t believe Manson was innocent but insisted that “if you kill Manson you have to kill Calley.” He was not alone in seeing the correspondence. Allen Katzman of The East Village Other wrote that if Manson’s followers slaughtered the Vietnamese rather than Tate and her friends, Manson and his followers would have been “just following orders and obeying the ten commandments.” Even National Lampoon and Mad magazine made the connection, with Lampoon imagining a boxing match between Manson and Calley, won by the latter because of the quick intervention of Richard Nixon. Nothing made this point more brutally graphic in all meanings of the term than Tom Veitch and Greg Irons in one of their “comix” (underground, and very adult, work that emerged in the sixties often associated with Robert Crumb) entitled The Legion of Charlies. The opening page provides two top panels with Lieutenant “Kali” (a Hindu goddess associated with death) telling his troops “we’re gonna hafta wipe um all out.” The bottom two panels feature Manson demanding that “piggies must die . . . let’s get ’em.” The satire gets weirder as the U.S. government decides legions of Manson followers can kill and cannibalize with more speed and panache than the U.S. military. “We’ve taken the logic inherent in today’s news,” Veitch wrote, “and taken it to absurdity.” That’s just peacenik rhetoric, right? Sure it is. But that doesn’t change the fact that, as Manson had ordered his family “to do something witchy,” Calley ordered Charlie Company to do much the same. There’s nothing in the official army records that vindicates or even mitigates what happened that day. Moreover, as explored later in this book, the incident reads as a microcosm of the larger American war-fighting plan in which the United States would behave like a brutal confused schizophrenic, offering the Vietnamese people largesse to win hearts and minds while raining down hell and destruction in nearly incalculable tonnages of bombs and chemical weapons. Long before Calley and Manson, Horace Greeley’s injunction to “Go west, young man” became both the rallying cry and an epithet for a country determined to manifest the fuck out of its destiny. There’s a vicious subtext of violence and rapine in the tendency of American history textbooks to describe the opening of the West. The image suggests a flower opening to sunlight, but darker images await. Settlers violently “opened” the West; prospectors, frontier start-up entrepreneurs, saloon keepers, and, most of all, soldiers tore their way across the continent to make the first American empire. Ed Sanders thought “the Family” had, like Tobe Hooper’s clan of the chain saw, headed west to grow up with the country, an acid nightmare of violence becoming how the West was won. If only Joan Didion had brought the sensibility of her essay “John Wayne: A Love Story” to her epithet for the sixties. Maybe Gay Talese could have pressed his metaphors further in his famous March 1970 Esquire piece “Charlie Manson’s Home on the Range.” As things turned out, it proved easier for the liberal intelligentsia and the American ayatollahs of the eighties right-wing backlash to declare the death of a fragile period of experimentation with social justice than to see 10050 Cielo Drive as a hyperreal theme park of the American empire, an allegory of the dream of an ever-expanding West, a corollary to a brutal war in East Asia where kids nursed at the man-teat of John Wayne and talked about “playing cowboys and Indians” in the jungle of the new frontier, and an aging Wayne himself tried to shore up the fantasy in his ludicrous 1968 pro-war film The Green Berets. Americans loved reading about Manson and still do, but the millions of Asian corpses didn’t move them. Richard Nixon may have declared Manson guilty, but he declared Lieutenant William Calley innocent. In April of 1971, Nixon ordered Calley released from the custody of military police, pending his sentencing. Calley remained under house arrest for three years until federal court judge J. Robert Elliott overturned his conviction. Sanders was wrong. If you convict Manson, you can actually let Calley go free. Elliott even attended Calley’s wedding. Plenty of mythmakers, across the political spectrum, have found in Manson a seething symbolism. Culture warrior Senator Ted Cruz seemed worried about his ghost voting from prison as late as 2020. Depending on who you read, Manson “killed” or “weaponized” or “embodied” the sixties. Manson had the power to make Americans believe in him, and through successive interviews over decades with everyone from Geraldo Rivera to Ronald Reagan Jr., he successfully became the boogeyman. He started this in his trial, where spoke of “these children who come at you with knives.” A damn good line used to describe three not-children who came not for their parents but for an emerging actor and her friends at a Norman-style chateau in the Hollywood Hills that once belonged to Lillian Gish. The little crook his followers called “The Wizard” scried up the perfect storm. Cultural critics insisted on calling his Family “the cult” and “the commune,” turning Manson into “the Dark Hippie,” the sum of all the half-mythical silent majority’s entirely mythical fears. Rolling Stone saw this coming in June of 1970. Manson would become the bourgeoise bugaboo, “the long-haired devil you loved to hate.”9 What was not to hate? Manson had taken the life of Tate, America’s new beach beauty, even as she’d been on the brink of becoming an oddly political sex symbol—a Jane Fonda who’d never let our boys down. She’d been a real sweet girl from Texas, Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas 1943. A military brat, Tate lived in Texas, California, and even Italy because of the work of her father, Colonel Paul Tate, who later served as an intelligence officer in Vietnam. She was the all-American girl who only in your most grandiose of fantasies lived next door. Almost exactly eight years before being butchered in the Hollywood Hills, the icily gorgeous Tate, a Catherine Deneuve for Grand Ole Opry Fans, posed for the Atomic Frontier Days in Richland, Texas. Feet shod in boots, wearing shorts that revealed her lengthy tanned shanks kissed by the Texas sun, she straddled a Nike-class surface-to-air-missile, cowboy hat on her head. This was four years before Stanley Kubrick used the image of Slim Pickens bronco-busting a missile in Dr. Strangelove. The event celebrated the local plutonium manufacturing plant and its role in America’s system of mass destruction. Floats paraded down Main Street Richland reading THE WEST, NEW AND OLD, the atomic missile and the six-gun, the arms race and the cattle drive, the hope that the commies would go down like the Mescalero Apache. She continued to be a strange icon of American power. A few years later, Tate appeared mostly unclothed in a ham-handed attempt by Esquire to parody Mao’s Little Red Book, his turgid quotes juxtaposed with Sharon in wet T-shirts and bandoliers. Today, it looks more like a self-own, a parody of Esquire’s stated commitment to what they described as “the capitalist way of things” when they introduced Tate’s spread in the summer of ’67. Tate became a symbol of all kinds of things before the ’69 murders, just as she would after. Glamour, a rags-to-riches story, the ingenue that might become a star, something sexy and American. Her anti-communist wet T-shirt photos and willingness to rail on a missile seemed to make sense among baby boomers for whom “do our own thing” could mean the perpetual contact high of living in Haight-Ashbury or marching in an anti-war demonstration or growing old enough to support Donald Trump while believing QAnon and the Pentagon Papers bear the same level of meaning—the generation so certain of both the power of crystals and the danger of “chemtrails.” Can you dig it? After all, the world lost Tate because, while some women of the sixties founded and fought for the work of the National Organization for Women (NOW), a few female boomers lived in a biblical patriarchy with a hirsute, death-obsessed little goblin who played the guitar well enough that he attracted the attention of Byrds producer Terry Melcher and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Lynette Fromme, Leslie Van Houten, Linda Kasabian, and a host of others went California dreaming with a man who hobnobbed with new Hollywood while building weaponized dune buggies to fight Black Panthers in the San Fernando Valley. A very American story. So maybe the children were coming for an older America with knives out? Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman seemed scary, if not as utterly terrifying in the middle-class imagination as Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. For most of the white American mainstream, Manson served a useful purpose. The silent majority could silently nod as their president called this diminutive fright wig of a guy “guilty, directly or indirectly” of the murders of eight people. This just felt right, being so afraid that you felt an extra dopamine rush of satisfaction at the dark messiah’s sentence. It felt wrong to be upset over the hundreds of Vietnamese dead at the contested borders of the American empire. Fantasizing about the intruders, Manson’s Lugosi-eyes floating in mist above them, entering the Tate-Polanski home felt so much better than picturing young American soldiers raping and murdering an entire village at a leisurely pace, the hours it took to terrorize and butcher and burn becoming so wearing that most of Charlie Company took a lunch break before resuming the slaughter. Certainly no one wanted to think about how My Lai represented only the tip of the bloody spear in Vietnam, how tens of thousands of civilians died in the Mekong Delta during Operation Speedy Express or how “free-fire zones” made such massacres a tactical imperative. Lieutenant William Calley claimed he was just following orders. But rather than pondering the implications of that story about America, why not dwell on Tex Watson announcing to Sharon Tate and her coffee heiress friend Abigail Folger that “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business”? Better yet, let’s imagine that Manson said it. Let’s imagine the sixties revealed their true meaning on a single night in Benedict Canyon. Let’s forget the end of an era occurred in the Mekong Delta or at Kent State or with the Christmas bombings. Horror makes it easier to live in an empire. Except when it doesn’t. Tobe Hooper wanted the chain saw to show Americans a story about their country. George A. Romero described himself as “pissed off” that the promised “revolution” of the sixties had never truly come. Could his flesh-eating ghouls be the only kind of revolution that could endure? Could they at least interject chaos into the new American consensus that made meaningful change seem impossible by the 1980s?10 A fascination with horror, and the hope that horror can be so shocking that it burns this motherfucker down with the sound of a chain saw roaring in the distance, tells us about more than just the American seventies. It’s a history that has something uncomfortable to say about being a citizen of the American empire at this moment. The horror con that becomes an actual blood bath or the Halloween theme park where you are stalked and slaughtered by very real psychopaths appears in films like Blood Fest, Haunt, The Houses October Built (1 and 2), Hell Fest, and No Escape Room. Each ask the viewer to consider what horror actually means in a society where it’s everywhere. Awash in uncountable podcasts, documentaries, wikis, tribute websites, and books about “true crime,” how have we come to understand violence? When what counts as news has also taken on the tincture of hyperreality, a drop here and a drop there of rage and calamity, what do we mean by horror? Chain saw horror always comes as a crisis of knowledge. The portal opens when spells are whispered in some dark, forgotten tongue. What was not known is revealed and—uh oh—it’s something we never should have learned. Or maybe it’s better to know, to find the text or the amulet or the buried body to end the terror? We need the chain saw if we want to understand how America works. The slaughterhouse that calved a thousand maniacs means learning that everything you thought was true is wrong. Understanding politics and ideology means taking apart the assumptions that live like parasites in our minds. Chain saw horror does that. It doesn’t worry about the relationship of map and territory. It assumes the map has been lost, or drawn with malevolent purpose, and the territory is a place where you are about to die. 4.I Used to Hate the Water NOT EVERYONE in the United States wanted to turn the American myth into a slaughterhouse on a Texas homestead, or a California one. By the summer of 1975, another film seduced an even wider audience. The American public showed its Janus face by turning out in droves for a summer fairy tale with a monster in it, even as catching a midnight showing of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre remained a whispered dare, teenagers and adults watching with guilt and delight. Jaws came to swallow the entertainment industry whole. At a moment in the history of Hollywood and the United States when the national success story seemed to have ended with screams and the ear-splitting sound of a chain saw, the blockbuster, for the first time, became a perennial part of summer. The term referred to a film so popular, and so mainstream, that hopeful viewers lined up around whole city blocks waiting for their tickets. Steven Spielberg started the trend of Hollywood making an endless summer of high-concept films that sold tickets, tubs of popcorn, and colas by the tens of millions. Spielberg came of age with Tobe Hooper but took a different set of lessons from both film school and the America of the fifties and sixties. It’s impossible to imagine the young, thin enfant terrible saying his blockbuster Jaws was a movie about America, even though it inadvertently shows an even more frightening side of the country’s shadowy self than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It’s a story of American innocence and ability to triumph, a bloody companion piece to his friend and sometime collaborator George Lucas’s American Graffiti (1973). Huge crowds loved Jaws and shoveled 260 million dollars into ticket booths during a recession (1.2 billion in current dollars). No film had ever performed like this before, both at the box office and in a new world of movie merchandizing with iron-on Jaws T-shirts, books, and even a board game. Spielberg conjured an alternative vision of reality to Hooper’s dark Massacre. Awash in vivid blues, Jaws combined horrific death with a hopeful message about a can-do America. Anecdotes tell of American audiences breaking out in a home-team-scores-a-touchdown cheer as the monster goes KABLOW! after a million-to-one shot from Roy Scheider’s rifle to an oxygen tank the shark has ingested. In the final scene, Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss have blown the shark to bits and swim off into a sunset on a makeshift raft, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer of the seventies. Everybody is safe. Amity Island, the focus of the creature’s attacks, seems more like a mild, quiet suburb than an island facing off with a monster. Before the giant shark comes along, the biggest worries are kids “karate chopping picket fences.” It’s more than a geographical island—it’s an island out of time, America’s dream of itself in the fifties, a place where you’d never know Vietnam or Watergate ever happened. Everyone is inexorably middle class and happy until the shark shows up to ruin it. But then our heroes kill it and America can go on dreaming the dream of itself. Chain Saw and Jaws, appearing at the same cultural turn, are the twin poles of American imagination at a crucial moment in the country’s history. Jaws offered a nightmare, but one met on the way to a dream come true. It’s a film manifesto for an America where men with square jaws destroy monsters. It’s not Tobe Hooper’s warning about the monsters hatched from the dragon’s teeth America sowed in its own soil, about what had been and about what was coming, what was coming for all of us. Who could go watch Jaws and cheer while the country faced defeat, economic decline, and maleficence at the highest level of government? Didn’t Hooper’s dark vision make more sense? A film like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre becoming so intensely popular needs no explanation; it suited the times. But the sun-drenched seascapes of Amity Island are straight out of a fifties creature feature, and they promised escape from very real fears. How could such different films become so popular in the same country? To understand this is to understand the nature of the American empire and its citizens’ profound lack of interest in confronting that reality. It’s different from every imperial power that’s come before it. It pretends not to exist. It’s willing to use lethal violence or to celebrate it uproariously, and then to forget it, to imagine its consequences are less important than they are. The public goes along—except when they suddenly don’t—but then reveal once more their genius for moderation, simplistic thinking, and unwillingness to face the truths of the world that gives them the iPhone and The Bachelor, golf carts and local breweries, Whole Foods selling you fresh fruits out of season and delivery services that bring an insane variety of goods—unimaginable bounties for 99.9 percent of humans who have ever lived—to your door within hours. The horror emerges and then subsides, the corpse appears only to vanish, the past surfaces and then gets a premature burial, the shark attacks but a hero blows it to chum. America, and Americans, lighted on an innovative way of being imperial. We see this in our horror fictions and we find it in the difficulty many Americans exhibit, especially those who thrive most within its system, of even thinking of their country as an empire. The hard truths remain waiting, even when ignored. The story of empire traces its way down the centuries, leaving eerie glyphs not always easy to decipher. The facts never have the tensile strength of memory’s fiber-optic cable. We tell our stories to distort the real story. Although this book explores horror and the empire’s influence on the present cultural moment, it also questions what we think we know about the deeper past. It puts the idea that we are the white hats under a hot light in a dark room. It asks whether we are telling the truth when we look at some atrocity and say, “this is not who we are.” Once, the chain saw and the shark tried to make a movie together. Poltergeist (1982) joined the murderer’s row of classic horror films. It took a switchback path to production, creating confusion about who exactly shaped the film, Spielberg the producer or Hooper the director. The confusion at one point became a legal dispute, and it was not only fans who took sides. The Directors Guild of America ultimately awarded Hooper a cash settlement and accused Spielberg and MGM of downplaying the indie horror director’s role while celebrating the film as another triumph by the maestro of the mainstream. Apparently, Poltergeist had its beginning, sort of, when Spielberg wrote a script called Watch the Skies. When Hooper came on as director, he scrapped the plot that catered to the renaissance of alien obsessions from the fifties that dominated the seventies. Hooper worked since the release of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre on a film about the supernatural and the secret history of the suburbs, and that’s largely the film he made. Poltergeist follows the Freeling family into a home built in a “planned community,” an old idea but a much more common phrase in the 1980s. It’s the quintessential American no-place, an LA suburb called Cuesta Verde, following Californian and Floridian real estate in its habit of taking banal phrases and making them “exotic” by translating them into Spanish. The sprawl is advertised as “where dreams comes true.” In a Hooper film we need no further warning that this is nightmare country. Cuesta Verde incarnates apex Southern California just as Southern California acts as avatar for apex America. The fictional neighborhood could be Chula Vista in its infancy or anywhere in Orange County. Hooper set his night terror in the middle of what poet and essayist Alice Bolin called “the insanity of LA’s epically unsustainable urban development” with the unspeakable secret being that “it was all on purpose.” She’s commenting on Joan Didion’s 1990 observation that LA embodied “a new kind of city, one that would seem to have no finite limits, a literal cloud on the land.” Didion and Bolin could be describing the whole of U.S. history. A booming sprawl of an empire never contained by borders, each crucial, misguided step in its manifest destiny fully planned and mysteriously financed, with Americans ever after squinting at the spiraling chaos and asking how we got here. Hooper embraced that chaos, and we are in his dark dream of America, despite the widespread belief that Spielberg took the reins from his director. It’s evident Spielberg’s enthusiasms are there. It is truly very frightening, and yet you can tell Hooper pulls his punches. The spookiness is decidedly PG. Spielberg did create, by Hooper’s own account, a pointless sequence involving a child and an astral journey to the afterlife that bloated the film by twenty minutes. He possibly held the idea that she would end the haunting in a cloudbank of “and a little child shall lead them” schmaltz—a trope that is to Spielberg as inscrutable as endangered blonde women are to Hitchcock. But Hooper brought the chain saw to mainstream audiences. He happily included political commentary, showing boomers with a hippie, or at least a doobie-filled, past that are really starting to dig Reagan. This is distinctly un-Spielbergian, as he made sure to erase any references to current American politics, and drug use, from Peter Benchley’s script for Jaws. The closest we get to politics in the war on the Great White is the vague suggestion that small-town mayors in bad ties are often insouciant. More importantly, Hooper did what Spielberg never would; he placed the horror in the cold guts of the American home. In the Spielberg-verse, the inhuman never threatens the security of American domestic spaces in films, never making it beyond the shoreline. The uncanny comes as space brethren, poorly disguised Christ figures, ETs, and close encounters. They are either cuddly friends or quite literally messianic messengers who’ll soon have you joyously sculpting your mashed potatoes and then going to live with them in the mothership. Hooper’s vision is far bleaker. The dénouement is pure chain saw, in fact recalling the opening frames of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This time it’s not the sandy loam of Texas that regurgitates its dead. It’s the family swimming pool. The whole Freeling family runs screaming from their home in the night while an eldritch portal pulls their house into Hades and part of the planned development where dreams come true goes down into the dark. We will enter that darkness. The phantoms of a thousand Native American massacres are roused throughout this book. The roots of America’s wars are about what happened in 1965 or 2001, but also in 1918, 1898, and before. Beware how the roots of history clutch and call us back to a past as criminally deranged as the present. Empire’s shadow even blankets the golden haze of World War II, that supposed “good war.” It’s all a story about America, the chain saw, and the shark. 5.Built on Top of a What?? THE ROOTS of American power, memory, and historical amnesia are deep, reaching back through the centuries when a handful of violent settler societies with their minds set on commerce seized lands belonging to the Pequot, the Yamasee, and the Powhatan, some of the earliest Native American peoples destroyed in conflict with colonies in New England, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Clinging to a narrow band of colonial outposts from Georgia to Massachusetts, white settlers began the slow and steady conquest of a continent, killing Indians, felling trees, slaughtering animals, and fencing open land in a “new world” that previously held no concept of private property. By contrast, the Europeans developed a concept of property so expansive as to include human beings. The enslavement of African people in Virginia began early in the seventeenth century, more than 150 years before the American Revolution. Colonies like the Carolina settlement included the right to own African people in their charters. Early in colonial America, some poor whites worked without wages as indentured servants. The practice died out, however, and indentured servants eventually earned their freedom. Colonial law regarded African men and women as chattel, literally “movable property” like a cow or a wagon. White supremacy became more than a domestic institution. Racism played the central role in the creation of the American empire. Its shadows whisper all around us in the present, a nightmare from which the world has never roused. Horror films have dealt with the memory of America’s imperial beginnings by turning to the trope of the haunted Indian burial ground, a notion so well-worn that it has acquired the acronym IBG. The Amityville Horror (1979), The Shining (1980), Pet Sematary (1989), and the Poltergeist series (1982–1999) all deal in various ways with the idea that, as the famous line from Pet Sematary has it, “the sour ground” became a place of darkness because of its history. Both Colin Dickey and Shea Vassar describe how, somewhere at the edge of white awareness, there lurks the realization that American capital built an empire on the remains of the dead. The idea has become so deeply imbricated into American culture that in Poltergeist (1982), the unlucky Freelings seek reassurance that their extraordinarily haunted house is not built on an Indian burial ground. Even The Onion hasn’t been able to leave the idea alone, in 2011 using the darkly funny headline “Report: Economy Failing Because U.S. Built on Ancient Indian Burial Grounds.” Empire’s beginnings are soaked in blood, in genocide. Many know about the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, in part because of the American Indian Movement’s (AIM) insistence that the country face it in 1973. Few know that hundreds of massacres resulting in tens of thousands of deaths (and often the enslavement of survivors) occurred from the period of earliest settlement. English settlers murdered and enslaved Powhatan people in a 1609 war of extermination. In 1704, for example, Governor James Moore of the Carolina colony marched a volunteer militia all the way to northern Florida to slaughter one thousand Apalachee people and enslave two thousand more. This was one of dozens of such incidents that occurred before the American Revolution and the beginning of expansion across the continent. Frontier mercenaries known as “rangers,” early America’s version of “civilian contractors,” slaughtered the Cherokee in Georgia and East Tennessee and did the same to the Shawnee of the Ohio Valley. Several early presidential administrations (often cliques of land speculators who stood to make fortunes as the settlers moved west) gave themselves “plausible deniability” about some of the worst atrocities. In the seventy years after the United States became a nation, almost continuous warfare carved out a continental empire, killing hundreds of thousands of Native peoples and turning those who survived into colonial subjects penned in apartheid-style homelands. Massive fortunes accrued to white elites, and plantation slavery spread southwest. The psychopathic violence of counterinsurgency masterminds like Andrew Jackson made political careers. Jackson prepared himself for the presidency by ruthlessly destroying the Red Stick rebellion in the spring of 1814, a group of guerrilla fighters who received their nom de guerre from their crimson spears. In what is now northern Alabama, the so-called Battle of Horseshoe Bend made way for the creation of the states of Alabama and Mississippi, both slaveholding strongholds. This battle amounted to nothing more than a massacre of eight hundred Muskogee, Shawnee, and African insurgents who fought as “red sticks.” Like the décor fashioned from human skin, and the mask of Leatherface himself in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Jackson’s troops stitched saddles and horse bridles from the skin of their enemies and delivered scalps of fighters, of children, of old men, as souvenirs for “the women of Tennessee.”11 In the next century, because of the American empire’s overwhelming preponderance of military power, the United States and the world wandered through the dark carnival. Wars of extermination on the empire’s frontier were only the beginning. The human catastrophe the history textbooks file under “westward expansion” served only as precursor for the global violence of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 6.Horrors, Foreign and Domestic HARRY TRUMAN seemed to have a fine time of it when he served as an artillery officer in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. His letters home to Bess Truman are a peculiar cocktail of saccharine sentiment, blockheaded observations, and sheer bloodlust. Amid sweet nothings, he casually mentioned his pleasure at helping to lob “1,800 shells at the Huns.” All in all, Truman declared World War I a “terrific experience,” a sentiment only a young American of below-average intelligence could hold in 1917–1918. He did regret, as he said in one of his idiosyncratic love letters, that the warring powers signed the armistice when they did. The peace that settled on the blood lands of the western front on November 11, 1918, meant Truman would miss out on the chance to “detonate Germany and cut off a few of the Dutch [common slang for German] kids’ hands and feet and scalp a few of their old men but I guess it will be better to make them work for France and Belgium for fifty years.”12 Truman wore the uniform of a country about to become the next great power. The American home front suffered nothing in comparison to every other major participant in the global war, really almost nothing on its own terms. However, American combat troops suffered horrific casualties, especially given the short period the AEF engaged the German army: 116,000 dead and 266,000 wounded, a number that does not include the hundreds of thousands the war traumatized mentally. American culture simply did not respond to the cataclysm of the war the way much of the rest of the world did. While France, Britain, and Germany built cyclopean ossuaries to hold the mangled dead (Menin Gate, Douaumont, Tannenberg), statues of cheerful and brave doughboys littered America. In fact, even when it came to recalling the broad-gauge murder of the World War I, the business of America was business. E. M. Viquesney, originally of Spencer, Indiana, proved equal parts talented sculptor and virtuoso advertising shill with his The Spirit of the American Doughboy. In 1921 he sculpted a monument of America’s soldiers of the Great War that presented one of them emerging onto an imagined battlefield, the statue’s hollowed-out limbs made of cheap sheet bronze advancing toward an unseen enemy, right arm raised and left arm holding a Springfield rifle. Viquesney mass-produced the image, and city halls and civic groups across the country purchased the adventuresome-looking sculpture to place in front of courthouses, on major thoroughfares, in front of Veterans of Foreign Wars or American Legion halls, and on college campuses. In fact, the first appeared on the campus of Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, where it aged poorly in weather, nearly forgotten for a century. Finally, its shoddy condition caused enough embarrassment that the college replaced it.13 The emerging American consumer economy of the 1920s allowed individuals to break off a piece of Great War memory and take it home with them. Along with monuments for purchase by civic groups, Viquesney manufactured twelve-inch miniature figures of the statue and even a version of the statue in which the doughboy’s triumphantly extended right arm held . . . a light bulb. Advertising copy for this desktop ode to the American fighting man promised the piece would serve to memorialize “the intrepid Doughboy’s part in raising the hope-inspiring light of democracy for a world in darkness.” You could select a shade in “decorated parchment” or “elaborate silk.” There was no need to worry if you, like so many Americans in the twenties, found yourself low on cash but high on patriotism. You could buy on credit. The ad, in full caps, offered the unintentionally chilling phrase, “WE FINANCE YOU.”14 Viquesney never became immensely wealthy from The Spirit of the American Doughboy, but he made enough—partially from investment in local projects in Indiana—that he weathered the crash of ’29 with panache. But despite his promise that the spirit of the doughboy carried “a hope-inspiring light,” he himself suffered from depression exacerbated by personal loss and poor health. He asphyxiated himself in his garage in the autumn of 1946. The Spirit of the American Doughboy kept marching without his maker. In fact, he’s marching on a hundred years later. Since 1918, when, as is sometimes said, the British Empire won a war through suffering a horrific defeat, the island nation slowly began to lose the world it built for itself. America inherited that world and its problems but came up with new solutions . . . insidious solutions. But first, the muscular nation needed to secure the home front. Too many of America’s own citizens, including those denied the basic rights of citizenship, would not get with the program of shifting from an erstwhile republic into an economic and military empire. So the bleak world the United States built after the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 not only wreaked havoc around the globe. Americans, the working class, people of color, any dissenters, all suffered as their nation-state became a global leviathan. The foot soldiers of the new empire suffered first. While Viquesney made them archetypes in bronze, actual veterans returned home in 1919 with no economic prospects, having served a government unwilling to provide aid. World War I veterans anticipated what had popularly become known as a bonus payment from the government. The bonus, in the past paid in land as well as money, represented an imagined difference between what the soldier could earn at home as opposed to the pittance made as doughboys. For many, it embodied a kind of social covenant and a safety net that aided veterans after the economic disruption of military service.15 President Calvin Coolidge dismissively referred to the idea of the bonus as “patriotism which is bought and paid for,” though Congress overrode his veto and granted more than three million bonus certificates to veterans that they could redeem over time or borrow against. After the beginning of the Great Depression in ’29, President Herbert Hoover effectively rescinded this plan. Unemployed and deeply embittered, twenty-five thousand veterans marched on Washington with over ten thousand men and their families setting up Hooverville in Anacostia Flat, a muddy river bottom of the Potomac. The Senate declined to pass a bill paying out the bonus, and Hoover sent regular army troops, tanks, and machine guns to clear the tent city. The aggressive move resulted in one hundred injuries and wounds. Some veterans attempted to set up camp again, and this time Washington police fired on them, killing William Hushka and Eric Carlson. Both are buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Much-reduced bonus payments would eventually come in 1936. Some former doughboys took the route of many European Great War veterans and became the muscle for the new right-wing nationalisms that flourished like a sward of noxious weeds in the twenties. The boys back from France, especially those associated with the wealthier, upper-middle-class leadership of the American Legion, followed the lead of Mussolini’s veteran “Blackshirts” in seeking to stamp out even the hint of homegrown socialism. The head of the American Legion praised Mussolini’s war on “Bolshevism.”16 Admiration for Il Duce sometimes led to directly copying the violence of the Italian fasci. Such mob violence certainly did not limit itself to horror film screenings. On the first anniversary of the armistice in 1919, members of the American Legion attacked a hall belonging to the Centralia, Washington, branch of the International Workers of the World (the IWW, better known as Wobblies). Members of the organization, already harassed by local authorities and the public mobs who often worked with them, had the temerity to fight back. In the running gunfight that followed, ranging all over the streets of Centralia, they killed four legionnaires.17 Centralia authorities, aided by a posse, arrested eleven of the Wobblies. On November 12, members of the Legion cut the town’s power lines and used the thick darkness to break into Centralia’s jail and seize one of the imprisoned IWW members, Wesley Everest, himself a Great War veteran. The lynch mob murdered him in an especially ghastly fashion, then let his corpse lie on the river bottom overnight. Everest’s killers retrieved the corpse the next day, dropping it like a rag doll on the floor of the local jail, a rope still around its neck. Everest had become an IWW member soon after the war. Like many of his comrades, he returned home to a sluggish labor market at a time when a small number had made enormous fortunes, including some whose businesses had boomed because of the war. Furious at how the lumber barons reduced his fellow workers to penury and a nomadic, essentially homeless existence, he came to believe deeply in the IWW radical program to dismantle capitalism in America. His murder offered a lethal response from the freebooting barons of American industry. The country’s economic power brokers faced down open and violent dissent before. During the railroad, coal, and steel phase of the industrial revolution, the nation’s ruling class made use of brutal paramilitary contractors like the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, the recently reformed National Guard, and even the U.S. Army itself to break strikes, hunt down labor leaders, and respond with lethal force against striking workers. States deployed the National Guard one hundred times between 1886 and 1893 alone. A few months before the Great War began in 1914, National Guard troops and a private paramilitary force deployed by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (part of the Rockefeller empire) machine-gunned and burned to death whole families of striking workers who lived in a tent city raised outside the company-owned town of Ludlow.18 The American empire abroad thrived in a bloody permaculture fertilized at home. The idea that America is a democracy and not an empire simply doesn’t square with the facts. Denial of the right to vote has been a continuing theme in American history. Disenfranchisement of African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and even the white working class has been a political reality backed by violence. Individual states in the Cold War passed laws restricting the rights of Americans who joined “communist-front” organizations and then created their own blacklists. Meanwhile, even before the digital age, the national security state practiced counterinsurgency at home as well as abroad. Since a 1978 law that allowed the FBI to continue spying on American citizens, the bureau asked for thirteen thousand warrants with only one ever denied.19 The Great War triggered the repressive power of government and corporate interests to coalesce. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the slightest peep out of dissenting political groups often led to power brokers responding with the bludgeon of a mailed fist. Seattle experienced a general strike in February of 1919, though one in which workers made exceedingly minor demands. The mayor received the aid of the U.S. Marine Corps to squash the effort. In the fall, police in Boston went on strike with the simple demand that city government allow them to join the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a moderate and arguably even conservative labor organization. Public officials around the country used terms like agents of Lenin and Bolshevik nightmare to describe their action. The threat of an intervention by the army again crushed the strike.20 Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer’s raids against suspected radicals are well known. The incidents of mob violence and local repression that accompanied them have not become a part of American memory. A Connecticut salesman spent six months in prison for praising Lenin’s intelligence. An Indiana jury acquitted a man for killing an immigrant who had said “to hell with the United States” a bit loudly and in public. The rule on Amity Island has always been to never bring up the shark, especially on the Fourth of July.21 Official acts of repression also unleashed lynch mobs against African American communities and individuals. The fear of political subversion made a poison alliance with white supremacy. The violence visited on sharecroppers in Alabama and Arkansas who attempted to unionize provides an example. But, with savage irony, mobs also targeted Black communities if they became cradles of small-scale capitalism, havens for an emerging Black middle class behind what W. E. B. Du Bois called “the veil” of Jim Crow. The pogrom against the “Black Wall Street” of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 has become the best known of such incidents. However, white supremacist violence erupted against African Americans in Washington, D.C., as early as the summer of 1919, some of it directed specifically against Black veterans of the Great War. Outside of these large-scale assaults, seventy-eight Black men died at the hands of lynch mobs in 1919, many of them burned alive in public rituals, enacted amid a carnival atmosphere.22 Leaders of heavy industry and finance could afford to act with near impunity against working-class Americans. The United States had been a debtor nation in 1914, but most of the world found itself indentured to the nation by war’s end in 1918. By 1929, Great Britain owed the United States an amount equivalent to one half their national income. Much has been made of the effect of the payment of war reparations by Germany, though the practice had long been a part of European peace settlements. The real story concerns how the United States saw the payment of German marks to Britain and France as crucial to maintaining a credit squeeze on their allies, keeping much of Europe servicing a mortgaged war. One financial writer for The Boston Journal made this plain, crowing triumphantly that, “Europeans must pay tribute for years to come.”23 So emerged the roaring twenties, a state of mind rather than a historical era. Some of the myths of the twenties actually happened. A nation of Gatsbys held parties for the extravagantly wealthy, and bathtub gin, jazz, and short skirts gilded life with glamour even for some of the plebeians. Millionaires became multi-millionaires. Many Americans who bought into the decade’s optimism looked askance at socialists and even organized labor. They believed that captains of industry wrangled their impossible wealth on the frontier of America’s Wild West economy through sheer force of will. Moreover, in this world of new American possibility, they themselves might own at least a small strip of beachfront on Amity Island one day . . . at least a little cottage with oceanfront access so they could go back into the water. By 1929, the entanglement of American money with the international debtor economy led the country into crisis. The shark had started feeding. America coughing caused the rest of the world to die of pneumonia in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. But in truth what historian Eric Hobsbawm describes as the “house of cards” created by the first (but not the last) American effort to shape the world economy had come crashing down.24 7.Weird Mystery Tales THE GREAT Depression represented a crisis for American capitalism and also suggested a crisis of confidence. Left-wing organizations, including a public and popular Communist Party of the United States of America, drew one hundred thousand new members and made allies in labor unions and left-leaning organizations. Many Americans wanted change in the thirties, a period that has become known as the country’s Red Decade. And yet, optimistic images of the American spirit like the unfortunate Viquesney public square monuments and parlor room tchotchkes reveal that much of the nation saw itself as a kind of Amity Island fifty-five years before Steven Spielberg’s Jaws (1975) gave the image to the world. In the minds of many middle-class white Americans, their towns and cities functioned like privately owned resorts, and the country itself could forget that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it had been a battleground of many nations, some European and others native to the continent. Politicians, who represented the interests of the wealthiest Americans and the class that aspired to be like them, could even speak of “isolationism,” a country able to hide behind its two walls of water after having done its part in a world war. Isolationism has largely been a myth that really means “the United States will make unilateral decisions rather than forming meaningful alliances.” During the era isolationism supposedly shaped American standards of international behavior, the country launched incursions into Mexico, occupied two Caribbean nations, toppled the government of Nicaragua, and seized major islands in the Pacific and dozens of small islands for what was rapidly becoming the American tradition of building multiple military bases in every region of the globe. The pretense of isolation extended to culture as well. European veterans scripted, produced, directed, and acted in what would become the first silent horror films, but Americans eschewed the emerging genre. When Variety reviewed Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the entertainment magazine tried to interest American audiences by calling it “a mystery story told in the Poe manner,” though it also warned them “it is morbid.” A much stronger, indeed violent, reaction to the film appeared in the streets of Los Angeles when Miller’s Theatre attempted to premier it in May of 1921. A two-thousand-person-strong protest, ginned up by William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers, prevented the film from being shown. Moving Picture World, a bubblegum guide for movie fans, wrote Caligari off as more evidence of “degenerate German invention.”25 Lingering anti-German sentiment left over from the Great War explains some of the negative responses to a motion picture that would play an important role in reimagining what a film could do, what it could be about, and how it could call forth new emotions. But something even more pungent, part of the bone and marrow of belief in a particular kind of America, called forth these violent responses. Most Americans did not like horror, or more accurately they thought it had nothing but ill intent. In fact, Americans seldom to never used the word horror as an adjective for films, fiction, stage plays, carnival shows, or other entertainment outlets. The use of the word weird in describing most any storytelling that departed from formulaic American flicks featuring action, romance, and comedy (often all at once) predated the Great War. Reviewers often described turn-of-the-century magic shows, especially those that encouraged audiences to view their illusions as the supernatural creeping across the boundaries of the rational, as weird. Any film that suggested mystery, supernatural or not, received the label weird. Early film magazines regularly described the weirdness of comedies that featured humorous ghosts, even when they turned out to be dreams or a kind of Scooby-Doo experience of a human pretending to be a visitant from beyond. The cinema scholar who has written the most about how Americans received and reviewed “weird” films, Kendall R. Phillips, sees a peculiar turn in attitudes toward them. By the time of the Great War, reviewers for magazines like Variety had begun to connect spooky topics on screen with “foreign” productions that are also described as “ghastly” or pretentious. The term weird went, Phillips writes, from being a general term for tales of the fantastic “to connoting films that were decidedly foreign and, ultimately, un-American.”26 Americans wanted their entertainment to let them visit an Amity Island without the shark. Threats to the beautiful heroes of cinema had to be of the criminal, often inept, variety in the 1910s and early ’20s. Americans raised monuments to the happy warriors their doughboys had supposedly been or used the image as peculiar reading lamps or parlor lighting, as the ads for the patriotic saint statues said, “in a world of darkness.” But as they did, large numbers of actual veterans fared poorly in the postwar years, a fact that helps us understand the otherwise inexplicable rage Hearst could stir over the showing of a somewhat challenging German art film that Americans hadn’t exactly clamored to see in the first place. 8.Empire’s Butcher Bill THE SECOND World War accelerated the options opened to the new world power as the United States took control of military bases all over the world. Bases leased from Britain in exchange for U.S. arms marked a kind of formal changing of the imperial guard, the last wheezing gasp of “Rule, Britannia!” An aggressive American foreign policy created flash points of conflict with the Soviet Union that provided numerous opportunities for the United States to extend its reach. Japan and islands seized from it like Okinawa gave the United States far-flung ports of call. West Germany hosted hundreds of U.S. bases during most of the Cold War. But this wasn’t enough and so, sometimes, the United States just took what it wanted without apology. In 1953, the United States seized a sizable chunk of Indigenous lands in Greenland, giving its inhabitants only a brief deadline before the U.S. Army bulldozed their communities. This became a forward base for America’s nuclear triad and is the root of one of the Trump administration’s frequent non sequiturs, a briefly touted plan to “buy Greenland.” The small-footprint empire that the national security state thought it had made had at least as much, perhaps more, destructive effects on the world than earlier powers. The large land and naval empires of the past ruled oppressively but, in cases like Austria-Hungary or the Ottomans, they also held in check and even salved conflicts between the peoples within their borders for hundreds of years. American hegemony had the opposite effect, ginning up older conflicts and even creating new ones. Since 9/11, the contours of the American empire have become increasingly clear. Ironically, President George W. Bush—until 2016 perhaps the chief executive most ill-informed about American foreign policy and one who surrounded himself with a coterie of operatives with decades of secrets to keep—spoke most openly and forthrightly about American imperial imperatives. In September of 2002, what became known as the Bush Doctrine called for preemptive strikes against any nation, at any time, in order to make possible “free and open societies.” It also, for the first time in American history, declared that the United States would not allow any nation to challenge its military preeminence as had the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Karl Rove, often referred to as “Bush’s brain,” announced matter-of-factly that “we’re an empire now . . . we’re history’s actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” An openness about the expansive use of American power continued, transmogrifying under the Trump regime into weaponized tweets that advertised threats, insults, ambitions, and sometimes even explicit initiatives—empire gone viral. The immense popularity of horror, and the violence horror revels in, restages the horror of empire’s reach for screaming audiences and chilled readers, who can’t take their eyes off the mayhem on screen and page. It’s the nature of living in an empire. Life in the empire means, above all, experiencing violence as a way of life. The shape this takes depends very much on whether you are a citizen, a citizen with limited constitutional and cultural protections, or a subject with no rights that the unimaginable colossus of American power sees itself bound to protect. But whether you are part of a wedding party slaughtered by a U.S. drone attack in Yemen or a bored middle-class dad in Kansas flipping between news channels featuring stories about school shootings and footage of explosions in places you couldn’t locate on a map, lethal threat and force are the coin of the imperial realm.27 So it has ever been with empires. The Assyrians of the ancient Near East welcomed you to their cities with monuments made of the skulls of their enemies, stele that celebrated the destruction of whole civilizations and their peoples. The Roman Empire brought its captive opponents in chains to parade them through the streets of their capital. Even Victorian Britain featured carnivals and freak shows that displayed the subjects of the empire as primitive, exotic, and defeated. The British Museum became a warehouse of objects ripped from the hands of colonized peoples. We have horror. It speaks our language of violence and conquest, sometimes to alarm us and sometimes to tell us that daddy vanquished the monster under the bed. Multiple Hugo Award–winner N. K. Jemisin’s now classic The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms featured a scene where the protagonist confronts the way the imperial power that runs her world legitimizes itself through lies, half-truths, and the general assumption of superiority. “They found so many ways to lie about the things they did,” she thinks. “It mocked the suffering of their victims.” It’s become very easy for us to lie about the things we do and to mock our victims’ suffering. Since Rove admitted the United States not only built an empire but could rearrange how the public conceives of reality, few Americans have been aware of the drone strikes that have killed civilians at weddings, at funerals, and in civilian refugee convoys. Living as a citizen of the empire means never having to think about it. Meanwhile, living as a subject, or victim, of the empire means never being able to forget it. Horror films are one of the few places the nature, the violence, and the failure of American power blinks in the unearthly light of the present, a blighted, ugly fog where you can find yourself wandering in a past they didn’t teach you about in school or looking into the abyss of a lost future. In Puerto Rico, you are ignored and disenfranchised with no voice to speak with and no vote to cast after being hit by a catastrophic Category 5 storm like 2017’s Hurricane Maria. In Sudan, your family grocery explodes after a drone strike, killing your brother and his wife because a “person of interest” who may or may not have been associated with Al-Qaeda or ISIS lived a block away. If you are an eighteen-year-old Marine Recon recruit between 2003 and 2021, you hump your way through a desert toward mountains likely hived with caves of Taliban fighters. You are about to become a casualty of a war that started before you were born. Privileged America doesn’t understand all the ways reality differs from their experience of it. There is a shadow moving at the edge of our consciousness, and the maestros of our dreams remind us it waits there. 9.The Thing on the Stairs “AS SOON as I looked up, there it was, and it was horrible.” Ray Bradbury, a little kid in the twenties, experienced waking nightmares of a monster balefully watching him from the top of the stairs. He remembered how the shadowed presence waited for him nearly every night. He would scream, sometimes fall backward onto the floor at the ghastly presence. He could recall, nearly ninety years later, his parents sighing and saying, “Oh my God, here we go again.”28 If a monster haunted the stairwell, a peculiar combination of rockets and dinosaurs filled his dreams with wonder. At the age of five, Bradbury thrilled to The Lost World, a 1925 film based on a novel by Arthur Conan Doyle that imagined explorers finding a land of dinosaurs in a remote part of the Amazon basin. He soon devoured Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. In his teens, he befriended the future genius of stop-motion animation Ray Harryhausen when both joined the Los Angeles chapter of the Science Fiction League. The boys had been enchanted by King Kong (1933), a film both friends claimed they saw hundreds of times. A love and terror of the primal, prehistoric beasts and behemoths from out of time lived in the same heart as an obsession with the future. It was one of the many paradoxes in the life of Bradbury that the man who wrote The Martian Chronicles and predicted everything from earbuds to artificial intelligence hated the internet, refused to type on a computer, did not want any of his work released in electronic format, and never learned to drive. And yet, he has inspired several generations with a dream of the stars. NASA gave the touchdown site of the Mars rover Curiosity the name Bradbury Landing when, on what would have been his ninety-second birthday, it settled into the waterless volcano-born regolith of the red planet.29 As a young teen, Bradbury found relief from his monsters by writing a short story a week in the basement of the UCLA library. Having discovered he could rent a typewriter for ten cents, his fingers began clattering away. Only death chilled them to a halt in 2012. Science fiction and horror are siblings, twins who have always tried and failed to cut a different figure from one another in the world. Dreams of the stars never really banished the terror of Bradbury’s monsters, and some of his anxieties remained decidedly earthbound. While he watched American society descend into political conformity in the 1950s, he wrote Fahrenheit 451 about a not-so-unbelievable near future where the “firemen” burn books because of the danger they present to the social order. Bradbury’s first short story collection, Dark Carnival, appeared in 1947 from Arkham House, a press first created for the sole purpose of publishing the short fiction of H. P. Lovecraft. The stories, many of them later republished in his 1955 The October Country, deal with how a skeleton might decide it could get along without its fleshier parts, how death might play the gentleman caller, and the kinds of things that live in the deep places of the earth. They are his monster at the top of the stairs. He went back to this nightmare land in the 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes, a book he originally called (again) Dark Carnival. Probably known to most for the Disney film adaptation, it’s arguably the best novel of Bradbury’s incredibly prolific career. In it, Cooger and Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to a small town, appearing in the middle of the night. The lights of the carnival draw the townspeople, all dissatisfied with their lives, into halls of mirrors, dark rides, the carnival clown’s uncomfortable laughter, and the call of the barker that offers wonder, mysteries, and something new, something different, if ultimately something as wicked as the title suggests. The small town as the setting for something dark to emerge has haunted the American imagination over the last century. It’s the little California village of Santa Mira where the pod people descend, a place where everyone knows everyone and there’s just the one local doctor in the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In 1960, Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone offered “A Stop at Willoughby,” the story of an anxiety-ridden businessman given the chance at a new life in a little burg. The viewer learns of the true horror of such seemingly anodyne hopes when the dream ends, and we face a more believable bleakness. Tobe Hooper imagined a lethal carnival coming to a little Florida town in The Funhouse (1981), a place where Mom and Dad tranquilly watch Bride of Frankenstein at home while a maniac dons a rubber mask of Boris Karloff’s monster and slaughters their kids in the ultimate haunted ride. In 1984, the nightmare comes to quiet Elm Street when Freddy Krueger extends his serrated glove in murderous rage, or maybe, the film asks us, it already lived in the hearts of the parents and their very eighties fear of the ill-kempt stranger. Stephen King’s Derry, Maine, was a little hamlet of human-made horrors before terrifying transdimensional clowns began croaking out of storm drains in the novel It, the 1990 TV limited series, and the more recent blockbuster films. Simple, staid, and very white America. When the sinister carnival comes, all the fairy tales that have poisoned us come alive and show their teeth. But even then, we’d rather believe the monsters are out there, and not in here with us. Even the most paranoid of Americans have found a way to tell themselves horror stories that are ultimately comforting. 10.The Greenbaum Effect THE WAY of the shark, the story of an innocent America fighting an outside threat, ultimately wants you to believe everything is just fine. Because of the nature of American exceptionalism, and because of the structures of imperial control that hardwire how Americans experience reality, some aspects of horror culture assure the watcher that everything’s okay and, in fact, really, really nice. Horror’s nightmares have not escaped the American dream of consumption and domination. One response to the confrontation with a reality in which “the worst thing is true” has been to amass stockpiles of weapons, suppress Black and Brown Americans, and attempt to exclude, colonize, and even exterminate perceived foreign threats. Don’t worry about the thing on the stairs. If you don’t want to be “woke,” it’s terribly cozy to sleep on peacefully while vast tracts of American horror culture allow you to float in Amity’s warm and woozy dream. But you can hear the chain saw’s death rattle in your dreams. Horror has also whispered about things we did not want to know, would prefer not to hear, about American history. These are stories that, while well-documented, you likely have either not heard of or, if you did, sounded like odd anecdotes. In some cases, you may think some of what you’ll read about can be dismissed as conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories are, like horror, tales of how the worst thing you imagine is true. “You think things are bad? Well, let me tell you, buddy, you don’t know the half of it.” Most readers likely view the conspiracy theorist as someone engaged in a granular drilling into obscure facts helped along by untreated mental illness who then freely dispenses the false information they have cobbled together. The idea of conspiracy has a complicated history, much too complex to relate here. Historians and cultural critics have sometimes viewed the American people as peculiarly vulnerable to false conspiracies. The American colonies premised their war for independence on the idea of a “conspiracy against the rights of Englishmen” among the king’s coterie of advisors. The country’s first partisan election in 1800 found John Adams supporters claiming Thomas Jefferson to be a member of the Illuminati who would confiscate Americans’ Bibles. In the midst of America’s post–World War II red scare, with many Americans certain Bolsheviks hid under their beds, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote his essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics” for Harper’s Magazine. Hofstadter claimed that a “paranoid style” of political rhetoric had been part of the American experience since the early national era and that it infected people across the political spectrum. In the 1950s, it just so happened that the American right had begun to suffer, “afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us,” but also by their “fantasies” about how the world works.30 The way Americans use conspiracy is, of course, not just a matter of the past. Tom Engelhardt wrote in 2015 that white Americans believe themselves the victims of various dark conspiracies by terrorists, even as they enjoy the protection of the most formidable arsenal of conventional and unconventional weapons in history. He notes that at a Trump rally in New Hampshire, audience members told horror stories about “‘training camps’ for terrorists” and a “new holocaust” taking place right there in New England with people “loaded into boxcars” and assassinated by ISIS. Then-candidate Trump said nothing to discourage such talk, as it fit his and his supporters’ “fact-challenged fantasy of a country,” a military and economic colossus somehow being victimized in lurid, gothic terms. Trumpism and its adherents may represent the apogee of what these and many other writers and thinkers have claimed about conspiracy theory. The belief in Qanon, the driving engine of Trumpism’s most devoted followers, seems to confirm America’s special identity as Conspiracy Nation. In order to understand these strange impulses, it appears we are forced to disagree with Hofstadter’s assertion that all of us have to deal with history’s afflictions, while conspiratorial thinkers are what he calls “double sufferers” in facing “the real world” and “their fantasies.” Is this true? What if the fantasies Americans accept as false conspiracy theories protect them from the real world? Perhaps it proved easier in the fifties to think about your government hiding a flying saucer than it is to look into how your country became the first, and so far the only, nation ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population. Or in the 1980s it seemed anything but comforting to tell myths about Satanists who murdered innocents at will. But perhaps it proved more salutary to the mind than the well-documented fact that your country engaged with terrorists, gunrunners, and international drug cartels to funnel arms to a band of mercenaries plotting to overthrow a legally elected government in Central America, or that the nation bears responsibility for brutal dictatorships ranging from the Iranian shah to Idi Amin to the Khmer Rouge? The strange story of Dr. Corydon Hammond and the illusory “Dr. Greenbaum” best illustrates this tendency of false conspiracy theories to add an extra layer of confusion to the nation’s maleficence. Hammond gave us a perfect template for this mythic bait and switch best called the Greenbaum effect. At a major medical conference in 1992, Hammond claimed that a Jewish scientist he identified simply as Greenbaum worked with the Nazis during World War II, teaching them various satanic mind control techniques learned from the kabbalah. After the war, this sinister figure came to the United States, where the CIA recruited him in their efforts to perfect brainwashing techniques. Somewhere in this anti-Semitic super villain fantasy, the highly peripatetic Greenbaum helped build a demonic infrastructure in America made up of, Hammond claimed, “tens of thousands of mental robots” engaged in everything from gunrunning to child molestation rings. All of this, he asserted, had the goal of creating “a Satanic Order that will rule the world.”31 Hammond’s claims call for chilly sarcasm. His use of age-old anti-Semitic tropes and laughable suggestions of satanic influence, however, hide the fact that almost every one of his unsustainable claims has a real-world analogue, a refracted mirror image of his easily falsifiable assertions. For example, we will see in this book that the CIA and the Pentagon did recruit Nazis to work toward American hegemony in the Cold War. The CIA also engaged in experiments with mind control, primarily with LSD, focused on the prison population. Former CIA directors have testified before Congress to this effect, and you can read the official history of the MK-Ultra experiments on the agency’s own website and in declassified documents available from the National Security Agency. And while the perpetual delusions of satanic covens kidnapping and killing children have zero basis in evidence, gunrunning has been a foundation of American foreign policy with a particularly egregious example, the Iran-Contra scandal, coming to light just a few years before Hammond made his claims.32 The Greenbaum effect is the tendency of Americans to choose outlandish and unsupported conspiracy theories while ignoring the conspiratorial actions of political and economic elites that are backed by evidence. It has shaped almost every decade of American life we’ll consider. Hammond’s early-1990s vacation from reality reveals that fictions immunize the public against the dark realities, neutralizing them and causing rational people to question other assertions of conspiracy, actual conspiracies, when they appear based on fact and from reliable sources. If a huge number of Americans are ineptly tangled in conspiratorial beliefs while ignoring actual conspiracies, another and perhaps larger proportion of the country uses conspiracy theory as a term of derision for any suggestion that powerful economic and political elites might collude together for unethical purposes. As this book explores in part 3, the CIA and a very willing American media engaged in a psy-ops campaign in 1968 to damn the ideas of the conspiracy theory and conspiracy theorist. Their conspiracy to spread conspiracy theory worked more thoroughly and quietly than most of their other efforts. One finds even among rational Americans, maybe especially among them, the tendency to use conspiracy theory to describe well-documented facts like the Iran-Contra arms deal, the CIA arming of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the 1980s, and the influence of the petroleum industry over the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. The same well-worn terms are used to describe evidence-free absurdities such as alien crafts being hidden away at Roswell, New Mexico, or a race of lizard people masquerading as the world’s ruling elite. In the meantime, false conspiracies, often weaponized by racism, flourish. Real conspiracies have hidden in plain sight. Now and again, as we’ll see with the flying saucer panic of the 1950s, the praetorians of American empire have seen the utility of the Greenbaum effect, pushing absurd fantasies to hide the empire’s work. This has allowed the American empire to have not only a “small footprint” but also in the lives of most of its citizens, an invisible one. It’s always been easy to sound a little crazy talking about American imperial power. The power of the Greenbaum effect and the public decision to regard some facts as Michael Parenti’s “dirty truths” makes it a risky endeavor to state the obvious. 11.Stranded in a Nightmare CONTEMPORARY AMERICANS feel stranded in their history. Those born in the seventies, eighties, or nineties, they called their grandparents “the greatest generation.” They learned a little about the Vietnam War, mostly from the movies. Something bad had happened there, something that was no one in particular’s fault. The events of 9/11 shocked them into supporting a war that cost them nothing. The upsurge of patriotism in the first Bush administration did not impel these Americans to volunteer for military service; recruiters noted in 2003 that few seemed to want to sign up for an actual war. The president told them to “get down to Disney World in Florida” and “go shopping.”33 But this is no tired polemic about the current generation’s inability to live up to some imagined greatness in the past. For the American generations who were your grandparents or great-grandparents, the world was easier than they admit—if they were white and in a relatively stable economic situation. World War II created the largest and most prosperous middle class not only in American history, but in the history of the world. The G.I. Bill, at least for white veterans, opened up the possibility of home ownership in suburbia and, because of segregation in the form of housing covenants, homogenous neighborhoods. The G.I. Bill allowed the U.S. government to build a white middle class quite literally from the ground up with subsidies for education as well as housing. Wages rose so high for middle-class Americans that they confessed themselves baffled by the changes from the 1930s. And, like the old false dream of the West, indeed like some biblical prophecy, deserts bloomed in California, Nevada, and Colorado after federal damming and irrigation projects. Hydroelectric power brought both light and water to what early white settlers had seen as a wilderness eager to kill them. National Geographic painted an image of the American frontier turned from threat to quiet paradise with “endless farms, all atwinkle, like stars along a manmade Milky Way.”34 Peace and security and more than the hint of the elusive notion of happiness. But, as often in peculiar dreams, many Americans felt a chill and knew something was very wrong. The American horror film that, as early as the 1950s, began to remind us again and again of the dues of empire, attracted fans who experienced these costs in their daily lives. The most escapist of such films, from the sometimes bizarrely optimistic sci-fi of the fifties to Jaws in the seventies, promised the bliss of terror quieted: there are threats, but we will defeat them and you, viewer, are part of that “we” that will benefit from the violence we will execute in your name. We are blowing up the shark for you. But the shark and its death throes offer only horror that comforts the comfortable. The shark is not just the predator gliding in the water out there. Imperial power does not simply do its wet work abroad. White supremacist and class violence have become the cost of maintaining the wealthy, the gated communities, the suburbs, and the illusion of safety. Global economic exploitation begins at home. Shadows purple mainland America, and even those who have thrived in the system see it from the corner of their eyes before quickly looking away. In many rural states, the death rate among infants, especially in marginalized groups, places the United States at thirty-second among the thirty-five wealthiest nations in infant mortality. In a country where everyone from paupers to billionaires report themselves as “middle class,” an aspirational assertion more than anything, one quarter of American households somehow subsist on under twenty-five thousand dollars a year. Many of these households include more than one wage earner, often working an exhausting and debilitating job in construction day labor or the fast-food industry. Nursing home assistants, day care employees, home health care workers, and EMTs are told to see their long and stressful weeks as vocations even as they struggle to pay bills. Tens of millions labor in the often-humiliating worlds of big-box retail, the daily uncertainty of the gig economy, the cubicled call center, or the dangerous, dehumanizing abattoirs of factory farming.35 Tobe Hooper understood this when he made his cannibalistic family out of people destroyed by their work in a slaughterhouse that didn’t need them anymore. Jordan Peele knew the same in 2019 when the film Us (U.S.?) featured the zombie-like “tethered” coming forth from an underground world to destroy the America of showboat SUVs and vacation homes more luxuriant than the houses much of America rents from a landlord, or from a bank. During the last century, the United States has been, writes historian Joshua B. Freeman, “as dominant in the world, in its own way, as Great Britain and Rome had been at the height of their empires.” But Freeman may underestimate American power, or at least what living in the empire has meant for the nation-state’s middle and upper classes. Inequality defends itself against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There’s not a question now of “how the other half lives” within the borders of the nation, what Americans took to calling “the homeland” in the early twenty-first century. Instead of “two halves,” there’s instead now 70 percent of us hustling and striving every day to live on declining wages and limited access to health care, a (relatively) stable and secure 29 percent of us whose privilege is more fragile than we think, and a tiny coterie of tech and investment oligarchs who have utterly unimaginable wealth counted not in the billions and often not even in the tens of billions but in the hundreds of billions. Hooper’s vision, the horror film literally reframing American history in all its primeval savagery, has remained the best and simultaneously the most politically subversive part of the genre. The alleged age of prosperity feared the atom bomb and the invasion of alien forces that would burn the suburbs to the ground, forces that could stand in for Soviets or Black Power advocates. While the country became mired in its violent campaigns in Southeast Asia, George A. Romero created an army of the dead. In the Reagan era, white flight took those who could still afford it from the suburbs to the exurbs, quiet towns now supposedly safe but threatened by unstoppable menaces like Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger. After 9/11, pronouncements of war without end and brutal retaliation against all conceivable enemies brought Romero’s zombies back from the dead while making torture sadism a Roman coliseum of the American mind at the local Cineplex. Horror waits for us at the end of empire’s dreaming.",

      "content": "1.Empire of Horror HORROR IS the dream life of American empire. Since the nineteenth century, the United States acted as an imperial power. The young nation seized land, killed Indigenous peoples, and battered to death any dissenters from its aggressive economic system. Once crowded into thirteen contentious little colonies that hugged the Atlantic, an empire born in blood emerged when these settler societies conquered most of Mexico and annihilated hundreds of small native nations that once lived from the Tennessee hills to the California coast, from Massachusetts Bay to the Ohio Valley. Many of the survivors of this genocide are today packed into hundreds of reservations, scattered across the continental and noncontiguous United States, where they sink below the poverty line at more than double the rate of the rest of America.1 The American empire slipped the confines of its continent in the early twentieth century. The new power’s shadow darkened Latin America and the Pacific, talons clawing for resources in East Asia. The Mexican War (1846–1848) doubled the size of the country. Hawaii and Alaska came next, along with the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, and a multitude of Pacific possessions. None would become states except for Hawaii and Alaska, and only after white men became the dominant political force in each region. Delivering a fatal blow to the decrepit Spanish imperium in the Spanish-American War (1898) allowed this rogue state to seize ports of call from the Caribbean to the doorstep of China. Cuba offered an experiment in which, after a military occupation from 1898 to 1902, a “republic” could come to life on the island so long as its government agreed to allow unilateral intervention, at any time, by the United States. The American military did occupy the country twice more and handpicked its leaders until the Cuban revolution in 1959. The United States never accepted that repudiation and continues to maintain a needlessly cruel economic boycott lingering now more than thirty years after the end of the Cold War. American presidents, military leaders, and captains of industry collaborated to create this new style of empire. The government could hold military bases in the Philippines without having to tangle any longer with the Indigenous insurgency that lasted more than a decade. U.S. Marines could protect business interests in Haiti during a nineteen-year occupation without having to administer it as a traditional colony. The U.S. military could run the Dominican Republic while keeping up the pretense of its independence. By the 1930s, Standard Oil (now Chevron) fully tied together American corporate and foreign policy interests by helping adjudicate an alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia that endures, profitably for both country’s ruling classes, into the present. Not only would oil interests benefit from the unlikely alliance. The partnership subsequently provided the United States with military bases in the region and the basis for an expanded network of bases in Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the United States officially structured its imperial holdings around the policy of “containing” communism. A new leadership cadre emerged in Washington, D.C., under the control of the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the cliques of unelected national security advisors that huddle around the country’s increasingly powerful executive branch. Closely linked to defense contractors with assets in the hundreds of billions, a relatively small and unsupervised economic and foreign policy elite waged secret wars, staged coups, and placed free-market-friendly dictators in power in Greece, Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Uganda, Iran, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Iraq. The end of the Cold War in 1991 changed none of this. The United States did not stand down with the dissolution of the Soviet Union—it launched invasions of both Panama and Iraq when their autocratic regimes, both longtime puppets of U.S. foreign policy and recipients of American arms and cash, stepped out of line. “Humanitarian interventions” into Haiti, Somalia, and the Balkans by the Clinton administration developed new military doctrine, tested weapons systems, and, in Kosovo, allowed for the building of enormous military bases to guard hoped-for oil pipelines that would bypass Russia and Iran. In the twenty-first century, the United States achieved a hegemony undreamt of by past imperial powers. Nearly 750 military bases, and hundreds of CIA black sites, are controlled by the United States around the globe. The majority of the world’s countries play host to American troops and weapons systems, 154 countries in 2020.2 U.S. covert ops does their work with impunity in nearly every country on earth. Regularly ignoring and sometimes even mocking the United Nations, American presidential administrations for fifty years have been breaking, amending, or simply ignoring multilateral treaties related to the UN Genocide Convention, the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, its own nuclear nonproliferation and test ban initiatives, and the International Criminal Court. The United States’ domination of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank gives the empire nearly limitless economic power over the debt of the world’s smallest and poorest nations. The Hollywood-McDonald’s-Disney industrial complex controls much of the global culture industry. Drone technology allows the United States to launch violent incursions in foreign nations that would have been considered acts of war in earlier times. Preemptive, bloody strikes in Sudan, Syria, Pakistan, and the Philippines have received limited news coverage from American media and a bored yawn from the American public. In November of 2021, news that American commanders kept secret a 2019 airstrike in Syria that killed eighty women and children spent only several hours as a top story for The New York Times online edition while no major news network provided coverage that lasted more than one minute. American power, covert and overt, over much of the globe leads analysts to describe the United States as a “hyperpower” rather than using the older language of superpower. The United States is also an empire whose culture industry makes horror films grossing more than half a billion dollars every year, many of them low-budget and highly profitable. Streaming services are cluttered not only with traditional horror films but with “true crime” documentaries that explore the most gruesome murders ever committed in surgical detail. Death’s own holiday, Halloween, has become a multi-billion-dollar affair that America has exported to other countries. It’s not paradoxical that an empire built on very real horror consumes horror as part of its regular entertainment. However, horror plays more than one role in the empire’s entertainment industry. Americans have, as Daniel Immerwahr described in his 2019 book How to Hide an Empire, worked assiduously to disguise their imperial design, even from themselves. Thus, some of our tales of terror are more oblique because we’d rather see ourselves as the shining city on a hill and not a global behemoth. So we tell horror stories that allow us to forget, that tell us of monsters beyond our borders and heroes that destroy them for us. And yet, horror also offers a shadowy mirror. It reveals truths and poses questions, tells us that we are the monsters that ignore borders in our insatiable hungers. The white American notion of the self—ruddy, open-faced, a bit innocent as it determinedly undertakes its mission to be what former secretary of state Madeleine Albright called “the indispensable nation”—stares into the glass only to find something twisted and not quite sane staring back. Despite the differences in horror fictions, despite how they offer radically different versions of the American dream, they always center violence. One kind of horror makes us yearn to turn the lights on and the other keeps the lights on the whole time for us. But both explore or exploit the violence of empire, critiquing it or imagining it as necessary for the preservation of the most prosperous, most dangerous nation on earth. The realities come to us in our cultural REM state. Our dependence on various sadisms to maintain the nation’s hegemony has caused two different dreams to emerge in the American unconscious. Both dreams have a darkness, even if one represses its cruelest assumptions. The first is a dream of safety and security. Most American citizens do not think of themselves as living in an empire but instead in a great nation that mostly does good things. The occasional failing, like the toppling of a government in a violent coup or the murder of civilians in an air strike, is “not who we are.” The world may be full of enemies of our freedom, but walls fashioned by the national security state, and actual concrete, protect us from “blowback.” This term, first coined in a secret history commissioned by the CIA and introduced to the public by former cold warrior turned critic of empire Chalmers Johnson, refers to unintended and unplanned consequences of the American empire’s most secret crimes. These actions are unknown to American citizens but unforgotten and unforgivable to its victims in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. When we screen the sunnier side of imperial assumptions, the horror film offers monsters marked for death from the beginning. Film or folklore predicates their existence on the monsters’ eventual destruction. Our heroes, often dealing with creatures who emerge from islands and maelstroms beyond the borders of America’s cordon sanitaire or violate U.S. airspace in their flying saucers or with their leathery wings, defeat the evil that threatens our safety and our sanity. These films, these dreams of innocence, tell us that the monsters are not unlike the psychos who attacked the Twin Towers on 9/11. Their motives are unclear, they are “evildoers” who have apparently attacked us for our inherent goodness. This book explains that Americans’ love of this iteration of horror comes from the same root as their acquiescence to the violence that made America. The jump scares and the gore, the evil cabals and paranormal activities, all allow us to imagine that evil comes from demonic principalities or masked killers, that it happens to innocent Americans in their allegedly safe homes. Violence is not what is done in our name, by fresh-faced young people we’ve hired to kill for us, in places we can’t find on a map. Violence is done to us and we fight back and we win—we always win. By the time the credits roll, these films assure us that everything is okay, that the evildoers have been punished and the American way of life, and the piece of it you’ve broken off for yourself, will not change even a little. Another kind of horror film denies us security and comfort, even as it refuses to let us believe we are the legitimate heirs of imperial privilege. These films demand we recognize how the American dream has been assembled from the night terrors of the world. They pose questions about how we won our comforts. They often leave us gobsmacked, muddled, and dazed as we try to bring ourselves to sensibility of what we thought was the real world. These are films that end with corpses everywhere and the survivors wearing their dead friends’ insides. The evil has not come from without, from empire’s frontier. It’s a violence we made, that we’ve either become or accepted, as the price of our privileges. These films critique the American dream by showing us the mounds of corpses it’s built on. These films are often aggressive with the audience, refusing to play by the rules of the genre. Commenting on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Mick Garris described it as a film that ignored old-school “somethings behind the door” scares in favor of “coming after you in fucking clown paint.” The thing coming at us in “fucking clown paint” has a lot more power than popular understandings of Aristotle’s notion of catharsis. The idea that horror films, especially ones that show body-rending violence, are palliatives for anxiety has been best summarized by Richard Rhodes as “taking the psychic garbage out.” Of course, as Maggie Nelson asks in The Art of Cruelty, where does this “psychic garbage” go? Who ends up with it? Is there any evidence that this “catharsis” is taking place, she asks, if “‘catharsis’ now means ‘tune in next week’”? Perhaps, as Nelson herself suggests, something deeply political, not simply psychological, works in our stories of violence. If we consume hour after hour after hour of innocence being corrupted or killed by monstrosity but watch our heroes annihilate the monster just before the credits roll, it’s soothing repetition and not catharsis. But horror also confronts us with unsettling dread that opens new possibilities. Horror directors like John Carpenter make films that, in his own words, critique “unrestrained capitalism.” George A. Romero could make a zombie film in 2005 that has Dennis Hopper standing in for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. These films follow the brutal logic of Eugene Ionesco’s famous assertion, sometimes in a very literal way, that “to tear ourselves away from the everyday, from habit, from mental laziness which hides from us the strangeness of reality, we must receive something like a real bludgeon blow.” These nightmares come from the irreconcilable contrasts of what Americans hope, or believe, the world to be and its bleaker reality. This is the reason so much of what spooks us in horror depends on sensory uncertainty, experience suddenly taking a dreaded turn, a past suddenly revealing its true meaning or a future lost. Horror lets us know that how we expected the world to act has been indefinitely cancelled. What appeared to be simply a shadow on the wall moves in a way nothing should. We are certain we are alone in a dark room when something brushes against us. The sunlight of a spring day suddenly dies as thunderheads trick out the sky in a sickening orange and Leatherface charges across a peaceful pasture, chain saw roaring, ready to teach us that you “DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS.” This is the precise opposite of entertainment as escapism, the wish to ignore reality. Michael Moorcock once attacked J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth fantasies as escapism that encouraged a Tory view of the world. Tolkien rebuked the young Marxist, saying that “jailers always hate escapism.” Moorcock famously replied that actually jailers love escapism—what they hate is an actual jailbreak. Many of our frightful fictions want us to contemplate a jailbreak from the American consensus. The horror film that demands we attend to the history of American violence does not simply reflect the culture. Its buoyant sadisms can restage the violence this country visits on the world and insist we look, that we see through lies and renounce the cant, the mental laziness, and the political nihilism. Americans can fight for tickets to the opening of Saw (2004) and Hostel (2005), infamously labelled “torture porn,” in the same cultural moment as the revelation that physical and sexual violence had been deployed by American soldiers against the detainees of Abu Ghraib prison. The tendency of our least comfortable filmmakers to try to bludgeon us says nothing about audience reaction or the meaning accrued to a specific film. This book does not suggest that audiences leave a horror film pondering geopolitics or the cost of American empire. Nor do they leave a simple monster-hunt story thinking about how good it is to live so well in a country like the United States. But they do leave the theater or close their streaming app with either a feeling of the rightness or wrongness of the world. They’ve been asked to question the story they tell themselves about reality. They’ve been asked to pay attention or they’ve been told to go back to sleep, everything’s okay. In the troubled sleep of empire, both dreams may come. In this book we will experience both fantasies and the political conviction that grows out of the worldview each assumes. We’ll see the predator who swims from sea to shining sea until slain by a working-class hero who’s trying to defend our amity. And we’ll have to watch a more excruciating vision, a murderous dance on the frontiers of American power, a roar of industrialized murder shattering the silence of purple mountains majesty. In the troubled sleep of empire, we meet the chain saw and the shark. 2. American Massacres TOBE HOOPER, his round, boyish, bespectacled face beaming with an easy smile, eased back in his chair as he responded to a question about the real meaning of his classic, and infamous, 1974 film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He laughed nervously, like a modest kid embarrassed by winning a prize at school, as he talked about his story of hippies finding some real bad trouble in the Texas hinterland. “I think what it’s trying to say,” Hooper quipped, as if giving credit to someone else for the eighty-minute nightmare, “is that this is America.”3 Hooper created a revisionist western, the myth of the American frontier that outdid The Wild Bunch in its unforgiving brutality. Hooper’s Wild West is not John Wayne facing down desperate men with the truest of grit. Hooper’s frontier rots like Katherine Anne Porter’s Texas dirt farms, so gone to seed that the clans that clustered there had to go to work at the local slaughterhouse. But, in the moribund heartland of seventies America, even the slaughterhouse has gone out of business. The evil demon presiding over the times in which the film first flickered on drive-in screens made the celluloid carnage appear a documentary. The first few minutes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre are staccato edits of unburied bodies. An edged, metallic riff tears the soundscape. Hooper, who spent a year chopping and scoring the film, created a whole library of unsettling sounds he could draw on. He achieved the grating sound of metal ripping apart by tearing apart a tambourine and dragging a saw across the threads so the seams busted like metal ripping flesh. So much for the sounds of the decade when Hooper came of age, when young, hopeful Americans wanted to hear Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for them. Hooper joined each serrated edit with the droning of a news anchor . . . murders, accidents, Nixon, and Vietnam. It’s a cacophony of horrors. The news reports, just like the unending stream of malignancies that greet us in our contemporary doom scrolling, report global and local carnage. The catalog of disasters continues as Hooper shows us exhumed graves in a small Texas town where some hippie kids drop by to ask directions to the old homeplace. The old men standing around, escapees from an Erskine Caldwell novel, are delighted by the women’s short-shorts and bemused by the bell-bottomed paramours the pretty girls prefer to John Wayne. We meet our heroes in this unquiet graveyard. Sally and Franklin are brother and sister, a duo living in different cultural time zones of the sixties and seventies. Sally is a liberated advocate of peace and love, while Franklin uses a wheelchair and is filled with an unendurable combination of sniveling self-pity and rage. The rest of the group are largely embodiments of the counterculture. Pam is a sultry astrology maven. Jerry and Kirk are floating clouds of cannabis eager to learn more about sultry astrology mavens. They’ve hit the road like Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters in part to find Sally and Franklin’s family home. Hooper told a story of a new kind of settlers. They are the children of the Age of Aquarius, but Pam warns that the times they are a-changing; Saturn has ascended. The monster who devoured his own children will become the new America. The Hitchhiker, no name provided, introduces us to the realities of American history that purblind patriotism would have us ignore. The blood is the life for the Hitchhiker and his family. They had worked for generations at a nearby slaughterhouse that fired them when it started using high-powered air guns. “The hammer was better,” the Hitchhiker assures his new friends, a gruesome observation but one that resonated with Americans who’d been hearing a new word on the evening news: deindustrialization. For the working class this meant, above all, unemployment as manufacturing jobs disappeared and the country began its arc toward today’s information and services economy. Sweaty, kinetic, and seemingly opposed to bathing, the Hitchhiker causes the kids to quickly become wary because, as Franklin puts it, they may have “picked up Count Dracula” from “a whole family of Draculas.” The Hitchhiker’s interest in blood, his own and others, suggests Franklin might be on to something. The film starts as a story about finding the family farm, the old dream of the homestead, the West that became the first frontier of the American empire. But it quickly becomes a fright tale that questions the sanity of any audience that would watch it and, by extension, the sanity of anyone who would believe the western fantasy of deserts inexplicably fecund and settlers moving peacefully across the landscapes, covered wagons like little puffs of cloud drifting along in an orderly row with the breeze of the American dream nudging them along. In place of a little house on the prairie, the kids find riverbeds dry as ash when they want to swim and, in the age of rural poverty, a crumbling Victorian farmhouse leering over the landscape. One by one, the hippie kids find themselves on meat hooks in scenes that are weirdly bloodless while evoking absolutely brutal violence. A man-child in a skin mask lays out Jerry in a single, spine-crunching blow from a slaughterhouse mallet. By the end of the film, only Sally remains, captive of the strange, male-only family of cannibals. The Hitchhiker, we learn, is part of this family, which includes the Cook; the murderous, if childlike Leatherface; and Grandpa, a desiccated corpse that comes to life only at the smell of blood and meat. All gather at what looks to be Sally’s last supper, the table piled high with offal and sausage, which we assume are pieces of her friends or other unlucky travelers in the heartland. The film ends without the now well-known figure of the “final girl” triumphing over the monster. Well, not exactly. We bear witness to another kind of America with a final girl less gritty and confident than we’ve come to know her. Sally, avatar of the last living hip sixties beauty, jumps through a window and runs for her life, slathered in blood and screaming, escaping to whatever fate awaits her in the back of a passing pickup truck. As she flees, Leatherface dances a gruesome ballet with his chain saw. A guttered western sun spreads a brown glow over the waterless landscape, a John Ford shot that would have suited Red River. Filming the movie had been a terror trip. The Texas summer broiled in 1973, making the shoot as miserable as all the characters seem to be on screen. Thirty-two days of temperatures at 95 to 100 degrees and sixteen-to eighteen-hour days made cast and crew hate each other and become dangerously accident-prone. The set almost became an actual chain saw massacre more than once. Gunnar Hansen, a Swedish poet who played the murderous Leatherface, later admitted that he became a bit too enthusiastic about trying to kill Marilyn Burns, Sally in the film. Indeed, swinging the chain saw, he came close to eviscerating more than one cast member and once Hooper himself. Burns later said that when she seems to lose her mind and have a complete psychotic break as she tries to escape at the end of the film, “that wasn’t acting.”4 Director, cast, and crew found the American past and present in Texas apocalypseland. Hooper’s camera moves listlessly across abandoned barns, rusting tractors, and a broken landscape that looks like a bone protruding from sand; rainless, the color of the earth is bright but harsh, baking the eyes of the viewer. Art director Robert A. Burns discovered a dead armadillo on the highway early in the shoot. Burns took it home, read a book on taxidermy, and sewed the animal into a Frankensteined version of its former self. An image of decay lying on the side of the road, vaguely portentous and, as Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) chairman H. Rap Brown said about violence, “as American as cherry pie.” The Texas Chain Saw Massacre appeared just as the crimes of the Nixon administration came slowly to light. The bodies buried in the American landscape had been exhumed, not unlike the harrowing scenes in the film’s opening moments. The house of the dead on Pennsylvania Avenue whispered ill-kept secrets: attempts to subvert a democratic election, the use of the FBI as an internal security force hardwired into Nixon’s presidium of corrupt advisors, and secret wars being waged in Cambodia and Laos that only a few in the Pentagon, and no one in Congress, knew anything about. Facing eminent impeachment, Nixon resigned in disgrace in the last weeks of the summer of ’74. In less than a year, Americans found themselves facing defeat in Vietnam. In late spring of ’75, families watched over TV dinners as the evening news showed the fall of Saigon in real time and the last Americans fleeing ingloriously in a helicopter off the rooftop of their embattled embassy. The most famous images showed hordes of South Vietnamese, who had worked with or for the Americans, being turned away at a makeshift helipad atop a downtown Saigon hotel turned CIA headquarters. During this year of the macabre, millions of Americans unexpectedly went to see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, first in drive-ins and grungy theaters and then on every screen that wanted to make a buck. The film reels turned on squeaky, stained, smoke-encrusted projectors for most of ’74, the movie’s dark reputation growing. The opening titles of Hooper’s film, a crawl that told of “the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history,” convinced some viewers that they were watching a true story, a companion piece to 1974’s controversial documentary that indicted American violence against the Vietnamese, Peter Davis’s Hearts and Minds. Tobe Hooper conjured the family of murderers from childhood tales of the Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, the grave robber, deer hunter, and taxidermist who lived his own gruesome vision of America. To Hooper’s consternation and delight, fans actually argued with the writer and director for decades about whether his film was a documentary or not. They were wrong about Hooper giving them an early example of a true crime murderama/docudrama. But more than childhood tales of Gein’s mayhem influenced the filmmaker. When he was walking on the UT Austin campus in August 1966, a cop screamed at Hooper to get his head down because “someone is shooting from the tower.” Hooper simply stared at the officer for a moment, maybe a little high and certainly oblivious to the mayhem swirling around him. Hooper sobered considerably when bullets ventilated the officer’s major organs.5 Charles Whitman had come to UT Austin to perpetrate one of the most savage mass murders, outside of covert warfare, in American history. Hooper hid behind cars and trash cans along with hundreds of others as the ex-marine fired from the twenty-eighth-floor observation deck of the Main Building. For ninety-six minutes the shots exploded, stopping only so Whitman could meticulously reload the arsenal of weapons he’d lugged up to his aerie. When police finally brought Whitman down, he had killed fifteen people and wounded thirty-one others. Earlier in the day, he enjoyed a quiet lunch with his mother and then stabbed her to death. He then drove home and stabbed his wife three times before heading to the campus. Like Hooper’s brutalist western, Whitman’s story is another tale that’s really about America. 3.I Wish They All Could Be California Girls BOOGEYMEN ALREADY haunted American dreams as the seventies became a turning point for empire. Tex left the ranch late, just as midnight came on and the campfire waned after dinner. He packed a .22 Buntline Special. Colt’s Manufacturing Company (founded in 1855) named the gun after Ned Buntline, the man who created the dime novel western. Wyatt Earp supposedly carried the same long-barreled smoke wagon to every killing he’d ever graced with his presence. Tex hit the trail to play his part in what became known as the Manson murders, despite Charles Manson’s limited role in the actual labor of killing. The importance of “Helter Skelter,” and Vincent Bugliosi’s archetypal 1975 true crime novel of the same name, has carried cultural weight out of proportion to the actual event. Bugliosi told readers a story not unlike he told jurors in 1970. Manson held a series of interconnected beliefs based on an exotic blend of white supremacist ideology folded in with bits and pieces of Scientology, Robert A. Heinlein, and the book of Revelation, all cooked in acid until fully homicidal. Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) proved a particular obsession to the group. It’s unclear whether Manson ever read it, but someone in the Manson Family did. When a child was born as a result of the group’s perpetual orgy, he was named Valentine Michael—a tribute to the alien fascist who’s the hero of Heinlein’s novel, a cult leader who enjoys patriarchal polyamory and “disincorporating” his enemies. Manson could relate. Heinlein, meanwhile, would go on to play an all too important role in the story of the American empire, endorsing policies that murdered more people than his psychotic admirers in the Manson Family could imagine offing in their most extravagant death fantasies. Reading Heinlein can teach you a lot about Manson and about postwar America. But it was Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter that became the book everyone had to read regarding the Tate-LaBianca murders, joining Ann Rule’s The Stranger Beside Me as the template for the true crime genre. It still keeps that reputation after half a century. Ed Sanders, poet and member of the Merry Prankster folk band the Fugs, also won a hearing with his 1971 book, The Family. It’s a wonderfully strange and byzantine mess, a true farrago of diary, reportage, memoir, fact-free rumination, political commentary, and occasionally a very detailed guide to the geography of the Southern California desert. It’s always classified as “true crime,” which is a bit like categorizing Robert Graves’s The White Goddess as classics. Sanders understood that the Tate-LaBianca murders had meaning beyond the actual event and would continue to accumulate meaning in the way of historical events. Joan Didion wrote in her famed essay “The White Album” that “many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969.” Greil Marcus insisted that “Manson’s shadow is everywhere” and suggested that the thrill kills of the Family had something to do with Woodstock, at least symbolically. But he couldn’t have conceivably meant such bum steer bullshit. He must have been upset, in the same headspace as Steve McQueen, when, out of the conviction that death cults might come for all the pretty people of new Hollywood, he packed a revolver to Sharon Tate’s funeral.6 Sanders saw another kind of connection. What made Charles Manson so different from Richard Nixon? What was the meaning of Manson gleefully holding the headline that read MANSON GUILTY, NIXON DECLARES? Why did Manson mock Nixon as late as the eighties and nineties and, in the stygian depths of his psychosis, how was he certain that he, Jesus, and the devil all in one package had actually been responsible for Nixon’s downfall? Maybe all that’s a story about America and not Manson. Maybe we needed Manson in 1969 and have continued to need him for the last half century. “I’m just your mirror” Manson was fond of saying to the throngs who interviewed him in prison; “you see in me what you need to see.” Even a broken, criminally insane clock can be right once or twice. Maybe the theatrical violence, the horror aesthetic that riveted the nation on 10050 Cielo Drive, had its corollary in an awareness of American imperial horrors? Did those two nights in the LA hills become a way to forget, or remember, how murder is done in our name? The Manson murders, many critics of the Vietnam War noted, had brought the war home. Perhaps this American massacre, and our reaction to it, showed our immense moral hypocrisy when it came to the crimes carried out on our behalf. Ed Sanders made this connection by comparing Manson to another figure accused of ordering a mass murder, Lieutenant William Calley. Calley became infamous as the officer who led Charlie Company, Twentieth Infantry Regiment of the “Americal” Division, into My Lai village, slaughtering as many as five hundred people, raping and mutilating as they proceeded. The army at first attempted to cover up the event but then put Calley on trial about one month after the Tate-LaBianca murders. No higher officers, including Captain Ernest Medina, who ordered the foray, faced conviction.7 Around the time the officer who led Charlie Company and Charles Manson came to national fame, Sanders had become the main man on the Tate-LaBianca beat for the Los Angeles Free Press, a countercultural lodestone known just as the Freep. Giving any nuanced view of the fascination with Manson got you in trouble in 1970, just as it does now. But after telling those who accused him of defending Manson to “go make motions of unification with a weather balloon,” Sanders proposed that the country that “perfected the concept of the ‘freefire zone’” in Vietnam and found fragmentation bombs amenable to the spirit of suburbia’s “well-kept lawns” possibly suffered a hypocrisy problem.8 In January of 1971, he forced readers back into the jungle with Calley. He didn’t believe Manson was innocent but insisted that “if you kill Manson you have to kill Calley.” He was not alone in seeing the correspondence. Allen Katzman of The East Village Other wrote that if Manson’s followers slaughtered the Vietnamese rather than Tate and her friends, Manson and his followers would have been “just following orders and obeying the ten commandments.” Even National Lampoon and Mad magazine made the connection, with Lampoon imagining a boxing match between Manson and Calley, won by the latter because of the quick intervention of Richard Nixon. Nothing made this point more brutally graphic in all meanings of the term than Tom Veitch and Greg Irons in one of their “comix” (underground, and very adult, work that emerged in the sixties often associated with Robert Crumb) entitled The Legion of Charlies. The opening page provides two top panels with Lieutenant “Kali” (a Hindu goddess associated with death) telling his troops “we’re gonna hafta wipe um all out.” The bottom two panels feature Manson demanding that “piggies must die . . . let’s get ’em.” The satire gets weirder as the U.S. government decides legions of Manson followers can kill and cannibalize with more speed and panache than the U.S. military. “We’ve taken the logic inherent in today’s news,” Veitch wrote, “and taken it to absurdity.” That’s just peacenik rhetoric, right? Sure it is. But that doesn’t change the fact that, as Manson had ordered his family “to do something witchy,” Calley ordered Charlie Company to do much the same. There’s nothing in the official army records that vindicates or even mitigates what happened that day. Moreover, as explored later in this book, the incident reads as a microcosm of the larger American war-fighting plan in which the United States would behave like a brutal confused schizophrenic, offering the Vietnamese people largesse to win hearts and minds while raining down hell and destruction in nearly incalculable tonnages of bombs and chemical weapons. Long before Calley and Manson, Horace Greeley’s injunction to “Go west, young man” became both the rallying cry and an epithet for a country determined to manifest the fuck out of its destiny. There’s a vicious subtext of violence and rapine in the tendency of American history textbooks to describe the opening of the West. The image suggests a flower opening to sunlight, but darker images await. Settlers violently “opened” the West; prospectors, frontier start-up entrepreneurs, saloon keepers, and, most of all, soldiers tore their way across the continent to make the first American empire. Ed Sanders thought “the Family” had, like Tobe Hooper’s clan of the chain saw, headed west to grow up with the country, an acid nightmare of violence becoming how the West was won. If only Joan Didion had brought the sensibility of her essay “John Wayne: A Love Story” to her epithet for the sixties. Maybe Gay Talese could have pressed his metaphors further in his famous March 1970 Esquire piece “Charlie Manson’s Home on the Range.” As things turned out, it proved easier for the liberal intelligentsia and the American ayatollahs of the eighties right-wing backlash to declare the death of a fragile period of experimentation with social justice than to see 10050 Cielo Drive as a hyperreal theme park of the American empire, an allegory of the dream of an ever-expanding West, a corollary to a brutal war in East Asia where kids nursed at the man-teat of John Wayne and talked about “playing cowboys and Indians” in the jungle of the new frontier, and an aging Wayne himself tried to shore up the fantasy in his ludicrous 1968 pro-war film The Green Berets. Americans loved reading about Manson and still do, but the millions of Asian corpses didn’t move them. Richard Nixon may have declared Manson guilty, but he declared Lieutenant William Calley innocent. In April of 1971, Nixon ordered Calley released from the custody of military police, pending his sentencing. Calley remained under house arrest for three years until federal court judge J. Robert Elliott overturned his conviction. Sanders was wrong. If you convict Manson, you can actually let Calley go free. Elliott even attended Calley’s wedding. Plenty of mythmakers, across the political spectrum, have found in Manson a seething symbolism. Culture warrior Senator Ted Cruz seemed worried about his ghost voting from prison as late as 2020. Depending on who you read, Manson “killed” or “weaponized” or “embodied” the sixties. Manson had the power to make Americans believe in him, and through successive interviews over decades with everyone from Geraldo Rivera to Ronald Reagan Jr., he successfully became the boogeyman. He started this in his trial, where spoke of “these children who come at you with knives.” A damn good line used to describe three not-children who came not for their parents but for an emerging actor and her friends at a Norman-style chateau in the Hollywood Hills that once belonged to Lillian Gish. The little crook his followers called “The Wizard” scried up the perfect storm. Cultural critics insisted on calling his Family “the cult” and “the commune,” turning Manson into “the Dark Hippie,” the sum of all the half-mythical silent majority’s entirely mythical fears. Rolling Stone saw this coming in June of 1970. Manson would become the bourgeoise bugaboo, “the long-haired devil you loved to hate.”9 What was not to hate? Manson had taken the life of Tate, America’s new beach beauty, even as she’d been on the brink of becoming an oddly political sex symbol—a Jane Fonda who’d never let our boys down. She’d been a real sweet girl from Texas, Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas 1943. A military brat, Tate lived in Texas, California, and even Italy because of the work of her father, Colonel Paul Tate, who later served as an intelligence officer in Vietnam. She was the all-American girl who only in your most grandiose of fantasies lived next door. Almost exactly eight years before being butchered in the Hollywood Hills, the icily gorgeous Tate, a Catherine Deneuve for Grand Ole Opry Fans, posed for the Atomic Frontier Days in Richland, Texas. Feet shod in boots, wearing shorts that revealed her lengthy tanned shanks kissed by the Texas sun, she straddled a Nike-class surface-to-air-missile, cowboy hat on her head. This was four years before Stanley Kubrick used the image of Slim Pickens bronco-busting a missile in Dr. Strangelove. The event celebrated the local plutonium manufacturing plant and its role in America’s system of mass destruction. Floats paraded down Main Street Richland reading THE WEST, NEW AND OLD, the atomic missile and the six-gun, the arms race and the cattle drive, the hope that the commies would go down like the Mescalero Apache. She continued to be a strange icon of American power. A few years later, Tate appeared mostly unclothed in a ham-handed attempt by Esquire to parody Mao’s Little Red Book, his turgid quotes juxtaposed with Sharon in wet T-shirts and bandoliers. Today, it looks more like a self-own, a parody of Esquire’s stated commitment to what they described as “the capitalist way of things” when they introduced Tate’s spread in the summer of ’67. Tate became a symbol of all kinds of things before the ’69 murders, just as she would after. Glamour, a rags-to-riches story, the ingenue that might become a star, something sexy and American. Her anti-communist wet T-shirt photos and willingness to rail on a missile seemed to make sense among baby boomers for whom “do our own thing” could mean the perpetual contact high of living in Haight-Ashbury or marching in an anti-war demonstration or growing old enough to support Donald Trump while believing QAnon and the Pentagon Papers bear the same level of meaning—the generation so certain of both the power of crystals and the danger of “chemtrails.” Can you dig it? After all, the world lost Tate because, while some women of the sixties founded and fought for the work of the National Organization for Women (NOW), a few female boomers lived in a biblical patriarchy with a hirsute, death-obsessed little goblin who played the guitar well enough that he attracted the attention of Byrds producer Terry Melcher and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Lynette Fromme, Leslie Van Houten, Linda Kasabian, and a host of others went California dreaming with a man who hobnobbed with new Hollywood while building weaponized dune buggies to fight Black Panthers in the San Fernando Valley. A very American story. So maybe the children were coming for an older America with knives out? Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman seemed scary, if not as utterly terrifying in the middle-class imagination as Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. For most of the white American mainstream, Manson served a useful purpose. The silent majority could silently nod as their president called this diminutive fright wig of a guy “guilty, directly or indirectly” of the murders of eight people. This just felt right, being so afraid that you felt an extra dopamine rush of satisfaction at the dark messiah’s sentence. It felt wrong to be upset over the hundreds of Vietnamese dead at the contested borders of the American empire. Fantasizing about the intruders, Manson’s Lugosi-eyes floating in mist above them, entering the Tate-Polanski home felt so much better than picturing young American soldiers raping and murdering an entire village at a leisurely pace, the hours it took to terrorize and butcher and burn becoming so wearing that most of Charlie Company took a lunch break before resuming the slaughter. Certainly no one wanted to think about how My Lai represented only the tip of the bloody spear in Vietnam, how tens of thousands of civilians died in the Mekong Delta during Operation Speedy Express or how “free-fire zones” made such massacres a tactical imperative. Lieutenant William Calley claimed he was just following orders. But rather than pondering the implications of that story about America, why not dwell on Tex Watson announcing to Sharon Tate and her coffee heiress friend Abigail Folger that “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business”? Better yet, let’s imagine that Manson said it. Let’s imagine the sixties revealed their true meaning on a single night in Benedict Canyon. Let’s forget the end of an era occurred in the Mekong Delta or at Kent State or with the Christmas bombings. Horror makes it easier to live in an empire. Except when it doesn’t. Tobe Hooper wanted the chain saw to show Americans a story about their country. George A. Romero described himself as “pissed off” that the promised “revolution” of the sixties had never truly come. Could his flesh-eating ghouls be the only kind of revolution that could endure? Could they at least interject chaos into the new American consensus that made meaningful change seem impossible by the 1980s?10 A fascination with horror, and the hope that horror can be so shocking that it burns this motherfucker down with the sound of a chain saw roaring in the distance, tells us about more than just the American seventies. It’s a history that has something uncomfortable to say about being a citizen of the American empire at this moment. The horror con that becomes an actual blood bath or the Halloween theme park where you are stalked and slaughtered by very real psychopaths appears in films like Blood Fest, Haunt, The Houses October Built (1 and 2), Hell Fest, and No Escape Room. Each ask the viewer to consider what horror actually means in a society where it’s everywhere. Awash in uncountable podcasts, documentaries, wikis, tribute websites, and books about “true crime,” how have we come to understand violence? When what counts as news has also taken on the tincture of hyperreality, a drop here and a drop there of rage and calamity, what do we mean by horror? Chain saw horror always comes as a crisis of knowledge. The portal opens when spells are whispered in some dark, forgotten tongue. What was not known is revealed and—uh oh—it’s something we never should have learned. Or maybe it’s better to know, to find the text or the amulet or the buried body to end the terror? We need the chain saw if we want to understand how America works. The slaughterhouse that calved a thousand maniacs means learning that everything you thought was true is wrong. Understanding politics and ideology means taking apart the assumptions that live like parasites in our minds. Chain saw horror does that. It doesn’t worry about the relationship of map and territory. It assumes the map has been lost, or drawn with malevolent purpose, and the territory is a place where you are about to die. 4.I Used to Hate the Water NOT EVERYONE in the United States wanted to turn the American myth into a slaughterhouse on a Texas homestead, or a California one. By the summer of 1975, another film seduced an even wider audience. The American public showed its Janus face by turning out in droves for a summer fairy tale with a monster in it, even as catching a midnight showing of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre remained a whispered dare, teenagers and adults watching with guilt and delight. Jaws came to swallow the entertainment industry whole. At a moment in the history of Hollywood and the United States when the national success story seemed to have ended with screams and the ear-splitting sound of a chain saw, the blockbuster, for the first time, became a perennial part of summer. The term referred to a film so popular, and so mainstream, that hopeful viewers lined up around whole city blocks waiting for their tickets. Steven Spielberg started the trend of Hollywood making an endless summer of high-concept films that sold tickets, tubs of popcorn, and colas by the tens of millions. Spielberg came of age with Tobe Hooper but took a different set of lessons from both film school and the America of the fifties and sixties. It’s impossible to imagine the young, thin enfant terrible saying his blockbuster Jaws was a movie about America, even though it inadvertently shows an even more frightening side of the country’s shadowy self than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It’s a story of American innocence and ability to triumph, a bloody companion piece to his friend and sometime collaborator George Lucas’s American Graffiti (1973). Huge crowds loved Jaws and shoveled 260 million dollars into ticket booths during a recession (1.2 billion in current dollars). No film had ever performed like this before, both at the box office and in a new world of movie merchandizing with iron-on Jaws T-shirts, books, and even a board game. Spielberg conjured an alternative vision of reality to Hooper’s dark Massacre. Awash in vivid blues, Jaws combined horrific death with a hopeful message about a can-do America. Anecdotes tell of American audiences breaking out in a home-team-scores-a-touchdown cheer as the monster goes KABLOW! after a million-to-one shot from Roy Scheider’s rifle to an oxygen tank the shark has ingested. In the final scene, Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss have blown the shark to bits and swim off into a sunset on a makeshift raft, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer of the seventies. Everybody is safe. Amity Island, the focus of the creature’s attacks, seems more like a mild, quiet suburb than an island facing off with a monster. Before the giant shark comes along, the biggest worries are kids “karate chopping picket fences.” It’s more than a geographical island—it’s an island out of time, America’s dream of itself in the fifties, a place where you’d never know Vietnam or Watergate ever happened. Everyone is inexorably middle class and happy until the shark shows up to ruin it. But then our heroes kill it and America can go on dreaming the dream of itself. Chain Saw and Jaws, appearing at the same cultural turn, are the twin poles of American imagination at a crucial moment in the country’s history. Jaws offered a nightmare, but one met on the way to a dream come true. It’s a film manifesto for an America where men with square jaws destroy monsters. It’s not Tobe Hooper’s warning about the monsters hatched from the dragon’s teeth America sowed in its own soil, about what had been and about what was coming, what was coming for all of us. Who could go watch Jaws and cheer while the country faced defeat, economic decline, and maleficence at the highest level of government? Didn’t Hooper’s dark vision make more sense? A film like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre becoming so intensely popular needs no explanation; it suited the times. But the sun-drenched seascapes of Amity Island are straight out of a fifties creature feature, and they promised escape from very real fears. How could such different films become so popular in the same country? To understand this is to understand the nature of the American empire and its citizens’ profound lack of interest in confronting that reality. It’s different from every imperial power that’s come before it. It pretends not to exist. It’s willing to use lethal violence or to celebrate it uproariously, and then to forget it, to imagine its consequences are less important than they are. The public goes along—except when they suddenly don’t—but then reveal once more their genius for moderation, simplistic thinking, and unwillingness to face the truths of the world that gives them the iPhone and The Bachelor, golf carts and local breweries, Whole Foods selling you fresh fruits out of season and delivery services that bring an insane variety of goods—unimaginable bounties for 99.9 percent of humans who have ever lived—to your door within hours. The horror emerges and then subsides, the corpse appears only to vanish, the past surfaces and then gets a premature burial, the shark attacks but a hero blows it to chum. America, and Americans, lighted on an innovative way of being imperial. We see this in our horror fictions and we find it in the difficulty many Americans exhibit, especially those who thrive most within its system, of even thinking of their country as an empire. The hard truths remain waiting, even when ignored. The story of empire traces its way down the centuries, leaving eerie glyphs not always easy to decipher. The facts never have the tensile strength of memory’s fiber-optic cable. We tell our stories to distort the real story. Although this book explores horror and the empire’s influence on the present cultural moment, it also questions what we think we know about the deeper past. It puts the idea that we are the white hats under a hot light in a dark room. It asks whether we are telling the truth when we look at some atrocity and say, “this is not who we are.” Once, the chain saw and the shark tried to make a movie together. Poltergeist (1982) joined the murderer’s row of classic horror films. It took a switchback path to production, creating confusion about who exactly shaped the film, Spielberg the producer or Hooper the director. The confusion at one point became a legal dispute, and it was not only fans who took sides. The Directors Guild of America ultimately awarded Hooper a cash settlement and accused Spielberg and MGM of downplaying the indie horror director’s role while celebrating the film as another triumph by the maestro of the mainstream. Apparently, Poltergeist had its beginning, sort of, when Spielberg wrote a script called Watch the Skies. When Hooper came on as director, he scrapped the plot that catered to the renaissance of alien obsessions from the fifties that dominated the seventies. Hooper worked since the release of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre on a film about the supernatural and the secret history of the suburbs, and that’s largely the film he made. Poltergeist follows the Freeling family into a home built in a “planned community,” an old idea but a much more common phrase in the 1980s. It’s the quintessential American no-place, an LA suburb called Cuesta Verde, following Californian and Floridian real estate in its habit of taking banal phrases and making them “exotic” by translating them into Spanish. The sprawl is advertised as “where dreams comes true.” In a Hooper film we need no further warning that this is nightmare country. Cuesta Verde incarnates apex Southern California just as Southern California acts as avatar for apex America. The fictional neighborhood could be Chula Vista in its infancy or anywhere in Orange County. Hooper set his night terror in the middle of what poet and essayist Alice Bolin called “the insanity of LA’s epically unsustainable urban development” with the unspeakable secret being that “it was all on purpose.” She’s commenting on Joan Didion’s 1990 observation that LA embodied “a new kind of city, one that would seem to have no finite limits, a literal cloud on the land.” Didion and Bolin could be describing the whole of U.S. history. A booming sprawl of an empire never contained by borders, each crucial, misguided step in its manifest destiny fully planned and mysteriously financed, with Americans ever after squinting at the spiraling chaos and asking how we got here. Hooper embraced that chaos, and we are in his dark dream of America, despite the widespread belief that Spielberg took the reins from his director. It’s evident Spielberg’s enthusiasms are there. It is truly very frightening, and yet you can tell Hooper pulls his punches. The spookiness is decidedly PG. Spielberg did create, by Hooper’s own account, a pointless sequence involving a child and an astral journey to the afterlife that bloated the film by twenty minutes. He possibly held the idea that she would end the haunting in a cloudbank of “and a little child shall lead them” schmaltz—a trope that is to Spielberg as inscrutable as endangered blonde women are to Hitchcock. But Hooper brought the chain saw to mainstream audiences. He happily included political commentary, showing boomers with a hippie, or at least a doobie-filled, past that are really starting to dig Reagan. This is distinctly un-Spielbergian, as he made sure to erase any references to current American politics, and drug use, from Peter Benchley’s script for Jaws. The closest we get to politics in the war on the Great White is the vague suggestion that small-town mayors in bad ties are often insouciant. More importantly, Hooper did what Spielberg never would; he placed the horror in the cold guts of the American home. In the Spielberg-verse, the inhuman never threatens the security of American domestic spaces in films, never making it beyond the shoreline. The uncanny comes as space brethren, poorly disguised Christ figures, ETs, and close encounters. They are either cuddly friends or quite literally messianic messengers who’ll soon have you joyously sculpting your mashed potatoes and then going to live with them in the mothership. Hooper’s vision is far bleaker. The dénouement is pure chain saw, in fact recalling the opening frames of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This time it’s not the sandy loam of Texas that regurgitates its dead. It’s the family swimming pool. The whole Freeling family runs screaming from their home in the night while an eldritch portal pulls their house into Hades and part of the planned development where dreams come true goes down into the dark. We will enter that darkness. The phantoms of a thousand Native American massacres are roused throughout this book. The roots of America’s wars are about what happened in 1965 or 2001, but also in 1918, 1898, and before. Beware how the roots of history clutch and call us back to a past as criminally deranged as the present. Empire’s shadow even blankets the golden haze of World War II, that supposed “good war.” It’s all a story about America, the chain saw, and the shark. 5.Built on Top of a What?? THE ROOTS of American power, memory, and historical amnesia are deep, reaching back through the centuries when a handful of violent settler societies with their minds set on commerce seized lands belonging to the Pequot, the Yamasee, and the Powhatan, some of the earliest Native American peoples destroyed in conflict with colonies in New England, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Clinging to a narrow band of colonial outposts from Georgia to Massachusetts, white settlers began the slow and steady conquest of a continent, killing Indians, felling trees, slaughtering animals, and fencing open land in a “new world” that previously held no concept of private property. By contrast, the Europeans developed a concept of property so expansive as to include human beings. The enslavement of African people in Virginia began early in the seventeenth century, more than 150 years before the American Revolution. Colonies like the Carolina settlement included the right to own African people in their charters. Early in colonial America, some poor whites worked without wages as indentured servants. The practice died out, however, and indentured servants eventually earned their freedom. Colonial law regarded African men and women as chattel, literally “movable property” like a cow or a wagon. White supremacy became more than a domestic institution. Racism played the central role in the creation of the American empire. Its shadows whisper all around us in the present, a nightmare from which the world has never roused. Horror films have dealt with the memory of America’s imperial beginnings by turning to the trope of the haunted Indian burial ground, a notion so well-worn that it has acquired the acronym IBG. The Amityville Horror (1979), The Shining (1980), Pet Sematary (1989), and the Poltergeist series (1982–1999) all deal in various ways with the idea that, as the famous line from Pet Sematary has it, “the sour ground” became a place of darkness because of its history. Both Colin Dickey and Shea Vassar describe how, somewhere at the edge of white awareness, there lurks the realization that American capital built an empire on the remains of the dead. The idea has become so deeply imbricated into American culture that in Poltergeist (1982), the unlucky Freelings seek reassurance that their extraordinarily haunted house is not built on an Indian burial ground. Even The Onion hasn’t been able to leave the idea alone, in 2011 using the darkly funny headline “Report: Economy Failing Because U.S. Built on Ancient Indian Burial Grounds.” Empire’s beginnings are soaked in blood, in genocide. Many know about the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, in part because of the American Indian Movement’s (AIM) insistence that the country face it in 1973. Few know that hundreds of massacres resulting in tens of thousands of deaths (and often the enslavement of survivors) occurred from the period of earliest settlement. English settlers murdered and enslaved Powhatan people in a 1609 war of extermination. In 1704, for example, Governor James Moore of the Carolina colony marched a volunteer militia all the way to northern Florida to slaughter one thousand Apalachee people and enslave two thousand more. This was one of dozens of such incidents that occurred before the American Revolution and the beginning of expansion across the continent. Frontier mercenaries known as “rangers,” early America’s version of “civilian contractors,” slaughtered the Cherokee in Georgia and East Tennessee and did the same to the Shawnee of the Ohio Valley. Several early presidential administrations (often cliques of land speculators who stood to make fortunes as the settlers moved west) gave themselves “plausible deniability” about some of the worst atrocities. In the seventy years after the United States became a nation, almost continuous warfare carved out a continental empire, killing hundreds of thousands of Native peoples and turning those who survived into colonial subjects penned in apartheid-style homelands. Massive fortunes accrued to white elites, and plantation slavery spread southwest. The psychopathic violence of counterinsurgency masterminds like Andrew Jackson made political careers. Jackson prepared himself for the presidency by ruthlessly destroying the Red Stick rebellion in the spring of 1814, a group of guerrilla fighters who received their nom de guerre from their crimson spears. In what is now northern Alabama, the so-called Battle of Horseshoe Bend made way for the creation of the states of Alabama and Mississippi, both slaveholding strongholds. This battle amounted to nothing more than a massacre of eight hundred Muskogee, Shawnee, and African insurgents who fought as “red sticks.” Like the décor fashioned from human skin, and the mask of Leatherface himself in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Jackson’s troops stitched saddles and horse bridles from the skin of their enemies and delivered scalps of fighters, of children, of old men, as souvenirs for “the women of Tennessee.”11 In the next century, because of the American empire’s overwhelming preponderance of military power, the United States and the world wandered through the dark carnival. Wars of extermination on the empire’s frontier were only the beginning. The human catastrophe the history textbooks file under “westward expansion” served only as precursor for the global violence of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 6.Horrors, Foreign and Domestic HARRY TRUMAN seemed to have a fine time of it when he served as an artillery officer in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. His letters home to Bess Truman are a peculiar cocktail of saccharine sentiment, blockheaded observations, and sheer bloodlust. Amid sweet nothings, he casually mentioned his pleasure at helping to lob “1,800 shells at the Huns.” All in all, Truman declared World War I a “terrific experience,” a sentiment only a young American of below-average intelligence could hold in 1917–1918. He did regret, as he said in one of his idiosyncratic love letters, that the warring powers signed the armistice when they did. The peace that settled on the blood lands of the western front on November 11, 1918, meant Truman would miss out on the chance to “detonate Germany and cut off a few of the Dutch [common slang for German] kids’ hands and feet and scalp a few of their old men but I guess it will be better to make them work for France and Belgium for fifty years.”12 Truman wore the uniform of a country about to become the next great power. The American home front suffered nothing in comparison to every other major participant in the global war, really almost nothing on its own terms. However, American combat troops suffered horrific casualties, especially given the short period the AEF engaged the German army: 116,000 dead and 266,000 wounded, a number that does not include the hundreds of thousands the war traumatized mentally. American culture simply did not respond to the cataclysm of the war the way much of the rest of the world did. While France, Britain, and Germany built cyclopean ossuaries to hold the mangled dead (Menin Gate, Douaumont, Tannenberg), statues of cheerful and brave doughboys littered America. In fact, even when it came to recalling the broad-gauge murder of the World War I, the business of America was business. E. M. Viquesney, originally of Spencer, Indiana, proved equal parts talented sculptor and virtuoso advertising shill with his The Spirit of the American Doughboy. In 1921 he sculpted a monument of America’s soldiers of the Great War that presented one of them emerging onto an imagined battlefield, the statue’s hollowed-out limbs made of cheap sheet bronze advancing toward an unseen enemy, right arm raised and left arm holding a Springfield rifle. Viquesney mass-produced the image, and city halls and civic groups across the country purchased the adventuresome-looking sculpture to place in front of courthouses, on major thoroughfares, in front of Veterans of Foreign Wars or American Legion halls, and on college campuses. In fact, the first appeared on the campus of Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, where it aged poorly in weather, nearly forgotten for a century. Finally, its shoddy condition caused enough embarrassment that the college replaced it.13 The emerging American consumer economy of the 1920s allowed individuals to break off a piece of Great War memory and take it home with them. Along with monuments for purchase by civic groups, Viquesney manufactured twelve-inch miniature figures of the statue and even a version of the statue in which the doughboy’s triumphantly extended right arm held . . . a light bulb. Advertising copy for this desktop ode to the American fighting man promised the piece would serve to memorialize “the intrepid Doughboy’s part in raising the hope-inspiring light of democracy for a world in darkness.” You could select a shade in “decorated parchment” or “elaborate silk.” There was no need to worry if you, like so many Americans in the twenties, found yourself low on cash but high on patriotism. You could buy on credit. The ad, in full caps, offered the unintentionally chilling phrase, “WE FINANCE YOU.”14 Viquesney never became immensely wealthy from The Spirit of the American Doughboy, but he made enough—partially from investment in local projects in Indiana—that he weathered the crash of ’29 with panache. But despite his promise that the spirit of the doughboy carried “a hope-inspiring light,” he himself suffered from depression exacerbated by personal loss and poor health. He asphyxiated himself in his garage in the autumn of 1946. The Spirit of the American Doughboy kept marching without his maker. In fact, he’s marching on a hundred years later. Since 1918, when, as is sometimes said, the British Empire won a war through suffering a horrific defeat, the island nation slowly began to lose the world it built for itself. America inherited that world and its problems but came up with new solutions . . . insidious solutions. But first, the muscular nation needed to secure the home front. Too many of America’s own citizens, including those denied the basic rights of citizenship, would not get with the program of shifting from an erstwhile republic into an economic and military empire. So the bleak world the United States built after the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 not only wreaked havoc around the globe. Americans, the working class, people of color, any dissenters, all suffered as their nation-state became a global leviathan. The foot soldiers of the new empire suffered first. While Viquesney made them archetypes in bronze, actual veterans returned home in 1919 with no economic prospects, having served a government unwilling to provide aid. World War I veterans anticipated what had popularly become known as a bonus payment from the government. The bonus, in the past paid in land as well as money, represented an imagined difference between what the soldier could earn at home as opposed to the pittance made as doughboys. For many, it embodied a kind of social covenant and a safety net that aided veterans after the economic disruption of military service.15 President Calvin Coolidge dismissively referred to the idea of the bonus as “patriotism which is bought and paid for,” though Congress overrode his veto and granted more than three million bonus certificates to veterans that they could redeem over time or borrow against. After the beginning of the Great Depression in ’29, President Herbert Hoover effectively rescinded this plan. Unemployed and deeply embittered, twenty-five thousand veterans marched on Washington with over ten thousand men and their families setting up Hooverville in Anacostia Flat, a muddy river bottom of the Potomac. The Senate declined to pass a bill paying out the bonus, and Hoover sent regular army troops, tanks, and machine guns to clear the tent city. The aggressive move resulted in one hundred injuries and wounds. Some veterans attempted to set up camp again, and this time Washington police fired on them, killing William Hushka and Eric Carlson. Both are buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Much-reduced bonus payments would eventually come in 1936. Some former doughboys took the route of many European Great War veterans and became the muscle for the new right-wing nationalisms that flourished like a sward of noxious weeds in the twenties. The boys back from France, especially those associated with the wealthier, upper-middle-class leadership of the American Legion, followed the lead of Mussolini’s veteran “Blackshirts” in seeking to stamp out even the hint of homegrown socialism. The head of the American Legion praised Mussolini’s war on “Bolshevism.”16 Admiration for Il Duce sometimes led to directly copying the violence of the Italian fasci. Such mob violence certainly did not limit itself to horror film screenings. On the first anniversary of the armistice in 1919, members of the American Legion attacked a hall belonging to the Centralia, Washington, branch of the International Workers of the World (the IWW, better known as Wobblies). Members of the organization, already harassed by local authorities and the public mobs who often worked with them, had the temerity to fight back. In the running gunfight that followed, ranging all over the streets of Centralia, they killed four legionnaires.17 Centralia authorities, aided by a posse, arrested eleven of the Wobblies. On November 12, members of the Legion cut the town’s power lines and used the thick darkness to break into Centralia’s jail and seize one of the imprisoned IWW members, Wesley Everest, himself a Great War veteran. The lynch mob murdered him in an especially ghastly fashion, then let his corpse lie on the river bottom overnight. Everest’s killers retrieved the corpse the next day, dropping it like a rag doll on the floor of the local jail, a rope still around its neck. Everest had become an IWW member soon after the war. Like many of his comrades, he returned home to a sluggish labor market at a time when a small number had made enormous fortunes, including some whose businesses had boomed because of the war. Furious at how the lumber barons reduced his fellow workers to penury and a nomadic, essentially homeless existence, he came to believe deeply in the IWW radical program to dismantle capitalism in America. His murder offered a lethal response from the freebooting barons of American industry. The country’s economic power brokers faced down open and violent dissent before. During the railroad, coal, and steel phase of the industrial revolution, the nation’s ruling class made use of brutal paramilitary contractors like the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, the recently reformed National Guard, and even the U.S. Army itself to break strikes, hunt down labor leaders, and respond with lethal force against striking workers. States deployed the National Guard one hundred times between 1886 and 1893 alone. A few months before the Great War began in 1914, National Guard troops and a private paramilitary force deployed by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (part of the Rockefeller empire) machine-gunned and burned to death whole families of striking workers who lived in a tent city raised outside the company-owned town of Ludlow.18 The American empire abroad thrived in a bloody permaculture fertilized at home. The idea that America is a democracy and not an empire simply doesn’t square with the facts. Denial of the right to vote has been a continuing theme in American history. Disenfranchisement of African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and even the white working class has been a political reality backed by violence. Individual states in the Cold War passed laws restricting the rights of Americans who joined “communist-front” organizations and then created their own blacklists. Meanwhile, even before the digital age, the national security state practiced counterinsurgency at home as well as abroad. Since a 1978 law that allowed the FBI to continue spying on American citizens, the bureau asked for thirteen thousand warrants with only one ever denied.19 The Great War triggered the repressive power of government and corporate interests to coalesce. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the slightest peep out of dissenting political groups often led to power brokers responding with the bludgeon of a mailed fist. Seattle experienced a general strike in February of 1919, though one in which workers made exceedingly minor demands. The mayor received the aid of the U.S. Marine Corps to squash the effort. In the fall, police in Boston went on strike with the simple demand that city government allow them to join the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a moderate and arguably even conservative labor organization. Public officials around the country used terms like agents of Lenin and Bolshevik nightmare to describe their action. The threat of an intervention by the army again crushed the strike.20 Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer’s raids against suspected radicals are well known. The incidents of mob violence and local repression that accompanied them have not become a part of American memory. A Connecticut salesman spent six months in prison for praising Lenin’s intelligence. An Indiana jury acquitted a man for killing an immigrant who had said “to hell with the United States” a bit loudly and in public. The rule on Amity Island has always been to never bring up the shark, especially on the Fourth of July.21 Official acts of repression also unleashed lynch mobs against African American communities and individuals. The fear of political subversion made a poison alliance with white supremacy. The violence visited on sharecroppers in Alabama and Arkansas who attempted to unionize provides an example. But, with savage irony, mobs also targeted Black communities if they became cradles of small-scale capitalism, havens for an emerging Black middle class behind what W. E. B. Du Bois called “the veil” of Jim Crow. The pogrom against the “Black Wall Street” of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 has become the best known of such incidents. However, white supremacist violence erupted against African Americans in Washington, D.C., as early as the summer of 1919, some of it directed specifically against Black veterans of the Great War. Outside of these large-scale assaults, seventy-eight Black men died at the hands of lynch mobs in 1919, many of them burned alive in public rituals, enacted amid a carnival atmosphere.22 Leaders of heavy industry and finance could afford to act with near impunity against working-class Americans. The United States had been a debtor nation in 1914, but most of the world found itself indentured to the nation by war’s end in 1918. By 1929, Great Britain owed the United States an amount equivalent to one half their national income. Much has been made of the effect of the payment of war reparations by Germany, though the practice had long been a part of European peace settlements. The real story concerns how the United States saw the payment of German marks to Britain and France as crucial to maintaining a credit squeeze on their allies, keeping much of Europe servicing a mortgaged war. One financial writer for The Boston Journal made this plain, crowing triumphantly that, “Europeans must pay tribute for years to come.”23 So emerged the roaring twenties, a state of mind rather than a historical era. Some of the myths of the twenties actually happened. A nation of Gatsbys held parties for the extravagantly wealthy, and bathtub gin, jazz, and short skirts gilded life with glamour even for some of the plebeians. Millionaires became multi-millionaires. Many Americans who bought into the decade’s optimism looked askance at socialists and even organized labor. They believed that captains of industry wrangled their impossible wealth on the frontier of America’s Wild West economy through sheer force of will. Moreover, in this world of new American possibility, they themselves might own at least a small strip of beachfront on Amity Island one day . . . at least a little cottage with oceanfront access so they could go back into the water. By 1929, the entanglement of American money with the international debtor economy led the country into crisis. The shark had started feeding. America coughing caused the rest of the world to die of pneumonia in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. But in truth what historian Eric Hobsbawm describes as the “house of cards” created by the first (but not the last) American effort to shape the world economy had come crashing down.24 7.Weird Mystery Tales THE GREAT Depression represented a crisis for American capitalism and also suggested a crisis of confidence. Left-wing organizations, including a public and popular Communist Party of the United States of America, drew one hundred thousand new members and made allies in labor unions and left-leaning organizations. Many Americans wanted change in the thirties, a period that has become known as the country’s Red Decade. And yet, optimistic images of the American spirit like the unfortunate Viquesney public square monuments and parlor room tchotchkes reveal that much of the nation saw itself as a kind of Amity Island fifty-five years before Steven Spielberg’s Jaws (1975) gave the image to the world. In the minds of many middle-class white Americans, their towns and cities functioned like privately owned resorts, and the country itself could forget that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it had been a battleground of many nations, some European and others native to the continent. Politicians, who represented the interests of the wealthiest Americans and the class that aspired to be like them, could even speak of “isolationism,” a country able to hide behind its two walls of water after having done its part in a world war. Isolationism has largely been a myth that really means “the United States will make unilateral decisions rather than forming meaningful alliances.” During the era isolationism supposedly shaped American standards of international behavior, the country launched incursions into Mexico, occupied two Caribbean nations, toppled the government of Nicaragua, and seized major islands in the Pacific and dozens of small islands for what was rapidly becoming the American tradition of building multiple military bases in every region of the globe. The pretense of isolation extended to culture as well. European veterans scripted, produced, directed, and acted in what would become the first silent horror films, but Americans eschewed the emerging genre. When Variety reviewed Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the entertainment magazine tried to interest American audiences by calling it “a mystery story told in the Poe manner,” though it also warned them “it is morbid.” A much stronger, indeed violent, reaction to the film appeared in the streets of Los Angeles when Miller’s Theatre attempted to premier it in May of 1921. A two-thousand-person-strong protest, ginned up by William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers, prevented the film from being shown. Moving Picture World, a bubblegum guide for movie fans, wrote Caligari off as more evidence of “degenerate German invention.”25 Lingering anti-German sentiment left over from the Great War explains some of the negative responses to a motion picture that would play an important role in reimagining what a film could do, what it could be about, and how it could call forth new emotions. But something even more pungent, part of the bone and marrow of belief in a particular kind of America, called forth these violent responses. Most Americans did not like horror, or more accurately they thought it had nothing but ill intent. In fact, Americans seldom to never used the word horror as an adjective for films, fiction, stage plays, carnival shows, or other entertainment outlets. The use of the word weird in describing most any storytelling that departed from formulaic American flicks featuring action, romance, and comedy (often all at once) predated the Great War. Reviewers often described turn-of-the-century magic shows, especially those that encouraged audiences to view their illusions as the supernatural creeping across the boundaries of the rational, as weird. Any film that suggested mystery, supernatural or not, received the label weird. Early film magazines regularly described the weirdness of comedies that featured humorous ghosts, even when they turned out to be dreams or a kind of Scooby-Doo experience of a human pretending to be a visitant from beyond. The cinema scholar who has written the most about how Americans received and reviewed “weird” films, Kendall R. Phillips, sees a peculiar turn in attitudes toward them. By the time of the Great War, reviewers for magazines like Variety had begun to connect spooky topics on screen with “foreign” productions that are also described as “ghastly” or pretentious. The term weird went, Phillips writes, from being a general term for tales of the fantastic “to connoting films that were decidedly foreign and, ultimately, un-American.”26 Americans wanted their entertainment to let them visit an Amity Island without the shark. Threats to the beautiful heroes of cinema had to be of the criminal, often inept, variety in the 1910s and early ’20s. Americans raised monuments to the happy warriors their doughboys had supposedly been or used the image as peculiar reading lamps or parlor lighting, as the ads for the patriotic saint statues said, “in a world of darkness.” But as they did, large numbers of actual veterans fared poorly in the postwar years, a fact that helps us understand the otherwise inexplicable rage Hearst could stir over the showing of a somewhat challenging German art film that Americans hadn’t exactly clamored to see in the first place. 8.Empire’s Butcher Bill THE SECOND World War accelerated the options opened to the new world power as the United States took control of military bases all over the world. Bases leased from Britain in exchange for U.S. arms marked a kind of formal changing of the imperial guard, the last wheezing gasp of “Rule, Britannia!” An aggressive American foreign policy created flash points of conflict with the Soviet Union that provided numerous opportunities for the United States to extend its reach. Japan and islands seized from it like Okinawa gave the United States far-flung ports of call. West Germany hosted hundreds of U.S. bases during most of the Cold War. But this wasn’t enough and so, sometimes, the United States just took what it wanted without apology. In 1953, the United States seized a sizable chunk of Indigenous lands in Greenland, giving its inhabitants only a brief deadline before the U.S. Army bulldozed their communities. This became a forward base for America’s nuclear triad and is the root of one of the Trump administration’s frequent non sequiturs, a briefly touted plan to “buy Greenland.” The small-footprint empire that the national security state thought it had made had at least as much, perhaps more, destructive effects on the world than earlier powers. The large land and naval empires of the past ruled oppressively but, in cases like Austria-Hungary or the Ottomans, they also held in check and even salved conflicts between the peoples within their borders for hundreds of years. American hegemony had the opposite effect, ginning up older conflicts and even creating new ones. Since 9/11, the contours of the American empire have become increasingly clear. Ironically, President George W. Bush—until 2016 perhaps the chief executive most ill-informed about American foreign policy and one who surrounded himself with a coterie of operatives with decades of secrets to keep—spoke most openly and forthrightly about American imperial imperatives. In September of 2002, what became known as the Bush Doctrine called for preemptive strikes against any nation, at any time, in order to make possible “free and open societies.” It also, for the first time in American history, declared that the United States would not allow any nation to challenge its military preeminence as had the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Karl Rove, often referred to as “Bush’s brain,” announced matter-of-factly that “we’re an empire now . . . we’re history’s actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” An openness about the expansive use of American power continued, transmogrifying under the Trump regime into weaponized tweets that advertised threats, insults, ambitions, and sometimes even explicit initiatives—empire gone viral. The immense popularity of horror, and the violence horror revels in, restages the horror of empire’s reach for screaming audiences and chilled readers, who can’t take their eyes off the mayhem on screen and page. It’s the nature of living in an empire. Life in the empire means, above all, experiencing violence as a way of life. The shape this takes depends very much on whether you are a citizen, a citizen with limited constitutional and cultural protections, or a subject with no rights that the unimaginable colossus of American power sees itself bound to protect. But whether you are part of a wedding party slaughtered by a U.S. drone attack in Yemen or a bored middle-class dad in Kansas flipping between news channels featuring stories about school shootings and footage of explosions in places you couldn’t locate on a map, lethal threat and force are the coin of the imperial realm.27 So it has ever been with empires. The Assyrians of the ancient Near East welcomed you to their cities with monuments made of the skulls of their enemies, stele that celebrated the destruction of whole civilizations and their peoples. The Roman Empire brought its captive opponents in chains to parade them through the streets of their capital. Even Victorian Britain featured carnivals and freak shows that displayed the subjects of the empire as primitive, exotic, and defeated. The British Museum became a warehouse of objects ripped from the hands of colonized peoples. We have horror. It speaks our language of violence and conquest, sometimes to alarm us and sometimes to tell us that daddy vanquished the monster under the bed. Multiple Hugo Award–winner N. K. Jemisin’s now classic The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms featured a scene where the protagonist confronts the way the imperial power that runs her world legitimizes itself through lies, half-truths, and the general assumption of superiority. “They found so many ways to lie about the things they did,” she thinks. “It mocked the suffering of their victims.” It’s become very easy for us to lie about the things we do and to mock our victims’ suffering. Since Rove admitted the United States not only built an empire but could rearrange how the public conceives of reality, few Americans have been aware of the drone strikes that have killed civilians at weddings, at funerals, and in civilian refugee convoys. Living as a citizen of the empire means never having to think about it. Meanwhile, living as a subject, or victim, of the empire means never being able to forget it. Horror films are one of the few places the nature, the violence, and the failure of American power blinks in the unearthly light of the present, a blighted, ugly fog where you can find yourself wandering in a past they didn’t teach you about in school or looking into the abyss of a lost future. In Puerto Rico, you are ignored and disenfranchised with no voice to speak with and no vote to cast after being hit by a catastrophic Category 5 storm like 2017’s Hurricane Maria. In Sudan, your family grocery explodes after a drone strike, killing your brother and his wife because a “person of interest” who may or may not have been associated with Al-Qaeda or ISIS lived a block away. If you are an eighteen-year-old Marine Recon recruit between 2003 and 2021, you hump your way through a desert toward mountains likely hived with caves of Taliban fighters. You are about to become a casualty of a war that started before you were born. Privileged America doesn’t understand all the ways reality differs from their experience of it. There is a shadow moving at the edge of our consciousness, and the maestros of our dreams remind us it waits there. 9.The Thing on the Stairs “AS SOON as I looked up, there it was, and it was horrible.” Ray Bradbury, a little kid in the twenties, experienced waking nightmares of a monster balefully watching him from the top of the stairs. He remembered how the shadowed presence waited for him nearly every night. He would scream, sometimes fall backward onto the floor at the ghastly presence. He could recall, nearly ninety years later, his parents sighing and saying, “Oh my God, here we go again.”28 If a monster haunted the stairwell, a peculiar combination of rockets and dinosaurs filled his dreams with wonder. At the age of five, Bradbury thrilled to The Lost World, a 1925 film based on a novel by Arthur Conan Doyle that imagined explorers finding a land of dinosaurs in a remote part of the Amazon basin. He soon devoured Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. In his teens, he befriended the future genius of stop-motion animation Ray Harryhausen when both joined the Los Angeles chapter of the Science Fiction League. The boys had been enchanted by King Kong (1933), a film both friends claimed they saw hundreds of times. A love and terror of the primal, prehistoric beasts and behemoths from out of time lived in the same heart as an obsession with the future. It was one of the many paradoxes in the life of Bradbury that the man who wrote The Martian Chronicles and predicted everything from earbuds to artificial intelligence hated the internet, refused to type on a computer, did not want any of his work released in electronic format, and never learned to drive. And yet, he has inspired several generations with a dream of the stars. NASA gave the touchdown site of the Mars rover Curiosity the name Bradbury Landing when, on what would have been his ninety-second birthday, it settled into the waterless volcano-born regolith of the red planet.29 As a young teen, Bradbury found relief from his monsters by writing a short story a week in the basement of the UCLA library. Having discovered he could rent a typewriter for ten cents, his fingers began clattering away. Only death chilled them to a halt in 2012. Science fiction and horror are siblings, twins who have always tried and failed to cut a different figure from one another in the world. Dreams of the stars never really banished the terror of Bradbury’s monsters, and some of his anxieties remained decidedly earthbound. While he watched American society descend into political conformity in the 1950s, he wrote Fahrenheit 451 about a not-so-unbelievable near future where the “firemen” burn books because of the danger they present to the social order. Bradbury’s first short story collection, Dark Carnival, appeared in 1947 from Arkham House, a press first created for the sole purpose of publishing the short fiction of H. P. Lovecraft. The stories, many of them later republished in his 1955 The October Country, deal with how a skeleton might decide it could get along without its fleshier parts, how death might play the gentleman caller, and the kinds of things that live in the deep places of the earth. They are his monster at the top of the stairs. He went back to this nightmare land in the 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes, a book he originally called (again) Dark Carnival. Probably known to most for the Disney film adaptation, it’s arguably the best novel of Bradbury’s incredibly prolific career. In it, Cooger and Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to a small town, appearing in the middle of the night. The lights of the carnival draw the townspeople, all dissatisfied with their lives, into halls of mirrors, dark rides, the carnival clown’s uncomfortable laughter, and the call of the barker that offers wonder, mysteries, and something new, something different, if ultimately something as wicked as the title suggests. The small town as the setting for something dark to emerge has haunted the American imagination over the last century. It’s the little California village of Santa Mira where the pod people descend, a place where everyone knows everyone and there’s just the one local doctor in the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In 1960, Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone offered “A Stop at Willoughby,” the story of an anxiety-ridden businessman given the chance at a new life in a little burg. The viewer learns of the true horror of such seemingly anodyne hopes when the dream ends, and we face a more believable bleakness. Tobe Hooper imagined a lethal carnival coming to a little Florida town in The Funhouse (1981), a place where Mom and Dad tranquilly watch Bride of Frankenstein at home while a maniac dons a rubber mask of Boris Karloff’s monster and slaughters their kids in the ultimate haunted ride. In 1984, the nightmare comes to quiet Elm Street when Freddy Krueger extends his serrated glove in murderous rage, or maybe, the film asks us, it already lived in the hearts of the parents and their very eighties fear of the ill-kempt stranger. Stephen King’s Derry, Maine, was a little hamlet of human-made horrors before terrifying transdimensional clowns began croaking out of storm drains in the novel It, the 1990 TV limited series, and the more recent blockbuster films. Simple, staid, and very white America. When the sinister carnival comes, all the fairy tales that have poisoned us come alive and show their teeth. But even then, we’d rather believe the monsters are out there, and not in here with us. Even the most paranoid of Americans have found a way to tell themselves horror stories that are ultimately comforting. 10.The Greenbaum Effect THE WAY of the shark, the story of an innocent America fighting an outside threat, ultimately wants you to believe everything is just fine. Because of the nature of American exceptionalism, and because of the structures of imperial control that hardwire how Americans experience reality, some aspects of horror culture assure the watcher that everything’s okay and, in fact, really, really nice. Horror’s nightmares have not escaped the American dream of consumption and domination. One response to the confrontation with a reality in which “the worst thing is true” has been to amass stockpiles of weapons, suppress Black and Brown Americans, and attempt to exclude, colonize, and even exterminate perceived foreign threats. Don’t worry about the thing on the stairs. If you don’t want to be “woke,” it’s terribly cozy to sleep on peacefully while vast tracts of American horror culture allow you to float in Amity’s warm and woozy dream. But you can hear the chain saw’s death rattle in your dreams. Horror has also whispered about things we did not want to know, would prefer not to hear, about American history. These are stories that, while well-documented, you likely have either not heard of or, if you did, sounded like odd anecdotes. In some cases, you may think some of what you’ll read about can be dismissed as conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories are, like horror, tales of how the worst thing you imagine is true. “You think things are bad? Well, let me tell you, buddy, you don’t know the half of it.” Most readers likely view the conspiracy theorist as someone engaged in a granular drilling into obscure facts helped along by untreated mental illness who then freely dispenses the false information they have cobbled together. The idea of conspiracy has a complicated history, much too complex to relate here. Historians and cultural critics have sometimes viewed the American people as peculiarly vulnerable to false conspiracies. The American colonies premised their war for independence on the idea of a “conspiracy against the rights of Englishmen” among the king’s coterie of advisors. The country’s first partisan election in 1800 found John Adams supporters claiming Thomas Jefferson to be a member of the Illuminati who would confiscate Americans’ Bibles. In the midst of America’s post–World War II red scare, with many Americans certain Bolsheviks hid under their beds, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote his essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics” for Harper’s Magazine. Hofstadter claimed that a “paranoid style” of political rhetoric had been part of the American experience since the early national era and that it infected people across the political spectrum. In the 1950s, it just so happened that the American right had begun to suffer, “afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us,” but also by their “fantasies” about how the world works.30 The way Americans use conspiracy is, of course, not just a matter of the past. Tom Engelhardt wrote in 2015 that white Americans believe themselves the victims of various dark conspiracies by terrorists, even as they enjoy the protection of the most formidable arsenal of conventional and unconventional weapons in history. He notes that at a Trump rally in New Hampshire, audience members told horror stories about “‘training camps’ for terrorists” and a “new holocaust” taking place right there in New England with people “loaded into boxcars” and assassinated by ISIS. Then-candidate Trump said nothing to discourage such talk, as it fit his and his supporters’ “fact-challenged fantasy of a country,” a military and economic colossus somehow being victimized in lurid, gothic terms. Trumpism and its adherents may represent the apogee of what these and many other writers and thinkers have claimed about conspiracy theory. The belief in Qanon, the driving engine of Trumpism’s most devoted followers, seems to confirm America’s special identity as Conspiracy Nation. In order to understand these strange impulses, it appears we are forced to disagree with Hofstadter’s assertion that all of us have to deal with history’s afflictions, while conspiratorial thinkers are what he calls “double sufferers” in facing “the real world” and “their fantasies.” Is this true? What if the fantasies Americans accept as false conspiracy theories protect them from the real world? Perhaps it proved easier in the fifties to think about your government hiding a flying saucer than it is to look into how your country became the first, and so far the only, nation ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population. Or in the 1980s it seemed anything but comforting to tell myths about Satanists who murdered innocents at will. But perhaps it proved more salutary to the mind than the well-documented fact that your country engaged with terrorists, gunrunners, and international drug cartels to funnel arms to a band of mercenaries plotting to overthrow a legally elected government in Central America, or that the nation bears responsibility for brutal dictatorships ranging from the Iranian shah to Idi Amin to the Khmer Rouge? The strange story of Dr. Corydon Hammond and the illusory “Dr. Greenbaum” best illustrates this tendency of false conspiracy theories to add an extra layer of confusion to the nation’s maleficence. Hammond gave us a perfect template for this mythic bait and switch best called the Greenbaum effect. At a major medical conference in 1992, Hammond claimed that a Jewish scientist he identified simply as Greenbaum worked with the Nazis during World War II, teaching them various satanic mind control techniques learned from the kabbalah. After the war, this sinister figure came to the United States, where the CIA recruited him in their efforts to perfect brainwashing techniques. Somewhere in this anti-Semitic super villain fantasy, the highly peripatetic Greenbaum helped build a demonic infrastructure in America made up of, Hammond claimed, “tens of thousands of mental robots” engaged in everything from gunrunning to child molestation rings. All of this, he asserted, had the goal of creating “a Satanic Order that will rule the world.”31 Hammond’s claims call for chilly sarcasm. His use of age-old anti-Semitic tropes and laughable suggestions of satanic influence, however, hide the fact that almost every one of his unsustainable claims has a real-world analogue, a refracted mirror image of his easily falsifiable assertions. For example, we will see in this book that the CIA and the Pentagon did recruit Nazis to work toward American hegemony in the Cold War. The CIA also engaged in experiments with mind control, primarily with LSD, focused on the prison population. Former CIA directors have testified before Congress to this effect, and you can read the official history of the MK-Ultra experiments on the agency’s own website and in declassified documents available from the National Security Agency. And while the perpetual delusions of satanic covens kidnapping and killing children have zero basis in evidence, gunrunning has been a foundation of American foreign policy with a particularly egregious example, the Iran-Contra scandal, coming to light just a few years before Hammond made his claims.32 The Greenbaum effect is the tendency of Americans to choose outlandish and unsupported conspiracy theories while ignoring the conspiratorial actions of political and economic elites that are backed by evidence. It has shaped almost every decade of American life we’ll consider. Hammond’s early-1990s vacation from reality reveals that fictions immunize the public against the dark realities, neutralizing them and causing rational people to question other assertions of conspiracy, actual conspiracies, when they appear based on fact and from reliable sources. If a huge number of Americans are ineptly tangled in conspiratorial beliefs while ignoring actual conspiracies, another and perhaps larger proportion of the country uses conspiracy theory as a term of derision for any suggestion that powerful economic and political elites might collude together for unethical purposes. As this book explores in part 3, the CIA and a very willing American media engaged in a psy-ops campaign in 1968 to damn the ideas of the conspiracy theory and conspiracy theorist. Their conspiracy to spread conspiracy theory worked more thoroughly and quietly than most of their other efforts. One finds even among rational Americans, maybe especially among them, the tendency to use conspiracy theory to describe well-documented facts like the Iran-Contra arms deal, the CIA arming of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the 1980s, and the influence of the petroleum industry over the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. The same well-worn terms are used to describe evidence-free absurdities such as alien crafts being hidden away at Roswell, New Mexico, or a race of lizard people masquerading as the world’s ruling elite. In the meantime, false conspiracies, often weaponized by racism, flourish. Real conspiracies have hidden in plain sight. Now and again, as we’ll see with the flying saucer panic of the 1950s, the praetorians of American empire have seen the utility of the Greenbaum effect, pushing absurd fantasies to hide the empire’s work. This has allowed the American empire to have not only a “small footprint” but also in the lives of most of its citizens, an invisible one. It’s always been easy to sound a little crazy talking about American imperial power. The power of the Greenbaum effect and the public decision to regard some facts as Michael Parenti’s “dirty truths” makes it a risky endeavor to state the obvious. 11.Stranded in a Nightmare CONTEMPORARY AMERICANS feel stranded in their history. Those born in the seventies, eighties, or nineties, they called their grandparents “the greatest generation.” They learned a little about the Vietnam War, mostly from the movies. Something bad had happened there, something that was no one in particular’s fault. The events of 9/11 shocked them into supporting a war that cost them nothing. The upsurge of patriotism in the first Bush administration did not impel these Americans to volunteer for military service; recruiters noted in 2003 that few seemed to want to sign up for an actual war. The president told them to “get down to Disney World in Florida” and “go shopping.”33 But this is no tired polemic about the current generation’s inability to live up to some imagined greatness in the past. For the American generations who were your grandparents or great-grandparents, the world was easier than they admit—if they were white and in a relatively stable economic situation. World War II created the largest and most prosperous middle class not only in American history, but in the history of the world. The G.I. Bill, at least for white veterans, opened up the possibility of home ownership in suburbia and, because of segregation in the form of housing covenants, homogenous neighborhoods. The G.I. Bill allowed the U.S. government to build a white middle class quite literally from the ground up with subsidies for education as well as housing. Wages rose so high for middle-class Americans that they confessed themselves baffled by the changes from the 1930s. And, like the old false dream of the West, indeed like some biblical prophecy, deserts bloomed in California, Nevada, and Colorado after federal damming and irrigation projects. Hydroelectric power brought both light and water to what early white settlers had seen as a wilderness eager to kill them. National Geographic painted an image of the American frontier turned from threat to quiet paradise with “endless farms, all atwinkle, like stars along a manmade Milky Way.”34 Peace and security and more than the hint of the elusive notion of happiness. But, as often in peculiar dreams, many Americans felt a chill and knew something was very wrong. The American horror film that, as early as the 1950s, began to remind us again and again of the dues of empire, attracted fans who experienced these costs in their daily lives. The most escapist of such films, from the sometimes bizarrely optimistic sci-fi of the fifties to Jaws in the seventies, promised the bliss of terror quieted: there are threats, but we will defeat them and you, viewer, are part of that “we” that will benefit from the violence we will execute in your name. We are blowing up the shark for you. But the shark and its death throes offer only horror that comforts the comfortable. The shark is not just the predator gliding in the water out there. Imperial power does not simply do its wet work abroad. White supremacist and class violence have become the cost of maintaining the wealthy, the gated communities, the suburbs, and the illusion of safety. Global economic exploitation begins at home. Shadows purple mainland America, and even those who have thrived in the system see it from the corner of their eyes before quickly looking away. In many rural states, the death rate among infants, especially in marginalized groups, places the United States at thirty-second among the thirty-five wealthiest nations in infant mortality. In a country where everyone from paupers to billionaires report themselves as “middle class,” an aspirational assertion more than anything, one quarter of American households somehow subsist on under twenty-five thousand dollars a year. Many of these households include more than one wage earner, often working an exhausting and debilitating job in construction day labor or the fast-food industry. Nursing home assistants, day care employees, home health care workers, and EMTs are told to see their long and stressful weeks as vocations even as they struggle to pay bills. Tens of millions labor in the often-humiliating worlds of big-box retail, the daily uncertainty of the gig economy, the cubicled call center, or the dangerous, dehumanizing abattoirs of factory farming.35 Tobe Hooper understood this when he made his cannibalistic family out of people destroyed by their work in a slaughterhouse that didn’t need them anymore. Jordan Peele knew the same in 2019 when the film Us (U.S.?) featured the zombie-like “tethered” coming forth from an underground world to destroy the America of showboat SUVs and vacation homes more luxuriant than the houses much of America rents from a landlord, or from a bank. During the last century, the United States has been, writes historian Joshua B. Freeman, “as dominant in the world, in its own way, as Great Britain and Rome had been at the height of their empires.” But Freeman may underestimate American power, or at least what living in the empire has meant for the nation-state’s middle and upper classes. Inequality defends itself against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There’s not a question now of “how the other half lives” within the borders of the nation, what Americans took to calling “the homeland” in the early twenty-first century. Instead of “two halves,” there’s instead now 70 percent of us hustling and striving every day to live on declining wages and limited access to health care, a (relatively) stable and secure 29 percent of us whose privilege is more fragile than we think, and a tiny coterie of tech and investment oligarchs who have utterly unimaginable wealth counted not in the billions and often not even in the tens of billions but in the hundreds of billions. Hooper’s vision, the horror film literally reframing American history in all its primeval savagery, has remained the best and simultaneously the most politically subversive part of the genre. The alleged age of prosperity feared the atom bomb and the invasion of alien forces that would burn the suburbs to the ground, forces that could stand in for Soviets or Black Power advocates. While the country became mired in its violent campaigns in Southeast Asia, George A. Romero created an army of the dead. In the Reagan era, white flight took those who could still afford it from the suburbs to the exurbs, quiet towns now supposedly safe but threatened by unstoppable menaces like Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger. After 9/11, pronouncements of war without end and brutal retaliation against all conceivable enemies brought Romero’s zombies back from the dead while making torture sadism a Roman coliseum of the American mind at the local Cineplex. Horror waits for us at the end of empire’s dreaming.",

      "content": "1.Twilight Zone THE ROAR of sixteen-inch naval guns made one young Navy recruit from Brooklyn imagine a hundred subway trains flying over his head. Amid the cacophony of the explosions unleashed from nearby ships, Ensign Gabe Pressman could not identify the even more massive shells lobbed in his direction, thinking at first the flashes across the crepuscular horizon must be heat lightning. Pressman’s small ship, the PC-470, formed part of the American seventh fleet that steamed into the Philippines to retake the American colony, seized by Japan at the same time they struck Pearl Harbor. The small craft normally performed patrol duty, sometimes acting as a submarine chaser tracking the Nazi “wolfpacks” of U-boats in the Atlantic. On October 23, Pressman’s boat faced the daunting challenge of landing troops on the fortified island of Leyte. The American invasion force included a future writer who, anguished almost daily by his experience of combat, became one of the most trenchant critics of the country whose uniform he wore in that late October of 1944. Halloween came early for him, and millions of others, that year.1 Rodman Edward Serling had the terrifying experience of landing on Leyte and establishing a beachhead. Japanese snipers harassed his unit, the 511th Parachute regiment, who fought as light infantry in the Pacific. Rod, as everyone called Serling, joined the army immediately after finishing high school in 1943. In the days before graduation, he’d been aglow with idealism about the war against the Axis, and tried, not very successfully, to recruit his friends at Binghamton Central High School in New York. Serling would also be disappointed in his hopes of getting to Europe to fight the Nazis. Instead, he found himself the summer after high school graduation training with his regiment in New Guinea for the planned assault on the Philippines. He had no concept of what awaited him on Leyte. The landing itself proved surprisingly easy. The battle raged offshore while Serling’s unit hit the sand behind the main landing parties. The smell of cordite, charred metal, and burning petroleum saturated the air as American and Japanese airplanes twisted into death spirals and fell into the Pacific, staining the turquoise waters black and red. Although they had no way of knowing it, Serling on the beach and Pressman from the deck of PC-470 took part in the largest naval engagement in human history. American submarines sank two cruisers. The American carrier USS Princeton exploded in a giant ball of flame following attacks of wave after wave of Japanese Zero fighters. The enormous hulk slid under the water as little more than shattered steel debris. In turn, American Hellcat fighters made this victory costly, downing a huge number of land-based Japanese aircraft. Meanwhile, repeated attacks from American torpedoes against the largest battleship in the world, Japan’s seventy-thousand-ton Musashi, eventually capsized the beast, the seas trembling under the monster’s weight before embracing it. On October 25, the third day of the battle, another American escort carrier took a direct hit from a kamikaze attack and gurgled under the waves only an hour later. Serling knew little about the details of the carnage occurring offshore the relatively peaceful sands of Leyte Island. Despite continuing attacks of snipers, the beach had been won. His unit soon moved inland, where they encountered significant resistance from Japanese ground forces. In a single firefight, Serling received wounds in the wrist and knee, although, per army policy with combat troops in the Second World War, he quickly returned to combat. But a more gruesome memory of the Battle of Leyte Gulf stayed with the nineteen-year-old. Serling could hear the peculiar combination of faraway explosions and airplane engines competing with the eerie counterpoint of somnolent surf sliding across the sand. Serling paused with some of his fellow soldiers in the so-called Death Squad, the demolitions platoon of the 511th with a reputation for high casualties given the nature of their work, attempting to disarm land mines and booby traps under the deadly eye of Japanese snipers. The sun broiled high and hot, but a breeze picked up across the ocean spray now and again. Serling sweated under a palm tree with some of his fellow privates while his buddy Melvin Levy, the 511th’s aspiring comedian, performed some impromptu stand-up for their other pals. In the middle of his routine, a low-flying U.S. transport plane suddenly roared overhead and dropped its payload of army rations, an enormous crate weighing hundreds of pounds. The huge container knocked Serling to the sand but barely scraped him. It landed directly on Levy. Serling saw his friend decapitated, the sudden impact turning him into human paste.2 An absurd accident amid the chaos of one of the decisive battles of the Second World War. A meaningless sacrifice, an incident that seems like it belongs in Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. For Serling, it opened a doorway to a dimension of the imagination, a region in the middle ground between sight and shadow, the entry point into the twilight zone. 2.Death of the Monsters? THE ENTRANCE of the United States into World War II came at a time when, not unlike the plot of one of Universal Studio’s classics, the monsters died only to resuscitate and return. They could and did become icons of empire. A new kind of fandom for horror films appeared. This audience had been forged by large groups of mainstream fans of the golden age of the early thirties that played a crucial role in keeping the macabre alive when the studios showed little interest. The release of 1935’s Bride of Frankenstein showed every indication of being the last of the great Universal Studio horror films, and horror seemed out of style. After 1936, Universal went into receivership under the guidance of the powerful John Cheever Cowdin. His portfolio included Standard Capital, Ideal Chemical, and Curtiss-Wright, the largest supplier of airplanes and aviation-related war material for the American army at the end of World War II. Cowdin sat as president and member of the Board of Directors of Universal Studios during this entire period, while studio head and early Hollywood icon Carl Laemmle Sr. received a promotion that removed him from day-to-day operations, and Laemmle Jr.—responsible for ensuring the production of masterpieces like The Phantom of the Opera, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dracula, and both of James Whale’s Frankenstein pictures—received a pink slip. He retired into relatively wealthy obscurity by age thirty. Cowdin seems like a caricature of a mid-century American capitalist, owning more companies than he could pay attention to, distracted by his interest in polo, having his multiple marriages blessed aboard his yacht Surf, and getting himself voted one of the best-dressed men of his era by Esquire. Under his benign neglect, a new vision of filmmaking emerged at Universal that favored cost cutting and subject matter that suited Americans who understandably wanted to avoid thinking of themselves as victims of their own economic system.3 The 1936 Universal film My Man Godfrey provides a perfect example, featuring a story of a Boston Brahmin with the bluest of blood who decides to live in a “hobo camp” for a bit of slumming adventure. The hero marries thirties beauty Carole Lombard after saving her dad’s business and opens a night club that puts his homeless pals to work. It’s a plot more bizarre than any monster movie, a fantasy of an America free of class conflict, where money that appears out of nowhere sets everything to rights and romantic love quite literally seals the deal. Audiences loved it and so did the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which nominated the flick for six awards. Universal decided its future lay in big-budget romances, light-hearted musicals, and serials like Radio Patrol and Jungle Jim. The latter became a successful effort to plagiarize the Tarzan books and films while joining the rise of “jungle horror” in legitimizing allegedly primitive people’s needs of American patronage abroad. Horror from the crypt and the laboratory seemed dead in this new environment. The genre suffered further from years of a near glut of films at the box office, not all of them the classic monsters from Universal. In 1935, rival studios had given the world the Werewolf of London, The Raven, and the Mark of the Vampire, with Universal managing to sneak past the censors a year later, with some significant changes, a wildly outré sexual and psychological thriller entitled Dracula’s Daughter. The deluge of scary caused one alarmed writer for The New York Times to worry that morbid films embodied “the national state of mind.”4 He may have been right. The term horror fan had not yet become a common one. But these fans of darkness were out there and, more important, the children of the Depression wanted to meet the monsters their older brothers and sisters obsessed over. The year 1938 surprised the studios and started a new round of horror films, most much less creative than the first efforts but satisfying for the generation that would fight the Second World War. My Man Godfrey seemed from another world. 3.My Man Frankenstein THE CRAZE started in Beverly Hills when a single hard-up theater owner had the idea of trying to revive the success of horror enjoyed in the early thirties by showing Frankenstein, Dracula, and King Kong in a marathon triple showing. The response was a bit too positive, with police called to restrain the crowds. Universal started charging hefty rental fees for their marquee monsters, and larger venues on Wilshire made room for the incredibly raucous crowds that seemed almost desperate to see the films again. Most theaters dropped King Kong, or added the RKO property to another double feature, but Dracula and Frankenstein stayed together, a deeply twisted meet-cute. Soon the Blue Mouse Theatre in Seattle picked up the idea promising “A MAMMOTH HORROR SHOW!” The Seattle Daily Times on August 25, 1938, seemed proud, if a little tentative, that their city “kept pace with the success that has attended this weird mystery entertainment.”5 The Seattle paper mused that the double bill offered a good opportunity for what it called “jaded mystery fans.” But it’s clear that the crowds coming to see what motion picture trade papers dubbed “the horror boys” included more than an older jaded crowd. Anecdotes suggest that the return of Dracula and Frankenstein’s monster set off a wave of young children skiving out of school. Theaters like the Blue Mouse charged twenty-five cents for adults but just a dime for “children” (age undefined). The double bill moved east to Salt Lake City, where an incredible line, probably overestimated at five thousand people, waited to see the vampire and the animated pile of corpses that went by his maker’s name. The theater’s manager rushed to rent out extra space. The now infamous undead duo came to the Capitol Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, which offered “ten dollars to the lady that will volunteer to see it alone,” even though the enormous crowds suggested no real necessity for the promotional push. Ads in Spanish ran in Dallas that warned viewers that “Bela Lugosi represente a un hombre pavoroso que calmba su se con sangre humana.” In Montreal, a dry account of the phenomenon told viewers that the vampire and the “unhuman” monster of Frankenstein recalled some of the “old German films,” in other words the films of Weimar Germany—Caligari, Nosferatu, The Golem—that first cradled modern horror.6 “Can you take it?” asked an advertisement that ran in the Brooklyn Eagle when the delirious furor over the films made it to New York City during the Halloween season of 1938. The RKO Albee Theatre, just west of Fort Greene Park, dared and really threatened their customers with a double feature of “Bela Lugosi in Dracula” and “Frankenstein with Karloff.” The Rialto in Manhattan ran the films ten times a day to satisfy crowds through much of the autumn. J. Cheever Cowdin played a lot of polo and made much of his fortune in the munitions industry while his studio’s now very famous monsters packed Americans into movie houses. Monster fans were attempting, so claimed at least one commentator, to escape worries about a world of “war and dictators.” But accounting at least paid attention and Motion Picture Daily could announce that after “scanning its profit books” Universal Studios constructed “eerie sets” for the 1939 Son of Frankenstein. Universal’s new management made the most of the rage and urged theater owners in a trade paper ad to “Throw away the books! Forget all you Everknew [sic] about showmanship! Because horror is paying off again!”7 If monstrous nightmares rather than capitalist fairy tales made money, let them have their terrors. Meanwhile, Cowdin made only part of his enormous fortune at Universal. While he worked on his tan and drank cocktails on the Surf, he let middle management decide if they wanted to keep the old Universal Studios warehouse of monsters or embark on the new sensation for “chillers” that billed themselves as “psychological horror” in the wake of World War II. Armament sales increasingly occupied him, and the emergence of a new American military, preparing itself for global hegemony and a Cold War, beckoned with profits to be made. Curtiss-Wright survived a controversy that, in a rational economy, would have destroyed it forever. In 1943, an investigation revealed that high-ranking army officers who, as one claimed, had been “wined and dined” by the company, knowingly allowed defective engines to be sold to the U.S. Army Air Force. Army officers faced court martial, though the civilian contractors who bribed them faced no penalties whatsoever.8 The company itself endured, eventually getting into a peculiar and profitable combination of the oil industry intertwined with supplying parts for nuclear submarines that would become part of the American “nuclear triad” of apocalyptic weaponry delivered from bombers, from ground-based missiles, and by sea. Today, the company’s website touts its core values, including leadership, innovation, and, in a peculiar take on the idea of values, “winning.” If Cowdin’s dapper ghost went online right now, he might find some of his company’s current corporate-speak confusing and elliptical. Nevertheless, he certainly represented a twentieth-century American type who saw “winning” as a “core value.” The form success took didn’t matter much to him, whether delivering a goal-scoring swing of a polo mallet, producing films like House of Dracula, or making tens of millions of 1940s dollars in the Cold War arms race. By 1945 a broad cross section of Americans saw “winning” as an ethical value, even if they did not put it in exactly those terms. In an atmosphere of America’s growing optimism about itself, the monsters could be fun too. 4.Monster Mash “A NECROLOGY of the inmates of this macabre manse includes practically everyone in Universal’s vicious varsity,” wrote New York Times critic A. H. Weller of House of Frankenstein in early December 1944. Weller viewed the latest in the Universal monster series at the Rialto, the storied palace of moviegoing at the corner of Forty-Second and Broadway. He liked the flick, though he encouraged prospective viewers to “bring a tongue and cheek and an open mind.”9 While Rod Serling endured the horror of the Philippine campaign, Americans at home experienced a near-complete repurposing of the terrors born in the golden age of 1931 to 1935. Horror films during World War II self-consciously offered, as Weller described, “more chuckles than chills.” The studio that gave the country Frankenstein, Dracula, The Bride of Frankenstein, and The Invisible Man in the thirties began to decline by 1941, when German émigré Curt Siodmak scripted The Wolf Man, the first successful lycanthrope lope across foggy moors starring Lon Chaney Jr., the hangdog-faced only child of the man who terrified Americans in the twenties. Son of Chaney became a mainstay in horror for three decades without ever quite managing the octave of his father’s dark song. If you believe horror films are not about anything but sudden scares and unnerving situations, The Wolf Man appears to make your point. At a crucial junction in American history, the beginning of the clash between Japan and the United States for Pacific power, Americans flocked to see a fantasy about curses and gypsies and bogs with man-beasts in a contemporary Europe in which no one referenced or even seemed to know that there was a war on. Did the monster mash offer nothing but a safety valve, a place to take our anxiety, a place where horrors emerged red-fanged from the shadows only to dissipate as the credits rolled? The dark carnival succeeds because it breaks our temporal prison, allows us to enjoy some amnesia about the world. Popular culture allowed frightening world wars to seem anodyne. It encouraged people to forget the horror of their own lives. Plenty of real-world horror needed ignoring. In the first months after Larry Talbot found out that the autumn moon doomed him to shape-shifting, bad news about the newest global war rattled out of every newsreel moviegoers saw before the film; the headlines of the morning paper wearied them even before their day began. In the weeks following the December Pearl Harbor attack, Bataan and Singapore fell to Japan while German U-boats ravaged American shipping. In one of his famed fireside chats, FDR rather ominously evoked the miserable condition of the Continental Army at Valley Forge and made use of the famed Thomas Paine quote about times that “try men’s souls.” Under the direction of Roosevelt’s government, the National Association of Broadcasters forbade the use of the phrase now for some good news from the radio, as it highlighted the bleak situation.10 Universal Studios understood. Producers followed up Siodmak’s scruffy new monster with what became known as monster mash films (later inspiring Bobby Pickett’s 1962 hit single). The studio unleashed their whole catalog of monsters in an effort to keep American audiences entertained in the midst of war, pitting Frankenstein against the Wolf Man, throwing in Dracula for good measure, sometimes spoofing the monsters that had frightened the kids who, now in their late teens and early twenties, grinded slowly up the Italian peninsula, fought for every village in Nazi-controlled France, or landed on frighteningly fortified islands in the Pacific, jungles hived with determined enemies. The monster movies’ turn toward the silly and sensational didn’t represent an entirely new phenomenon in American filmmaking, far from it. The moviegoing public, and the studios themselves, had never taken “the cinema” as seriously as their European counterparts. Only amid the Great Depression, a time made of equal parts despair and rebellious impulse, did European directors like James Whale, Paul Leni, Karl Freund, and Edgar G. Ulmer successfully bring meditations on morbidity and fairy tales about death to American audiences uncertain about the myths they had been taught since the turn of the century. In the desperate and hungry thirties, only gangsters competed with monsters for America’s sympathy, both sticking it to a corrupt system, even if fated to be ground under by its wheels. But it’s impossible to overestimate American optimism, or at least American hubris. By the late thirties, the screwball romantic comedy proved the most popular genre, often featuring the lavish, fun-loving lifestyles of the wealthy. Director George Cukor’s Holiday (1938) featured Cary Grant turning cartwheels as he prepared to marry his wealthy fiancée (Katharine Hepburn). The moviegoing public loved a rags to riches story or, even better, a riches to even more riches story with nuptials as a lagniappe. The men who owned the movies by the late 1930s provide the best explanation for the values screened by popular films. The old joke that only organized crime and filmmaking are depression-proof proved half right after the collapse of the world banking system in 1929. Almost all the major studios went into receivership, staying afloat with funds from the banking houses that built American capitalism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Others went completely bust, their assets soaked up by brokerage firms with origins in the Gilded Age. Obviously, this does not mean that movie scripts suddenly issued forth from a cabal of capitalists in a smoke-filled room, all dressed like the top-hatted real estate mogul from Monopoly. But it would be naïve not to note that plenty of movie deals that made a small number of families rich did occur in gilded rooms filled with the actual smoke of cigars enjoyed after steak dinners while millions of Americans starved their way through the Great Depression. Of course, layers of artistic freedom, not to mention middle management, existed between the bosses’ values and what showed up on local screens. So what happened to the movie industry of the thirties couldn’t be called a conspiracy . . . except insofar as parting customers from their money requires premeditation and planning. The small coterie of powerful families that ran Wall Street did not micromanage studio production. They simply had no interest in underwriting an experimental, shocking, or even particularly interesting motion picture industry. Since the House of Morgan and the House of Rockefeller held the purse strings of Paramount, Warner Bros., Fox, and Universal, it’s not shocking that House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945) provided light entertainment rather than raising questions about the nature of American society in the tradition of horror in 1920s German expressionism and European avant-garde cinema more generally. But why did Americans want horror to begin with, even in its pallid 1940s form? How could a country so sure of itself have a place for monsters? The growth of an internal security state to police the boundaries benefitted from the movies as anesthetic. Monsters could be Marx’s “opiate of the people” and “the sigh of the oppressed,” for all the imperial state cared. But it could even be more useful. In the decade after the Second World War, plenty of horror films became unofficial propaganda, alien invasion flicks made with government blessing and even cooperation. But the empire did worry about the nightmares Americans might have about this new atomic age. An empire extending military and economic power abroad must quell dissent at home. A wide range of Americans received nasty attention from the national security state after World War II. Strikingly, many of the men who made the monsters became special targets. Horror could and did make Americans forget about the realities of the world, could defend Amity Island. But even in the early days of the Cold War, the chain saw could unleash its dissonant barrage on the false dream of America. Could you censor dark dreams? What about when the monsters wouldn’t behave? Thus begins the long history of what we know today as surveillance culture. 5.Dracula vs. the FBI BELA LUGOSI spoke before a Los Angeles crowd of over two thousand people in August of 1944.11 The Hungarian-American Council for Democracy (HACD) sponsored the mass rally to urge the Roosevelt administration to end immigration restrictions for Hungarian Jews and to pressure the collaborationist Nazi regime that controlled Lugosi’s homeland to protect those that remained. He had no way of knowing the effort did little good. The SS, with the direct aid of Hungarian fascists, had already deported nearly half a million Jews to death camps in Austria and Poland the previous month. Lugosi described the plight of Hungary’s Jews nearly a quarter of a century after he fled his native land to escape the White Terror that ensued after a right-wing government seized Budapest. His previous support for the communist regime of Belá Kun, who had briefly come to power in 1919 only to be quickly toppled after a disastrous war with Romania, placed Lugosi on the kill list of Admiral Miklós Horthy, who, for all intents and purposes, ruled from Budapest as head of a military junta. The elderly warlord still controlled Hungary in 1944, though his regime existed largely at Hitler’s sufferance. Hungarian forces aided the invasion of the Soviet Union, and members of the country’s large, fascist Arrow Cross Party actively participated in the Holocaust throughout eastern Europe. Born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in eastern Hungary, Lugosi became his stage name, an homage to his 1882 birthplace, Lugos (today Lugoj, Romania). He abandoned school at an early age but quickly rose to prominence in Hungary’s National Theatre. Although granted a deferment when the Great War came in 1914, he volunteered to fight for the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1915, he received his first war wound fighting against the forces of the Russian czar in what is now western Ukraine. A few months later, he would receive a second wound. Ironically, this time he had been fighting in the Carpathians, the treacherous, jagged mountain range that in the twentieth century became fully associated with vampire legends and Count Dracula himself. Lugosi left the army in 1916 having suffered a “mental collapse.” The precise cause of the incident remains unclear. We do know that Lugosi, in one of the rare moments he spoke about the Great War, described the experience of being buried alive in a trench beneath a mound of his comrade’s corpses as Russian forces clambered over him. After leaving the army, he returned to the theater and worked to create an actor’s union. Lugosi supported the goals of the communist regime and became especially vocal in his calls for the nationalization of the theater. He was well known enough to Horthy’s regime to flee to Vienna after Kun’s fall. Agents of the new government continued to pursue him. Lugosi worked his way to America in 1920, first aboard a merchant ship bound for New Orleans and then on to Ellis Island. During the Red Scare of the 1920s, with most eastern Europeans suspected of being communist revolutionaries (and Lugosi had, after all, been an actual communist revolutionary), becoming a naturalized citizen proved almost impossible. Lugosi did not become a citizen until 1931, the year that Dracula made him an international star. Lugosi’s involvement in the labor movement did not end after Dracula. He became, along with Boris Karloff, a lifelong supporter of the Screen Actors Guild. Lugosi served for several years on the advisory board. He also attempted to unionize his costars, as did Karloff, who handed out SAG applications in his heavy-browed Frankenstein makeup during the original film. Since Lugosi’s role in heavy makeup as Ygor in 1939’s Son of Frankenstein, he played a significant number of murderers and mad scientists for poverty-row studios, even appearing as the Big Bad in one of the era’s popular, but low-budget, serials, The Phantom Creeps. The effort to stay afloat financially as a freelancer in Hollywood, part of the personal experience that drove his labor activism, increasingly faltered as he sold his Tudor-style home in the Beachwood Canyon district of the Hollywood Hills and found himself appearing in small and silly roles even as tiny studios graffitied their posters with his name. In the serial The Phantom Creeps (1939), Lugosi played a scientist who, in a precursor to the Bond villain archetypes, creates various death rays, murderous gadgets, and a killer robot (the titular creeping phantom) that he hopes to sell to the highest bidder among the international market of warring powers. The serials, which introduced a generation of Saturday matinee-goers to “Commando Cody and the Rocket Men” or heroes they knew previously from radio and comics like “The Shadow” and the “Green Hornet,” can be enjoyed today for their peculiarity and vivid, if simple-minded, melodrama. But, amid playground dialogue and cliffhanger plotting, Lugosi must have suffered as he remembered his days as a rising star in Budapest. In 1942, Lugosi appeared in a propaganda/espionage/horror mash-up rushed into production soon after bombs fell on Pearl Harbor. Black Dragons, originally entitled The Yellow Menace, opened with what appears to be the claws of a dragon reaching across a map of the Pacific to threaten the American mainland. This is a peculiar reading of geography. Japan’s war aims included the seizure of American imperial holdings but not an invasion of the boundaries of the United States. Black Dragons tells a different story, and, given his political leanings, Lugosi likely appreciated the plot. The Black Dragon Society, a secret arm of the Japanese emperor, takes on the identities of major American industrialists with the help of a Nazi plastic surgeon (played by Lugosi). But the Black Dragons even betray their Nazi ally and imprison him since he’s the only one who knows of their sinister conspiracy. A convoluted plot point has Lugosi play both the original Nazi scientist who returns to kill the Black Dragons and a Japanese spy who himself receives plastic surgery so he can return to Germany with the Führer none the wiser. There’s not much of interest in the film aside from its context. Although something of an artifact of the Hollywood left, Black Dragons contains as much race-baiting as warnings about the possibly traitorous intentions of corporate America. Anti-Asian slurs are tossed around thoughtlessly in a film purportedly about dangers to democracy. Lugosi is the only thing worth watching in the film today as he drifts ominously through the scenes, the intensity of his eyes a hypnotic frightmare. After Lugosi’s years of exile on poverty row, many expected that Universal would ask the fading star to reprise his most famous role two years later in House of Dracula (1944). Instead, they picked John Carradine for what turned out to be a minor role for the titular monster. After World War II, Lugosi, like several of Hollywood’s B- and C-list actors, became popular in summertime stage productions. He would appear as Dracula in stage plays that ran in Denver, Colorado, or Reading, Pennsylvania. As Hoover’s investigation sputtered to a halt, the summer of ’48 found Lugosi playing a one-week engagement at the Norwich Theatre and Masonic Temple in New London, Connecticut. The year 1947 became the first since 1931 that Lugosi did not work on a film set. In 1948, Universal proffered him a role in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, though as the title of the film suggests, it’s a rather small one. Lugosi insisted to Hollywood Digest that his role in the film contained “no burlesque” and that “his trademark would be unblemished.” The film did rake it in for Universal at the box office. But not unlike the success of 1931’s Dracula, it did not lead to Lugosi being offered more significant work in the long term. Lugosi’s long struggle with alcohol and drug addiction are well known. He became one of the first American celebrities to speak openly, and very bravely, about this when he sought treatment. By the 1950s, as he worked less and less and in smaller and odder roles, he unfortunately became something of a joke in an industry with a notoriously short memory of its stars. But he never stopped working completely and this tells us something about how the American taste for horror had changed since the days when the “weird mystery” offered pleasure to a relatively small, mostly older, and mostly male group of pulp magazine aficionados. During the Second World War, Lugosi became the president of the Hungarian-American Council for Democracy, an organization largely focused on the ouster of Hungary’s decidedly undemocratic regime. During this same period, he wrote a series of articles for the leftist Hungarian journal Magyar Jövő, or “Hungarian Future,” that evoke the revolutionary ideals of 1919. Lugosi’s leftist activities during the period before the Los Angeles rally included appearing on a Brooklyn radio show called The Voice of Fighting Spain, which had its roots in the anti-fascist struggle in the Spanish Civil War and received its funding from the Communist Party front organization that called itself the Institute for International Democracy. Lugosi’s affiliations would have attracted some attention even in the midst of a war in which the United States counted the Soviet Union as one of its two major, and certainly its most powerful, allies. The Office of Strategic Services, transformed at the beginning of the Cold War into the Central Intelligence Agency, opened a file on Lugosi. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), the congressional power brokers fueling the post–World War II Red Scare and incidents such as the persecution of the Hollywood Ten, appointed a small group of operatives to keep an eye on him. They called themselves the Dracula council. They appear to have lost interest in Lugosi’s leftist sympathies given the much more pressing matter of winning a war against the Axis. In 1947 the combination of the National Security Act and the acceptance of the doctrine of “containment” acted as charters for the launch of America’s Cold War. In that year, a man few Americans wanted to take an interest in them turned a baleful eye on Lugosi. J. Edgar Hoover made his bones in the Bureau of Investigation, the FBI’s forerunner. In 1919, at age twenty-four, he headed the bureau’s General Intelligence Division, christened the Radical Division given Hoover’s interest in ferreting out real and perceived revolutionary parties in the United States. Hoover became convinced that the shadow of Trotsky loomed behind every labor organizer, that every one of the era’s large strikes presaged an American Petrograd. By the 1940s, the FBI essentially functioned as his personal police force and spy network. Agents assembled thick files on major and minor figures in entertainment, politics, and the arts who held the vaguest of liberal sympathies. Hoover’s interest in the former communist from Hungary with the thick Magyar accent seems entirely predictable. Hoover ordered the Los Angeles office to open an investigation into Lugosi, “concerning his activities.” This phrase, in Hoover-speak, meant that agents should pore over every aspect of the public and private life of their subject. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service also looked into the possibility of revoking his citizenship. Other emerging voices in horror and science fiction faced similar investigations for their left-wing views. Peter Lorre proved a special target because of his friendship with Bertolt Brecht, the German communist playwright who strongly supported a failed 1919 revolution in his country. Like Lugosi, Lorre came from Hungary, but before he fled Nazi terror, he starred as one of cinema’s first serial murderers in Fritz Lang’s M. Automatically becoming the heavy in films ranging from pitch-black noir dramas to Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon, he soon became a natural choice for horror films.12 Lorre earned Hoover’s ire after publicly supporting the Hollywood Ten, a group of left-leaning screenwriters singled out by Congress’s HUAC for refusing to cooperate with their investigation. Hoover launched Operation COMPIC (Communist Infiltration—Motion Picture Industry) while segregationist John E. Rankin of Mississippi lead the charge against Hollywood as “the greatest hotbed of subversive activities in the United States.” In response, Lorre joined a radio program effort called Hollywood Fights Back. Despite stars like Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball, and John Huston participating in the effort, smearing someone red had a chilling effect on their career. Vincent Price, whose star began to rise in Hollywood in 1945, had yet to become as deeply identified with horror films as he would after House of Wax (1953). Most did know the young, handsome actor’s left-leaning politics and willingness to talk openly about them. This attracted FBI attention, but the actor had leaned hard right in the thirties, when many Americans went to the opposite end of the political spectrum. Price said he came to his senses in 1938 after watching the gears of Hitler’s death machine begin to grind. Still, Price remained more circumspect than most in supporting liberal and anti-fascist efforts that had little or no ties to American communists. Several figures who continue to shape the American tradition of horror, fantasy, and science fiction received the FBI’s unwonted concern. Ray Bradbury, with his tales of an America perpetually facing a thing at the top of the stairs, had forty pages of material assembled by agents who suspected his then-genial liberalism hid communist sympathies.13 The report included the contention that “he has been described as being critical of the United States government.” In a memo, now available through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the FBI copied their colleagues at the CIA, violating the agencies’ proscription against surveillance and investigation of private American citizens. Large portions of Bradbury’s file are redacted, but what we can read makes clear that the FBI worried that the author planned to travel to Cuba and take part in a writer’s conference “whose [sic] goal of action is to obtain unity in the fight against anti-imperialism.” What interested the FBI in Bradbury to begin with, particularly given that his file admits “there is no evidence” he ever “joined the CP”? For the FBI, the idea that Bradbury suggested in The Martian Chronicles that humans came to the red planet as “despoilers and not developers” sounded a bit too much like a critique of imperial America, both in its frontier past and Cold War present. Much of the case rested on the word of a former communist turned government snitch named Martin K. Berkeley, who claimed that Bradbury supported the Screen Actors Guild because of sympathy for “its more pro-communist elements.” Berkeley insisted he heard Bradbury describe writers who caved to McCarthyism as “cowards” and that Bradbury’s stories “had been definitely slanted against the United States and its capitalistic system.” Indeed, the informant warned that science fiction itself “may be a lucrative field for the transmission of Communist ideologies.” Too many science fiction writers, he warned Bradbury’s investigators, shared pro-communist views with “a small number of scientists” who believed a war with the Soviet Union would be “threatening to the isolation (existence?) of the universe.”14 What other information did the FBI have on the prominent writer, the poet of dark carnivals? After a ten-year investigation of Bradbury, it seemed investigators uncovered one clear communist connection when an unnamed informant (likely Berkeley, again) claimed Bradbury planned to attend an “anti-imperialist” writers congress being held in Havana, Cuba. In fact, a Roy Bradbury, possibly the source of a misprint of Ray Bradbury’s name in his FBI file, had been invited to the gathering. After keeping tabs on Bradbury almost since the end of World War II, the FBI quietly dropped the case. Isaac Asimov also received Hoover’s attention. As Olive Beck has described in unpublished research on the topic, Asimov, who joined Robert A. Heinlein and Bradbury as leading writers of science fiction after World War II, faced a rather more sinister set of charges. A practicing scientist in the biochemistry department at Boston University, he came under scrutiny for possibly aiding the Soviet espionage networks that had ferreted out secrets of the A-bomb. The FBI long believed that an academic leaked scientific secrets to the Soviets, a figure they referred to as ROBPROF. The basis for the code name seems to have been Asimov’s own work as the author of I, Robot.15 The only information the FBI found that pointed to Asimov concerned a list compiled by the Communist Party USA (“The CPUSA underground,” a bureau memo ominously called the tiny organization) of Boston-area figures who might be “possibly amenable” to membership. Asimov remained under investigation for two years, even with no other evidence surfacing. While not as long under surveillance as other figures in the world of fantasy and horror, it’s notable that the FBI shadowed Asimov for espionage and high treason, a capital crime.16 But few in the world of horror and science fiction carried as strong a resume on the left as Lugosi. It did not help that the Hungarian Communist Party made significant gains in summer parliamentary elections, the major step in the country falling into Stalin’s grip and becoming part of the Warsaw Pact. Lugosi’s case had been dropped by the time of his death, and in fact, Hoover and the immigration authorities dropped the matter much more quickly than Bradbury’s, perhaps because of the latter’s growing fame and influence. Moreover, the investigation of Lugosi revealed nothing that did not already exist in the public record. No evidence emerged that Lugosi ever joined the CPUSA. His file would include his Magyar Jövő articles and the fact that he subscribed to a fund supporting labor leader Harry Bridges in a legal struggle to prevent the federal government from stripping him of his citizenship and deporting him. In line with the FBI’s desire to collect personal dirt on its subjects in case it needed to besmirch their reputation later, one of his agents included in his report that Lugosi appeared “intoxicated most of the time.”17 Dirty tricks are the companion of dirty wars. The need to keep track of Lugosi’s drinking habits along with his politics became a standard part of the bureau’s internal security apparatus. Former director James Comey has described, for example, “the darkest chapter” in the bureau’s history as the sending of a package to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964 that contained a set of recordings of his extramarital transgressions and a typed note urging him to kill himself within the month. Clearly, horror would have a role in an emerging national security state such as this one. But would it distract a populace restive under the reigns of the growing hegemony of the Pentagon, Hollywood, and industry? Or would it become a spectral light revealing that mad scientists had taken charge of the American experience? Horror was about to meet the bomb. 6.Terror Bombing ROBERT A. Lewis, copilot of the U.S. B-29 bomber the Enola Gay, kept a folder with him in the summer of 1945 labeled “letter to mom and dad.” In fact, it would become the logbook for a top-secret mission that the crew readied for on Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas held by the Japanese early in World War II. American forces seized it a few months before the Battle of Leyte Gulf, precisely because it offered an excellent launching site for the increasingly destructive American air raids. Lewis grew up in New Jersey and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A facility with electronics, and a preternaturally calm demeanor, led to his selection as part of a small group who tested the new B-29 Superfortress. In 1945, General Curtis LeMay chose Colonel Paul Tibbets to command the Enola Gay. Tibbets immediately chose Lewis as his copilot. They would drop the first atomic weapon in history on the city of Hiroshima. The USAF chose the city since it was spared conventional bombing runs for most of the war. This allowed America to demonstrate the full power of these weapons. Apologists for the bomb later called Hiroshima the site of a major military base. There was a base near the city. But the blast killed over one hundred thousand civilians, along with a contingent of Korean prisoners forced into slave labor after the Japanese conquest of their country and some American POWs. Lewis wrote an unofficial account of what happened in August of ’45 on the back of army department action report forms. He stenciled a sketch of the mushroom cloud and compared the dropping of the superweapon to a Buck Rogers adventure. “We had expected something fierce,” he admitted, but also wrote, “My God what have we done?” He ruminated over how many Japanese the new superweapon killed.18 We don’t know whether Lewis felt guilt over his bit part in the inauguration of the atomic age. In some ways, his comments reflected all the confusion, anxiety, and excitement Americans experienced in 1945. They were like Buck Rogers, the popular movie serial hero who used high-tech weapons to fight malevolent enemies. But should they be? What had they done? How many did we kill? Do we want to know? Most Americans didn’t know the answers to these questions, and it likely wouldn’t have mattered much if they tried to find out. The U.S. government used its power to ensure that the public would not care how many we killed. Many of the war films made while combat continued assured audiences that the Japanese people suffered little, if at all, from the air campaigns conducted since 1942 against the Japanese home islands that LeMay proudly described as “terror bombing.” In the film Bombardier (1943), a young pilot briefly has a crisis of conscience over the death of civilians but is assured by his commander, and in a letter from his mom, that a new target site would make “munitions” the only victim of the bombing campaign. The ownership of major studios by corporate moguls, many of whom had diverse streams of revenue generated by the war, ensured more than the transformation of horror films into escapist fantasies. The tendency for financial and political elites to ally assured a cozy relationship between the studios and the American government. In the summer of 1942, the Office of War Information created a special branch to ensure that films would “enhance understanding of the war at home and abroad” and act as “liaison with the press, radio, and the motion pictures.” This language makes what came to be known as the Bureau of Motion Pictures sound like a benign public relations agency. In theory, this did not give the War Department authority to censor films. In reality, military censors insisted on seeing and editing any scripts that might portray, for example, a human side to Japanese soldiers or civilians. In film after film, Japanese pilots are shown bombing and strafing civilians, an inhuman tactic they did, in fact, employ. However, in these same films American pilots are always hitting “military targets” with utter precision. There’s certainly not a word said about “terror bombing.”19 In an animated feature you aren’t likely to see appear on the Disney+ channel any time soon, the House of Mouse released Victory Through Air Power (1943). Viewers are treated to exploding military compounds and munitions without the slightest suggestion that human beings are killed in these raids. Frank Capra’s Know Your Enemy: Japan seems out of step with much of his Why We Fight series, which attempted to blend a set of universal values with American patriotism. The war ended before the film gained wide distribution among the troops. But its content gives us a fair representation of American propaganda efforts. The film insisted that Japanese soldiers had been mentally shaped by the Bushido code to believe that “treachery, brutality, rape and torture” are justified. Meanwhile, the film celebrated the killing of twenty thousand Japanese at Iwo Jima and described the horrific battle of Okinawa as a triumphant moment when American forces “trapped and destroyed 100,000.” At a time when hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians died in LeMay’s “terror” campaign, the film insisted that “the nasty gangsters” in the “factories and war plants” were the only victims of the constant air raids.20 These propaganda efforts had real-world effects not only for Japanese civilians but also for Americans of Japanese descent. A little over two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR issued Executive Order 9066, which allowed the U.S. military wide latitude to exclude anyone deemed a security risk from “military areas.” Although the order did not specifically mention Japanese Americans or insist on the building of detention camps, it came with a wink and a nod, and the commanders across the country understood its meaning. The entire state of California became a “military area,” and Japanese Americans were not allowed in the state unless detained in an internment camp. The U.S. government imprisoned 127,000 men, women, and children of Japanese descent during World War II. Newspaper editorials, including one in the Los Angeles Times, justified their imprisonment by describing the war in the Pacific as “a war with their race.” California Congressional Representative Leland Ford pulled no punches in insisting that all Japanese should be placed in “concentration camps,” a phrase in common use for the internment camps, even though much current discussion, journalism, and even historical writing uses the term relocation camps.21 The degree of racial hatred most white Americans felt toward the Japanese makes it hard to discern whether few if any felt any qualms about the genocidal air campaign waged on the Pacific rival’s homeland. The war on the ground seemed a struggle to match, and sometimes overmatch, the Japanese atrocities against soldiers and civilians. Acclaimed author Paul Fussell, a combat veteran of World War II, admits that American servicemen enjoyed using Japanese prisoners for target practice and “felt intense satisfaction when watching them twist and writhe when set on fire by the napalm of the flame thrower.” In a grotesquerie that would surface in the American horror tradition in the 1960s, soldiers and marines made trophies of Japanese skulls. This may appear to the reader as a bizarre rumor or, at the very least, uncommon. In fact, the May 22, 1944, issue of Life magazine contains a picture of twenty-year-old Natalie Nickerson writing a thank-you note to her boyfriend for the skull he mailed her, a macabre gift the photograph shows her gazing at lovingly.22 Terror bomber Curtis LeMay took command of the Pacific air campaign in February of 1945 and rejected even the concept of precision bombing. The tough-talking LeMay, later the model for General Jack D. Ripper in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, believed the use of a relatively new incendiary weapon called napalm—but evocatively referred to by the air crews on Tinian as hell-jelly—would reduce Japan’s wooden cities and the people who lived in them to ash. He was right. Two Harvard chemistry professors, Louis Fieser and E. B. Hershberg, developed what would become the basic formula on Valentine’s Day, 1942. They chose the Fourth of July to test the new weapon on a Harvard University football field, hoping sedate Cambridge would assume the work of rowdy undergraduates when the explosive charges ignited. What they created was much worse than an incendiary bomb. The new weapon ignited into a viscous jelly that burned more slowly than gasoline—whether it adhered to a structure or human flesh. In March of 1945, LeMay unleashed 325 bombers armed with napalm on Tokyo, burning much of the city and killing 89,000 people, the overwhelming majority women, the elderly, children, and babies. The center of the blasts extruded such incredible temperatures that the city’s canals boiled. The work of the air corps, designated XXI Bomber Command, had only begun. Using up to 600 aircraft in raid after raid, almost all Japan’s major cities burned in the months to come. The death toll reached 260,000 and, with the island on fire, 13 million became homeless. An uncountable number suffered lifelong pain from disfiguring burns.23 Taken together, LeMay’s “terror bombings” created a larger mound of corpses than the two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But, after the immediate elation over the war’s end, the bomb became a shadow cast across everything Americans believed about themselves. Nancy Arnot Harjan, one of Studs Terkel’s interviewees for his oral history project The Good War, experienced World War II as a teenager who believed above all that “the country was innocent,” that the GIs liberating Paris “were all knights in shining armor, saving humanity.”24 But painful questions began to surface. Harjan remembered about “a week or two” of elation stalked by disturbing questions. Her thoughts may not have been representative of the official culture of victory. But it shows Americans could express doubts about their government’s use of such a weapon, perhaps pondering and refining their misgivings for decades, and speak of them thoughtfully when a well-known writer like Terkel asked about how it felt to be American in the summer of ’45: This wonderful new bomb had ended it all . . . Seventy thousand or a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand civilians? It came as a shock after seeing so many war movies with the Japanese portrayed as militaristic brutes. To see women, children, and old innocent civilians brutally burned . . . What was it all about? In truth, most Americans expressed unease about the use of the bomb, wondering at least to themselves, “What was it all about?” They also quickly accepted it as part of a Faustian bargain that ensured both the political dominance of the United States and the peculiar kind of pleasure in life a cross section of Americans had come to enjoy during the war. One member of the U.S. Merchant Marine, Frank Keegan, only remembered relief upon hearing news of Truman’s decision, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan’s surrender. Keegan said to himself, “Nice goin’, Harry. You did it to ’em, kid. That’s how guiltless I was.” He could recall later, matter-of-factly if not entirely pleased with his attitude, “He saved our lives, he terminated the goddamn thing.”25 In his own reflections about the decision to use the bomb, Fussell reminded us that frontline troops in modern wars live with a primal certainty of either death or catastrophic wounds. The news of the end of war, whatever form the denouement takes, comes to them with a wave of feeling that can’t be described as relief or celebration. They essentially feel that a death sentence has been lifted, that someone in authority made a call in the final seconds and granted them a pardon.26 But other Americans experienced war’s end with a triumphalism of a type that had been building since the news from various fronts had become increasingly positive. One of Terkel’s interviewees remembered that while the “the rest of the world came out bruised and scarred” by the global conflagration, many Americans who had not been in a branch of the service, or had not lost family members, discovered “new gratifications they’d never known in their lives. Mass travel, mass vacations, everything else came out of it.” This may have been true of many of those in uniform as well. Unlike the armies of the rest of the globe, a majority of enlistees in the armed forces served behind the lines and a majority of those never left the States.27 Many Americans entered 1945 convinced their country had swept the world of its shadows. Roosevelt and then Truman sought to win the war both “thoroughly” and “fast,” while doing so “at the lowest possible cost” to Americans. That’s certainly an admirable goal, arguably a moral imperative. And yet, a massive loss of life among enemies and allies revealed the secret of the administration’s nightmare math. While tens of millions died on home fronts across the globe, saving gasoline and growing Victory gardens counted as “sacrifice” for Americans. Even Joseph Stalin, better known for his brutality than perspicacity, could blandly note that compared to his country of burning rubble and twenty-one million corpses, “things are not that bad in the United States.”28 Things weren’t so bad. And yet, historian Tom Engelhardt has referred to the postwar era as the time of “the Great Fear” during which “backyard barbeques” took place in “an anxiety-ridden garrison state” where abundance competed with horror. What could Americans have been afraid of? As the world’s only atomic power, the United States could have withdrawn back into its continental borders. It could have concentrated on being a constitutional republic that used its vast resources to build an equitable society that benefitted its citizens from cradle to grave. Indeed, in the first years after World War II, Harry Truman faced a populace eager to demobilize. They did not want to build a military machine, having seen what government intervention in the economy could do if it set itself to projects responsive to the needs of the people. Roosevelt’s promised freedoms for which we fought seemed within reach . . . freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and even freedom from fear. But the thermal flash of the atom bomb left these promises in ruin. A professional class of militarists became intertwined with a war economy that kept the country on a war footing and in fact increased military expenditures. By 1950, the United States footed the majority of the French bill for maintaining their control of East Asia. Horror films now seemed less about fear and more about the yuks, a way to take the edge off, especially with Abbott and Costello meeting up with the monsters of contemporary America’s youth for gags. Older horror seemed a little too subversive, at times with a sexual subtext that challenged the cult of breadwinner, wife, and children that would emerge in the American middle class after 1945. Slapstick could not properly channel America’s Cold War uncertainties. Amity Island had become a truly global power, with plenty of anxiety building under the era’s gleaming sunshine. Someone who’d seen the face of American power abroad would rev the chain saw long before Tobe Hooper told his tale of a Texas massacre. 7.Void, Despair, Torment ROD SERLING joined hundreds of thousands of American veterans returning from Europe and the Pacific to find a much different country from the one that greeted their fathers and grandfathers in 1919. White veterans received the full benefit of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, better known as the G.I. Bill, which provided money for a college education and help with securing a thirty-year mortgage on a home they could, at least theoretically, claim as their own. The possibility of buying a home with such a generous loan period was first made available to many Americans with the Fair Housing Act of the New Deal era. Low-interest loans also allowed the purchases of businesses and farms. But Serling could not settle into this shockingly comfortable niche in American society. He worried that his generation might sell their own freedoms for middle-class prosperity, or simply become lost in the narcissism that the expanding American economy encouraged. Discharged in 1946, he certainly benefitted from the best of these changes. The G.I. Bill allowed him to join hundreds of thousands of other young white men in attending college, once the privilege of the upper middle class or the tiny numbers able to gain scholarships. He enrolled immediately at Antioch College in Ohio, studied literature and creative writing, and managed to sell his first teleplay to NBC while matriculating. He graduated in 1950, married his college sweetheart, Carolyn Kramer, and walked into the bright future offered to privileged citizens of a superpower. Black veterans faced a different reality. Lynching remained a feature of American life, publicly celebrated by the mobs themselves if rarely discussed in the broader culture. Isaac Woodard, on his return from service where he had been decorated for bravery under fire in New Guinea, met just such a fate on February 12, 1946. Riding a Greyhound home to see his family, a white bus driver stopped in Batesburg, South Carolina, to complain to authorities that Woodard had asked for a bathroom stop. A group of police beat Woodard severely and the local sheriff gouged out Woodward’s eyes with a nightstick. Federal attention led to the sherriff’s trial but also a quick acquittal by an all-white jury. While the situation was particularly egregious in the American South, every American region had laws, de facto and de jure, that prevented Black men and women from reaping the G.I. Bill’s benefits. These veterans could, in theory, receive money for college, but most colleges in the United States remained whites only. Under the law, Black veterans could lay claim to home and business loans, but banks could and did refuse them without fear of legal repercussions. So-called covenant neighborhoods collaborated with real estate firms and local politicians to ensure no Black families moved into the new suburbs. Whites who wanted to live in segregated neighborhoods had the support of the Federal Housing Administration. The U.S. government, in a practice known as redlining, made fluid funds available to contractors who agreed to build suburbs that excluded African Americans.29 World War II looked in some ways like the beginning of a new phase in the freedom struggle for African Americans. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled against state practices that suppressed, or simply denied, Black women and men the right to vote. Veterans of World War II like Medgar Evers brought home from the war a determination to make America live up to its claims of being a bastion of democracy and freedom. During the war itself, A. Philip Randolph, an African American socialist and labor union leader, held a huge rally in Madison Square Garden to protest the treatment of Black soldiers. He would later be the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. But, when World War II ended, it would be another twenty years before the 1965 Voting Rights Act laid the groundwork for African American political autonomy. It’s also true that, outside of a general sense that something happened with segregation during the civil rights movements, even most college-educated whites have a limited grasp of the role of thousands of organizers whose experience had been shaped by World War II and their mistreatment by an American army allegedly fighting fascism. We know about Medgar Evers because he was murdered in his own driveway. James Baldwin thought that World War II meant something very different to African Americans than to whites. “A certain hope died,” he wrote, both because of the treatment even Black veterans received and how little the world changed for all Black people in 1945. In fact, the twin shadows of the Holocaust and Hiroshima seemed a deadly warning to Baldwin, a reminder of what white people would do while claiming to be both Christian and civilized. Baldwin wrote in the evocatively titled The Fire Next Time that “the threat of universal extinction” had entered the world. Wasn’t the bomb part of the logic of white supremacy, an iron logic of nihilism that had created “this void, this despair, this torment” felt all over the world from “the streets of Stockholm” to the “sidewalks of Harlem”? Terror at what the world had become haunted millions of Americans. The prosperity and eerie optimism of postwar America reached only a large minority of its white citizens. The long period of economic growth, more than a quarter of a century after 1945, came in fits and starts for many families. The larger paychecks many workers began to see did not keep pace with prices. Companies like General Motors and U.S. Steel made tens of millions in profits while refusing Truman’s admonitions to ward off strikes with tiny wage increases. Meanwhile, a Republican-controlled Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which struck an enormous blow to labor unions, one from which they arguably never recovered. Among other restrictive provisions, the act outlawed unions among supervisors and foremen, effectively severing a large part of the new white-collar workforce from membership in, and sympathy with, organized labor. The emerging Cold War with the Soviet Union ensured that American foreign policy poisoned discussions about worker’s rights. Republican leaders in Congress insisted on widespread communist infiltration in organized labor and used anti-communist rhetoric to frighten suburban voters who unreasonably connected rising prices and wage slumps with strikes rather than with the powerful corporations that kept wages low and prices high. The attitude of the United States toward its recent enemies, and its recent friends, seems shocking, but it followed the economic logic of imperial power. It’s difficult, nearly impossible, to imagine a continuing partnership between the United States and the Soviet Union, despite the warmth of the relationship through the thirties and the alliance of the war years. Truman and Stalin didn’t share much in terms of either politics or background. But both did hold a morally blinkered view of the postwar world. 8.Cold Warriors . . . in Space!! MOST AMERICANS, now and at the time, do not grasp how the Soviet Union interpreted the United States’ embrace of Germany after 1945. The Truman administration’s quick willingness to welcome Germany back into the family of nations, at least American-controlled West Germany, which had received a free market makeover, seemed an astonishing move. Over the next several decades, West Germany became a deadly forward base from which to project nuclear missiles. Medium-range missiles aimed directly at the Soviet heartland remained frightening portents into the 1980s, as much to the western Europeans being “protected” by them as to the Russians. Anti-communism perhaps made this decision at least as rational, or rather no more irrational, than Stalin’s insistence that the Warsaw Pact nations provide the Soviet Union with “buffer states.” But Operation Paperclip, though little known at the time, proved one of the more shocking decisions by the emerging American national security state. This initiative brought over 1,600 Nazi scientists to the United States, cleared them of all war crimes, and set them to work developing the basis for delivery systems of nuclear weapons. This ethically purblind decision transformed the global balance of power. It’s difficult to imagine that the United States would have charged so far ahead of the Soviet Union in the arms race without the help of Wernher von Braun, a fact admitted by a number of NASA scientists from that era. Von Braun had joined the Nazi Party when Hitler came to power, and he rose through the ranks of the SS to become a major. In his early thirties he’d been given the title of professor, a particular honorific in German, by Hitler himself. During the war, he led the V-2 rocket building program, which employed slave labor from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Victims who survived the camp have testified that von Braun selected workers personally. He even handpicked prisoners for torture, seemingly for no purpose other than sadistic pleasure. At the end of the war, von Braun claimed he wanted to surrender to the Americans rather than the Soviets. The Americans would make the best captors, he asserted, because “they believed in the Bible.”30 By 1948, the CIA went even further in enlisting former Nazis, including members of the Waffen-SS who had played a central role in the Holocaust and related war crimes. A few such figures provided alleged intelligence about Soviet activities in eastern Europe that facilitated the move toward the Cold War. A retired CIA agent later admitted that this provided the American security establishment with the “Russian boogeyman junk” that Truman’s national security state loved rather than a meaningful picture of geopolitics.31 The American public might have been even more shocked to learn that the CIA worked closely with Nazi collaborators in the Soviet Union itself after 1946. Not only had many of these groups aided in the German invasion of the Soviet Union but they also had, by the agency’s own admission, “been linked to Nazi atrocities on the eastern front.” The mass murder of Poles, Jews, Red Army POWs, and communists represented this “link.” In the fall of 1949, the CIA parachuted guerilla squads of war criminals back into Ukraine in what became known as Operation Nightingale. Although Russian special forces quickly annihilated these cells, the reader should imagine the American reaction to Soviet-sponsored guerrillas dropped into, say, Nebraska to take lives, destroy critical infrastructure, and generally wreak havoc.32 Perhaps Americans would not have been appalled by their government. Mainstream white America became convinced that their pastel middle-class dreams could turn Marxist red, so much so that even the worst crimes of the Nazis faded for a time out of American memory. The famous, mostly infamous, General George S. Patton, whose failures and inconsistent performance as a military thinker have been overshadowed by legend and the 1970 film, provides an interesting case study in American attitudes. After touring the Ohrdruf death camp with Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, Patton wrote that the victims appeared to him to be “a subhuman species without any of the cultural or social refinements of the time.” Patton had no sympathy for the dead, using his celebrity to insist the United States immediately rearm the Nazis and launch a preemptive offensive against the Soviet Union.33 Historians spill gallons of ink over the origins of the Cold War. There’s no single answer to why the United States and the Soviet Union, former allies against the Axis, turned on one another so quickly. Numerous commentators have suggested that both great powers needed the Cold War. Stalin and his successors, with an occasional notable exception, could set aside hopes for a worldwide revolution and settle into what Noam Chomsky described as the dominance of “a military-bureaucratic elite” over Soviet foreign affairs. For the United States, the Bolshevik threat gave legitimacy to the new, expansionist American foreign policy and a highly militarized economy. However one feels about the nuances of the debate, it’s impossible to chalk it up to Soviet aggression. Communist revolutionaries around the globe—from Vietnam to Ghana and Greece—found the Soviets decidedly drowsy on the matter of proletarian revolution. While convinced of Moscow’s influence everywhere, Americans lived in ignorance of the steps their government took to ratchet up tensions between the two powers. No one wanted to think much about foreign policy after V-J Day, and when told a new enemy had appeared, only a small number questioned the state’s assurances that “the American way of life” faced an implacable foe or had any idea of a longer history that helped explain Soviet suspicion. The relationship soured in 1917. The United States invaded Russia at the end of the First World War, largely in support of the British effort to prevent Lenin’s communist revolution from succeeding. A thaw in relations came in the 1930s and many Americans admired the undeniable economic miracle taking place in the Soviet Union as socialism sent Russia’s essentially medieval economy barreling into the twentieth century.34 A darker picture emerged for those who paid the closest attention. Increasingly, even American leftists grew nervous about the emergence of Stalin as he consolidated the Soviet Union into a dictatorship, repressed dissent at home, made small and devious land grabs in the Baltics, and, ironically, gave up on precisely what the Anglo-American right so deeply feared: the spread of an international worker’s revolution around the globe. Instead, Stalin insisted on a theory he called “socialism in one country,” an idea that confronted Marxist dissidents, or anyone who actually read Marx, with a bizarre formulation. Stalin gave half-hearted support to the fight against fascism in Spain and no attention at all to the emerging communist revolution in China. Meanwhile, he murdered his fellow communists in enormous numbers and even sent his dreaded secret police, the NKVD, to assassinate left-wing dissidents from Stalinism around the globe. The United States entered a cold war with Stalin’s Russia, despite having little to fear from the wounded giant. Uninterested in spreading Lenin’s revolution and leading a country decimated by a world war that killed nearly twenty-seven million Soviet soldiers and civilians, Stalin spent the remaining years of his life (d. 1953) watching American westerns, eating enormous meals with his flunkies, and ensuring he remained in power. The Soviet Union did have cause to worry about America’s space program. By the late forties, von Braun worked on rocketry for the U.S. military and converted to evangelical Christianity. Transferred to NASA on its founding in 1958, he played an integral role in the development of the launch vehicle for the Apollo program. His ambition grew, seeing rocketry as a path to the exploration of Mars. By 1960, von Braun received enough adulation for his work in the United States and Britain that a biopic appeared entitled I Aim at the Stars. Comedian Mort Sahl suggested that But Sometimes I Hit London would make a fine subtitle. In fact, von Braun dreamed not only of Mars but also of an orbital space platform that could rain down destruction on the Soviets from the skies.35 The reality was that the United States, a superpower with global reach, defined the Soviet Union, a regional power with limited ambitions, as a mortal enemy. Americans became fearful, uncertain, and anxious in an age of increasing abundance, indeed in a society that had the largest and most prosperous middle class in the history of the world. It also became a society wracked by anxiety, over the bomb, over change, over fear of the Soviets, even over the idea that they belonged to a generation that seemed so stable and secure in relation to that of their parents. Wouldn’t it all be taken away? 9.Noon on Doomsday MILLIONS OF men and women who had seen the worst of World War II were not ready for the American empire’s slugfest with another enemy. Rod Serling, for example, brooded over what he’d seen in the Pacific at a time when discussion of postwar trauma, both physical and mental, had no place in American society. Discussion of the wounded, including the psychologically wounded, veteran remained verboten in American culture after the first months of peace. Indeed, popular magazines such as Ladies’ Home Journal and Life ran articles directed at soldiers’ wives, suggesting that their homebound husbands likely needed “a few weeks” (!) to adjust to the civilian experience.36 One of Serling’s first successes in television revealed his growing social conscience. His 1956 script Patterns became a huge hit for NBC’s Kraft Television Theatre. A boardroom drama that placed big business maleficence and cultural conformity in its crosshairs, Serling’s film tapped into a widespread American fear of corporate life revealed in the success of novels like The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and Revolutionary Road. Patterns aired twice due to its popularity and a film would be produced from it. Serling seemingly had found a way to write about the dangers of fascism in his own country without being called a communist. Indeed, he could do it and be highly successful all at once. Or so he thought. Serling, like many whites, found himself shocked out of his complacency toward the treatment of Black Americans by the vicious murder of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till. In August of 1955, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam beat, mutilated, and shot Till, dumping his body in the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. They believed the young child had “whistled” at Carolyn Bryant, Bryant’s wife. Less than a month after Till’s murder, an all-white jury found the accused not guilty. Carolyn Bryant claimed Till not only whistled at her but grabbed her around the waist. Decades later, Bryant admitted she’d lied about the entire story. Black death has meant very little to a country steeped in white supremacy.37 Till’s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, sent the young boy to live with his grandparents in the Mississippi Delta because she believed it safer than her southside Chicago neighborhood. After his death, she insisted on an open casket funeral, revealing the torture inflicted on his body. Major magazines and newspapers carried the story, and while many treated it as a singular incident, at least some used it to tell the wider history of ongoing violence against African Americans. Moved to anger by the racist violence, Serling attempted to reimagine the tale in a teleplay he called Noon on Doomsday, alternatively titled A Town Has Turned to Dust. However, fear of offending the American public caused corporate sponsors to demand radical changes to the script, a somewhat odd decision since they allowed Patterns to mock the very corporate environment they now sought to protect. White supremacy, and any challenges to it, clearly remained the hill the country’s ruling class would die on. The changes to Noon on Doomsday made it unrecognizable as a comment on the Till lynching. CBS insisted that the murdered character have a Mexican background rather than being African American. Also, and at the network’s insistence, hints of advances toward a white woman as the cause of the killing were dropped. To completely erase any political commentary, studio executives moved the setting out of Mississippi and the contemporary period and into a generic “Old West” setting. Disgusted, Serling watched as a network beholden to advertisers reduced his clarion call for racial justice to little more than a police procedural with an excruciatingly vague message about tolerance. Serling never forgot his anger over what he considered one of his more important works. In what was supposed to be a promotional interview for a new anthology series helmed by Serling, network executives gritted their teeth as he barked at Mike Wallace that it was “criminal” that television execs simply refused to allow writers to explore “social evils.” His new show, he wrote in TV Guide, “probes into the dimension of imagination but with a concern for taste and for an adult audience too long assumed to have IQs in negative figures.” 10.What the Martian Said THE PILOT for The Twilight Zone aired on October 2, 1959. Serling wrote more than ninety scripts for a series that ran 156 episodes. It became the first show on television to imagine fascism coming to America, to challenge the red baiting woven into the culture after World War II, to question how the Japanese were stereotyped after Pearl Harbor, and indeed the first to show the mushroom cloud and wonder about the morality of atomic weapons. But, as Serling once noted, you can get away with anything “if a Martian says it,” or even if you throw a flying saucer or two into the story. Serling used alien invasions and nightmare scenarios to ask hard questions of an America used to horror from the stars shaping how they understood the terror of the real world. An expert on the science fiction and the politics of postwar America, Steffen Hantke, described “the amalgamation of science fiction with the horror film” in these years. This new way of thinking about monsters would attempt a marriage, doomed to divorce, between the fifties’ fascination with the American empire creating “the World of Tomorrow” and the dystopian realities the tomorrow being built for Americans promised.38 The beginnings of this great divorce, and the creation of what James Cameron has called “the interzone” that links horror and science fiction, appears in the bizarre celebrations of predatory American conceptions of space spearheaded by none other than Walt Disney and former SS officer Wernher von Braun. Their collaboration, made even eerier by Disney’s flirtation with the German American Bund (the American fascist movement) in the 1930s, intertwined with the growing fascination with manifest destiny in space in America’s emerging right wing. Disneyland opened in the summer of 1955 and visitors could ease into the diverse hypersensory worlds of Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorowland by entering through Main Street, U.S.A., the world of the American small town. Tomorrowland’s vision of space conquered and sanitized already played out for viewers of Disneyland, a TV anthology series that mixed animation with iconic, and revised, stories of American history. Disney brought in von Braun to showcase the future. Two episodes, “Man in Space” and “Man and the Moon,” feature the former SS officer explaining in his thick East Prussian accent that America would go beyond the moon and someday reach Mars itself. The man who could get a call through to Hitler any hour of the day found in the United States his instrument for his quest to “aim at the stars.” The Stars and Stripes would fly over Tomorrowland, literally and metaphorically. Hungarian-born director George Pal attempted something similar with his flop Conquest of Space (1955). Drawing in part on von Braun’s vision of the American future, specifically his 1952 book, The Mars Project, the film fell flat for most audiences. Pal had been associated with two classics, When Worlds Collide (1951) and an American reimagination of The War of the Worlds (1953). Both offered viewers differing visions of conquest and space, though in each of these classics old-fashioned military power and triage eugenics are the ultimate savior. Conquest of Space, despite a title that seemed to promise lasers massacring whatever indigenous extraterrestrials America might meet out in the black, caused viewers to leave the theater disappointed. Although now and again scientifically accurate, audiences seemed to feel that Pal had produced a western with no native peoples to kill. Aim at the stars, sure. But sometimes can’t we hit Moscow? 11.Shelter from the Midnight Sun ROD SERLING’S daughter Anne remembers her father as kind, funny, given to pranks, and doing his best to ensure that she did not have a “Hollywood dad.” She also recalls that he woke up screaming and when, terrified, she asked what was wrong, he simply said, “I dreamed Japanese soldiers were trying to kill me,” and gently told her to go back to bed. World War II and its legacy appeared again and again in The Twilight Zone, often very directly. The treatment of Japanese Americans and the lingering scars of war have seldom been more thoughtfully explored than in his scripts for season one’s “The Purple Testament” and season three’s “A Quality of Mercy.” Both draw heavily on Serling’s efforts to make peace with his combat experience. Both stories are set in the Philippines during the closing days of the war. “The Purple Testament” creates a supernatural aura for the trauma of battle itself in the story of a lieutenant who can see which of his men will die in combat by looking into their faces. “A Quality of Mercy” enters completely unexplored territory, featuring a gung ho lieutenant, eager to kill the enemy since he arrived in the Pacific just as the conflict was winding down. Taking over a war-weary platoon, he wants to launch a frontal attack on a cave filled with a small number of wounded Japanese soldiers, a pointless sally mounted over the protests of his sergeant. But before the deadly assault can commence, the bloodthirsty young officer finds himself mysteriously transformed into a member of the Japanese Imperial Army about to slaughter American soldiers in the same situation. He awakens from his tour of duty in the twilight zone to hear his sergeant tell him “a big bomb” has been dropped in Hiroshima and HQ has ordered that the platoon hold its position. Serling told his most poignant, and most controversial, tale of war in what became the final season of The Twilight Zone. In “The Encounter,” Fenton, an angry, severely traumatized, and alcoholic veteran of the Pacific, meets a Japanese American seeking work. Fenton offers to give him a job helping clean out his attic, an accidental ramshackle museum of mementos and souvenirs of the Pacific war including a samurai sword taken from the dead hands of an enemy that reads, “The Sword Will Avenge Me.” George Takei, soon famous as Star Trek’s Mr. Sulu, starred as one of the two protagonists, Arthur Takamori, who endures Fenton’s racist comments as the old souvenirs of war that clutter the attic begin to sizzle with a dire supernatural energy. The episode isn’t one of the classics of the series and some of the plot twists undercut the political comment. Still, it explored the idea of a World War II veteran suffering from guilt and trauma, a notion that has found little purchase in pop culture portrayals of that not-so-good war even today. Adding power to the story, Takei himself had been imprisoned in detention camps in California and Arkansas as a child under Roosevelt’s Order 9066. Perhaps Serling’s engagement with the bomb made for some of his most important efforts to use horror as social criticism. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki inaugurated an explosive and ominous end to several decades of unending warfare that grew out of the First World War. Historians today, looking at the period of 1914 to 1945, urge us to see it as a “thirty years’ war” to better understand the spasm of violence that eviscerated the world. But did the twin mushroom clouds really end the vile era? Staring back from our current vantage point, we see a century of wreckage and ruin. Unending war with a cease-fire proclaimed now and again until the bloodletting resumed. We continue to live in the nuclear age, though it seldom appears on our current list of concerns. But immediately after 1945, the fascination with the bomb bled into all aspects of American culture, frequently as a source of profound anxiety. This included the obsessive fascination that accompanies the object of our fears. Serling worried Americans about the moral meaning of the bomb through a medium that had long assured them it represented American omnipotence. Television, struggling to decide what it would become in the postwar era, attempted to satiate the strange need to see death incarnate. Two Los Angeles stations attempted to film a nuclear test 250 miles away in early 1951. Viewers simply saw, in an image that seems positively Lynchian, “the flash of eerie white light.” In 1952, televisions across the nation pulsed weirdly with a flash that sank into “a dark penumbra” enveloping a tiny tenebrous light. Viewers complained about the quality of the image of holocaust, few ever learning that the chiaroscuro image had ruffled across their tiny screens because even at the distance from which the cameras filmed, the heat from the blast melted their lenses.39 Serling grasped the dangers of such weapons and not only in the obvious sense of their threat to human life on earth. He wondered whether a democracy could withstand the pressures of becoming an unstoppable military juggernaut. Could American democracy survive the American empire? Serling’s interest in racial justice already made him aware of the limits of American democracy. Would even basic community break down in an age of apocalyptic weapons needed to defend the porous borders of a global empire? Over the years, in fits and starts, he bleakly decided the answer was yes, eventually using his platform to speak out forcefully about American intervention in Asia. But even in the early sixties, we see him trying to make sense of his country and its possible fate. Serling took viewers to a particularly sadistic corner of the Twilight Zone in September of 1961. In an episode entitled “The Shelter,” which aired about one year before the Cuban missile crisis, suburban neighbors blithely gathered for a birthday party rapidly turn on one another when the television reports UFOs, probably Soviet bombers, descending on them. Only one of the neighbors, the beloved family doctor to most of the gathering, has built a fallout shelter. Even some dedicated fans of the show found the episode heavy-handed, too blatantly allegorical, preachy. Would people really turn on one another so quickly in a crisis? Serling, and the embattled protagonist of “The Shelter,” thought it naïve to believe otherwise.40 Atomic weapons became, and have remained, a symbol of the apocalypse, a haunting backdrop to horror culture’s tales of death. Serling frequently revisited the theme directly in episodes like “Time Enough at Last,” “Third from the Sun,” “A Little Peace and Quiet,” and, more obliquely, in “The Midnight Sun.” Serling’s use of science fiction terrors to make people think appeared at a period when, just as often, these tropes reassured Americans everything would be fine. In the center of empire, theaters had begun a new kind of danse macabre as dark powers starved for conquest arrived to conquer the ailing earth. The future belonged to horror.",

      "content": "1.Twilight Zone THE ROAR of sixteen-inch naval guns made one young Navy recruit from Brooklyn imagine a hundred subway trains flying over his head. Amid the cacophony of the explosions unleashed from nearby ships, Ensign Gabe Pressman could not identify the even more massive shells lobbed in his direction, thinking at first the flashes across the crepuscular horizon must be heat lightning. Pressman’s small ship, the PC-470, formed part of the American seventh fleet that steamed into the Philippines to retake the American colony, seized by Japan at the same time they struck Pearl Harbor. The small craft normally performed patrol duty, sometimes acting as a submarine chaser tracking the Nazi “wolfpacks” of U-boats in the Atlantic. On October 23, Pressman’s boat faced the daunting challenge of landing troops on the fortified island of Leyte. The American invasion force included a future writer who, anguished almost daily by his experience of combat, became one of the most trenchant critics of the country whose uniform he wore in that late October of 1944. Halloween came early for him, and millions of others, that year.1 Rodman Edward Serling had the terrifying experience of landing on Leyte and establishing a beachhead. Japanese snipers harassed his unit, the 511th Parachute regiment, who fought as light infantry in the Pacific. Rod, as everyone called Serling, joined the army immediately after finishing high school in 1943. In the days before graduation, he’d been aglow with idealism about the war against the Axis, and tried, not very successfully, to recruit his friends at Binghamton Central High School in New York. Serling would also be disappointed in his hopes of getting to Europe to fight the Nazis. Instead, he found himself the summer after high school graduation training with his regiment in New Guinea for the planned assault on the Philippines. He had no concept of what awaited him on Leyte. The landing itself proved surprisingly easy. The battle raged offshore while Serling’s unit hit the sand behind the main landing parties. The smell of cordite, charred metal, and burning petroleum saturated the air as American and Japanese airplanes twisted into death spirals and fell into the Pacific, staining the turquoise waters black and red. Although they had no way of knowing it, Serling on the beach and Pressman from the deck of PC-470 took part in the largest naval engagement in human history. American submarines sank two cruisers. The American carrier USS Princeton exploded in a giant ball of flame following attacks of wave after wave of Japanese Zero fighters. The enormous hulk slid under the water as little more than shattered steel debris. In turn, American Hellcat fighters made this victory costly, downing a huge number of land-based Japanese aircraft. Meanwhile, repeated attacks from American torpedoes against the largest battleship in the world, Japan’s seventy-thousand-ton Musashi, eventually capsized the beast, the seas trembling under the monster’s weight before embracing it. On October 25, the third day of the battle, another American escort carrier took a direct hit from a kamikaze attack and gurgled under the waves only an hour later. Serling knew little about the details of the carnage occurring offshore the relatively peaceful sands of Leyte Island. Despite continuing attacks of snipers, the beach had been won. His unit soon moved inland, where they encountered significant resistance from Japanese ground forces. In a single firefight, Serling received wounds in the wrist and knee, although, per army policy with combat troops in the Second World War, he quickly returned to combat. But a more gruesome memory of the Battle of Leyte Gulf stayed with the nineteen-year-old. Serling could hear the peculiar combination of faraway explosions and airplane engines competing with the eerie counterpoint of somnolent surf sliding across the sand. Serling paused with some of his fellow soldiers in the so-called Death Squad, the demolitions platoon of the 511th with a reputation for high casualties given the nature of their work, attempting to disarm land mines and booby traps under the deadly eye of Japanese snipers. The sun broiled high and hot, but a breeze picked up across the ocean spray now and again. Serling sweated under a palm tree with some of his fellow privates while his buddy Melvin Levy, the 511th’s aspiring comedian, performed some impromptu stand-up for their other pals. In the middle of his routine, a low-flying U.S. transport plane suddenly roared overhead and dropped its payload of army rations, an enormous crate weighing hundreds of pounds. The huge container knocked Serling to the sand but barely scraped him. It landed directly on Levy. Serling saw his friend decapitated, the sudden impact turning him into human paste.2 An absurd accident amid the chaos of one of the decisive battles of the Second World War. A meaningless sacrifice, an incident that seems like it belongs in Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. For Serling, it opened a doorway to a dimension of the imagination, a region in the middle ground between sight and shadow, the entry point into the twilight zone. 2.Death of the Monsters? THE ENTRANCE of the United States into World War II came at a time when, not unlike the plot of one of Universal Studio’s classics, the monsters died only to resuscitate and return. They could and did become icons of empire. A new kind of fandom for horror films appeared. This audience had been forged by large groups of mainstream fans of the golden age of the early thirties that played a crucial role in keeping the macabre alive when the studios showed little interest. The release of 1935’s Bride of Frankenstein showed every indication of being the last of the great Universal Studio horror films, and horror seemed out of style. After 1936, Universal went into receivership under the guidance of the powerful John Cheever Cowdin. His portfolio included Standard Capital, Ideal Chemical, and Curtiss-Wright, the largest supplier of airplanes and aviation-related war material for the American army at the end of World War II. Cowdin sat as president and member of the Board of Directors of Universal Studios during this entire period, while studio head and early Hollywood icon Carl Laemmle Sr. received a promotion that removed him from day-to-day operations, and Laemmle Jr.—responsible for ensuring the production of masterpieces like The Phantom of the Opera, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dracula, and both of James Whale’s Frankenstein pictures—received a pink slip. He retired into relatively wealthy obscurity by age thirty. Cowdin seems like a caricature of a mid-century American capitalist, owning more companies than he could pay attention to, distracted by his interest in polo, having his multiple marriages blessed aboard his yacht Surf, and getting himself voted one of the best-dressed men of his era by Esquire. Under his benign neglect, a new vision of filmmaking emerged at Universal that favored cost cutting and subject matter that suited Americans who understandably wanted to avoid thinking of themselves as victims of their own economic system.3 The 1936 Universal film My Man Godfrey provides a perfect example, featuring a story of a Boston Brahmin with the bluest of blood who decides to live in a “hobo camp” for a bit of slumming adventure. The hero marries thirties beauty Carole Lombard after saving her dad’s business and opens a night club that puts his homeless pals to work. It’s a plot more bizarre than any monster movie, a fantasy of an America free of class conflict, where money that appears out of nowhere sets everything to rights and romantic love quite literally seals the deal. Audiences loved it and so did the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which nominated the flick for six awards. Universal decided its future lay in big-budget romances, light-hearted musicals, and serials like Radio Patrol and Jungle Jim. The latter became a successful effort to plagiarize the Tarzan books and films while joining the rise of “jungle horror” in legitimizing allegedly primitive people’s needs of American patronage abroad. Horror from the crypt and the laboratory seemed dead in this new environment. The genre suffered further from years of a near glut of films at the box office, not all of them the classic monsters from Universal. In 1935, rival studios had given the world the Werewolf of London, The Raven, and the Mark of the Vampire, with Universal managing to sneak past the censors a year later, with some significant changes, a wildly outré sexual and psychological thriller entitled Dracula’s Daughter. The deluge of scary caused one alarmed writer for The New York Times to worry that morbid films embodied “the national state of mind.”4 He may have been right. The term horror fan had not yet become a common one. But these fans of darkness were out there and, more important, the children of the Depression wanted to meet the monsters their older brothers and sisters obsessed over. The year 1938 surprised the studios and started a new round of horror films, most much less creative than the first efforts but satisfying for the generation that would fight the Second World War. My Man Godfrey seemed from another world. 3.My Man Frankenstein THE CRAZE started in Beverly Hills when a single hard-up theater owner had the idea of trying to revive the success of horror enjoyed in the early thirties by showing Frankenstein, Dracula, and King Kong in a marathon triple showing. The response was a bit too positive, with police called to restrain the crowds. Universal started charging hefty rental fees for their marquee monsters, and larger venues on Wilshire made room for the incredibly raucous crowds that seemed almost desperate to see the films again. Most theaters dropped King Kong, or added the RKO property to another double feature, but Dracula and Frankenstein stayed together, a deeply twisted meet-cute. Soon the Blue Mouse Theatre in Seattle picked up the idea promising “A MAMMOTH HORROR SHOW!” The Seattle Daily Times on August 25, 1938, seemed proud, if a little tentative, that their city “kept pace with the success that has attended this weird mystery entertainment.”5 The Seattle paper mused that the double bill offered a good opportunity for what it called “jaded mystery fans.” But it’s clear that the crowds coming to see what motion picture trade papers dubbed “the horror boys” included more than an older jaded crowd. Anecdotes suggest that the return of Dracula and Frankenstein’s monster set off a wave of young children skiving out of school. Theaters like the Blue Mouse charged twenty-five cents for adults but just a dime for “children” (age undefined). The double bill moved east to Salt Lake City, where an incredible line, probably overestimated at five thousand people, waited to see the vampire and the animated pile of corpses that went by his maker’s name. The theater’s manager rushed to rent out extra space. The now infamous undead duo came to the Capitol Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, which offered “ten dollars to the lady that will volunteer to see it alone,” even though the enormous crowds suggested no real necessity for the promotional push. Ads in Spanish ran in Dallas that warned viewers that “Bela Lugosi represente a un hombre pavoroso que calmba su se con sangre humana.” In Montreal, a dry account of the phenomenon told viewers that the vampire and the “unhuman” monster of Frankenstein recalled some of the “old German films,” in other words the films of Weimar Germany—Caligari, Nosferatu, The Golem—that first cradled modern horror.6 “Can you take it?” asked an advertisement that ran in the Brooklyn Eagle when the delirious furor over the films made it to New York City during the Halloween season of 1938. The RKO Albee Theatre, just west of Fort Greene Park, dared and really threatened their customers with a double feature of “Bela Lugosi in Dracula” and “Frankenstein with Karloff.” The Rialto in Manhattan ran the films ten times a day to satisfy crowds through much of the autumn. J. Cheever Cowdin played a lot of polo and made much of his fortune in the munitions industry while his studio’s now very famous monsters packed Americans into movie houses. Monster fans were attempting, so claimed at least one commentator, to escape worries about a world of “war and dictators.” But accounting at least paid attention and Motion Picture Daily could announce that after “scanning its profit books” Universal Studios constructed “eerie sets” for the 1939 Son of Frankenstein. Universal’s new management made the most of the rage and urged theater owners in a trade paper ad to “Throw away the books! Forget all you Everknew [sic] about showmanship! Because horror is paying off again!”7 If monstrous nightmares rather than capitalist fairy tales made money, let them have their terrors. Meanwhile, Cowdin made only part of his enormous fortune at Universal. While he worked on his tan and drank cocktails on the Surf, he let middle management decide if they wanted to keep the old Universal Studios warehouse of monsters or embark on the new sensation for “chillers” that billed themselves as “psychological horror” in the wake of World War II. Armament sales increasingly occupied him, and the emergence of a new American military, preparing itself for global hegemony and a Cold War, beckoned with profits to be made. Curtiss-Wright survived a controversy that, in a rational economy, would have destroyed it forever. In 1943, an investigation revealed that high-ranking army officers who, as one claimed, had been “wined and dined” by the company, knowingly allowed defective engines to be sold to the U.S. Army Air Force. Army officers faced court martial, though the civilian contractors who bribed them faced no penalties whatsoever.8 The company itself endured, eventually getting into a peculiar and profitable combination of the oil industry intertwined with supplying parts for nuclear submarines that would become part of the American “nuclear triad” of apocalyptic weaponry delivered from bombers, from ground-based missiles, and by sea. Today, the company’s website touts its core values, including leadership, innovation, and, in a peculiar take on the idea of values, “winning.” If Cowdin’s dapper ghost went online right now, he might find some of his company’s current corporate-speak confusing and elliptical. Nevertheless, he certainly represented a twentieth-century American type who saw “winning” as a “core value.” The form success took didn’t matter much to him, whether delivering a goal-scoring swing of a polo mallet, producing films like House of Dracula, or making tens of millions of 1940s dollars in the Cold War arms race. By 1945 a broad cross section of Americans saw “winning” as an ethical value, even if they did not put it in exactly those terms. In an atmosphere of America’s growing optimism about itself, the monsters could be fun too. 4.Monster Mash “A NECROLOGY of the inmates of this macabre manse includes practically everyone in Universal’s vicious varsity,” wrote New York Times critic A. H. Weller of House of Frankenstein in early December 1944. Weller viewed the latest in the Universal monster series at the Rialto, the storied palace of moviegoing at the corner of Forty-Second and Broadway. He liked the flick, though he encouraged prospective viewers to “bring a tongue and cheek and an open mind.”9 While Rod Serling endured the horror of the Philippine campaign, Americans at home experienced a near-complete repurposing of the terrors born in the golden age of 1931 to 1935. Horror films during World War II self-consciously offered, as Weller described, “more chuckles than chills.” The studio that gave the country Frankenstein, Dracula, The Bride of Frankenstein, and The Invisible Man in the thirties began to decline by 1941, when German émigré Curt Siodmak scripted The Wolf Man, the first successful lycanthrope lope across foggy moors starring Lon Chaney Jr., the hangdog-faced only child of the man who terrified Americans in the twenties. Son of Chaney became a mainstay in horror for three decades without ever quite managing the octave of his father’s dark song. If you believe horror films are not about anything but sudden scares and unnerving situations, The Wolf Man appears to make your point. At a crucial junction in American history, the beginning of the clash between Japan and the United States for Pacific power, Americans flocked to see a fantasy about curses and gypsies and bogs with man-beasts in a contemporary Europe in which no one referenced or even seemed to know that there was a war on. Did the monster mash offer nothing but a safety valve, a place to take our anxiety, a place where horrors emerged red-fanged from the shadows only to dissipate as the credits rolled? The dark carnival succeeds because it breaks our temporal prison, allows us to enjoy some amnesia about the world. Popular culture allowed frightening world wars to seem anodyne. It encouraged people to forget the horror of their own lives. Plenty of real-world horror needed ignoring. In the first months after Larry Talbot found out that the autumn moon doomed him to shape-shifting, bad news about the newest global war rattled out of every newsreel moviegoers saw before the film; the headlines of the morning paper wearied them even before their day began. In the weeks following the December Pearl Harbor attack, Bataan and Singapore fell to Japan while German U-boats ravaged American shipping. In one of his famed fireside chats, FDR rather ominously evoked the miserable condition of the Continental Army at Valley Forge and made use of the famed Thomas Paine quote about times that “try men’s souls.” Under the direction of Roosevelt’s government, the National Association of Broadcasters forbade the use of the phrase now for some good news from the radio, as it highlighted the bleak situation.10 Universal Studios understood. Producers followed up Siodmak’s scruffy new monster with what became known as monster mash films (later inspiring Bobby Pickett’s 1962 hit single). The studio unleashed their whole catalog of monsters in an effort to keep American audiences entertained in the midst of war, pitting Frankenstein against the Wolf Man, throwing in Dracula for good measure, sometimes spoofing the monsters that had frightened the kids who, now in their late teens and early twenties, grinded slowly up the Italian peninsula, fought for every village in Nazi-controlled France, or landed on frighteningly fortified islands in the Pacific, jungles hived with determined enemies. The monster movies’ turn toward the silly and sensational didn’t represent an entirely new phenomenon in American filmmaking, far from it. The moviegoing public, and the studios themselves, had never taken “the cinema” as seriously as their European counterparts. Only amid the Great Depression, a time made of equal parts despair and rebellious impulse, did European directors like James Whale, Paul Leni, Karl Freund, and Edgar G. Ulmer successfully bring meditations on morbidity and fairy tales about death to American audiences uncertain about the myths they had been taught since the turn of the century. In the desperate and hungry thirties, only gangsters competed with monsters for America’s sympathy, both sticking it to a corrupt system, even if fated to be ground under by its wheels. But it’s impossible to overestimate American optimism, or at least American hubris. By the late thirties, the screwball romantic comedy proved the most popular genre, often featuring the lavish, fun-loving lifestyles of the wealthy. Director George Cukor’s Holiday (1938) featured Cary Grant turning cartwheels as he prepared to marry his wealthy fiancée (Katharine Hepburn). The moviegoing public loved a rags to riches story or, even better, a riches to even more riches story with nuptials as a lagniappe. The men who owned the movies by the late 1930s provide the best explanation for the values screened by popular films. The old joke that only organized crime and filmmaking are depression-proof proved half right after the collapse of the world banking system in 1929. Almost all the major studios went into receivership, staying afloat with funds from the banking houses that built American capitalism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Others went completely bust, their assets soaked up by brokerage firms with origins in the Gilded Age. Obviously, this does not mean that movie scripts suddenly issued forth from a cabal of capitalists in a smoke-filled room, all dressed like the top-hatted real estate mogul from Monopoly. But it would be naïve not to note that plenty of movie deals that made a small number of families rich did occur in gilded rooms filled with the actual smoke of cigars enjoyed after steak dinners while millions of Americans starved their way through the Great Depression. Of course, layers of artistic freedom, not to mention middle management, existed between the bosses’ values and what showed up on local screens. So what happened to the movie industry of the thirties couldn’t be called a conspiracy . . . except insofar as parting customers from their money requires premeditation and planning. The small coterie of powerful families that ran Wall Street did not micromanage studio production. They simply had no interest in underwriting an experimental, shocking, or even particularly interesting motion picture industry. Since the House of Morgan and the House of Rockefeller held the purse strings of Paramount, Warner Bros., Fox, and Universal, it’s not shocking that House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945) provided light entertainment rather than raising questions about the nature of American society in the tradition of horror in 1920s German expressionism and European avant-garde cinema more generally. But why did Americans want horror to begin with, even in its pallid 1940s form? How could a country so sure of itself have a place for monsters? The growth of an internal security state to police the boundaries benefitted from the movies as anesthetic. Monsters could be Marx’s “opiate of the people” and “the sigh of the oppressed,” for all the imperial state cared. But it could even be more useful. In the decade after the Second World War, plenty of horror films became unofficial propaganda, alien invasion flicks made with government blessing and even cooperation. But the empire did worry about the nightmares Americans might have about this new atomic age. An empire extending military and economic power abroad must quell dissent at home. A wide range of Americans received nasty attention from the national security state after World War II. Strikingly, many of the men who made the monsters became special targets. Horror could and did make Americans forget about the realities of the world, could defend Amity Island. But even in the early days of the Cold War, the chain saw could unleash its dissonant barrage on the false dream of America. Could you censor dark dreams? What about when the monsters wouldn’t behave? Thus begins the long history of what we know today as surveillance culture. 5.Dracula vs. the FBI BELA LUGOSI spoke before a Los Angeles crowd of over two thousand people in August of 1944.11 The Hungarian-American Council for Democracy (HACD) sponsored the mass rally to urge the Roosevelt administration to end immigration restrictions for Hungarian Jews and to pressure the collaborationist Nazi regime that controlled Lugosi’s homeland to protect those that remained. He had no way of knowing the effort did little good. The SS, with the direct aid of Hungarian fascists, had already deported nearly half a million Jews to death camps in Austria and Poland the previous month. Lugosi described the plight of Hungary’s Jews nearly a quarter of a century after he fled his native land to escape the White Terror that ensued after a right-wing government seized Budapest. His previous support for the communist regime of Belá Kun, who had briefly come to power in 1919 only to be quickly toppled after a disastrous war with Romania, placed Lugosi on the kill list of Admiral Miklós Horthy, who, for all intents and purposes, ruled from Budapest as head of a military junta. The elderly warlord still controlled Hungary in 1944, though his regime existed largely at Hitler’s sufferance. Hungarian forces aided the invasion of the Soviet Union, and members of the country’s large, fascist Arrow Cross Party actively participated in the Holocaust throughout eastern Europe. Born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in eastern Hungary, Lugosi became his stage name, an homage to his 1882 birthplace, Lugos (today Lugoj, Romania). He abandoned school at an early age but quickly rose to prominence in Hungary’s National Theatre. Although granted a deferment when the Great War came in 1914, he volunteered to fight for the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1915, he received his first war wound fighting against the forces of the Russian czar in what is now western Ukraine. A few months later, he would receive a second wound. Ironically, this time he had been fighting in the Carpathians, the treacherous, jagged mountain range that in the twentieth century became fully associated with vampire legends and Count Dracula himself. Lugosi left the army in 1916 having suffered a “mental collapse.” The precise cause of the incident remains unclear. We do know that Lugosi, in one of the rare moments he spoke about the Great War, described the experience of being buried alive in a trench beneath a mound of his comrade’s corpses as Russian forces clambered over him. After leaving the army, he returned to the theater and worked to create an actor’s union. Lugosi supported the goals of the communist regime and became especially vocal in his calls for the nationalization of the theater. He was well known enough to Horthy’s regime to flee to Vienna after Kun’s fall. Agents of the new government continued to pursue him. Lugosi worked his way to America in 1920, first aboard a merchant ship bound for New Orleans and then on to Ellis Island. During the Red Scare of the 1920s, with most eastern Europeans suspected of being communist revolutionaries (and Lugosi had, after all, been an actual communist revolutionary), becoming a naturalized citizen proved almost impossible. Lugosi did not become a citizen until 1931, the year that Dracula made him an international star. Lugosi’s involvement in the labor movement did not end after Dracula. He became, along with Boris Karloff, a lifelong supporter of the Screen Actors Guild. Lugosi served for several years on the advisory board. He also attempted to unionize his costars, as did Karloff, who handed out SAG applications in his heavy-browed Frankenstein makeup during the original film. Since Lugosi’s role in heavy makeup as Ygor in 1939’s Son of Frankenstein, he played a significant number of murderers and mad scientists for poverty-row studios, even appearing as the Big Bad in one of the era’s popular, but low-budget, serials, The Phantom Creeps. The effort to stay afloat financially as a freelancer in Hollywood, part of the personal experience that drove his labor activism, increasingly faltered as he sold his Tudor-style home in the Beachwood Canyon district of the Hollywood Hills and found himself appearing in small and silly roles even as tiny studios graffitied their posters with his name. In the serial The Phantom Creeps (1939), Lugosi played a scientist who, in a precursor to the Bond villain archetypes, creates various death rays, murderous gadgets, and a killer robot (the titular creeping phantom) that he hopes to sell to the highest bidder among the international market of warring powers. The serials, which introduced a generation of Saturday matinee-goers to “Commando Cody and the Rocket Men” or heroes they knew previously from radio and comics like “The Shadow” and the “Green Hornet,” can be enjoyed today for their peculiarity and vivid, if simple-minded, melodrama. But, amid playground dialogue and cliffhanger plotting, Lugosi must have suffered as he remembered his days as a rising star in Budapest. In 1942, Lugosi appeared in a propaganda/espionage/horror mash-up rushed into production soon after bombs fell on Pearl Harbor. Black Dragons, originally entitled The Yellow Menace, opened with what appears to be the claws of a dragon reaching across a map of the Pacific to threaten the American mainland. This is a peculiar reading of geography. Japan’s war aims included the seizure of American imperial holdings but not an invasion of the boundaries of the United States. Black Dragons tells a different story, and, given his political leanings, Lugosi likely appreciated the plot. The Black Dragon Society, a secret arm of the Japanese emperor, takes on the identities of major American industrialists with the help of a Nazi plastic surgeon (played by Lugosi). But the Black Dragons even betray their Nazi ally and imprison him since he’s the only one who knows of their sinister conspiracy. A convoluted plot point has Lugosi play both the original Nazi scientist who returns to kill the Black Dragons and a Japanese spy who himself receives plastic surgery so he can return to Germany with the Führer none the wiser. There’s not much of interest in the film aside from its context. Although something of an artifact of the Hollywood left, Black Dragons contains as much race-baiting as warnings about the possibly traitorous intentions of corporate America. Anti-Asian slurs are tossed around thoughtlessly in a film purportedly about dangers to democracy. Lugosi is the only thing worth watching in the film today as he drifts ominously through the scenes, the intensity of his eyes a hypnotic frightmare. After Lugosi’s years of exile on poverty row, many expected that Universal would ask the fading star to reprise his most famous role two years later in House of Dracula (1944). Instead, they picked John Carradine for what turned out to be a minor role for the titular monster. After World War II, Lugosi, like several of Hollywood’s B- and C-list actors, became popular in summertime stage productions. He would appear as Dracula in stage plays that ran in Denver, Colorado, or Reading, Pennsylvania. As Hoover’s investigation sputtered to a halt, the summer of ’48 found Lugosi playing a one-week engagement at the Norwich Theatre and Masonic Temple in New London, Connecticut. The year 1947 became the first since 1931 that Lugosi did not work on a film set. In 1948, Universal proffered him a role in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, though as the title of the film suggests, it’s a rather small one. Lugosi insisted to Hollywood Digest that his role in the film contained “no burlesque” and that “his trademark would be unblemished.” The film did rake it in for Universal at the box office. But not unlike the success of 1931’s Dracula, it did not lead to Lugosi being offered more significant work in the long term. Lugosi’s long struggle with alcohol and drug addiction are well known. He became one of the first American celebrities to speak openly, and very bravely, about this when he sought treatment. By the 1950s, as he worked less and less and in smaller and odder roles, he unfortunately became something of a joke in an industry with a notoriously short memory of its stars. But he never stopped working completely and this tells us something about how the American taste for horror had changed since the days when the “weird mystery” offered pleasure to a relatively small, mostly older, and mostly male group of pulp magazine aficionados. During the Second World War, Lugosi became the president of the Hungarian-American Council for Democracy, an organization largely focused on the ouster of Hungary’s decidedly undemocratic regime. During this same period, he wrote a series of articles for the leftist Hungarian journal Magyar Jövő, or “Hungarian Future,” that evoke the revolutionary ideals of 1919. Lugosi’s leftist activities during the period before the Los Angeles rally included appearing on a Brooklyn radio show called The Voice of Fighting Spain, which had its roots in the anti-fascist struggle in the Spanish Civil War and received its funding from the Communist Party front organization that called itself the Institute for International Democracy. Lugosi’s affiliations would have attracted some attention even in the midst of a war in which the United States counted the Soviet Union as one of its two major, and certainly its most powerful, allies. The Office of Strategic Services, transformed at the beginning of the Cold War into the Central Intelligence Agency, opened a file on Lugosi. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), the congressional power brokers fueling the post–World War II Red Scare and incidents such as the persecution of the Hollywood Ten, appointed a small group of operatives to keep an eye on him. They called themselves the Dracula council. They appear to have lost interest in Lugosi’s leftist sympathies given the much more pressing matter of winning a war against the Axis. In 1947 the combination of the National Security Act and the acceptance of the doctrine of “containment” acted as charters for the launch of America’s Cold War. In that year, a man few Americans wanted to take an interest in them turned a baleful eye on Lugosi. J. Edgar Hoover made his bones in the Bureau of Investigation, the FBI’s forerunner. In 1919, at age twenty-four, he headed the bureau’s General Intelligence Division, christened the Radical Division given Hoover’s interest in ferreting out real and perceived revolutionary parties in the United States. Hoover became convinced that the shadow of Trotsky loomed behind every labor organizer, that every one of the era’s large strikes presaged an American Petrograd. By the 1940s, the FBI essentially functioned as his personal police force and spy network. Agents assembled thick files on major and minor figures in entertainment, politics, and the arts who held the vaguest of liberal sympathies. Hoover’s interest in the former communist from Hungary with the thick Magyar accent seems entirely predictable. Hoover ordered the Los Angeles office to open an investigation into Lugosi, “concerning his activities.” This phrase, in Hoover-speak, meant that agents should pore over every aspect of the public and private life of their subject. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service also looked into the possibility of revoking his citizenship. Other emerging voices in horror and science fiction faced similar investigations for their left-wing views. Peter Lorre proved a special target because of his friendship with Bertolt Brecht, the German communist playwright who strongly supported a failed 1919 revolution in his country. Like Lugosi, Lorre came from Hungary, but before he fled Nazi terror, he starred as one of cinema’s first serial murderers in Fritz Lang’s M. Automatically becoming the heavy in films ranging from pitch-black noir dramas to Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon, he soon became a natural choice for horror films.12 Lorre earned Hoover’s ire after publicly supporting the Hollywood Ten, a group of left-leaning screenwriters singled out by Congress’s HUAC for refusing to cooperate with their investigation. Hoover launched Operation COMPIC (Communist Infiltration—Motion Picture Industry) while segregationist John E. Rankin of Mississippi lead the charge against Hollywood as “the greatest hotbed of subversive activities in the United States.” In response, Lorre joined a radio program effort called Hollywood Fights Back. Despite stars like Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball, and John Huston participating in the effort, smearing someone red had a chilling effect on their career. Vincent Price, whose star began to rise in Hollywood in 1945, had yet to become as deeply identified with horror films as he would after House of Wax (1953). Most did know the young, handsome actor’s left-leaning politics and willingness to talk openly about them. This attracted FBI attention, but the actor had leaned hard right in the thirties, when many Americans went to the opposite end of the political spectrum. Price said he came to his senses in 1938 after watching the gears of Hitler’s death machine begin to grind. Still, Price remained more circumspect than most in supporting liberal and anti-fascist efforts that had little or no ties to American communists. Several figures who continue to shape the American tradition of horror, fantasy, and science fiction received the FBI’s unwonted concern. Ray Bradbury, with his tales of an America perpetually facing a thing at the top of the stairs, had forty pages of material assembled by agents who suspected his then-genial liberalism hid communist sympathies.13 The report included the contention that “he has been described as being critical of the United States government.” In a memo, now available through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the FBI copied their colleagues at the CIA, violating the agencies’ proscription against surveillance and investigation of private American citizens. Large portions of Bradbury’s file are redacted, but what we can read makes clear that the FBI worried that the author planned to travel to Cuba and take part in a writer’s conference “whose [sic] goal of action is to obtain unity in the fight against anti-imperialism.” What interested the FBI in Bradbury to begin with, particularly given that his file admits “there is no evidence” he ever “joined the CP”? For the FBI, the idea that Bradbury suggested in The Martian Chronicles that humans came to the red planet as “despoilers and not developers” sounded a bit too much like a critique of imperial America, both in its frontier past and Cold War present. Much of the case rested on the word of a former communist turned government snitch named Martin K. Berkeley, who claimed that Bradbury supported the Screen Actors Guild because of sympathy for “its more pro-communist elements.” Berkeley insisted he heard Bradbury describe writers who caved to McCarthyism as “cowards” and that Bradbury’s stories “had been definitely slanted against the United States and its capitalistic system.” Indeed, the informant warned that science fiction itself “may be a lucrative field for the transmission of Communist ideologies.” Too many science fiction writers, he warned Bradbury’s investigators, shared pro-communist views with “a small number of scientists” who believed a war with the Soviet Union would be “threatening to the isolation (existence?) of the universe.”14 What other information did the FBI have on the prominent writer, the poet of dark carnivals? After a ten-year investigation of Bradbury, it seemed investigators uncovered one clear communist connection when an unnamed informant (likely Berkeley, again) claimed Bradbury planned to attend an “anti-imperialist” writers congress being held in Havana, Cuba. In fact, a Roy Bradbury, possibly the source of a misprint of Ray Bradbury’s name in his FBI file, had been invited to the gathering. After keeping tabs on Bradbury almost since the end of World War II, the FBI quietly dropped the case. Isaac Asimov also received Hoover’s attention. As Olive Beck has described in unpublished research on the topic, Asimov, who joined Robert A. Heinlein and Bradbury as leading writers of science fiction after World War II, faced a rather more sinister set of charges. A practicing scientist in the biochemistry department at Boston University, he came under scrutiny for possibly aiding the Soviet espionage networks that had ferreted out secrets of the A-bomb. The FBI long believed that an academic leaked scientific secrets to the Soviets, a figure they referred to as ROBPROF. The basis for the code name seems to have been Asimov’s own work as the author of I, Robot.15 The only information the FBI found that pointed to Asimov concerned a list compiled by the Communist Party USA (“The CPUSA underground,” a bureau memo ominously called the tiny organization) of Boston-area figures who might be “possibly amenable” to membership. Asimov remained under investigation for two years, even with no other evidence surfacing. While not as long under surveillance as other figures in the world of fantasy and horror, it’s notable that the FBI shadowed Asimov for espionage and high treason, a capital crime.16 But few in the world of horror and science fiction carried as strong a resume on the left as Lugosi. It did not help that the Hungarian Communist Party made significant gains in summer parliamentary elections, the major step in the country falling into Stalin’s grip and becoming part of the Warsaw Pact. Lugosi’s case had been dropped by the time of his death, and in fact, Hoover and the immigration authorities dropped the matter much more quickly than Bradbury’s, perhaps because of the latter’s growing fame and influence. Moreover, the investigation of Lugosi revealed nothing that did not already exist in the public record. No evidence emerged that Lugosi ever joined the CPUSA. His file would include his Magyar Jövő articles and the fact that he subscribed to a fund supporting labor leader Harry Bridges in a legal struggle to prevent the federal government from stripping him of his citizenship and deporting him. In line with the FBI’s desire to collect personal dirt on its subjects in case it needed to besmirch their reputation later, one of his agents included in his report that Lugosi appeared “intoxicated most of the time.”17 Dirty tricks are the companion of dirty wars. The need to keep track of Lugosi’s drinking habits along with his politics became a standard part of the bureau’s internal security apparatus. Former director James Comey has described, for example, “the darkest chapter” in the bureau’s history as the sending of a package to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964 that contained a set of recordings of his extramarital transgressions and a typed note urging him to kill himself within the month. Clearly, horror would have a role in an emerging national security state such as this one. But would it distract a populace restive under the reigns of the growing hegemony of the Pentagon, Hollywood, and industry? Or would it become a spectral light revealing that mad scientists had taken charge of the American experience? Horror was about to meet the bomb. 6.Terror Bombing ROBERT A. Lewis, copilot of the U.S. B-29 bomber the Enola Gay, kept a folder with him in the summer of 1945 labeled “letter to mom and dad.” In fact, it would become the logbook for a top-secret mission that the crew readied for on Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas held by the Japanese early in World War II. American forces seized it a few months before the Battle of Leyte Gulf, precisely because it offered an excellent launching site for the increasingly destructive American air raids. Lewis grew up in New Jersey and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A facility with electronics, and a preternaturally calm demeanor, led to his selection as part of a small group who tested the new B-29 Superfortress. In 1945, General Curtis LeMay chose Colonel Paul Tibbets to command the Enola Gay. Tibbets immediately chose Lewis as his copilot. They would drop the first atomic weapon in history on the city of Hiroshima. The USAF chose the city since it was spared conventional bombing runs for most of the war. This allowed America to demonstrate the full power of these weapons. Apologists for the bomb later called Hiroshima the site of a major military base. There was a base near the city. But the blast killed over one hundred thousand civilians, along with a contingent of Korean prisoners forced into slave labor after the Japanese conquest of their country and some American POWs. Lewis wrote an unofficial account of what happened in August of ’45 on the back of army department action report forms. He stenciled a sketch of the mushroom cloud and compared the dropping of the superweapon to a Buck Rogers adventure. “We had expected something fierce,” he admitted, but also wrote, “My God what have we done?” He ruminated over how many Japanese the new superweapon killed.18 We don’t know whether Lewis felt guilt over his bit part in the inauguration of the atomic age. In some ways, his comments reflected all the confusion, anxiety, and excitement Americans experienced in 1945. They were like Buck Rogers, the popular movie serial hero who used high-tech weapons to fight malevolent enemies. But should they be? What had they done? How many did we kill? Do we want to know? Most Americans didn’t know the answers to these questions, and it likely wouldn’t have mattered much if they tried to find out. The U.S. government used its power to ensure that the public would not care how many we killed. Many of the war films made while combat continued assured audiences that the Japanese people suffered little, if at all, from the air campaigns conducted since 1942 against the Japanese home islands that LeMay proudly described as “terror bombing.” In the film Bombardier (1943), a young pilot briefly has a crisis of conscience over the death of civilians but is assured by his commander, and in a letter from his mom, that a new target site would make “munitions” the only victim of the bombing campaign. The ownership of major studios by corporate moguls, many of whom had diverse streams of revenue generated by the war, ensured more than the transformation of horror films into escapist fantasies. The tendency for financial and political elites to ally assured a cozy relationship between the studios and the American government. In the summer of 1942, the Office of War Information created a special branch to ensure that films would “enhance understanding of the war at home and abroad” and act as “liaison with the press, radio, and the motion pictures.” This language makes what came to be known as the Bureau of Motion Pictures sound like a benign public relations agency. In theory, this did not give the War Department authority to censor films. In reality, military censors insisted on seeing and editing any scripts that might portray, for example, a human side to Japanese soldiers or civilians. In film after film, Japanese pilots are shown bombing and strafing civilians, an inhuman tactic they did, in fact, employ. However, in these same films American pilots are always hitting “military targets” with utter precision. There’s certainly not a word said about “terror bombing.”19 In an animated feature you aren’t likely to see appear on the Disney+ channel any time soon, the House of Mouse released Victory Through Air Power (1943). Viewers are treated to exploding military compounds and munitions without the slightest suggestion that human beings are killed in these raids. Frank Capra’s Know Your Enemy: Japan seems out of step with much of his Why We Fight series, which attempted to blend a set of universal values with American patriotism. The war ended before the film gained wide distribution among the troops. But its content gives us a fair representation of American propaganda efforts. The film insisted that Japanese soldiers had been mentally shaped by the Bushido code to believe that “treachery, brutality, rape and torture” are justified. Meanwhile, the film celebrated the killing of twenty thousand Japanese at Iwo Jima and described the horrific battle of Okinawa as a triumphant moment when American forces “trapped and destroyed 100,000.” At a time when hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians died in LeMay’s “terror” campaign, the film insisted that “the nasty gangsters” in the “factories and war plants” were the only victims of the constant air raids.20 These propaganda efforts had real-world effects not only for Japanese civilians but also for Americans of Japanese descent. A little over two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR issued Executive Order 9066, which allowed the U.S. military wide latitude to exclude anyone deemed a security risk from “military areas.” Although the order did not specifically mention Japanese Americans or insist on the building of detention camps, it came with a wink and a nod, and the commanders across the country understood its meaning. The entire state of California became a “military area,” and Japanese Americans were not allowed in the state unless detained in an internment camp. The U.S. government imprisoned 127,000 men, women, and children of Japanese descent during World War II. Newspaper editorials, including one in the Los Angeles Times, justified their imprisonment by describing the war in the Pacific as “a war with their race.” California Congressional Representative Leland Ford pulled no punches in insisting that all Japanese should be placed in “concentration camps,” a phrase in common use for the internment camps, even though much current discussion, journalism, and even historical writing uses the term relocation camps.21 The degree of racial hatred most white Americans felt toward the Japanese makes it hard to discern whether few if any felt any qualms about the genocidal air campaign waged on the Pacific rival’s homeland. The war on the ground seemed a struggle to match, and sometimes overmatch, the Japanese atrocities against soldiers and civilians. Acclaimed author Paul Fussell, a combat veteran of World War II, admits that American servicemen enjoyed using Japanese prisoners for target practice and “felt intense satisfaction when watching them twist and writhe when set on fire by the napalm of the flame thrower.” In a grotesquerie that would surface in the American horror tradition in the 1960s, soldiers and marines made trophies of Japanese skulls. This may appear to the reader as a bizarre rumor or, at the very least, uncommon. In fact, the May 22, 1944, issue of Life magazine contains a picture of twenty-year-old Natalie Nickerson writing a thank-you note to her boyfriend for the skull he mailed her, a macabre gift the photograph shows her gazing at lovingly.22 Terror bomber Curtis LeMay took command of the Pacific air campaign in February of 1945 and rejected even the concept of precision bombing. The tough-talking LeMay, later the model for General Jack D. Ripper in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, believed the use of a relatively new incendiary weapon called napalm—but evocatively referred to by the air crews on Tinian as hell-jelly—would reduce Japan’s wooden cities and the people who lived in them to ash. He was right. Two Harvard chemistry professors, Louis Fieser and E. B. Hershberg, developed what would become the basic formula on Valentine’s Day, 1942. They chose the Fourth of July to test the new weapon on a Harvard University football field, hoping sedate Cambridge would assume the work of rowdy undergraduates when the explosive charges ignited. What they created was much worse than an incendiary bomb. The new weapon ignited into a viscous jelly that burned more slowly than gasoline—whether it adhered to a structure or human flesh. In March of 1945, LeMay unleashed 325 bombers armed with napalm on Tokyo, burning much of the city and killing 89,000 people, the overwhelming majority women, the elderly, children, and babies. The center of the blasts extruded such incredible temperatures that the city’s canals boiled. The work of the air corps, designated XXI Bomber Command, had only begun. Using up to 600 aircraft in raid after raid, almost all Japan’s major cities burned in the months to come. The death toll reached 260,000 and, with the island on fire, 13 million became homeless. An uncountable number suffered lifelong pain from disfiguring burns.23 Taken together, LeMay’s “terror bombings” created a larger mound of corpses than the two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But, after the immediate elation over the war’s end, the bomb became a shadow cast across everything Americans believed about themselves. Nancy Arnot Harjan, one of Studs Terkel’s interviewees for his oral history project The Good War, experienced World War II as a teenager who believed above all that “the country was innocent,” that the GIs liberating Paris “were all knights in shining armor, saving humanity.”24 But painful questions began to surface. Harjan remembered about “a week or two” of elation stalked by disturbing questions. Her thoughts may not have been representative of the official culture of victory. But it shows Americans could express doubts about their government’s use of such a weapon, perhaps pondering and refining their misgivings for decades, and speak of them thoughtfully when a well-known writer like Terkel asked about how it felt to be American in the summer of ’45: This wonderful new bomb had ended it all . . . Seventy thousand or a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand civilians? It came as a shock after seeing so many war movies with the Japanese portrayed as militaristic brutes. To see women, children, and old innocent civilians brutally burned . . . What was it all about? In truth, most Americans expressed unease about the use of the bomb, wondering at least to themselves, “What was it all about?” They also quickly accepted it as part of a Faustian bargain that ensured both the political dominance of the United States and the peculiar kind of pleasure in life a cross section of Americans had come to enjoy during the war. One member of the U.S. Merchant Marine, Frank Keegan, only remembered relief upon hearing news of Truman’s decision, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan’s surrender. Keegan said to himself, “Nice goin’, Harry. You did it to ’em, kid. That’s how guiltless I was.” He could recall later, matter-of-factly if not entirely pleased with his attitude, “He saved our lives, he terminated the goddamn thing.”25 In his own reflections about the decision to use the bomb, Fussell reminded us that frontline troops in modern wars live with a primal certainty of either death or catastrophic wounds. The news of the end of war, whatever form the denouement takes, comes to them with a wave of feeling that can’t be described as relief or celebration. They essentially feel that a death sentence has been lifted, that someone in authority made a call in the final seconds and granted them a pardon.26 But other Americans experienced war’s end with a triumphalism of a type that had been building since the news from various fronts had become increasingly positive. One of Terkel’s interviewees remembered that while the “the rest of the world came out bruised and scarred” by the global conflagration, many Americans who had not been in a branch of the service, or had not lost family members, discovered “new gratifications they’d never known in their lives. Mass travel, mass vacations, everything else came out of it.” This may have been true of many of those in uniform as well. Unlike the armies of the rest of the globe, a majority of enlistees in the armed forces served behind the lines and a majority of those never left the States.27 Many Americans entered 1945 convinced their country had swept the world of its shadows. Roosevelt and then Truman sought to win the war both “thoroughly” and “fast,” while doing so “at the lowest possible cost” to Americans. That’s certainly an admirable goal, arguably a moral imperative. And yet, a massive loss of life among enemies and allies revealed the secret of the administration’s nightmare math. While tens of millions died on home fronts across the globe, saving gasoline and growing Victory gardens counted as “sacrifice” for Americans. Even Joseph Stalin, better known for his brutality than perspicacity, could blandly note that compared to his country of burning rubble and twenty-one million corpses, “things are not that bad in the United States.”28 Things weren’t so bad. And yet, historian Tom Engelhardt has referred to the postwar era as the time of “the Great Fear” during which “backyard barbeques” took place in “an anxiety-ridden garrison state” where abundance competed with horror. What could Americans have been afraid of? As the world’s only atomic power, the United States could have withdrawn back into its continental borders. It could have concentrated on being a constitutional republic that used its vast resources to build an equitable society that benefitted its citizens from cradle to grave. Indeed, in the first years after World War II, Harry Truman faced a populace eager to demobilize. They did not want to build a military machine, having seen what government intervention in the economy could do if it set itself to projects responsive to the needs of the people. Roosevelt’s promised freedoms for which we fought seemed within reach . . . freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and even freedom from fear. But the thermal flash of the atom bomb left these promises in ruin. A professional class of militarists became intertwined with a war economy that kept the country on a war footing and in fact increased military expenditures. By 1950, the United States footed the majority of the French bill for maintaining their control of East Asia. Horror films now seemed less about fear and more about the yuks, a way to take the edge off, especially with Abbott and Costello meeting up with the monsters of contemporary America’s youth for gags. Older horror seemed a little too subversive, at times with a sexual subtext that challenged the cult of breadwinner, wife, and children that would emerge in the American middle class after 1945. Slapstick could not properly channel America’s Cold War uncertainties. Amity Island had become a truly global power, with plenty of anxiety building under the era’s gleaming sunshine. Someone who’d seen the face of American power abroad would rev the chain saw long before Tobe Hooper told his tale of a Texas massacre. 7.Void, Despair, Torment ROD SERLING joined hundreds of thousands of American veterans returning from Europe and the Pacific to find a much different country from the one that greeted their fathers and grandfathers in 1919. White veterans received the full benefit of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, better known as the G.I. Bill, which provided money for a college education and help with securing a thirty-year mortgage on a home they could, at least theoretically, claim as their own. The possibility of buying a home with such a generous loan period was first made available to many Americans with the Fair Housing Act of the New Deal era. Low-interest loans also allowed the purchases of businesses and farms. But Serling could not settle into this shockingly comfortable niche in American society. He worried that his generation might sell their own freedoms for middle-class prosperity, or simply become lost in the narcissism that the expanding American economy encouraged. Discharged in 1946, he certainly benefitted from the best of these changes. The G.I. Bill allowed him to join hundreds of thousands of other young white men in attending college, once the privilege of the upper middle class or the tiny numbers able to gain scholarships. He enrolled immediately at Antioch College in Ohio, studied literature and creative writing, and managed to sell his first teleplay to NBC while matriculating. He graduated in 1950, married his college sweetheart, Carolyn Kramer, and walked into the bright future offered to privileged citizens of a superpower. Black veterans faced a different reality. Lynching remained a feature of American life, publicly celebrated by the mobs themselves if rarely discussed in the broader culture. Isaac Woodard, on his return from service where he had been decorated for bravery under fire in New Guinea, met just such a fate on February 12, 1946. Riding a Greyhound home to see his family, a white bus driver stopped in Batesburg, South Carolina, to complain to authorities that Woodard had asked for a bathroom stop. A group of police beat Woodard severely and the local sheriff gouged out Woodward’s eyes with a nightstick. Federal attention led to the sherriff’s trial but also a quick acquittal by an all-white jury. While the situation was particularly egregious in the American South, every American region had laws, de facto and de jure, that prevented Black men and women from reaping the G.I. Bill’s benefits. These veterans could, in theory, receive money for college, but most colleges in the United States remained whites only. Under the law, Black veterans could lay claim to home and business loans, but banks could and did refuse them without fear of legal repercussions. So-called covenant neighborhoods collaborated with real estate firms and local politicians to ensure no Black families moved into the new suburbs. Whites who wanted to live in segregated neighborhoods had the support of the Federal Housing Administration. The U.S. government, in a practice known as redlining, made fluid funds available to contractors who agreed to build suburbs that excluded African Americans.29 World War II looked in some ways like the beginning of a new phase in the freedom struggle for African Americans. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled against state practices that suppressed, or simply denied, Black women and men the right to vote. Veterans of World War II like Medgar Evers brought home from the war a determination to make America live up to its claims of being a bastion of democracy and freedom. During the war itself, A. Philip Randolph, an African American socialist and labor union leader, held a huge rally in Madison Square Garden to protest the treatment of Black soldiers. He would later be the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. But, when World War II ended, it would be another twenty years before the 1965 Voting Rights Act laid the groundwork for African American political autonomy. It’s also true that, outside of a general sense that something happened with segregation during the civil rights movements, even most college-educated whites have a limited grasp of the role of thousands of organizers whose experience had been shaped by World War II and their mistreatment by an American army allegedly fighting fascism. We know about Medgar Evers because he was murdered in his own driveway. James Baldwin thought that World War II meant something very different to African Americans than to whites. “A certain hope died,” he wrote, both because of the treatment even Black veterans received and how little the world changed for all Black people in 1945. In fact, the twin shadows of the Holocaust and Hiroshima seemed a deadly warning to Baldwin, a reminder of what white people would do while claiming to be both Christian and civilized. Baldwin wrote in the evocatively titled The Fire Next Time that “the threat of universal extinction” had entered the world. Wasn’t the bomb part of the logic of white supremacy, an iron logic of nihilism that had created “this void, this despair, this torment” felt all over the world from “the streets of Stockholm” to the “sidewalks of Harlem”? Terror at what the world had become haunted millions of Americans. The prosperity and eerie optimism of postwar America reached only a large minority of its white citizens. The long period of economic growth, more than a quarter of a century after 1945, came in fits and starts for many families. The larger paychecks many workers began to see did not keep pace with prices. Companies like General Motors and U.S. Steel made tens of millions in profits while refusing Truman’s admonitions to ward off strikes with tiny wage increases. Meanwhile, a Republican-controlled Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which struck an enormous blow to labor unions, one from which they arguably never recovered. Among other restrictive provisions, the act outlawed unions among supervisors and foremen, effectively severing a large part of the new white-collar workforce from membership in, and sympathy with, organized labor. The emerging Cold War with the Soviet Union ensured that American foreign policy poisoned discussions about worker’s rights. Republican leaders in Congress insisted on widespread communist infiltration in organized labor and used anti-communist rhetoric to frighten suburban voters who unreasonably connected rising prices and wage slumps with strikes rather than with the powerful corporations that kept wages low and prices high. The attitude of the United States toward its recent enemies, and its recent friends, seems shocking, but it followed the economic logic of imperial power. It’s difficult, nearly impossible, to imagine a continuing partnership between the United States and the Soviet Union, despite the warmth of the relationship through the thirties and the alliance of the war years. Truman and Stalin didn’t share much in terms of either politics or background. But both did hold a morally blinkered view of the postwar world. 8.Cold Warriors . . . in Space!! MOST AMERICANS, now and at the time, do not grasp how the Soviet Union interpreted the United States’ embrace of Germany after 1945. The Truman administration’s quick willingness to welcome Germany back into the family of nations, at least American-controlled West Germany, which had received a free market makeover, seemed an astonishing move. Over the next several decades, West Germany became a deadly forward base from which to project nuclear missiles. Medium-range missiles aimed directly at the Soviet heartland remained frightening portents into the 1980s, as much to the western Europeans being “protected” by them as to the Russians. Anti-communism perhaps made this decision at least as rational, or rather no more irrational, than Stalin’s insistence that the Warsaw Pact nations provide the Soviet Union with “buffer states.” But Operation Paperclip, though little known at the time, proved one of the more shocking decisions by the emerging American national security state. This initiative brought over 1,600 Nazi scientists to the United States, cleared them of all war crimes, and set them to work developing the basis for delivery systems of nuclear weapons. This ethically purblind decision transformed the global balance of power. It’s difficult to imagine that the United States would have charged so far ahead of the Soviet Union in the arms race without the help of Wernher von Braun, a fact admitted by a number of NASA scientists from that era. Von Braun had joined the Nazi Party when Hitler came to power, and he rose through the ranks of the SS to become a major. In his early thirties he’d been given the title of professor, a particular honorific in German, by Hitler himself. During the war, he led the V-2 rocket building program, which employed slave labor from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Victims who survived the camp have testified that von Braun selected workers personally. He even handpicked prisoners for torture, seemingly for no purpose other than sadistic pleasure. At the end of the war, von Braun claimed he wanted to surrender to the Americans rather than the Soviets. The Americans would make the best captors, he asserted, because “they believed in the Bible.”30 By 1948, the CIA went even further in enlisting former Nazis, including members of the Waffen-SS who had played a central role in the Holocaust and related war crimes. A few such figures provided alleged intelligence about Soviet activities in eastern Europe that facilitated the move toward the Cold War. A retired CIA agent later admitted that this provided the American security establishment with the “Russian boogeyman junk” that Truman’s national security state loved rather than a meaningful picture of geopolitics.31 The American public might have been even more shocked to learn that the CIA worked closely with Nazi collaborators in the Soviet Union itself after 1946. Not only had many of these groups aided in the German invasion of the Soviet Union but they also had, by the agency’s own admission, “been linked to Nazi atrocities on the eastern front.” The mass murder of Poles, Jews, Red Army POWs, and communists represented this “link.” In the fall of 1949, the CIA parachuted guerilla squads of war criminals back into Ukraine in what became known as Operation Nightingale. Although Russian special forces quickly annihilated these cells, the reader should imagine the American reaction to Soviet-sponsored guerrillas dropped into, say, Nebraska to take lives, destroy critical infrastructure, and generally wreak havoc.32 Perhaps Americans would not have been appalled by their government. Mainstream white America became convinced that their pastel middle-class dreams could turn Marxist red, so much so that even the worst crimes of the Nazis faded for a time out of American memory. The famous, mostly infamous, General George S. Patton, whose failures and inconsistent performance as a military thinker have been overshadowed by legend and the 1970 film, provides an interesting case study in American attitudes. After touring the Ohrdruf death camp with Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, Patton wrote that the victims appeared to him to be “a subhuman species without any of the cultural or social refinements of the time.” Patton had no sympathy for the dead, using his celebrity to insist the United States immediately rearm the Nazis and launch a preemptive offensive against the Soviet Union.33 Historians spill gallons of ink over the origins of the Cold War. There’s no single answer to why the United States and the Soviet Union, former allies against the Axis, turned on one another so quickly. Numerous commentators have suggested that both great powers needed the Cold War. Stalin and his successors, with an occasional notable exception, could set aside hopes for a worldwide revolution and settle into what Noam Chomsky described as the dominance of “a military-bureaucratic elite” over Soviet foreign affairs. For the United States, the Bolshevik threat gave legitimacy to the new, expansionist American foreign policy and a highly militarized economy. However one feels about the nuances of the debate, it’s impossible to chalk it up to Soviet aggression. Communist revolutionaries around the globe—from Vietnam to Ghana and Greece—found the Soviets decidedly drowsy on the matter of proletarian revolution. While convinced of Moscow’s influence everywhere, Americans lived in ignorance of the steps their government took to ratchet up tensions between the two powers. No one wanted to think much about foreign policy after V-J Day, and when told a new enemy had appeared, only a small number questioned the state’s assurances that “the American way of life” faced an implacable foe or had any idea of a longer history that helped explain Soviet suspicion. The relationship soured in 1917. The United States invaded Russia at the end of the First World War, largely in support of the British effort to prevent Lenin’s communist revolution from succeeding. A thaw in relations came in the 1930s and many Americans admired the undeniable economic miracle taking place in the Soviet Union as socialism sent Russia’s essentially medieval economy barreling into the twentieth century.34 A darker picture emerged for those who paid the closest attention. Increasingly, even American leftists grew nervous about the emergence of Stalin as he consolidated the Soviet Union into a dictatorship, repressed dissent at home, made small and devious land grabs in the Baltics, and, ironically, gave up on precisely what the Anglo-American right so deeply feared: the spread of an international worker’s revolution around the globe. Instead, Stalin insisted on a theory he called “socialism in one country,” an idea that confronted Marxist dissidents, or anyone who actually read Marx, with a bizarre formulation. Stalin gave half-hearted support to the fight against fascism in Spain and no attention at all to the emerging communist revolution in China. Meanwhile, he murdered his fellow communists in enormous numbers and even sent his dreaded secret police, the NKVD, to assassinate left-wing dissidents from Stalinism around the globe. The United States entered a cold war with Stalin’s Russia, despite having little to fear from the wounded giant. Uninterested in spreading Lenin’s revolution and leading a country decimated by a world war that killed nearly twenty-seven million Soviet soldiers and civilians, Stalin spent the remaining years of his life (d. 1953) watching American westerns, eating enormous meals with his flunkies, and ensuring he remained in power. The Soviet Union did have cause to worry about America’s space program. By the late forties, von Braun worked on rocketry for the U.S. military and converted to evangelical Christianity. Transferred to NASA on its founding in 1958, he played an integral role in the development of the launch vehicle for the Apollo program. His ambition grew, seeing rocketry as a path to the exploration of Mars. By 1960, von Braun received enough adulation for his work in the United States and Britain that a biopic appeared entitled I Aim at the Stars. Comedian Mort Sahl suggested that But Sometimes I Hit London would make a fine subtitle. In fact, von Braun dreamed not only of Mars but also of an orbital space platform that could rain down destruction on the Soviets from the skies.35 The reality was that the United States, a superpower with global reach, defined the Soviet Union, a regional power with limited ambitions, as a mortal enemy. Americans became fearful, uncertain, and anxious in an age of increasing abundance, indeed in a society that had the largest and most prosperous middle class in the history of the world. It also became a society wracked by anxiety, over the bomb, over change, over fear of the Soviets, even over the idea that they belonged to a generation that seemed so stable and secure in relation to that of their parents. Wouldn’t it all be taken away? 9.Noon on Doomsday MILLIONS OF men and women who had seen the worst of World War II were not ready for the American empire’s slugfest with another enemy. Rod Serling, for example, brooded over what he’d seen in the Pacific at a time when discussion of postwar trauma, both physical and mental, had no place in American society. Discussion of the wounded, including the psychologically wounded, veteran remained verboten in American culture after the first months of peace. Indeed, popular magazines such as Ladies’ Home Journal and Life ran articles directed at soldiers’ wives, suggesting that their homebound husbands likely needed “a few weeks” (!) to adjust to the civilian experience.36 One of Serling’s first successes in television revealed his growing social conscience. His 1956 script Patterns became a huge hit for NBC’s Kraft Television Theatre. A boardroom drama that placed big business maleficence and cultural conformity in its crosshairs, Serling’s film tapped into a widespread American fear of corporate life revealed in the success of novels like The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and Revolutionary Road. Patterns aired twice due to its popularity and a film would be produced from it. Serling seemingly had found a way to write about the dangers of fascism in his own country without being called a communist. Indeed, he could do it and be highly successful all at once. Or so he thought. Serling, like many whites, found himself shocked out of his complacency toward the treatment of Black Americans by the vicious murder of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till. In August of 1955, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam beat, mutilated, and shot Till, dumping his body in the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. They believed the young child had “whistled” at Carolyn Bryant, Bryant’s wife. Less than a month after Till’s murder, an all-white jury found the accused not guilty. Carolyn Bryant claimed Till not only whistled at her but grabbed her around the waist. Decades later, Bryant admitted she’d lied about the entire story. Black death has meant very little to a country steeped in white supremacy.37 Till’s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, sent the young boy to live with his grandparents in the Mississippi Delta because she believed it safer than her southside Chicago neighborhood. After his death, she insisted on an open casket funeral, revealing the torture inflicted on his body. Major magazines and newspapers carried the story, and while many treated it as a singular incident, at least some used it to tell the wider history of ongoing violence against African Americans. Moved to anger by the racist violence, Serling attempted to reimagine the tale in a teleplay he called Noon on Doomsday, alternatively titled A Town Has Turned to Dust. However, fear of offending the American public caused corporate sponsors to demand radical changes to the script, a somewhat odd decision since they allowed Patterns to mock the very corporate environment they now sought to protect. White supremacy, and any challenges to it, clearly remained the hill the country’s ruling class would die on. The changes to Noon on Doomsday made it unrecognizable as a comment on the Till lynching. CBS insisted that the murdered character have a Mexican background rather than being African American. Also, and at the network’s insistence, hints of advances toward a white woman as the cause of the killing were dropped. To completely erase any political commentary, studio executives moved the setting out of Mississippi and the contemporary period and into a generic “Old West” setting. Disgusted, Serling watched as a network beholden to advertisers reduced his clarion call for racial justice to little more than a police procedural with an excruciatingly vague message about tolerance. Serling never forgot his anger over what he considered one of his more important works. In what was supposed to be a promotional interview for a new anthology series helmed by Serling, network executives gritted their teeth as he barked at Mike Wallace that it was “criminal” that television execs simply refused to allow writers to explore “social evils.” His new show, he wrote in TV Guide, “probes into the dimension of imagination but with a concern for taste and for an adult audience too long assumed to have IQs in negative figures.” 10.What the Martian Said THE PILOT for The Twilight Zone aired on October 2, 1959. Serling wrote more than ninety scripts for a series that ran 156 episodes. It became the first show on television to imagine fascism coming to America, to challenge the red baiting woven into the culture after World War II, to question how the Japanese were stereotyped after Pearl Harbor, and indeed the first to show the mushroom cloud and wonder about the morality of atomic weapons. But, as Serling once noted, you can get away with anything “if a Martian says it,” or even if you throw a flying saucer or two into the story. Serling used alien invasions and nightmare scenarios to ask hard questions of an America used to horror from the stars shaping how they understood the terror of the real world. An expert on the science fiction and the politics of postwar America, Steffen Hantke, described “the amalgamation of science fiction with the horror film” in these years. This new way of thinking about monsters would attempt a marriage, doomed to divorce, between the fifties’ fascination with the American empire creating “the World of Tomorrow” and the dystopian realities the tomorrow being built for Americans promised.38 The beginnings of this great divorce, and the creation of what James Cameron has called “the interzone” that links horror and science fiction, appears in the bizarre celebrations of predatory American conceptions of space spearheaded by none other than Walt Disney and former SS officer Wernher von Braun. Their collaboration, made even eerier by Disney’s flirtation with the German American Bund (the American fascist movement) in the 1930s, intertwined with the growing fascination with manifest destiny in space in America’s emerging right wing. Disneyland opened in the summer of 1955 and visitors could ease into the diverse hypersensory worlds of Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorowland by entering through Main Street, U.S.A., the world of the American small town. Tomorrowland’s vision of space conquered and sanitized already played out for viewers of Disneyland, a TV anthology series that mixed animation with iconic, and revised, stories of American history. Disney brought in von Braun to showcase the future. Two episodes, “Man in Space” and “Man and the Moon,” feature the former SS officer explaining in his thick East Prussian accent that America would go beyond the moon and someday reach Mars itself. The man who could get a call through to Hitler any hour of the day found in the United States his instrument for his quest to “aim at the stars.” The Stars and Stripes would fly over Tomorrowland, literally and metaphorically. Hungarian-born director George Pal attempted something similar with his flop Conquest of Space (1955). Drawing in part on von Braun’s vision of the American future, specifically his 1952 book, The Mars Project, the film fell flat for most audiences. Pal had been associated with two classics, When Worlds Collide (1951) and an American reimagination of The War of the Worlds (1953). Both offered viewers differing visions of conquest and space, though in each of these classics old-fashioned military power and triage eugenics are the ultimate savior. Conquest of Space, despite a title that seemed to promise lasers massacring whatever indigenous extraterrestrials America might meet out in the black, caused viewers to leave the theater disappointed. Although now and again scientifically accurate, audiences seemed to feel that Pal had produced a western with no native peoples to kill. Aim at the stars, sure. But sometimes can’t we hit Moscow? 11.Shelter from the Midnight Sun ROD SERLING’S daughter Anne remembers her father as kind, funny, given to pranks, and doing his best to ensure that she did not have a “Hollywood dad.” She also recalls that he woke up screaming and when, terrified, she asked what was wrong, he simply said, “I dreamed Japanese soldiers were trying to kill me,” and gently told her to go back to bed. World War II and its legacy appeared again and again in The Twilight Zone, often very directly. The treatment of Japanese Americans and the lingering scars of war have seldom been more thoughtfully explored than in his scripts for season one’s “The Purple Testament” and season three’s “A Quality of Mercy.” Both draw heavily on Serling’s efforts to make peace with his combat experience. Both stories are set in the Philippines during the closing days of the war. “The Purple Testament” creates a supernatural aura for the trauma of battle itself in the story of a lieutenant who can see which of his men will die in combat by looking into their faces. “A Quality of Mercy” enters completely unexplored territory, featuring a gung ho lieutenant, eager to kill the enemy since he arrived in the Pacific just as the conflict was winding down. Taking over a war-weary platoon, he wants to launch a frontal attack on a cave filled with a small number of wounded Japanese soldiers, a pointless sally mounted over the protests of his sergeant. But before the deadly assault can commence, the bloodthirsty young officer finds himself mysteriously transformed into a member of the Japanese Imperial Army about to slaughter American soldiers in the same situation. He awakens from his tour of duty in the twilight zone to hear his sergeant tell him “a big bomb” has been dropped in Hiroshima and HQ has ordered that the platoon hold its position. Serling told his most poignant, and most controversial, tale of war in what became the final season of The Twilight Zone. In “The Encounter,” Fenton, an angry, severely traumatized, and alcoholic veteran of the Pacific, meets a Japanese American seeking work. Fenton offers to give him a job helping clean out his attic, an accidental ramshackle museum of mementos and souvenirs of the Pacific war including a samurai sword taken from the dead hands of an enemy that reads, “The Sword Will Avenge Me.” George Takei, soon famous as Star Trek’s Mr. Sulu, starred as one of the two protagonists, Arthur Takamori, who endures Fenton’s racist comments as the old souvenirs of war that clutter the attic begin to sizzle with a dire supernatural energy. The episode isn’t one of the classics of the series and some of the plot twists undercut the political comment. Still, it explored the idea of a World War II veteran suffering from guilt and trauma, a notion that has found little purchase in pop culture portrayals of that not-so-good war even today. Adding power to the story, Takei himself had been imprisoned in detention camps in California and Arkansas as a child under Roosevelt’s Order 9066. Perhaps Serling’s engagement with the bomb made for some of his most important efforts to use horror as social criticism. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki inaugurated an explosive and ominous end to several decades of unending warfare that grew out of the First World War. Historians today, looking at the period of 1914 to 1945, urge us to see it as a “thirty years’ war” to better understand the spasm of violence that eviscerated the world. But did the twin mushroom clouds really end the vile era? Staring back from our current vantage point, we see a century of wreckage and ruin. Unending war with a cease-fire proclaimed now and again until the bloodletting resumed. We continue to live in the nuclear age, though it seldom appears on our current list of concerns. But immediately after 1945, the fascination with the bomb bled into all aspects of American culture, frequently as a source of profound anxiety. This included the obsessive fascination that accompanies the object of our fears. Serling worried Americans about the moral meaning of the bomb through a medium that had long assured them it represented American omnipotence. Television, struggling to decide what it would become in the postwar era, attempted to satiate the strange need to see death incarnate. Two Los Angeles stations attempted to film a nuclear test 250 miles away in early 1951. Viewers simply saw, in an image that seems positively Lynchian, “the flash of eerie white light.” In 1952, televisions across the nation pulsed weirdly with a flash that sank into “a dark penumbra” enveloping a tiny tenebrous light. Viewers complained about the quality of the image of holocaust, few ever learning that the chiaroscuro image had ruffled across their tiny screens because even at the distance from which the cameras filmed, the heat from the blast melted their lenses.39 Serling grasped the dangers of such weapons and not only in the obvious sense of their threat to human life on earth. He wondered whether a democracy could withstand the pressures of becoming an unstoppable military juggernaut. Could American democracy survive the American empire? Serling’s interest in racial justice already made him aware of the limits of American democracy. Would even basic community break down in an age of apocalyptic weapons needed to defend the porous borders of a global empire? Over the years, in fits and starts, he bleakly decided the answer was yes, eventually using his platform to speak out forcefully about American intervention in Asia. But even in the early sixties, we see him trying to make sense of his country and its possible fate. Serling took viewers to a particularly sadistic corner of the Twilight Zone in September of 1961. In an episode entitled “The Shelter,” which aired about one year before the Cuban missile crisis, suburban neighbors blithely gathered for a birthday party rapidly turn on one another when the television reports UFOs, probably Soviet bombers, descending on them. Only one of the neighbors, the beloved family doctor to most of the gathering, has built a fallout shelter. Even some dedicated fans of the show found the episode heavy-handed, too blatantly allegorical, preachy. Would people really turn on one another so quickly in a crisis? Serling, and the embattled protagonist of “The Shelter,” thought it naïve to believe otherwise.40 Atomic weapons became, and have remained, a symbol of the apocalypse, a haunting backdrop to horror culture’s tales of death. Serling frequently revisited the theme directly in episodes like “Time Enough at Last,” “Third from the Sun,” “A Little Peace and Quiet,” and, more obliquely, in “The Midnight Sun.” Serling’s use of science fiction terrors to make people think appeared at a period when, just as often, these tropes reassured Americans everything would be fine. In the center of empire, theaters had begun a new kind of danse macabre as dark powers starved for conquest arrived to conquer the ailing earth. The future belonged to horror.",

      "content": "1.Twilight Zone THE ROAR of sixteen-inch naval guns made one young Navy recruit from Brooklyn imagine a hundred subway trains flying over his head. Amid the cacophony of the explosions unleashed from nearby ships, Ensign Gabe Pressman could not identify the even more massive shells lobbed in his direction, thinking at first the flashes across the crepuscular horizon must be heat lightning. Pressman’s small ship, the PC-470, formed part of the American seventh fleet that steamed into the Philippines to retake the American colony, seized by Japan at the same time they struck Pearl Harbor. The small craft normally performed patrol duty, sometimes acting as a submarine chaser tracking the Nazi “wolfpacks” of U-boats in the Atlantic. On October 23, Pressman’s boat faced the daunting challenge of landing troops on the fortified island of Leyte. The American invasion force included a future writer who, anguished almost daily by his experience of combat, became one of the most trenchant critics of the country whose uniform he wore in that late October of 1944. Halloween came early for him, and millions of others, that year.1 Rodman Edward Serling had the terrifying experience of landing on Leyte and establishing a beachhead. Japanese snipers harassed his unit, the 511th Parachute regiment, who fought as light infantry in the Pacific. Rod, as everyone called Serling, joined the army immediately after finishing high school in 1943. In the days before graduation, he’d been aglow with idealism about the war against the Axis, and tried, not very successfully, to recruit his friends at Binghamton Central High School in New York. Serling would also be disappointed in his hopes of getting to Europe to fight the Nazis. Instead, he found himself the summer after high school graduation training with his regiment in New Guinea for the planned assault on the Philippines. He had no concept of what awaited him on Leyte. The landing itself proved surprisingly easy. The battle raged offshore while Serling’s unit hit the sand behind the main landing parties. The smell of cordite, charred metal, and burning petroleum saturated the air as American and Japanese airplanes twisted into death spirals and fell into the Pacific, staining the turquoise waters black and red. Although they had no way of knowing it, Serling on the beach and Pressman from the deck of PC-470 took part in the largest naval engagement in human history. American submarines sank two cruisers. The American carrier USS Princeton exploded in a giant ball of flame following attacks of wave after wave of Japanese Zero fighters. The enormous hulk slid under the water as little more than shattered steel debris. In turn, American Hellcat fighters made this victory costly, downing a huge number of land-based Japanese aircraft. Meanwhile, repeated attacks from American torpedoes against the largest battleship in the world, Japan’s seventy-thousand-ton Musashi, eventually capsized the beast, the seas trembling under the monster’s weight before embracing it. On October 25, the third day of the battle, another American escort carrier took a direct hit from a kamikaze attack and gurgled under the waves only an hour later. Serling knew little about the details of the carnage occurring offshore the relatively peaceful sands of Leyte Island. Despite continuing attacks of snipers, the beach had been won. His unit soon moved inland, where they encountered significant resistance from Japanese ground forces. In a single firefight, Serling received wounds in the wrist and knee, although, per army policy with combat troops in the Second World War, he quickly returned to combat. But a more gruesome memory of the Battle of Leyte Gulf stayed with the nineteen-year-old. Serling could hear the peculiar combination of faraway explosions and airplane engines competing with the eerie counterpoint of somnolent surf sliding across the sand. Serling paused with some of his fellow soldiers in the so-called Death Squad, the demolitions platoon of the 511th with a reputation for high casualties given the nature of their work, attempting to disarm land mines and booby traps under the deadly eye of Japanese snipers. The sun broiled high and hot, but a breeze picked up across the ocean spray now and again. Serling sweated under a palm tree with some of his fellow privates while his buddy Melvin Levy, the 511th’s aspiring comedian, performed some impromptu stand-up for their other pals. In the middle of his routine, a low-flying U.S. transport plane suddenly roared overhead and dropped its payload of army rations, an enormous crate weighing hundreds of pounds. The huge container knocked Serling to the sand but barely scraped him. It landed directly on Levy. Serling saw his friend decapitated, the sudden impact turning him into human paste.2 An absurd accident amid the chaos of one of the decisive battles of the Second World War. A meaningless sacrifice, an incident that seems like it belongs in Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. For Serling, it opened a doorway to a dimension of the imagination, a region in the middle ground between sight and shadow, the entry point into the twilight zone. 2.Death of the Monsters? THE ENTRANCE of the United States into World War II came at a time when, not unlike the plot of one of Universal Studio’s classics, the monsters died only to resuscitate and return. They could and did become icons of empire. A new kind of fandom for horror films appeared. This audience had been forged by large groups of mainstream fans of the golden age of the early thirties that played a crucial role in keeping the macabre alive when the studios showed little interest. The release of 1935’s Bride of Frankenstein showed every indication of being the last of the great Universal Studio horror films, and horror seemed out of style. After 1936, Universal went into receivership under the guidance of the powerful John Cheever Cowdin. His portfolio included Standard Capital, Ideal Chemical, and Curtiss-Wright, the largest supplier of airplanes and aviation-related war material for the American army at the end of World War II. Cowdin sat as president and member of the Board of Directors of Universal Studios during this entire period, while studio head and early Hollywood icon Carl Laemmle Sr. received a promotion that removed him from day-to-day operations, and Laemmle Jr.—responsible for ensuring the production of masterpieces like The Phantom of the Opera, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dracula, and both of James Whale’s Frankenstein pictures—received a pink slip. He retired into relatively wealthy obscurity by age thirty. Cowdin seems like a caricature of a mid-century American capitalist, owning more companies than he could pay attention to, distracted by his interest in polo, having his multiple marriages blessed aboard his yacht Surf, and getting himself voted one of the best-dressed men of his era by Esquire. Under his benign neglect, a new vision of filmmaking emerged at Universal that favored cost cutting and subject matter that suited Americans who understandably wanted to avoid thinking of themselves as victims of their own economic system.3 The 1936 Universal film My Man Godfrey provides a perfect example, featuring a story of a Boston Brahmin with the bluest of blood who decides to live in a “hobo camp” for a bit of slumming adventure. The hero marries thirties beauty Carole Lombard after saving her dad’s business and opens a night club that puts his homeless pals to work. It’s a plot more bizarre than any monster movie, a fantasy of an America free of class conflict, where money that appears out of nowhere sets everything to rights and romantic love quite literally seals the deal. Audiences loved it and so did the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which nominated the flick for six awards. Universal decided its future lay in big-budget romances, light-hearted musicals, and serials like Radio Patrol and Jungle Jim. The latter became a successful effort to plagiarize the Tarzan books and films while joining the rise of “jungle horror” in legitimizing allegedly primitive people’s needs of American patronage abroad. Horror from the crypt and the laboratory seemed dead in this new environment. The genre suffered further from years of a near glut of films at the box office, not all of them the classic monsters from Universal. In 1935, rival studios had given the world the Werewolf of London, The Raven, and the Mark of the Vampire, with Universal managing to sneak past the censors a year later, with some significant changes, a wildly outré sexual and psychological thriller entitled Dracula’s Daughter. The deluge of scary caused one alarmed writer for The New York Times to worry that morbid films embodied “the national state of mind.”4 He may have been right. The term horror fan had not yet become a common one. But these fans of darkness were out there and, more important, the children of the Depression wanted to meet the monsters their older brothers and sisters obsessed over. The year 1938 surprised the studios and started a new round of horror films, most much less creative than the first efforts but satisfying for the generation that would fight the Second World War. My Man Godfrey seemed from another world. 3.My Man Frankenstein THE CRAZE started in Beverly Hills when a single hard-up theater owner had the idea of trying to revive the success of horror enjoyed in the early thirties by showing Frankenstein, Dracula, and King Kong in a marathon triple showing. The response was a bit too positive, with police called to restrain the crowds. Universal started charging hefty rental fees for their marquee monsters, and larger venues on Wilshire made room for the incredibly raucous crowds that seemed almost desperate to see the films again. Most theaters dropped King Kong, or added the RKO property to another double feature, but Dracula and Frankenstein stayed together, a deeply twisted meet-cute. Soon the Blue Mouse Theatre in Seattle picked up the idea promising “A MAMMOTH HORROR SHOW!” The Seattle Daily Times on August 25, 1938, seemed proud, if a little tentative, that their city “kept pace with the success that has attended this weird mystery entertainment.”5 The Seattle paper mused that the double bill offered a good opportunity for what it called “jaded mystery fans.” But it’s clear that the crowds coming to see what motion picture trade papers dubbed “the horror boys” included more than an older jaded crowd. Anecdotes suggest that the return of Dracula and Frankenstein’s monster set off a wave of young children skiving out of school. Theaters like the Blue Mouse charged twenty-five cents for adults but just a dime for “children” (age undefined). The double bill moved east to Salt Lake City, where an incredible line, probably overestimated at five thousand people, waited to see the vampire and the animated pile of corpses that went by his maker’s name. The theater’s manager rushed to rent out extra space. The now infamous undead duo came to the Capitol Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, which offered “ten dollars to the lady that will volunteer to see it alone,” even though the enormous crowds suggested no real necessity for the promotional push. Ads in Spanish ran in Dallas that warned viewers that “Bela Lugosi represente a un hombre pavoroso que calmba su se con sangre humana.” In Montreal, a dry account of the phenomenon told viewers that the vampire and the “unhuman” monster of Frankenstein recalled some of the “old German films,” in other words the films of Weimar Germany—Caligari, Nosferatu, The Golem—that first cradled modern horror.6 “Can you take it?” asked an advertisement that ran in the Brooklyn Eagle when the delirious furor over the films made it to New York City during the Halloween season of 1938. The RKO Albee Theatre, just west of Fort Greene Park, dared and really threatened their customers with a double feature of “Bela Lugosi in Dracula” and “Frankenstein with Karloff.” The Rialto in Manhattan ran the films ten times a day to satisfy crowds through much of the autumn. J. Cheever Cowdin played a lot of polo and made much of his fortune in the munitions industry while his studio’s now very famous monsters packed Americans into movie houses. Monster fans were attempting, so claimed at least one commentator, to escape worries about a world of “war and dictators.” But accounting at least paid attention and Motion Picture Daily could announce that after “scanning its profit books” Universal Studios constructed “eerie sets” for the 1939 Son of Frankenstein. Universal’s new management made the most of the rage and urged theater owners in a trade paper ad to “Throw away the books! Forget all you Everknew [sic] about showmanship! Because horror is paying off again!”7 If monstrous nightmares rather than capitalist fairy tales made money, let them have their terrors. Meanwhile, Cowdin made only part of his enormous fortune at Universal. While he worked on his tan and drank cocktails on the Surf, he let middle management decide if they wanted to keep the old Universal Studios warehouse of monsters or embark on the new sensation for “chillers” that billed themselves as “psychological horror” in the wake of World War II. Armament sales increasingly occupied him, and the emergence of a new American military, preparing itself for global hegemony and a Cold War, beckoned with profits to be made. Curtiss-Wright survived a controversy that, in a rational economy, would have destroyed it forever. In 1943, an investigation revealed that high-ranking army officers who, as one claimed, had been “wined and dined” by the company, knowingly allowed defective engines to be sold to the U.S. Army Air Force. Army officers faced court martial, though the civilian contractors who bribed them faced no penalties whatsoever.8 The company itself endured, eventually getting into a peculiar and profitable combination of the oil industry intertwined with supplying parts for nuclear submarines that would become part of the American “nuclear triad” of apocalyptic weaponry delivered from bombers, from ground-based missiles, and by sea. Today, the company’s website touts its core values, including leadership, innovation, and, in a peculiar take on the idea of values, “winning.” If Cowdin’s dapper ghost went online right now, he might find some of his company’s current corporate-speak confusing and elliptical. Nevertheless, he certainly represented a twentieth-century American type who saw “winning” as a “core value.” The form success took didn’t matter much to him, whether delivering a goal-scoring swing of a polo mallet, producing films like House of Dracula, or making tens of millions of 1940s dollars in the Cold War arms race. By 1945 a broad cross section of Americans saw “winning” as an ethical value, even if they did not put it in exactly those terms. In an atmosphere of America’s growing optimism about itself, the monsters could be fun too. 4.Monster Mash “A NECROLOGY of the inmates of this macabre manse includes practically everyone in Universal’s vicious varsity,” wrote New York Times critic A. H. Weller of House of Frankenstein in early December 1944. Weller viewed the latest in the Universal monster series at the Rialto, the storied palace of moviegoing at the corner of Forty-Second and Broadway. He liked the flick, though he encouraged prospective viewers to “bring a tongue and cheek and an open mind.”9 While Rod Serling endured the horror of the Philippine campaign, Americans at home experienced a near-complete repurposing of the terrors born in the golden age of 1931 to 1935. Horror films during World War II self-consciously offered, as Weller described, “more chuckles than chills.” The studio that gave the country Frankenstein, Dracula, The Bride of Frankenstein, and The Invisible Man in the thirties began to decline by 1941, when German émigré Curt Siodmak scripted The Wolf Man, the first successful lycanthrope lope across foggy moors starring Lon Chaney Jr., the hangdog-faced only child of the man who terrified Americans in the twenties. Son of Chaney became a mainstay in horror for three decades without ever quite managing the octave of his father’s dark song. If you believe horror films are not about anything but sudden scares and unnerving situations, The Wolf Man appears to make your point. At a crucial junction in American history, the beginning of the clash between Japan and the United States for Pacific power, Americans flocked to see a fantasy about curses and gypsies and bogs with man-beasts in a contemporary Europe in which no one referenced or even seemed to know that there was a war on. Did the monster mash offer nothing but a safety valve, a place to take our anxiety, a place where horrors emerged red-fanged from the shadows only to dissipate as the credits rolled? The dark carnival succeeds because it breaks our temporal prison, allows us to enjoy some amnesia about the world. Popular culture allowed frightening world wars to seem anodyne. It encouraged people to forget the horror of their own lives. Plenty of real-world horror needed ignoring. In the first months after Larry Talbot found out that the autumn moon doomed him to shape-shifting, bad news about the newest global war rattled out of every newsreel moviegoers saw before the film; the headlines of the morning paper wearied them even before their day began. In the weeks following the December Pearl Harbor attack, Bataan and Singapore fell to Japan while German U-boats ravaged American shipping. In one of his famed fireside chats, FDR rather ominously evoked the miserable condition of the Continental Army at Valley Forge and made use of the famed Thomas Paine quote about times that “try men’s souls.” Under the direction of Roosevelt’s government, the National Association of Broadcasters forbade the use of the phrase now for some good news from the radio, as it highlighted the bleak situation.10 Universal Studios understood. Producers followed up Siodmak’s scruffy new monster with what became known as monster mash films (later inspiring Bobby Pickett’s 1962 hit single). The studio unleashed their whole catalog of monsters in an effort to keep American audiences entertained in the midst of war, pitting Frankenstein against the Wolf Man, throwing in Dracula for good measure, sometimes spoofing the monsters that had frightened the kids who, now in their late teens and early twenties, grinded slowly up the Italian peninsula, fought for every village in Nazi-controlled France, or landed on frighteningly fortified islands in the Pacific, jungles hived with determined enemies. The monster movies’ turn toward the silly and sensational didn’t represent an entirely new phenomenon in American filmmaking, far from it. The moviegoing public, and the studios themselves, had never taken “the cinema” as seriously as their European counterparts. Only amid the Great Depression, a time made of equal parts despair and rebellious impulse, did European directors like James Whale, Paul Leni, Karl Freund, and Edgar G. Ulmer successfully bring meditations on morbidity and fairy tales about death to American audiences uncertain about the myths they had been taught since the turn of the century. In the desperate and hungry thirties, only gangsters competed with monsters for America’s sympathy, both sticking it to a corrupt system, even if fated to be ground under by its wheels. But it’s impossible to overestimate American optimism, or at least American hubris. By the late thirties, the screwball romantic comedy proved the most popular genre, often featuring the lavish, fun-loving lifestyles of the wealthy. Director George Cukor’s Holiday (1938) featured Cary Grant turning cartwheels as he prepared to marry his wealthy fiancée (Katharine Hepburn). The moviegoing public loved a rags to riches story or, even better, a riches to even more riches story with nuptials as a lagniappe. The men who owned the movies by the late 1930s provide the best explanation for the values screened by popular films. The old joke that only organized crime and filmmaking are depression-proof proved half right after the collapse of the world banking system in 1929. Almost all the major studios went into receivership, staying afloat with funds from the banking houses that built American capitalism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Others went completely bust, their assets soaked up by brokerage firms with origins in the Gilded Age. Obviously, this does not mean that movie scripts suddenly issued forth from a cabal of capitalists in a smoke-filled room, all dressed like the top-hatted real estate mogul from Monopoly. But it would be naïve not to note that plenty of movie deals that made a small number of families rich did occur in gilded rooms filled with the actual smoke of cigars enjoyed after steak dinners while millions of Americans starved their way through the Great Depression. Of course, layers of artistic freedom, not to mention middle management, existed between the bosses’ values and what showed up on local screens. So what happened to the movie industry of the thirties couldn’t be called a conspiracy . . . except insofar as parting customers from their money requires premeditation and planning. The small coterie of powerful families that ran Wall Street did not micromanage studio production. They simply had no interest in underwriting an experimental, shocking, or even particularly interesting motion picture industry. Since the House of Morgan and the House of Rockefeller held the purse strings of Paramount, Warner Bros., Fox, and Universal, it’s not shocking that House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945) provided light entertainment rather than raising questions about the nature of American society in the tradition of horror in 1920s German expressionism and European avant-garde cinema more generally. But why did Americans want horror to begin with, even in its pallid 1940s form? How could a country so sure of itself have a place for monsters? The growth of an internal security state to police the boundaries benefitted from the movies as anesthetic. Monsters could be Marx’s “opiate of the people” and “the sigh of the oppressed,” for all the imperial state cared. But it could even be more useful. In the decade after the Second World War, plenty of horror films became unofficial propaganda, alien invasion flicks made with government blessing and even cooperation. But the empire did worry about the nightmares Americans might have about this new atomic age. An empire extending military and economic power abroad must quell dissent at home. A wide range of Americans received nasty attention from the national security state after World War II. Strikingly, many of the men who made the monsters became special targets. Horror could and did make Americans forget about the realities of the world, could defend Amity Island. But even in the early days of the Cold War, the chain saw could unleash its dissonant barrage on the false dream of America. Could you censor dark dreams? What about when the monsters wouldn’t behave? Thus begins the long history of what we know today as surveillance culture. 5.Dracula vs. the FBI BELA LUGOSI spoke before a Los Angeles crowd of over two thousand people in August of 1944.11 The Hungarian-American Council for Democracy (HACD) sponsored the mass rally to urge the Roosevelt administration to end immigration restrictions for Hungarian Jews and to pressure the collaborationist Nazi regime that controlled Lugosi’s homeland to protect those that remained. He had no way of knowing the effort did little good. The SS, with the direct aid of Hungarian fascists, had already deported nearly half a million Jews to death camps in Austria and Poland the previous month. Lugosi described the plight of Hungary’s Jews nearly a quarter of a century after he fled his native land to escape the White Terror that ensued after a right-wing government seized Budapest. His previous support for the communist regime of Belá Kun, who had briefly come to power in 1919 only to be quickly toppled after a disastrous war with Romania, placed Lugosi on the kill list of Admiral Miklós Horthy, who, for all intents and purposes, ruled from Budapest as head of a military junta. The elderly warlord still controlled Hungary in 1944, though his regime existed largely at Hitler’s sufferance. Hungarian forces aided the invasion of the Soviet Union, and members of the country’s large, fascist Arrow Cross Party actively participated in the Holocaust throughout eastern Europe. Born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in eastern Hungary, Lugosi became his stage name, an homage to his 1882 birthplace, Lugos (today Lugoj, Romania). He abandoned school at an early age but quickly rose to prominence in Hungary’s National Theatre. Although granted a deferment when the Great War came in 1914, he volunteered to fight for the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1915, he received his first war wound fighting against the forces of the Russian czar in what is now western Ukraine. A few months later, he would receive a second wound. Ironically, this time he had been fighting in the Carpathians, the treacherous, jagged mountain range that in the twentieth century became fully associated with vampire legends and Count Dracula himself. Lugosi left the army in 1916 having suffered a “mental collapse.” The precise cause of the incident remains unclear. We do know that Lugosi, in one of the rare moments he spoke about the Great War, described the experience of being buried alive in a trench beneath a mound of his comrade’s corpses as Russian forces clambered over him. After leaving the army, he returned to the theater and worked to create an actor’s union. Lugosi supported the goals of the communist regime and became especially vocal in his calls for the nationalization of the theater. He was well known enough to Horthy’s regime to flee to Vienna after Kun’s fall. Agents of the new government continued to pursue him. Lugosi worked his way to America in 1920, first aboard a merchant ship bound for New Orleans and then on to Ellis Island. During the Red Scare of the 1920s, with most eastern Europeans suspected of being communist revolutionaries (and Lugosi had, after all, been an actual communist revolutionary), becoming a naturalized citizen proved almost impossible. Lugosi did not become a citizen until 1931, the year that Dracula made him an international star. Lugosi’s involvement in the labor movement did not end after Dracula. He became, along with Boris Karloff, a lifelong supporter of the Screen Actors Guild. Lugosi served for several years on the advisory board. He also attempted to unionize his costars, as did Karloff, who handed out SAG applications in his heavy-browed Frankenstein makeup during the original film. Since Lugosi’s role in heavy makeup as Ygor in 1939’s Son of Frankenstein, he played a significant number of murderers and mad scientists for poverty-row studios, even appearing as the Big Bad in one of the era’s popular, but low-budget, serials, The Phantom Creeps. The effort to stay afloat financially as a freelancer in Hollywood, part of the personal experience that drove his labor activism, increasingly faltered as he sold his Tudor-style home in the Beachwood Canyon district of the Hollywood Hills and found himself appearing in small and silly roles even as tiny studios graffitied their posters with his name. In the serial The Phantom Creeps (1939), Lugosi played a scientist who, in a precursor to the Bond villain archetypes, creates various death rays, murderous gadgets, and a killer robot (the titular creeping phantom) that he hopes to sell to the highest bidder among the international market of warring powers. The serials, which introduced a generation of Saturday matinee-goers to “Commando Cody and the Rocket Men” or heroes they knew previously from radio and comics like “The Shadow” and the “Green Hornet,” can be enjoyed today for their peculiarity and vivid, if simple-minded, melodrama. But, amid playground dialogue and cliffhanger plotting, Lugosi must have suffered as he remembered his days as a rising star in Budapest. In 1942, Lugosi appeared in a propaganda/espionage/horror mash-up rushed into production soon after bombs fell on Pearl Harbor. Black Dragons, originally entitled The Yellow Menace, opened with what appears to be the claws of a dragon reaching across a map of the Pacific to threaten the American mainland. This is a peculiar reading of geography. Japan’s war aims included the seizure of American imperial holdings but not an invasion of the boundaries of the United States. Black Dragons tells a different story, and, given his political leanings, Lugosi likely appreciated the plot. The Black Dragon Society, a secret arm of the Japanese emperor, takes on the identities of major American industrialists with the help of a Nazi plastic surgeon (played by Lugosi). But the Black Dragons even betray their Nazi ally and imprison him since he’s the only one who knows of their sinister conspiracy. A convoluted plot point has Lugosi play both the original Nazi scientist who returns to kill the Black Dragons and a Japanese spy who himself receives plastic surgery so he can return to Germany with the Führer none the wiser. There’s not much of interest in the film aside from its context. Although something of an artifact of the Hollywood left, Black Dragons contains as much race-baiting as warnings about the possibly traitorous intentions of corporate America. Anti-Asian slurs are tossed around thoughtlessly in a film purportedly about dangers to democracy. Lugosi is the only thing worth watching in the film today as he drifts ominously through the scenes, the intensity of his eyes a hypnotic frightmare. After Lugosi’s years of exile on poverty row, many expected that Universal would ask the fading star to reprise his most famous role two years later in House of Dracula (1944). Instead, they picked John Carradine for what turned out to be a minor role for the titular monster. After World War II, Lugosi, like several of Hollywood’s B- and C-list actors, became popular in summertime stage productions. He would appear as Dracula in stage plays that ran in Denver, Colorado, or Reading, Pennsylvania. As Hoover’s investigation sputtered to a halt, the summer of ’48 found Lugosi playing a one-week engagement at the Norwich Theatre and Masonic Temple in New London, Connecticut. The year 1947 became the first since 1931 that Lugosi did not work on a film set. In 1948, Universal proffered him a role in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, though as the title of the film suggests, it’s a rather small one. Lugosi insisted to Hollywood Digest that his role in the film contained “no burlesque” and that “his trademark would be unblemished.” The film did rake it in for Universal at the box office. But not unlike the success of 1931’s Dracula, it did not lead to Lugosi being offered more significant work in the long term. Lugosi’s long struggle with alcohol and drug addiction are well known. He became one of the first American celebrities to speak openly, and very bravely, about this when he sought treatment. By the 1950s, as he worked less and less and in smaller and odder roles, he unfortunately became something of a joke in an industry with a notoriously short memory of its stars. But he never stopped working completely and this tells us something about how the American taste for horror had changed since the days when the “weird mystery” offered pleasure to a relatively small, mostly older, and mostly male group of pulp magazine aficionados. During the Second World War, Lugosi became the president of the Hungarian-American Council for Democracy, an organization largely focused on the ouster of Hungary’s decidedly undemocratic regime. During this same period, he wrote a series of articles for the leftist Hungarian journal Magyar Jövő, or “Hungarian Future,” that evoke the revolutionary ideals of 1919. Lugosi’s leftist activities during the period before the Los Angeles rally included appearing on a Brooklyn radio show called The Voice of Fighting Spain, which had its roots in the anti-fascist struggle in the Spanish Civil War and received its funding from the Communist Party front organization that called itself the Institute for International Democracy. Lugosi’s affiliations would have attracted some attention even in the midst of a war in which the United States counted the Soviet Union as one of its two major, and certainly its most powerful, allies. The Office of Strategic Services, transformed at the beginning of the Cold War into the Central Intelligence Agency, opened a file on Lugosi. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), the congressional power brokers fueling the post–World War II Red Scare and incidents such as the persecution of the Hollywood Ten, appointed a small group of operatives to keep an eye on him. They called themselves the Dracula council. They appear to have lost interest in Lugosi’s leftist sympathies given the much more pressing matter of winning a war against the Axis. In 1947 the combination of the National Security Act and the acceptance of the doctrine of “containment” acted as charters for the launch of America’s Cold War. In that year, a man few Americans wanted to take an interest in them turned a baleful eye on Lugosi. J. Edgar Hoover made his bones in the Bureau of Investigation, the FBI’s forerunner. In 1919, at age twenty-four, he headed the bureau’s General Intelligence Division, christened the Radical Division given Hoover’s interest in ferreting out real and perceived revolutionary parties in the United States. Hoover became convinced that the shadow of Trotsky loomed behind every labor organizer, that every one of the era’s large strikes presaged an American Petrograd. By the 1940s, the FBI essentially functioned as his personal police force and spy network. Agents assembled thick files on major and minor figures in entertainment, politics, and the arts who held the vaguest of liberal sympathies. Hoover’s interest in the former communist from Hungary with the thick Magyar accent seems entirely predictable. Hoover ordered the Los Angeles office to open an investigation into Lugosi, “concerning his activities.” This phrase, in Hoover-speak, meant that agents should pore over every aspect of the public and private life of their subject. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service also looked into the possibility of revoking his citizenship. Other emerging voices in horror and science fiction faced similar investigations for their left-wing views. Peter Lorre proved a special target because of his friendship with Bertolt Brecht, the German communist playwright who strongly supported a failed 1919 revolution in his country. Like Lugosi, Lorre came from Hungary, but before he fled Nazi terror, he starred as one of cinema’s first serial murderers in Fritz Lang’s M. Automatically becoming the heavy in films ranging from pitch-black noir dramas to Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon, he soon became a natural choice for horror films.12 Lorre earned Hoover’s ire after publicly supporting the Hollywood Ten, a group of left-leaning screenwriters singled out by Congress’s HUAC for refusing to cooperate with their investigation. Hoover launched Operation COMPIC (Communist Infiltration—Motion Picture Industry) while segregationist John E. Rankin of Mississippi lead the charge against Hollywood as “the greatest hotbed of subversive activities in the United States.” In response, Lorre joined a radio program effort called Hollywood Fights Back. Despite stars like Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball, and John Huston participating in the effort, smearing someone red had a chilling effect on their career. Vincent Price, whose star began to rise in Hollywood in 1945, had yet to become as deeply identified with horror films as he would after House of Wax (1953). Most did know the young, handsome actor’s left-leaning politics and willingness to talk openly about them. This attracted FBI attention, but the actor had leaned hard right in the thirties, when many Americans went to the opposite end of the political spectrum. Price said he came to his senses in 1938 after watching the gears of Hitler’s death machine begin to grind. Still, Price remained more circumspect than most in supporting liberal and anti-fascist efforts that had little or no ties to American communists. Several figures who continue to shape the American tradition of horror, fantasy, and science fiction received the FBI’s unwonted concern. Ray Bradbury, with his tales of an America perpetually facing a thing at the top of the stairs, had forty pages of material assembled by agents who suspected his then-genial liberalism hid communist sympathies.13 The report included the contention that “he has been described as being critical of the United States government.” In a memo, now available through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the FBI copied their colleagues at the CIA, violating the agencies’ proscription against surveillance and investigation of private American citizens. Large portions of Bradbury’s file are redacted, but what we can read makes clear that the FBI worried that the author planned to travel to Cuba and take part in a writer’s conference “whose [sic] goal of action is to obtain unity in the fight against anti-imperialism.” What interested the FBI in Bradbury to begin with, particularly given that his file admits “there is no evidence” he ever “joined the CP”? For the FBI, the idea that Bradbury suggested in The Martian Chronicles that humans came to the red planet as “despoilers and not developers” sounded a bit too much like a critique of imperial America, both in its frontier past and Cold War present. Much of the case rested on the word of a former communist turned government snitch named Martin K. Berkeley, who claimed that Bradbury supported the Screen Actors Guild because of sympathy for “its more pro-communist elements.” Berkeley insisted he heard Bradbury describe writers who caved to McCarthyism as “cowards” and that Bradbury’s stories “had been definitely slanted against the United States and its capitalistic system.” Indeed, the informant warned that science fiction itself “may be a lucrative field for the transmission of Communist ideologies.” Too many science fiction writers, he warned Bradbury’s investigators, shared pro-communist views with “a small number of scientists” who believed a war with the Soviet Union would be “threatening to the isolation (existence?) of the universe.”14 What other information did the FBI have on the prominent writer, the poet of dark carnivals? After a ten-year investigation of Bradbury, it seemed investigators uncovered one clear communist connection when an unnamed informant (likely Berkeley, again) claimed Bradbury planned to attend an “anti-imperialist” writers congress being held in Havana, Cuba. In fact, a Roy Bradbury, possibly the source of a misprint of Ray Bradbury’s name in his FBI file, had been invited to the gathering. After keeping tabs on Bradbury almost since the end of World War II, the FBI quietly dropped the case. Isaac Asimov also received Hoover’s attention. As Olive Beck has described in unpublished research on the topic, Asimov, who joined Robert A. Heinlein and Bradbury as leading writers of science fiction after World War II, faced a rather more sinister set of charges. A practicing scientist in the biochemistry department at Boston University, he came under scrutiny for possibly aiding the Soviet espionage networks that had ferreted out secrets of the A-bomb. The FBI long believed that an academic leaked scientific secrets to the Soviets, a figure they referred to as ROBPROF. The basis for the code name seems to have been Asimov’s own work as the author of I, Robot.15 The only information the FBI found that pointed to Asimov concerned a list compiled by the Communist Party USA (“The CPUSA underground,” a bureau memo ominously called the tiny organization) of Boston-area figures who might be “possibly amenable” to membership. Asimov remained under investigation for two years, even with no other evidence surfacing. While not as long under surveillance as other figures in the world of fantasy and horror, it’s notable that the FBI shadowed Asimov for espionage and high treason, a capital crime.16 But few in the world of horror and science fiction carried as strong a resume on the left as Lugosi. It did not help that the Hungarian Communist Party made significant gains in summer parliamentary elections, the major step in the country falling into Stalin’s grip and becoming part of the Warsaw Pact. Lugosi’s case had been dropped by the time of his death, and in fact, Hoover and the immigration authorities dropped the matter much more quickly than Bradbury’s, perhaps because of the latter’s growing fame and influence. Moreover, the investigation of Lugosi revealed nothing that did not already exist in the public record. No evidence emerged that Lugosi ever joined the CPUSA. His file would include his Magyar Jövő articles and the fact that he subscribed to a fund supporting labor leader Harry Bridges in a legal struggle to prevent the federal government from stripping him of his citizenship and deporting him. In line with the FBI’s desire to collect personal dirt on its subjects in case it needed to besmirch their reputation later, one of his agents included in his report that Lugosi appeared “intoxicated most of the time.”17 Dirty tricks are the companion of dirty wars. The need to keep track of Lugosi’s drinking habits along with his politics became a standard part of the bureau’s internal security apparatus. Former director James Comey has described, for example, “the darkest chapter” in the bureau’s history as the sending of a package to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964 that contained a set of recordings of his extramarital transgressions and a typed note urging him to kill himself within the month. Clearly, horror would have a role in an emerging national security state such as this one. But would it distract a populace restive under the reigns of the growing hegemony of the Pentagon, Hollywood, and industry? Or would it become a spectral light revealing that mad scientists had taken charge of the American experience? Horror was about to meet the bomb. 6.Terror Bombing ROBERT A. Lewis, copilot of the U.S. B-29 bomber the Enola Gay, kept a folder with him in the summer of 1945 labeled “letter to mom and dad.” In fact, it would become the logbook for a top-secret mission that the crew readied for on Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas held by the Japanese early in World War II. American forces seized it a few months before the Battle of Leyte Gulf, precisely because it offered an excellent launching site for the increasingly destructive American air raids. Lewis grew up in New Jersey and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A facility with electronics, and a preternaturally calm demeanor, led to his selection as part of a small group who tested the new B-29 Superfortress. In 1945, General Curtis LeMay chose Colonel Paul Tibbets to command the Enola Gay. Tibbets immediately chose Lewis as his copilot. They would drop the first atomic weapon in history on the city of Hiroshima. The USAF chose the city since it was spared conventional bombing runs for most of the war. This allowed America to demonstrate the full power of these weapons. Apologists for the bomb later called Hiroshima the site of a major military base. There was a base near the city. But the blast killed over one hundred thousand civilians, along with a contingent of Korean prisoners forced into slave labor after the Japanese conquest of their country and some American POWs. Lewis wrote an unofficial account of what happened in August of ’45 on the back of army department action report forms. He stenciled a sketch of the mushroom cloud and compared the dropping of the superweapon to a Buck Rogers adventure. “We had expected something fierce,” he admitted, but also wrote, “My God what have we done?” He ruminated over how many Japanese the new superweapon killed.18 We don’t know whether Lewis felt guilt over his bit part in the inauguration of the atomic age. In some ways, his comments reflected all the confusion, anxiety, and excitement Americans experienced in 1945. They were like Buck Rogers, the popular movie serial hero who used high-tech weapons to fight malevolent enemies. But should they be? What had they done? How many did we kill? Do we want to know? Most Americans didn’t know the answers to these questions, and it likely wouldn’t have mattered much if they tried to find out. The U.S. government used its power to ensure that the public would not care how many we killed. Many of the war films made while combat continued assured audiences that the Japanese people suffered little, if at all, from the air campaigns conducted since 1942 against the Japanese home islands that LeMay proudly described as “terror bombing.” In the film Bombardier (1943), a young pilot briefly has a crisis of conscience over the death of civilians but is assured by his commander, and in a letter from his mom, that a new target site would make “munitions” the only victim of the bombing campaign. The ownership of major studios by corporate moguls, many of whom had diverse streams of revenue generated by the war, ensured more than the transformation of horror films into escapist fantasies. The tendency for financial and political elites to ally assured a cozy relationship between the studios and the American government. In the summer of 1942, the Office of War Information created a special branch to ensure that films would “enhance understanding of the war at home and abroad” and act as “liaison with the press, radio, and the motion pictures.” This language makes what came to be known as the Bureau of Motion Pictures sound like a benign public relations agency. In theory, this did not give the War Department authority to censor films. In reality, military censors insisted on seeing and editing any scripts that might portray, for example, a human side to Japanese soldiers or civilians. In film after film, Japanese pilots are shown bombing and strafing civilians, an inhuman tactic they did, in fact, employ. However, in these same films American pilots are always hitting “military targets” with utter precision. There’s certainly not a word said about “terror bombing.”19 In an animated feature you aren’t likely to see appear on the Disney+ channel any time soon, the House of Mouse released Victory Through Air Power (1943). Viewers are treated to exploding military compounds and munitions without the slightest suggestion that human beings are killed in these raids. Frank Capra’s Know Your Enemy: Japan seems out of step with much of his Why We Fight series, which attempted to blend a set of universal values with American patriotism. The war ended before the film gained wide distribution among the troops. But its content gives us a fair representation of American propaganda efforts. The film insisted that Japanese soldiers had been mentally shaped by the Bushido code to believe that “treachery, brutality, rape and torture” are justified. Meanwhile, the film celebrated the killing of twenty thousand Japanese at Iwo Jima and described the horrific battle of Okinawa as a triumphant moment when American forces “trapped and destroyed 100,000.” At a time when hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians died in LeMay’s “terror” campaign, the film insisted that “the nasty gangsters” in the “factories and war plants” were the only victims of the constant air raids.20 These propaganda efforts had real-world effects not only for Japanese civilians but also for Americans of Japanese descent. A little over two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR issued Executive Order 9066, which allowed the U.S. military wide latitude to exclude anyone deemed a security risk from “military areas.” Although the order did not specifically mention Japanese Americans or insist on the building of detention camps, it came with a wink and a nod, and the commanders across the country understood its meaning. The entire state of California became a “military area,” and Japanese Americans were not allowed in the state unless detained in an internment camp. The U.S. government imprisoned 127,000 men, women, and children of Japanese descent during World War II. Newspaper editorials, including one in the Los Angeles Times, justified their imprisonment by describing the war in the Pacific as “a war with their race.” California Congressional Representative Leland Ford pulled no punches in insisting that all Japanese should be placed in “concentration camps,” a phrase in common use for the internment camps, even though much current discussion, journalism, and even historical writing uses the term relocation camps.21 The degree of racial hatred most white Americans felt toward the Japanese makes it hard to discern whether few if any felt any qualms about the genocidal air campaign waged on the Pacific rival’s homeland. The war on the ground seemed a struggle to match, and sometimes overmatch, the Japanese atrocities against soldiers and civilians. Acclaimed author Paul Fussell, a combat veteran of World War II, admits that American servicemen enjoyed using Japanese prisoners for target practice and “felt intense satisfaction when watching them twist and writhe when set on fire by the napalm of the flame thrower.” In a grotesquerie that would surface in the American horror tradition in the 1960s, soldiers and marines made trophies of Japanese skulls. This may appear to the reader as a bizarre rumor or, at the very least, uncommon. In fact, the May 22, 1944, issue of Life magazine contains a picture of twenty-year-old Natalie Nickerson writing a thank-you note to her boyfriend for the skull he mailed her, a macabre gift the photograph shows her gazing at lovingly.22 Terror bomber Curtis LeMay took command of the Pacific air campaign in February of 1945 and rejected even the concept of precision bombing. The tough-talking LeMay, later the model for General Jack D. Ripper in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, believed the use of a relatively new incendiary weapon called napalm—but evocatively referred to by the air crews on Tinian as hell-jelly—would reduce Japan’s wooden cities and the people who lived in them to ash. He was right. Two Harvard chemistry professors, Louis Fieser and E. B. Hershberg, developed what would become the basic formula on Valentine’s Day, 1942. They chose the Fourth of July to test the new weapon on a Harvard University football field, hoping sedate Cambridge would assume the work of rowdy undergraduates when the explosive charges ignited. What they created was much worse than an incendiary bomb. The new weapon ignited into a viscous jelly that burned more slowly than gasoline—whether it adhered to a structure or human flesh. In March of 1945, LeMay unleashed 325 bombers armed with napalm on Tokyo, burning much of the city and killing 89,000 people, the overwhelming majority women, the elderly, children, and babies. The center of the blasts extruded such incredible temperatures that the city’s canals boiled. The work of the air corps, designated XXI Bomber Command, had only begun. Using up to 600 aircraft in raid after raid, almost all Japan’s major cities burned in the months to come. The death toll reached 260,000 and, with the island on fire, 13 million became homeless. An uncountable number suffered lifelong pain from disfiguring burns.23 Taken together, LeMay’s “terror bombings” created a larger mound of corpses than the two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But, after the immediate elation over the war’s end, the bomb became a shadow cast across everything Americans believed about themselves. Nancy Arnot Harjan, one of Studs Terkel’s interviewees for his oral history project The Good War, experienced World War II as a teenager who believed above all that “the country was innocent,” that the GIs liberating Paris “were all knights in shining armor, saving humanity.”24 But painful questions began to surface. Harjan remembered about “a week or two” of elation stalked by disturbing questions. Her thoughts may not have been representative of the official culture of victory. But it shows Americans could express doubts about their government’s use of such a weapon, perhaps pondering and refining their misgivings for decades, and speak of them thoughtfully when a well-known writer like Terkel asked about how it felt to be American in the summer of ’45: This wonderful new bomb had ended it all . . . Seventy thousand or a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand civilians? It came as a shock after seeing so many war movies with the Japanese portrayed as militaristic brutes. To see women, children, and old innocent civilians brutally burned . . . What was it all about? In truth, most Americans expressed unease about the use of the bomb, wondering at least to themselves, “What was it all about?” They also quickly accepted it as part of a Faustian bargain that ensured both the political dominance of the United States and the peculiar kind of pleasure in life a cross section of Americans had come to enjoy during the war. One member of the U.S. Merchant Marine, Frank Keegan, only remembered relief upon hearing news of Truman’s decision, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan’s surrender. Keegan said to himself, “Nice goin’, Harry. You did it to ’em, kid. That’s how guiltless I was.” He could recall later, matter-of-factly if not entirely pleased with his attitude, “He saved our lives, he terminated the goddamn thing.”25 In his own reflections about the decision to use the bomb, Fussell reminded us that frontline troops in modern wars live with a primal certainty of either death or catastrophic wounds. The news of the end of war, whatever form the denouement takes, comes to them with a wave of feeling that can’t be described as relief or celebration. They essentially feel that a death sentence has been lifted, that someone in authority made a call in the final seconds and granted them a pardon.26 But other Americans experienced war’s end with a triumphalism of a type that had been building since the news from various fronts had become increasingly positive. One of Terkel’s interviewees remembered that while the “the rest of the world came out bruised and scarred” by the global conflagration, many Americans who had not been in a branch of the service, or had not lost family members, discovered “new gratifications they’d never known in their lives. Mass travel, mass vacations, everything else came out of it.” This may have been true of many of those in uniform as well. Unlike the armies of the rest of the globe, a majority of enlistees in the armed forces served behind the lines and a majority of those never left the States.27 Many Americans entered 1945 convinced their country had swept the world of its shadows. Roosevelt and then Truman sought to win the war both “thoroughly” and “fast,” while doing so “at the lowest possible cost” to Americans. That’s certainly an admirable goal, arguably a moral imperative. And yet, a massive loss of life among enemies and allies revealed the secret of the administration’s nightmare math. While tens of millions died on home fronts across the globe, saving gasoline and growing Victory gardens counted as “sacrifice” for Americans. Even Joseph Stalin, better known for his brutality than perspicacity, could blandly note that compared to his country of burning rubble and twenty-one million corpses, “things are not that bad in the United States.”28 Things weren’t so bad. And yet, historian Tom Engelhardt has referred to the postwar era as the time of “the Great Fear” during which “backyard barbeques” took place in “an anxiety-ridden garrison state” where abundance competed with horror. What could Americans have been afraid of? As the world’s only atomic power, the United States could have withdrawn back into its continental borders. It could have concentrated on being a constitutional republic that used its vast resources to build an equitable society that benefitted its citizens from cradle to grave. Indeed, in the first years after World War II, Harry Truman faced a populace eager to demobilize. They did not want to build a military machine, having seen what government intervention in the economy could do if it set itself to projects responsive to the needs of the people. Roosevelt’s promised freedoms for which we fought seemed within reach . . . freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and even freedom from fear. But the thermal flash of the atom bomb left these promises in ruin. A professional class of militarists became intertwined with a war economy that kept the country on a war footing and in fact increased military expenditures. By 1950, the United States footed the majority of the French bill for maintaining their control of East Asia. Horror films now seemed less about fear and more about the yuks, a way to take the edge off, especially with Abbott and Costello meeting up with the monsters of contemporary America’s youth for gags. Older horror seemed a little too subversive, at times with a sexual subtext that challenged the cult of breadwinner, wife, and children that would emerge in the American middle class after 1945. Slapstick could not properly channel America’s Cold War uncertainties. Amity Island had become a truly global power, with plenty of anxiety building under the era’s gleaming sunshine. Someone who’d seen the face of American power abroad would rev the chain saw long before Tobe Hooper told his tale of a Texas massacre. 7.Void, Despair, Torment ROD SERLING joined hundreds of thousands of American veterans returning from Europe and the Pacific to find a much different country from the one that greeted their fathers and grandfathers in 1919. White veterans received the full benefit of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, better known as the G.I. Bill, which provided money for a college education and help with securing a thirty-year mortgage on a home they could, at least theoretically, claim as their own. The possibility of buying a home with such a generous loan period was first made available to many Americans with the Fair Housing Act of the New Deal era. Low-interest loans also allowed the purchases of businesses and farms. But Serling could not settle into this shockingly comfortable niche in American society. He worried that his generation might sell their own freedoms for middle-class prosperity, or simply become lost in the narcissism that the expanding American economy encouraged. Discharged in 1946, he certainly benefitted from the best of these changes. The G.I. Bill allowed him to join hundreds of thousands of other young white men in attending college, once the privilege of the upper middle class or the tiny numbers able to gain scholarships. He enrolled immediately at Antioch College in Ohio, studied literature and creative writing, and managed to sell his first teleplay to NBC while matriculating. He graduated in 1950, married his college sweetheart, Carolyn Kramer, and walked into the bright future offered to privileged citizens of a superpower. Black veterans faced a different reality. Lynching remained a feature of American life, publicly celebrated by the mobs themselves if rarely discussed in the broader culture. Isaac Woodard, on his return from service where he had been decorated for bravery under fire in New Guinea, met just such a fate on February 12, 1946. Riding a Greyhound home to see his family, a white bus driver stopped in Batesburg, South Carolina, to complain to authorities that Woodard had asked for a bathroom stop. A group of police beat Woodard severely and the local sheriff gouged out Woodward’s eyes with a nightstick. Federal attention led to the sherriff’s trial but also a quick acquittal by an all-white jury. While the situation was particularly egregious in the American South, every American region had laws, de facto and de jure, that prevented Black men and women from reaping the G.I. Bill’s benefits. These veterans could, in theory, receive money for college, but most colleges in the United States remained whites only. Under the law, Black veterans could lay claim to home and business loans, but banks could and did refuse them without fear of legal repercussions. So-called covenant neighborhoods collaborated with real estate firms and local politicians to ensure no Black families moved into the new suburbs. Whites who wanted to live in segregated neighborhoods had the support of the Federal Housing Administration. The U.S. government, in a practice known as redlining, made fluid funds available to contractors who agreed to build suburbs that excluded African Americans.29 World War II looked in some ways like the beginning of a new phase in the freedom struggle for African Americans. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled against state practices that suppressed, or simply denied, Black women and men the right to vote. Veterans of World War II like Medgar Evers brought home from the war a determination to make America live up to its claims of being a bastion of democracy and freedom. During the war itself, A. Philip Randolph, an African American socialist and labor union leader, held a huge rally in Madison Square Garden to protest the treatment of Black soldiers. He would later be the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. But, when World War II ended, it would be another twenty years before the 1965 Voting Rights Act laid the groundwork for African American political autonomy. It’s also true that, outside of a general sense that something happened with segregation during the civil rights movements, even most college-educated whites have a limited grasp of the role of thousands of organizers whose experience had been shaped by World War II and their mistreatment by an American army allegedly fighting fascism. We know about Medgar Evers because he was murdered in his own driveway. James Baldwin thought that World War II meant something very different to African Americans than to whites. “A certain hope died,” he wrote, both because of the treatment even Black veterans received and how little the world changed for all Black people in 1945. In fact, the twin shadows of the Holocaust and Hiroshima seemed a deadly warning to Baldwin, a reminder of what white people would do while claiming to be both Christian and civilized. Baldwin wrote in the evocatively titled The Fire Next Time that “the threat of universal extinction” had entered the world. Wasn’t the bomb part of the logic of white supremacy, an iron logic of nihilism that had created “this void, this despair, this torment” felt all over the world from “the streets of Stockholm” to the “sidewalks of Harlem”? Terror at what the world had become haunted millions of Americans. The prosperity and eerie optimism of postwar America reached only a large minority of its white citizens. The long period of economic growth, more than a quarter of a century after 1945, came in fits and starts for many families. The larger paychecks many workers began to see did not keep pace with prices. Companies like General Motors and U.S. Steel made tens of millions in profits while refusing Truman’s admonitions to ward off strikes with tiny wage increases. Meanwhile, a Republican-controlled Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which struck an enormous blow to labor unions, one from which they arguably never recovered. Among other restrictive provisions, the act outlawed unions among supervisors and foremen, effectively severing a large part of the new white-collar workforce from membership in, and sympathy with, organized labor. The emerging Cold War with the Soviet Union ensured that American foreign policy poisoned discussions about worker’s rights. Republican leaders in Congress insisted on widespread communist infiltration in organized labor and used anti-communist rhetoric to frighten suburban voters who unreasonably connected rising prices and wage slumps with strikes rather than with the powerful corporations that kept wages low and prices high. The attitude of the United States toward its recent enemies, and its recent friends, seems shocking, but it followed the economic logic of imperial power. It’s difficult, nearly impossible, to imagine a continuing partnership between the United States and the Soviet Union, despite the warmth of the relationship through the thirties and the alliance of the war years. Truman and Stalin didn’t share much in terms of either politics or background. But both did hold a morally blinkered view of the postwar world. 8.Cold Warriors . . . in Space!! MOST AMERICANS, now and at the time, do not grasp how the Soviet Union interpreted the United States’ embrace of Germany after 1945. The Truman administration’s quick willingness to welcome Germany back into the family of nations, at least American-controlled West Germany, which had received a free market makeover, seemed an astonishing move. Over the next several decades, West Germany became a deadly forward base from which to project nuclear missiles. Medium-range missiles aimed directly at the Soviet heartland remained frightening portents into the 1980s, as much to the western Europeans being “protected” by them as to the Russians. Anti-communism perhaps made this decision at least as rational, or rather no more irrational, than Stalin’s insistence that the Warsaw Pact nations provide the Soviet Union with “buffer states.” But Operation Paperclip, though little known at the time, proved one of the more shocking decisions by the emerging American national security state. This initiative brought over 1,600 Nazi scientists to the United States, cleared them of all war crimes, and set them to work developing the basis for delivery systems of nuclear weapons. This ethically purblind decision transformed the global balance of power. It’s difficult to imagine that the United States would have charged so far ahead of the Soviet Union in the arms race without the help of Wernher von Braun, a fact admitted by a number of NASA scientists from that era. Von Braun had joined the Nazi Party when Hitler came to power, and he rose through the ranks of the SS to become a major. In his early thirties he’d been given the title of professor, a particular honorific in German, by Hitler himself. During the war, he led the V-2 rocket building program, which employed slave labor from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Victims who survived the camp have testified that von Braun selected workers personally. He even handpicked prisoners for torture, seemingly for no purpose other than sadistic pleasure. At the end of the war, von Braun claimed he wanted to surrender to the Americans rather than the Soviets. The Americans would make the best captors, he asserted, because “they believed in the Bible.”30 By 1948, the CIA went even further in enlisting former Nazis, including members of the Waffen-SS who had played a central role in the Holocaust and related war crimes. A few such figures provided alleged intelligence about Soviet activities in eastern Europe that facilitated the move toward the Cold War. A retired CIA agent later admitted that this provided the American security establishment with the “Russian boogeyman junk” that Truman’s national security state loved rather than a meaningful picture of geopolitics.31 The American public might have been even more shocked to learn that the CIA worked closely with Nazi collaborators in the Soviet Union itself after 1946. Not only had many of these groups aided in the German invasion of the Soviet Union but they also had, by the agency’s own admission, “been linked to Nazi atrocities on the eastern front.” The mass murder of Poles, Jews, Red Army POWs, and communists represented this “link.” In the fall of 1949, the CIA parachuted guerilla squads of war criminals back into Ukraine in what became known as Operation Nightingale. Although Russian special forces quickly annihilated these cells, the reader should imagine the American reaction to Soviet-sponsored guerrillas dropped into, say, Nebraska to take lives, destroy critical infrastructure, and generally wreak havoc.32 Perhaps Americans would not have been appalled by their government. Mainstream white America became convinced that their pastel middle-class dreams could turn Marxist red, so much so that even the worst crimes of the Nazis faded for a time out of American memory. The famous, mostly infamous, General George S. Patton, whose failures and inconsistent performance as a military thinker have been overshadowed by legend and the 1970 film, provides an interesting case study in American attitudes. After touring the Ohrdruf death camp with Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, Patton wrote that the victims appeared to him to be “a subhuman species without any of the cultural or social refinements of the time.” Patton had no sympathy for the dead, using his celebrity to insist the United States immediately rearm the Nazis and launch a preemptive offensive against the Soviet Union.33 Historians spill gallons of ink over the origins of the Cold War. There’s no single answer to why the United States and the Soviet Union, former allies against the Axis, turned on one another so quickly. Numerous commentators have suggested that both great powers needed the Cold War. Stalin and his successors, with an occasional notable exception, could set aside hopes for a worldwide revolution and settle into what Noam Chomsky described as the dominance of “a military-bureaucratic elite” over Soviet foreign affairs. For the United States, the Bolshevik threat gave legitimacy to the new, expansionist American foreign policy and a highly militarized economy. However one feels about the nuances of the debate, it’s impossible to chalk it up to Soviet aggression. Communist revolutionaries around the globe—from Vietnam to Ghana and Greece—found the Soviets decidedly drowsy on the matter of proletarian revolution. While convinced of Moscow’s influence everywhere, Americans lived in ignorance of the steps their government took to ratchet up tensions between the two powers. No one wanted to think much about foreign policy after V-J Day, and when told a new enemy had appeared, only a small number questioned the state’s assurances that “the American way of life” faced an implacable foe or had any idea of a longer history that helped explain Soviet suspicion. The relationship soured in 1917. The United States invaded Russia at the end of the First World War, largely in support of the British effort to prevent Lenin’s communist revolution from succeeding. A thaw in relations came in the 1930s and many Americans admired the undeniable economic miracle taking place in the Soviet Union as socialism sent Russia’s essentially medieval economy barreling into the twentieth century.34 A darker picture emerged for those who paid the closest attention. Increasingly, even American leftists grew nervous about the emergence of Stalin as he consolidated the Soviet Union into a dictatorship, repressed dissent at home, made small and devious land grabs in the Baltics, and, ironically, gave up on precisely what the Anglo-American right so deeply feared: the spread of an international worker’s revolution around the globe. Instead, Stalin insisted on a theory he called “socialism in one country,” an idea that confronted Marxist dissidents, or anyone who actually read Marx, with a bizarre formulation. Stalin gave half-hearted support to the fight against fascism in Spain and no attention at all to the emerging communist revolution in China. Meanwhile, he murdered his fellow communists in enormous numbers and even sent his dreaded secret police, the NKVD, to assassinate left-wing dissidents from Stalinism around the globe. The United States entered a cold war with Stalin’s Russia, despite having little to fear from the wounded giant. Uninterested in spreading Lenin’s revolution and leading a country decimated by a world war that killed nearly twenty-seven million Soviet soldiers and civilians, Stalin spent the remaining years of his life (d. 1953) watching American westerns, eating enormous meals with his flunkies, and ensuring he remained in power. The Soviet Union did have cause to worry about America’s space program. By the late forties, von Braun worked on rocketry for the U.S. military and converted to evangelical Christianity. Transferred to NASA on its founding in 1958, he played an integral role in the development of the launch vehicle for the Apollo program. His ambition grew, seeing rocketry as a path to the exploration of Mars. By 1960, von Braun received enough adulation for his work in the United States and Britain that a biopic appeared entitled I Aim at the Stars. Comedian Mort Sahl suggested that But Sometimes I Hit London would make a fine subtitle. In fact, von Braun dreamed not only of Mars but also of an orbital space platform that could rain down destruction on the Soviets from the skies.35 The reality was that the United States, a superpower with global reach, defined the Soviet Union, a regional power with limited ambitions, as a mortal enemy. Americans became fearful, uncertain, and anxious in an age of increasing abundance, indeed in a society that had the largest and most prosperous middle class in the history of the world. It also became a society wracked by anxiety, over the bomb, over change, over fear of the Soviets, even over the idea that they belonged to a generation that seemed so stable and secure in relation to that of their parents. Wouldn’t it all be taken away? 9.Noon on Doomsday MILLIONS OF men and women who had seen the worst of World War II were not ready for the American empire’s slugfest with another enemy. Rod Serling, for example, brooded over what he’d seen in the Pacific at a time when discussion of postwar trauma, both physical and mental, had no place in American society. Discussion of the wounded, including the psychologically wounded, veteran remained verboten in American culture after the first months of peace. Indeed, popular magazines such as Ladies’ Home Journal and Life ran articles directed at soldiers’ wives, suggesting that their homebound husbands likely needed “a few weeks” (!) to adjust to the civilian experience.36 One of Serling’s first successes in television revealed his growing social conscience. His 1956 script Patterns became a huge hit for NBC’s Kraft Television Theatre. A boardroom drama that placed big business maleficence and cultural conformity in its crosshairs, Serling’s film tapped into a widespread American fear of corporate life revealed in the success of novels like The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and Revolutionary Road. Patterns aired twice due to its popularity and a film would be produced from it. Serling seemingly had found a way to write about the dangers of fascism in his own country without being called a communist. Indeed, he could do it and be highly successful all at once. Or so he thought. Serling, like many whites, found himself shocked out of his complacency toward the treatment of Black Americans by the vicious murder of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till. In August of 1955, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam beat, mutilated, and shot Till, dumping his body in the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. They believed the young child had “whistled” at Carolyn Bryant, Bryant’s wife. Less than a month after Till’s murder, an all-white jury found the accused not guilty. Carolyn Bryant claimed Till not only whistled at her but grabbed her around the waist. Decades later, Bryant admitted she’d lied about the entire story. Black death has meant very little to a country steeped in white supremacy.37 Till’s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, sent the young boy to live with his grandparents in the Mississippi Delta because she believed it safer than her southside Chicago neighborhood. After his death, she insisted on an open casket funeral, revealing the torture inflicted on his body. Major magazines and newspapers carried the story, and while many treated it as a singular incident, at least some used it to tell the wider history of ongoing violence against African Americans. Moved to anger by the racist violence, Serling attempted to reimagine the tale in a teleplay he called Noon on Doomsday, alternatively titled A Town Has Turned to Dust. However, fear of offending the American public caused corporate sponsors to demand radical changes to the script, a somewhat odd decision since they allowed Patterns to mock the very corporate environment they now sought to protect. White supremacy, and any challenges to it, clearly remained the hill the country’s ruling class would die on. The changes to Noon on Doomsday made it unrecognizable as a comment on the Till lynching. CBS insisted that the murdered character have a Mexican background rather than being African American. Also, and at the network’s insistence, hints of advances toward a white woman as the cause of the killing were dropped. To completely erase any political commentary, studio executives moved the setting out of Mississippi and the contemporary period and into a generic “Old West” setting. Disgusted, Serling watched as a network beholden to advertisers reduced his clarion call for racial justice to little more than a police procedural with an excruciatingly vague message about tolerance. Serling never forgot his anger over what he considered one of his more important works. In what was supposed to be a promotional interview for a new anthology series helmed by Serling, network executives gritted their teeth as he barked at Mike Wallace that it was “criminal” that television execs simply refused to allow writers to explore “social evils.” His new show, he wrote in TV Guide, “probes into the dimension of imagination but with a concern for taste and for an adult audience too long assumed to have IQs in negative figures.” 10.What the Martian Said THE PILOT for The Twilight Zone aired on October 2, 1959. Serling wrote more than ninety scripts for a series that ran 156 episodes. It became the first show on television to imagine fascism coming to America, to challenge the red baiting woven into the culture after World War II, to question how the Japanese were stereotyped after Pearl Harbor, and indeed the first to show the mushroom cloud and wonder about the morality of atomic weapons. But, as Serling once noted, you can get away with anything “if a Martian says it,” or even if you throw a flying saucer or two into the story. Serling used alien invasions and nightmare scenarios to ask hard questions of an America used to horror from the stars shaping how they understood the terror of the real world. An expert on the science fiction and the politics of postwar America, Steffen Hantke, described “the amalgamation of science fiction with the horror film” in these years. This new way of thinking about monsters would attempt a marriage, doomed to divorce, between the fifties’ fascination with the American empire creating “the World of Tomorrow” and the dystopian realities the tomorrow being built for Americans promised.38 The beginnings of this great divorce, and the creation of what James Cameron has called “the interzone” that links horror and science fiction, appears in the bizarre celebrations of predatory American conceptions of space spearheaded by none other than Walt Disney and former SS officer Wernher von Braun. Their collaboration, made even eerier by Disney’s flirtation with the German American Bund (the American fascist movement) in the 1930s, intertwined with the growing fascination with manifest destiny in space in America’s emerging right wing. Disneyland opened in the summer of 1955 and visitors could ease into the diverse hypersensory worlds of Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorowland by entering through Main Street, U.S.A., the world of the American small town. Tomorrowland’s vision of space conquered and sanitized already played out for viewers of Disneyland, a TV anthology series that mixed animation with iconic, and revised, stories of American history. Disney brought in von Braun to showcase the future. Two episodes, “Man in Space” and “Man and the Moon,” feature the former SS officer explaining in his thick East Prussian accent that America would go beyond the moon and someday reach Mars itself. The man who could get a call through to Hitler any hour of the day found in the United States his instrument for his quest to “aim at the stars.” The Stars and Stripes would fly over Tomorrowland, literally and metaphorically. Hungarian-born director George Pal attempted something similar with his flop Conquest of Space (1955). Drawing in part on von Braun’s vision of the American future, specifically his 1952 book, The Mars Project, the film fell flat for most audiences. Pal had been associated with two classics, When Worlds Collide (1951) and an American reimagination of The War of the Worlds (1953). Both offered viewers differing visions of conquest and space, though in each of these classics old-fashioned military power and triage eugenics are the ultimate savior. Conquest of Space, despite a title that seemed to promise lasers massacring whatever indigenous extraterrestrials America might meet out in the black, caused viewers to leave the theater disappointed. Although now and again scientifically accurate, audiences seemed to feel that Pal had produced a western with no native peoples to kill. Aim at the stars, sure. But sometimes can’t we hit Moscow? 11.Shelter from the Midnight Sun ROD SERLING’S daughter Anne remembers her father as kind, funny, given to pranks, and doing his best to ensure that she did not have a “Hollywood dad.” She also recalls that he woke up screaming and when, terrified, she asked what was wrong, he simply said, “I dreamed Japanese soldiers were trying to kill me,” and gently told her to go back to bed. World War II and its legacy appeared again and again in The Twilight Zone, often very directly. The treatment of Japanese Americans and the lingering scars of war have seldom been more thoughtfully explored than in his scripts for season one’s “The Purple Testament” and season three’s “A Quality of Mercy.” Both draw heavily on Serling’s efforts to make peace with his combat experience. Both stories are set in the Philippines during the closing days of the war. “The Purple Testament” creates a supernatural aura for the trauma of battle itself in the story of a lieutenant who can see which of his men will die in combat by looking into their faces. “A Quality of Mercy” enters completely unexplored territory, featuring a gung ho lieutenant, eager to kill the enemy since he arrived in the Pacific just as the conflict was winding down. Taking over a war-weary platoon, he wants to launch a frontal attack on a cave filled with a small number of wounded Japanese soldiers, a pointless sally mounted over the protests of his sergeant. But before the deadly assault can commence, the bloodthirsty young officer finds himself mysteriously transformed into a member of the Japanese Imperial Army about to slaughter American soldiers in the same situation. He awakens from his tour of duty in the twilight zone to hear his sergeant tell him “a big bomb” has been dropped in Hiroshima and HQ has ordered that the platoon hold its position. Serling told his most poignant, and most controversial, tale of war in what became the final season of The Twilight Zone. In “The Encounter,” Fenton, an angry, severely traumatized, and alcoholic veteran of the Pacific, meets a Japanese American seeking work. Fenton offers to give him a job helping clean out his attic, an accidental ramshackle museum of mementos and souvenirs of the Pacific war including a samurai sword taken from the dead hands of an enemy that reads, “The Sword Will Avenge Me.” George Takei, soon famous as Star Trek’s Mr. Sulu, starred as one of the two protagonists, Arthur Takamori, who endures Fenton’s racist comments as the old souvenirs of war that clutter the attic begin to sizzle with a dire supernatural energy. The episode isn’t one of the classics of the series and some of the plot twists undercut the political comment. Still, it explored the idea of a World War II veteran suffering from guilt and trauma, a notion that has found little purchase in pop culture portrayals of that not-so-good war even today. Adding power to the story, Takei himself had been imprisoned in detention camps in California and Arkansas as a child under Roosevelt’s Order 9066. Perhaps Serling’s engagement with the bomb made for some of his most important efforts to use horror as social criticism. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki inaugurated an explosive and ominous end to several decades of unending warfare that grew out of the First World War. Historians today, looking at the period of 1914 to 1945, urge us to see it as a “thirty years’ war” to better understand the spasm of violence that eviscerated the world. But did the twin mushroom clouds really end the vile era? Staring back from our current vantage point, we see a century of wreckage and ruin. Unending war with a cease-fire proclaimed now and again until the bloodletting resumed. We continue to live in the nuclear age, though it seldom appears on our current list of concerns. But immediately after 1945, the fascination with the bomb bled into all aspects of American culture, frequently as a source of profound anxiety. This included the obsessive fascination that accompanies the object of our fears. Serling worried Americans about the moral meaning of the bomb through a medium that had long assured them it represented American omnipotence. Television, struggling to decide what it would become in the postwar era, attempted to satiate the strange need to see death incarnate. Two Los Angeles stations attempted to film a nuclear test 250 miles away in early 1951. Viewers simply saw, in an image that seems positively Lynchian, “the flash of eerie white light.” In 1952, televisions across the nation pulsed weirdly with a flash that sank into “a dark penumbra” enveloping a tiny tenebrous light. Viewers complained about the quality of the image of holocaust, few ever learning that the chiaroscuro image had ruffled across their tiny screens because even at the distance from which the cameras filmed, the heat from the blast melted their lenses.39 Serling grasped the dangers of such weapons and not only in the obvious sense of their threat to human life on earth. He wondered whether a democracy could withstand the pressures of becoming an unstoppable military juggernaut. Could American democracy survive the American empire? Serling’s interest in racial justice already made him aware of the limits of American democracy. Would even basic community break down in an age of apocalyptic weapons needed to defend the porous borders of a global empire? Over the years, in fits and starts, he bleakly decided the answer was yes, eventually using his platform to speak out forcefully about American intervention in Asia. But even in the early sixties, we see him trying to make sense of his country and its possible fate. Serling took viewers to a particularly sadistic corner of the Twilight Zone in September of 1961. In an episode entitled “The Shelter,” which aired about one year before the Cuban missile crisis, suburban neighbors blithely gathered for a birthday party rapidly turn on one another when the television reports UFOs, probably Soviet bombers, descending on them. Only one of the neighbors, the beloved family doctor to most of the gathering, has built a fallout shelter. Even some dedicated fans of the show found the episode heavy-handed, too blatantly allegorical, preachy. Would people really turn on one another so quickly in a crisis? Serling, and the embattled protagonist of “The Shelter,” thought it naïve to believe otherwise.40 Atomic weapons became, and have remained, a symbol of the apocalypse, a haunting backdrop to horror culture’s tales of death. Serling frequently revisited the theme directly in episodes like “Time Enough at Last,” “Third from the Sun,” “A Little Peace and Quiet,” and, more obliquely, in “The Midnight Sun.” Serling’s use of science fiction terrors to make people think appeared at a period when, just as often, these tropes reassured Americans everything would be fine. In the center of empire, theaters had begun a new kind of danse macabre as dark powers starved for conquest arrived to conquer the ailing earth. The future belonged to horror.",

      "content": "1.Unidentified THE MONSTERS usually came from Mars. The bloody iron oxide glow and association with the god of war made our closest planetary neighbor in the void a natural jumping-off point for an extraterrestrial invasion. H. G. Wells predicted just such an attack in his 1897 tale The War of the Worlds, appearing in serialized form to the British public the same year the world met Bram Stoker’s Dracula. In Wells’s original vision the Martians came thirsting for our blood. Dying on their moldering planet, like the rotting five-hundred-year-old warlord in the Carpathians, the aliens hungered for a literal fresh transfusion of life. Mars and Transylvania had one thing in common. The old cultures, in British imperial myth, wanted, depended on, the vitality of great Britannia. Americans proved willing to believe the same about their growing empire. In 1939, a radio play by Orson Welles’s The Mercury Theatre on the Air narrated a version of The War of the Worlds in a fashion that convinced at least some listeners that Martian death rays scoured the landscape of New Jersey. Welles saw his production as part of the coalition building that many left-leaning artists and activists pursued in the thirties, a broad anti-fascist front. So he must have been delighted that at least some listeners misheard the program in such a way as to believe that the Nazis invaded the East Coast. In the year 1947, invaders filled the skies over the forty-eight states. By the middle of the summer, newspaper accounts dubbed their touring vehicles “flying saucers.” Most agree that the term can be traced to the private pilot and U.S. Forest Service employee Kenneth Arnold, who saw “nine, bright, saucer-like objects” flying at “incredible” speeds. At the same time, the idea of saucer-like crafts played an important role in the pulp sci-fi and horror magazines of the twenties and thirties, ensuring that the idea already held some currency in American culture. Arnold’s supposed sighting made an ephemeral cultural image into an icon. The Chicago Sun reported on June 26 that Arnold insisted, based on his flight experience, that the object sighted near Mount Rainier moved at speeds exceeding 1,200 miles per hour. “It’s impossible,” Arnold admitted, “but there it is.”1 The U.S. military agreed with Arnold on the impossibility of such a craft. Officials connected to the newly created Air Force, formerly the Army Air Forces, overanxiously denied the existence of any actual craft buzzing around up there. They invented the term unidentified flying objects (UFOs) since they knew from their own experience that nothing kills enthusiasm like a military acronym. UFO stuck, becoming a permanent part of American popular culture and lexicon. The acronym lost its original bureaucratic origins and came to mean “visiting and/or invading extraterrestrials” in general parlance, contrary to Air Force hopes that it simply means a thing in the sky that doesn’t matter because we can’t identify it and could well be a weather balloon, a hallucination, or a simple trick of the light. Gritting their teeth, everybody in the Pentagon with less than four stars busily worked to convince Americans there was nothing to worry about. They failed spectacularly. Then, they succeeded beyond their wildest hopes. Was the newly inaugurated Pentagon hiding secrets? Yes. Did it have to do with alien craft, crashing with some regularity in the desert Southwest? Sadly, no. Most Americans, at first, did not assume that horrors from outer space accounted for what writers on the topic later dubbed the summer of the flying saucers. The Second World War convinced many that the sightings related to a new kind of superweapon. Perhaps surprisingly, few seem to have assumed that these vehicles flying around unidentified represented a Soviet plot. Kenneth Arnold himself sent a telegram to Wright Field in Ohio expressing his “disappointment” that the Air Force gave no confirmation of the origin of what he had seen since he “felt certain they belonged to our government.” Arnold hoped that the commanding general and the Air Force scientists would take his concerns more seriously since he assumed that he’d seen “an instrument of destruction meant to be used in combination with our atom bomb.” Shouldn’t the American people know about this?2 Truman’s burgeoning national security state thought there was plenty the American people did not need to know. In 1947, the National Security Act created the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon, putting in place a cooperative and unitary military command structure. At least that’s all the American public assumed had happened. And, anyway, the new legislation looked about as interesting as changes to an administrative flowchart. Most took little notice. In fact, the act allowed for a complete reorientation of foreign policy, extremely powerful institutions not answerable to the democratic process, and what amounted to the unconstrained ability to wage secret wars anywhere around the globe. Historian Tom Engelhardt writes that the National Security Council became, in effect, the president’s “second cabinet, coordinating domestic, foreign, and military policies beyond the oversight of Congress or the public.” The new National Security Agency (NSA) quickly became a clearing house of data on American citizens as well as foreign powers. Under the act, the NSA did not even have to reveal its existence to the American public until 1975.3 A single short paragraph in the act created one of the most powerful agencies in American foreign policy over the next seventy years, a secret army answerable primarily to the president and his advisors. The CIA became, in effect, a new, secret branch of the armed forces with a mission broadly defined as the “analysis” of intelligence and the dangerously vague permission to conduct “clandestine activities.” In 1949, a wave of bad news from the fluctuating fronts of the Cold War led to a bill that exempted the agency from having to disclose “its size, budget, operations, and sources.”4 The sweeping powers of the new agency deeply concerned many senior officials and military leaders, even if the American public paid very little attention. In some cases, this opposition amounted to administrative turf wars. Hoover seemed especially concerned about what would become of his beloved FBI. Other critics sounded off with more serious concerns about what the NSA meant for democracy. More traditional military leaders and a few in the press warned of the creation of “an American ‘Gestapo.’” Several months before the CIA began operations, George C. Marshall, the top American military commander in World War II and secretary of state in 1947, sent a private memorandum to Truman that said in part that “the powers of the proposed agency seem almost unlimited and need clarification.” There is no record of a response.5 The culture of secrecy that emerged with the National Security Act carried direct implications for what would become the new American fears of invaders in flying saucers. The entire intelligence community and the Air Force took an interest in the reported phenomenon, though not because they thought (or knew) that aliens regularly visited some of the most isolated parts of the United States. Instead, the national security state very much needed a panic-free American public to carry out the Cold War geopolitical agenda. Advantageously for America’s foreign policy commissars, the Greenbaum effect began to do its work. Flying saucer enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists, without fail, latched on to conspiracy folklore with no basis in reality or uncovered secrets the government barely tried to keep hidden. Over the decades since the 1950s, UFO fans have frequently become excited about various smoking guns they are pretty sure the Freedom of Information Act, or the FBI’s own decision to release documents digitally, has allowed them to find. Anyone enthusiastic over U.S. government conspiracies would require a serious stockpile of cork, yarn, and thumbtacks to make enough murder boards to cover them all. And yet, the Greenbaum effect prevented any serious research into truly troubling matters. The desire to ferret out state secrets seldom included an examination of assassinations and the overthrow of foreign governments, the meaning of various obscure treaties, or the involvement of the U.S. military all over the globe. Instead, visitors from other worlds became the consuming passion, surely to the delight of the alphabet agencies raised to life by the National Security Act. Meanwhile, the CIA provided the less suspicious elements of the American public with a phrase that also helped them ignore what their country was really up to in the world. CIA Dispatch #1035-960, now widely available, reveals that the agency encouraged the use of the term conspiracy theory by the shapers of American opinion. “Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose” the document code-named PSYCH reads. In a series of talking points, the document urges that “assets” in the American news media be told that conspiracy theories “appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”6 The creation of an American consensus of ignorance about the crimes of empire seemed complete. The Greenbaum effect ensured that absurdities about little green men and lizard people kept the tin foil hat crowd busy. Meanwhile, the very term conspiracy theory and its associations successfully inoculated more skeptical Americans against the horrors of American interventionism, conflating evidence-free nonsense with realities that hid in plain sight. The national security state squared a very dark circle. 2.Crash Landings THE FBI released an influential bread-crumb trail to nowhere, referred to as the Hottel memo or the Roswell memo, to an eager public in the late 1970s. In it there’s some red meat for anyone hoping for a close encounter of any kind. In March of 1950, the special agent in charge of the D.C. office, Guy Hottel, reported to J. Edgar Hoover a rumor circulating in New Mexico that “an investigator for the Air Forces stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered.” According to the story, beings “three feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture” occupied each craft. Hoover never ordered a follow-up on the vague hearsay.7 Sounds suspicious, doesn’t it? When news of the released memo spread, the faithful believed it confirmed a government cover-up with the mention of New Mexico proving it. The reason for this “aha!” lay in another obscure 1947 incident that occurred soon after Kenneth Arnold experienced his flying saucer sighting: an Air Force craft crashed at a ranch near Roswell. Locals took up Arnold’s language and spoke of a “flying disc.” The front page of the Roswell Daily Record on July 8 came emblazoned with the headline “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region.” The Army Air Force sought to tamp down the story by dismissing the crash as a failed weather balloon and that seemed the end of l’affaire Roswell. Few continued to hold much interest in Roswell until the Hottel memo. True believers circulated it widely to the delight of UFO fans, who crowed over the sudden, supposed proof of a government cover-up at Roswell—never mind that the alleged deception occurred three years before the field office director’s report. In 1980, Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, the former a paranormal enthusiast who previously wrote about the Bermuda Triangle and other alleged paranormal phenomena, published the hugely popular book The Roswell Incident. Their false assertions, allegedly based on interviews with numerous eyewitnesses but actually jerry-built from informal chats with people who claimed to know eyewitnesses or someone who knew an eyewitness, became the template for the idea of a government conspiracy to cover up the supposed crash and discovery of an alien craft in the New Mexico desert. Every decade or so, there’s new interest in Roswell. In the 1990s, more books, often making contradictory claims, appeared about the supposed crash. Many of these news books seem to have been fueled by the enormous popularity of the television series The X-Files (1993–2002), a brilliant twist on the police procedural. Running for nine seasons, plus two feature films and a reboot, the franchise made use of the era’s fascination with conspiracy and suppression of the truth. At least “truths” related to aliens and assorted cryptids . . . never coups, assassinations, or quotidian tales about the building of hundreds of U.S. military bases on foreign soil. In 2011, the FBI’s digital history project called the Vault created renewed interest in the old story. The Vault was a kind of image-building project for the FBI, a joint effort with the National Archives to release about seven thousand unclassified documents to the public. The Guy Hottel memo sent to Hoover in 1950 quickly became the most popular. Indeed, to the chagrin of the FBI, mainstream news outlets reported on the memo as if it suggested a cover-up of the Roswell incident, ignoring that it constituted a third- or arguably fourth-hand account of rumors of an incident that seemed to warrant no further investigation. In April of 2011, just as the FBI launched the Vault, an ABC news report entitled “FBI Vault Reveals UFO, Roswell Files” again linked the memo, now available for more than thirty years, to the possibility of a government cover-up. The reportage would have left most readers with the lingering suspicion that there was more to the story, especially since the director of the New York Center for Extraterrestrial Research was the single person ABC chose to interview in depth. Described with the grammatical conundrum “a UFO supporter,” he insisted that the news would force the government to come clean about the truth behind the flying saucers. In 2013, the FBI reported that the memo had been viewed nearly a million times. Roswell continues to be a popular topic among UFO enthusiasts and in popular culture. In 1999, a cult TV show called Roswell ran for three seasons. A remake of the series launched in 2019. Why do Americans care so much about these kinds of stories? In June of 1997, a CNN/Time poll found that three-quarters of respondents believed the government covered up the incident at Roswell. The same survey found, confusingly, that more of those polled believed in a Roswell cover-up than believed in extraterrestrial life. Apparently, this comes from a general sense that the U.S. government must be up to something. Maybe it’s aliens? As we’ve already seen, the birth of the national security state played a decisive role in both creating and sustaining these illusions. The people, or small movements, that have come to be known as conspiracy theorists actually exist in a peculiar symbiosis with the desire of the Cold War state to engage in actual, rather complex conspiracies. In fact, the semi-seriousness with which the Pentagon, the CIA, and the FBI took flying saucer sightings points to the real horror of the era. The government was, for example, utterly deceptive about the nature of the 1947 crash near Roswell when the Air Force described the wreckage as a weather balloon. In 1995, an Air Force report quietly explained the entire Roswell incident, an explanation disregarded or ignored by anyone more interested in little green men than the politics of the Cold War. The crash, wrote Air Force investigators, appeared “consistent with balloon devices and most likely from the MOGUL balloons that had not been recovered.” In other words, America’s Cold War with Russia and the need to keep the empire’s secrets played a crucial role in the belief that monsters were descending from the stars.8 Project Mogul launched at the end of World War II, a classified collaboration between the U.S. Army Air Forces and New York University that used large clusters of balloons and radar reflectors to trace seismic activity possibly indicative of a Soviet atomic test. Mogul long remained classified since it inaugurated decades of aerial espionage conducted against the Soviet Union. This would come to include an embarrassing May 1960 incident in which the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 spy plan in their airspace and captured the pilot, forcing Eisenhower to admit that such flights had been carried out for years.9 But far more Americans know about Roswell and its supposed alien connections than their country’s tendency to violate the rest of the world’s airspace with impunity. And far more care. Why is this so? The answer lies in the directions taken by American horror in the Cold War. It has its genesis in the fact that the worst possible thing really is the truth in the story of the American empire and the fact that Americans are quite comfortable not knowing that. 3.Lone Gunmen THERE ARE plenty of fringe theorists in America who believe an astonishing variety of nonsense. The American public mocks them and buys hundreds of thousands of copies of their books, listens to their podcasts, and watches hours of series that air, and re-air, every 1970s theory about extraterrestrial life. The television series Ancient Aliens has run for eighteen seasons on what purports to be the History Channel, despite its bizarre mix of creationism, contradictory claims, and junk science. In Smithsonian, science writer Riley Black memorably called the popular series “some of the most noxious sludge in television’s bottomless chum bucket.” In her detailed article she explains a multitude of manufactured truths and notes how frequently the show describes fundamentalist Christians without formal advanced degrees as “biblical archeologists” and “paleontologists.”10 The misinformation industry thrives off America’s juvenile dance between consumer and commodity. The authors of the Roswell paperbacks that began appearing in the eighties are both absurd and rich from the desire of Americans to hold on to modern myths. In fact, the success of their claims makes perfect sense in a country where millions believed in and spread music producer Ray Santilli’s 1995 alien autopsy hoax, including a former CIA scientist who insisted the footage was real even after the revelation that Santilli used a foam alien to create it. Then there are academics like Courtney Brown, of the prestigious Emory University, who claimed to use telepathy to learn the true nature of the Hale-Bopp comet . . . the same psychic talents he used to communicate with Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth (Brown assures us they are also aliens). And, of course, Cory Hammond, whose nightmare visions of Satanists, mind control, and the CIA question American covert actions and manage to find all the wrong answers. These examples are easy to mock. They also often find a large audience, have their speculations taken seriously by major news outlets, and earn an odd kind of belief by Americans who, looking at the maelstrom of history, politics, and science, are so baffled that they throw up their hands and mutter, “Well, it could be, I guess.” Meanwhile, mass culture phenomena from films like the The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and The Parallax View (1974) presented the possibility of American institutions subverted at the highest level, often by outside powers (an international communist conspiracy in the first and a corporation in the other). Like the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), anyone you know might be a pod person and woe betide you if you try to convince the authorities. Or, more likely in American life, you’ll be considered a delusional paranoid by consumers who also turn your book into a best-seller while a film adaptation goes into development. The official keepers of state secrets have, since the end of World War II, been perfectly content to allow such theories to spread. For all the latent American concern over conspiracy, and the occasional pop culture celebration of heroes trying to figure out the score (“The Truth Is Out There” became the most instantly recognizable tagline of The X-Files), the paranoia or simple intrigue shown by the American public never focuses on getting to the bottom of actual conspiracies. There’s certainly evidence that the caretakers of the national security state understood the power of promoting false conspiracies to cover real ones. In 1952, Walter Bedell Smith, once Eisenhower’s chief of staff and at that time serving as director of the CIA, suggested that the UFO had some real potential in advancing U.S. interests. He encouraged his top lieutenants to “discuss the possible offensive or defensive utilization of these phenomenon for psychological warfare purposes.”11 The flying saucers did offer a much-needed distraction. Indeed, during the period that Americans watched the skies for extraterrestrial invaders, the highest echelons of the U.S. government successfully created an infrastructure for clandestine terror, overthrew two elected governments and waged a guerilla terrorist campaign against another, all the while hiding significant facts about the use of atomic weapons. General public ignorance of these facts offers a clear example that Americans want their conspiracies to involve only aliens, international cabals, or both. We want the monster out there, not in here with us. We accept the apex predator in the water that we can kill but not the American myths of the frontier turned into a psychopath with a chain saw fetish. Thus, when a whistleblower shows us the truth that’s actually out there, as Edward Snowden did by revealing the National Security Agency’s PRISM program that collected cell phone data on most Americans with the cooperation of companies like Verizon, most Americans brand them as a traitor. Snowden had to go into exile or face conviction under the draconian 1917 Espionage Act. (Passed as the United States entered World War I, this act had been used to imprison anyone who opposed the country’s entrance into the conflict.) He was not asked to share his thoughts on the History Channel and his book did not become a mainstream best-seller available in cheap paperback editions. In the 1940s and 1950s, suggestions like Kenneth Arnold’s claims are what really concerned the newborn national security state. What did Americans know about the nation’s new superweapons? Most important, could a panic over their power be prevented or the terror they caused become part of the public relations arsenal needed to keep the Cold War at a low boil? In the late 1940s, the U.S. government began preparing to do some pretty nasty business at home and abroad. An informed public might demand an accounting of the new agencies that sprang into existence after the National Security Act. What would happen if Americans ever really came to grips with the reality of atomic weapons? Perhaps they would balk at the apocalypse. 4.The Creatures with Atom Brains!! WE KNEW radiation killed. It’s impossible to imagine the army of radioactive monsters that crawled, slithered, and skittered toward fifties horror fans without noticing the role of the bomb. Susan Sontag’s essay “The Imagination of Disaster” takes seriously the desire of American filmgoers to look at destruction, its possibility and its outcome. Sontag, and the ruminations of a hundred commentors on genre film, have insisted that the Cold War and sci-fi horror must be explained as allegories for aliens as communists and creature features as atomic anxiety. What was missed in trying to understand the need to screen apocalyptic horror is Sontag’s point that there’s a fantasy being lived in these films, as much as a set of anxieties about the bombs from the sky and reds under the beds. Had she pondered this fantasy over the decades, Sontag might have concluded that it’s a central tenet of the citizens of empire. The destruction of America, restaged and replayed again and again, became a symbol of undefined and inexplicable grievance. Despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, Americans since World War II imagined themselves as the victims on the world stage. In 1949, when a civil war overthrew the brutal and corrupt Chiang Kai-shek, America believed it “lost China.” We feared the Soviets during decades when they had no way to deliver their tiny nuclear arsenal to the American mainland. Defeat in Vietnam became a myth of betrayal and victimization. The country’s culture remains beset with an unhealthy neurosis that allows it to ignore the overwhelming hegemony it exercises over most of the people on earth. The only country ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population has a fortress mentality, an inexplicable seething rage against the world. The country did not collectively forget its conscience in 1945. The bomb became a moral issue for millions of Americans after the elation over the war’s end. Close to the one-year anniversary of the first bomb falling on Hiroshima, the New Yorker published John Hersey’s account of the effects of the new weapon. Hersey forced Americans to wonder about the decision to use the bomb, his spare prose making it clear that Hiroshima was anything but a giant military base. The emotional effect of his article, soon published as a best-selling book, grew from his intimate portrayal of the effects of radioactivity on six survivors. Hersey, without falling into sentimentalism, described the deteriorating health of the six in ways that horrified readers. Readers learned that the bomb’s aftereffects included the rapid degeneration of stem cell tissue as the phosphorus in their bodies caused bones to glow hot with radiation. Their blood boiled with poison. Hersey reported that men had become sterile while young women simply ceased menstruating. Victims suffered intense pains from burns that had depilated skin down to cartilage. Hersey taught Americans the phrase radiation sickness. His work carefully, and sometimes even dryly, documented how the weaponized dust and debris, ionized with radium, that emerges out of the heart of an atomic explosion eviscerates human cells and mutates DNA. Perhaps for the first time in their lives, many Americans found themselves confronted with the Japanese people as human beings. But we must be careful. It would be easy to overstate the effect of Hersey’s book, and the efforts of other critics of the atom bomb. The sense of outrage over Pearl Harbor, and a profound lack of knowledge about the diplomatic and strategic context of the attack, clouded moral reasoning about the use of such a weapon. Americans already accepted the idea of LeMay’s “terror bombing,” a practice that actually killed more civilians than the twin A-bomb attacks in August of ’45, and, to many, the mass murder at Hiroshima and Nagasaki seemed like a quicker and more efficient version of the deadly air campaigns. Not everyone, even those who pondered Hersey’s spare but muscular account, came to grips with the fact that the bomb secreted a deadly element that rewrote DNA sequences, mutating human beings at the level of their basic code. Radiation killed tens of thousands in the months and years after the bombings. “So what?” many thought, and either put down Hersey’s book or never read it in the first place. After all, hadn’t the use of weapons of questionable morality already been a part of America’s “good war”? Marine and army forces from Guadalcanal to Tarawa to Okinawa deployed the flamethrower, a weapon repeatedly condemned in the twenties and thirties by the world community after its use in World War I. Wielded by a single soldier or marine, the fearful weapon incinerated the “bug hives,” pillboxes that held Japanese soldiers, portrayed in propaganda cartoons as an inhuman, insectoid enemy fanatically willing to die for the emperor. For many Americans, the bomb just seemed a bigger and bolder version of such tactics. In fact, perhaps one of the most common comments about the bomb in politics and journalism after August of ’45 touted it as an example of American know-how. The scruples shown by at least a sliver of the American public in the few years after their country dropped the world’s first atomic device went into a political coma after the Soviet Union announced it had atomic weapons. Code-named First Lightning, the American intelligence community also called the device Joe-1 in recognition that Joseph Stalin now possessed the bomb. The American public’s response contained the peculiar mixture of nationalist bravado and sheer panic that came to represent the American state of mind in the years after World War II. Less than a month after American spy planes detected Joe-1’s radioactive trail, Democratic senator of Connecticut Brien McMahon warned Americans against complacency and insisted that the development of conventional and atomic weapons must continue. An arms race had become central to preserving American prerogatives. McMahon’s view got the most attention, as it offered a narrative of immediate threat. In the meantime, no one paid any attention to the numerous scientists calling for a sweeping internationalization of scientific research and shared risk instead of national self-interest. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who became a critic of the Pentagon’s use of the weapon he played a pivotal role in creating, found himself stripped of his security clearance. After his last, difficult meeting with Harry Truman, the president told aides never to let that “son of a bitch” appear on his schedule again. The president, who, as a young man, wished the Great War to last longer so he could kill more Germans, didn’t care for the scientist’s moral scruples.12 The country seemed ready to enjoy Sontag’s imagination of disaster. In 1955, Creature with the Atom Brain became one of the many films to imagine a mad scientist who uses radiation for apocalyptic designs, specifically raising the dead. The villain of the piece is a Nazi scientist or, in other words, precisely the kind of person working on America’s radioactive arsenal through the auspices of Operation Paperclip. Viewers watched this peculiar reflection of reality on a double bill with It Came from Beneath the Sea, a tale of nuclear submarines and giant cephalopods weaponized by radiation. Though these seem like modern fairy tales concerned with the dangers of atomic weapons, their celebration of American military power left audiences assured of the need for America’s full-spectrum dominance. 5.We Gratefully Acknowledge the Cooperation of Those in Authority SCIENCE FICTION horror already worked to encourage trust in the national security state. In 1950, hoping to build on the “summer of the flying saucers” and the continuing alleged sightings, a tiny production company called Colonial Productions made the first feature film to deal with the phenomenon. They called it The Flying Saucer. Colonial included patriotic text at the film’s beginning that read, “We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of those in authority” for making the picture possible. “Those in authority” could not help being pleased with the film’s message, which combined action and America triumphing over their enemies with tough-guy antics and technological acuity. The Flying Saucer opens with sightings of the eponymous craft over a number of American cites. An unnamed American spy agency, clearly the new CIA, enlists Mike Trent, “a playboy, sportsman, and two-fisted drinker,” to investigate sightings in Alaska. Ominously for the logic of the Cold War, “undercover agents in a communist group” in Juneau were trying to locate and learn the tech behind the alien craft since it offered “a perfect delivery system” for the A-bomb. The intrepid Trent, after some romantic adventures and fisticuffs with Russian spies, discovers that an American scientist, not extraterrestrials, developed the saucer. This nod to Kenneth Arnold’s suspicions about a U.S. superweapon is tamped down as the last minutes become a race to prevent the Soviets from stealing the saucer (small enough to conceal in the basement of a log cabin). One communist agent briefly absconds with the craft, but the American scientist has rigged it to explode. Proclaiming “all of that settled,” playboy Trent decides to marry his blonde CIA handler and all’s well. The slipshod production of The Flying Saucer—probably at least thirty minutes of the hour-and-fifteen-minute running time is filled out by aerial and landscape footage of Alaska—did not prevent it from becoming a drive-in theater standby and even a mention, if a rather acidic one, in The New York Times (“A film called ‘The Flying Saucer’ flew into the Rialto yesterday,” wrote critic Bosley Crowther, “and . . . it can go right on flying”).13 Whatever the Times thought of it, an American public nervous that Joseph Stalin had an A-bomb proved ready for a flood tide of films featuring alien aggression and radioactive monsters, usually with a thinly veiled Cold War message. The basic formula for most science-fiction horror films of the decade uses the first act to introduce a threat from beyond the stars or, somewhat ironically, from under the sands of “the West,” a New Mexico of the mind where audiences would vaguely remember the Trinity test exploded the bomb into the world. In act two, Washington learns of the threat (usually because of a child or a scientist or a child and a scientist, almost always in a small town), and the filmmaker inserts World War II or Korean War footage to show tank treads rolling formidably in a long steel line, jeeps filled with combat troops, and a general mobilization against the threat. The scientist, sometimes with the help of another very pretty scientist/soon-to-be love interest, engineers a way the army can destroy the flying saucers or the giant ants or the mutated octopi. In the last act, the army, with a bit of scientific can-do, destroys the threat in a Hiroshima strike against the extraterrestrials. Sometimes there’s fallout, literal fallout, but that’s the price of peace. The success of these films, and the hundreds of them made between 1950 and about 1968, is equal parts celebration of American empire building and assurance from “those in authority” that the U.S. military could defeat any threat. The year 1949 had become a crucial turning point in American public opinion regarding the Cold War, a hardening of attitudes that overdetermined the political possibilities of the country for decades to come. The fantasy of disaster, the fantasy of being both victim and conqueror, played out on thousands of screens almost every night through the first two decades of the Cold War. America the victimized saw its post–World War II preeminence under siege. In the same year that Stalin could celebrate his nation being able to explode an atom bomb, the communist revolution in China headed by Mao-Tse Tung succeeded. This created shock and surprise in the United States, and perhaps even in Mao himself. Mao’s revolution solidified the American foreign policy establishment’s aggressive stance against an alleged international communist conspiracy. The somewhat moderate policy of “containment” advocated by George F. Kennan in ’46 called for a sort of diplomatic and economic seawall raised against a rising red tide. Many foreign policy wonks, and an increasingly paranoid right wing in both major political parties, entertained the possibility of communist influence at the highest levels of government. The phrase domino theory percolated among elites and soon the public, the logical fallacy of the slippery slope turned into a geopolitical confession of faith. If one country “went communist,” its neighbors would also tip over, one after another, into a sea of red. It’s a fantasy of loss of control, the need of empires through history to see every small act of independence as a threat. The United States had, in fact, already declared its vision of the postwar world, where if any nation refused the country’s influence, they were, by definition, a tool of Moscow. In 1946, Truman called for a massive aid package to the right-wing monarchy of Greece. The Greek government faced a communist insurgency comprised mostly of partisans who fought against the Nazis with Allied help since 1941. Stalin, perhaps the least revolutionary leader on the planet, took little interest in the conflict but did react with horror to Truman’s characterization of it. In a 1947 stem-winder of a speech, given to a joint session of Congress but directed at the Kremlin, the American president described the “terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists” who threatened “the very existence of the Greek state.” But he went further. “I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” The cynical use of rhetoric about “free peoples” aside, this seemed both a threat to Moscow and a declaration of war against the revolutionary aspirations of people from Africa to Asia to Latin America who labored under the centuries-old yoke of European imperialism. The Truman doctrine made it clear how America would use its military and economic power to stack the dominoes any way it wanted to. The United States pursued a course in Greece, soon to become a familiar pattern, in which American “advisors” and military hardware arrived in 1947 to prop up the repressive, but anti-communist, regime. The conservative Greek government survived to place in power a menagerie of criminals, economic oligarchs, and even some Nazi collaborators who earned U.S. approbation for their virulent anti-socialism.14 In Asia, Truman and his National Security Council poisoned relations with China for decades. The 1950 deployment of U.S. troops to South Korea to defend it against invasion from the communist North Korea fell within the parameters of “containment.” However, early successes led General Douglas MacArthur and some of Truman’s closest advisors to urge a full-scale invasion of North Korea, despite China’s explicit warning they would intervene if the United States took this step. American troops crossed the thirty-eighth parallel in the summer of 1950. In response, Chinese forces threw a punishing haymaker of an assault that forced the American army into retreat and even retook the South Korean capital of Seoul. After two years of talks, the deaths of 33,686 American soldiers, and perhaps as many as four million Korean dead in both the North and South, the conflict ended with the divided country having essentially the same borders it did in 1950 and a heavy, permanent American military presence along the restored border. Nearly every major city on the peninsula lay in ruins from American air power. Millions faced starvation. The city of Wonsan endured a forty-one-day, nearly twenty-four-hour shelling from American battleships that U.S. Rear Admiral Allan E. Smith concluded had been the longest and most destructive naval bombardment in human history.15 The catastrophic circumstances strengthened the hand of the most reactionary elements of the North Korean state. Today it remains one of the most isolated and repressive countries on earth. Generations of leaders with a bizarre, semi-mystical version of communism that ritualized a cult of personality around the “Dear Leader” rule an impoverished nation that’s nevertheless well on its way to becoming a nuclear power. The Korean War grimly affected U.S. foreign policy and democratic institutions. The specter of defeat after the Chinese intervention caused discontent and outright fear at the Pentagon and in the administration. Truman suggested at a news conference that field commanders could authorize the use of nuclear weapons and mused in his diary about a new Hiroshima that might bring a quick end to the conflict. The United States readied atomic weapons at bases in Japan. In the spring of 1951, the Joint Chiefs ordered an atomic attack on Manchuria—the very region where Chinese troops first fought the Japanese invasion as American allies—if China sent in more troops to consolidate its early gains. Paradoxically only the fanaticism of MacArthur caused the administration to pause. MacArthur wanted to go nuclear on China and the Soviet Union, and apparently he floated a plan to irradiate much of Asia in order to make a point. In pushing back against this psychotic suggestion, the Truman administration decided to stick with conventional warfare rather than annihilate the Korean peninsula.16 Defense spending boomed. The United States held a stockpile of two hundred atomic weapons in 1949. By 1960, when Kennedy claimed that Republicans had allowed a “missile gap” with the Soviet Union, America possessed eighteen thousand atomic devices. The idea of the missile gap emerged, according to the most distinguished historian of the CIA, from unsubstantiated claims by the agency, the USAF, and the defense industry that the Russians had five hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) able to strike anywhere in the United States. They actually possessed four, and three of those might not have made it off the ground. The Soviet Union would not achieve anything like missile parity until the late 1970s.17 The United States also accelerated research and testing of the hydrogen bomb, triumphantly called “the super bomb” by many in the defense establishment. First tested in the Pacific in the fall of ’52, the device contained one thousand times the force of the weapon dropped on Hiroshima. A crater that yawned two miles wide and almost a mile deep appeared on Enewetak Atoll and gave some hint of the new weapon’s power. Polls suggested that a slim majority of Americans wanted to see an end to nuclear testing. At the same time, sheer, unstoppable military power had come to hold a special place in the American people’s hearts. Paul Fussell describes the enormous tonnage of explosive power placed in the hands of individual America GIs that left Europe a scarred and blasted landscape. He writes that, despite hours of “marksmanship” practice U.S. soldiers engaged in with their M1 carbines, ace shooting and battlefield tactics became passé when “mass wiping-outs, artillery stonks, and frontal flamethrower assaults” could do the job. By late 1944, Europe looked as if the no-man’s-land of the Great War metastasized across the continent, enveloped major cities, and rolled over every acre of farmland and factory district. The men who fought the war, the staff officers who took note of the effect of the unfettered violence, and the commanding generals who ordered mini apocalypses unleashed on ancient European cities all came home with a deep appreciation for the American military machine’s ability to blow the absolute hell out of any obstacle and burn alive any possible threat.18 Horror science fiction accepted the logic of total military supremacy as well, especially when tied to the can-do spirit of science, often evoking the image of the scrappy American inventor. This archetype of the heroic innovator had long held a special place in American mythology. The new style of scares, with a few cinematically interesting exceptions, showed us a new kind of scientist, the opposite of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his crew of doubting Thomases. These new scientists work with the military, they answer to the call of duty, and there’s no question whose side they are on. The mad scientist had transformed into the patriotic scientist or simply the compliant one. Stanley Kubrick’s dark comedy Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb didn’t appear until 1964. By then, as the director well knew, too many Americans had developed a peculiar affection for the bomb. A popular flick called The Atomic Submarine appeared in 1959, and at the time, probably moved at least as many Americans as Kubrick’s arty, over-the-top parody. The Atomic Submarine took some cues from The Flying Saucer, even as it reimagined the alien invasion story by adding some Arctic adventure and even more slack-jawed militarism. The story involved the North Pole becoming a kind of Devil’s Triangle where American ships and subs have begun to disappear. Surely it must be some Soviet plot, and so the USS Tigershark, christened by the film “the deadliest atomic submarine in the U.S. fleet,” goes to investigate. The building of the USS Nautilus, the first submarine to use atomic power, inspired the film. The navy sent the sub to the Arctic waters in an effort not to find commies or to fight flying saucers, but to break submersion records and become the first watercraft to reach the geographic North Pole. The first attempt failed in July of 1958. A second effort succeeded, and the Eisenhower administration hoped the mission would counter the world’s perception of superior Soviet technology after the successful launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957. The Atomic Submarine also coiled into the belly of Cold War politics. A civilian peacenik scientist joins the crew for unconvincing plot reasons. He stands in for every member of the scientific community who warned about the effects of atom bombs and, in fact, exactly the kind of submarine he finds himself aboard. A chisel-chinned officer declares that the scientist’s anti-war statements are “open propaganda” and, worse, that he even shamed his own high-ranking naval officer dad into retirement and ill health. According to chisel-chin, the “press got in on it” and declared the scientist’s father “a warmonger.” Nonsense. In the actual 1950s, what destroyed Joseph McCarthy was not his disregard for civil liberties or even his grotesque, bullying public image. No one blinked an eye when he accused private citizens, or most of the State Department, of treasonous behavior. But when he went after the army, he went too far. The military may have been, other than Billy Graham, the decade’s most respected public institution. The Tigershark discovers a flying saucer at the North Pole inhabited by a tentacled one-eyed beanstalk intent on prepping planet earth for colonization. An intercontinental ballistic missile destroys the craft, but the sailors simply call it an ICBM without giving any explanation of what this meant. Clearly, the acronym had become as well known to the American public as UFO. A new mass militarism meant movie producers could count on their drive-in audience knowing the utter devastation such a device could wreak. There’s no room for dissenting voices aboard America’s atomic submarine. If you wanted to be a real American, not a communist flunky or worse, you had to come along fully for the ride. In the final scene, the peacenik scientist accepts atomic weapons as at least a necessary evil, admitting that “guys like the sailors” aboard the Tigershark, guys willing to unleash weapons of apocalyptic power when the order comes down, can save “us” from the invaders. America was not going to take any shit. 6.The Midnight Monster Show AMERICANS FROM all walks of life now believed they saw flying saucers, or flying somethings, careening across the skies. Films—not the ones best produced and now recalled as classics like The Thing from Another World (1951) or Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), but low-budget screamers, quickly produced and distributed widely and repeatedly at double bills in traditional theaters—helped shape the perception of these not-very-close encounters into alien invasions. But Martians or Venusians or the occasional unnamed extraterrestrial empire hungry for earth’s lifeblood provided many Americans with only some of the strange solaces of horror. The shiny steel surfaces of the flying saucer, mimicking the curvaceous modernism of both household appliances and the postwar automobile, took up only part of the shadows of the American mind. During the Second World War, Americans could venture out to venues on the home front to discover the frightful delights of horror’s first golden age. The monsters of their youth might have been cavorting with Abbott and Costello. But in cities and small towns across the country, the so-called spook show became a popular attraction, delivering live-action versions of the increasingly placid, predictable American horror film. In some respects, these local performances helped horror survive in the age of Frankenstein engaging in hijinks with Lou and Bud. Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors brought dark carnival delights across the country beginning in the 1940s. Dr. Silkini was actually Jack Baker from Toledo, Ohio. Baker’s show became the most popular of its kind, lasting until 1963. The traveling horror show included some traditional magic tricks, a séance played for laughs, and the occasional gag, like promising to show the audience an actual dead body only to lift the veil on a frozen chicken. But Baker served audiences some pretty strong stuff that went beyond these hijinks. He called the show’s most potent trick the Blackout, a skit in which he or one of his performers threatened to throw live snakes into the audience and then cut the lights, leading to inevitable screams as he flung a heavy, damp rope into the sudden darkness. Dr. Silkini really gave his audience the business at the show’s climax. The stage became a grand guignol gathering of what looked to be body parts in an art deco lab familiar to fans of the era’s many mad scientist films. Working with a hunchbacked assistant, Silkini brought the body to life with a fog and fireworks show of sparks and miniature explosions and Frankenstein’s monster himself. The monster would gruesomely strangle the hunchback and then shamble toward the audience just as Silkini dropped all the lights in the house. Screams edging into utter panic always followed. Universal Studios took a dim view of the unlicensed use of one of their marquee characters. However, Silkini managed to convince the studio’s legal department to allow him the rights to the character. Universal may have rightly understood that the popularity of the shows kept their classic monsters in undead circulation. In fact, Universal’s 1944 House of Frankenstein made use of a traveling midnight show (its ghost host played malevolently by Boris Karloff) in what seems a reluctant tribute to the rising popularity of Silkini and his many imitators. In fact, rescreening of classic, and perhaps some not-so-classic, horror films went hand in skeletal hand with the midnight shows. Silkini introduced the practice of “midnight bicycling” in which he rented out one venue to startle and entertain with his magic show and monster mash as well as a nearby movie palace the audience could bicycle to directly after his stage show to eat popcorn as eagerly as they gobbled down a horror film or bleak murder mystery. The midnight shows brought delicious excitement to small towns throughout the United States. Their appeal went beyond, and blended with, the outré character of the entertainment. The conventions of the event allowed teenagers, adults, and children to ignore curfew, young couples copping feels in the shadowy privacy of theaters while kids bicycled across town in the small hours. It’s challenging for contemporary readers to grasp how, in the quiet and often very homogenous town of the fifties, this allowed for a carnivalesque atmosphere edged with terror. But this was a white empire at play . . . and so not open to everyone. Segregation excluded many Americans from enjoying the pleasures of the midnight monster shows. During the height of Silkini and his many imitators’ popularity, state laws throughout the South and parts of the Midwest segregated all public spaces. De facto segregation in much of the rest of the United States prevailed. When Dr. Morris and His Weird House of Horrors brought their midnight show to the New Bern Theatre in North Carolina, the advertised “frightmare of monsters” was a whites-only affair. A poster for a “Mammoth Horror” event at the old vaudeville theater in Fort Smith, Arkansas, told “colored folks” that they would have to come to their own “exclusive”—that is, Jim Crow—performance.19 American racism brought out other ugly elements of the American id, fueling the empire’s suspicion and arrogance. In the atmosphere of the Cold War, seething prejudices against Asians and Asian Americans intertwined with the monster shows. The horror of movie monsters and dark magic mixed with a blighted representation of the enemies of the empire. A new midnight monster show illustrated this sinister side of the monstrous fun. In June of 1950, Bill Sachs reported for Billboard magazine that he recently caught Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient,” a “45-minute display” making its way through Kansas and Missouri. Sachs records the impressions of a reporter named Ray Amy, who watched what he described as “the snappiest and most clean cut of its type I’ve ever seen” in Kansas City in the early summer.20 Los Angeles–based Frank Chan performed as the villainous Chan Loo. Chan began his career as a magician working in the late 1930s at a tourist trap its promoter called China City. Developer Christine Sterling successfully created a kind of virtual Spanish mission on Olvera Street, a faux-historical rendition of a romanticized “mission days,” as cultural tourism usually termed the period that ignored the real costs of the conquest of California: destruction of Indigenous peoples and their culture by the spread of smallpox and forced baptisms that harried the region’s Chumash, Tataviam, and Tongva peoples like twin pale riders of plague and war.21 Sterling’s China City offered white Americans an equally patronizing representation of Chinese American life and indeed of Asia itself. Chan became one of the many Chinese Americans to receive some financial and social benefits from the project. Amid the false front of an imaginary China, people displaced by the destruction of L.A.’s original Chinatown in 1933 during the building of Union Station found jobs as performers, store owners, or practitioners of their traditional craft.22 Chinese American organizations in the thirties created the so-called New Chinatown on Broadway, which ultimately offered more autonomous opportunity for entrepreneurs in their community. China City, on the other hand, gave a performance space to people who already often played unidentified Asian extras for Hollywood studios, or in some cases, craftsmen whose families hailed from northern regions of China, where everything from handicraft to language and foodways could be vastly different from the country’s southern region, which most first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants once called home. Chan bridged a lot of these differences that held little interest for America audiences who wanted an imagined China. He blended very generalized symbols of his Chinese heritage with elements of traditional magic shows audiences had enjoyed since the late nineteenth century. Chan’s act promised “oriental mystery.” A contemporary photograph shows him dressed in elegant robes (most of the people who performed in China City wore costumes from a patchwork of varied periods in Chinese history with no concern for anachronism) while pulling a rabbit from a box painted with a lu-ung, or Chinese dragon.23 Chan followed in the footsteps of Dr. Silkini by creating a road show that combined his act with the American interest in horror. An accidental fire destroyed China City in 1948. Two years later, as the Korean War began, Chan built a career as Dr. Chan Loo, possibly using as inspiration Bela Lugosi’s 1932 Chandu the Magician. In promotional materials, Chan described himself as coming from a “long line of mystics,” including his father “a Seer as well as a magician,” who “in a letter to his son in 1932 gave an almost complete account of World War II which was to prove correct.”24 Two attractive young women appear on Chan’s poster. Their stage names are Allen Chin and Jessica Wong. They haves smiles as ripe as summer oranges and wear highly nontraditional kimonos cut high on the thigh. This obviously helped the show’s appeal. Chan traveled the country until the early 1960s. His formula promised a display of mystic art combined with the assurance that if you want to be scared, “this show will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. You will see the Wolf Man in person, the living Zombie and Igor the Hunchback . . . it’s sen-sational, weird, thrilling!” We shouldn’t underestimate the American public’s desire for the “thrilling” or the promise Chan made that “you’ll see gorgeous girls” along with a serving of monsters. But Chan’s mix of magic show and horror film offered the 1950s much more. He promised the “Horrors of the Orient,” a stylized Chinese dragon choking up fire and a partially decayed skull at the other end of the banner offering twin images of traditional scares from Asia and Europe. The “oriental horror” Chan proffered worked in part because of a long American suspicion about Asia exacerbated by Pearl Harbor and the subsequent conflict. By the 1950s, many Americans transferred the fear and hatred they felt toward Japan during the Second World War to a generalized Asian menace, a Cold War nightmare of the mind. This transference occurred all too easily since most Americans had limited knowledge of Asia and the Pacific world. The faux set pieces of China City encapsulated what most thought they knew, not simply about China but their mental construct of “Asian.” Moreover, the prejudices had roots deep in the previous century. Arriving in mid-nineteenth-century California to work in gold mines and then for the Central Pacific Railroad, Chinese laborers entered contracts with their employers best understood as indentured servitude. Though they made up about a quarter of the California labor force, the menial and deeply demeaning nature of their work did not prevent Chinese immigrants from being seen as insidious threats. In 1871, mobs burned and murdered their way through a section of Los Angeles called Calle de los Negros, slaughtering eighteen Chinese men. Between 1885 and 1887, eighty-six Chinese people died in shootings and lynchings.25 When a so-called Workingmen’s Party seized control of the city government of San Francisco in the 1870s, the new regime used their leverage to shape a revised state constitution that forbid citizenship for “any Chinese or Mongolian,” language that showed the general confusion about the identity and background of the new immigrants. Many white Californians and their representatives blamed an 1876 outbreak of smallpox on the Chinese community. The anti-Asian propaganda that resulted created a national, nonpartisan coalition opposed to the immigration of more Chinese people to America. This local boomlet of racism had a national counterpart. In 1882, Congress ended legal immigration with the Chinese Exclusion Act, continuously renewed until 1943, long after some Americans began to view the Chinese as victims of Japanese atrocities and, in ’41, as important allies against the Axis. According to leaders in California’s anti-Asian movement, in what continues as a common refrain about the anger against immigrants today, the Chinese would take American jobs and lower wages and, moreover, they were “utter heathens, treacherous, sensual, cowardly, and cruel.”26 This conception long poisoned American attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans. Ignorance and hatred of the Asian communities also worked dark magic with American foreign policy in Cold War attitudes toward China, the Korean War, and the disaster in Vietnam. Horror films extruded the poison of American fears and, in turn, brewed an even deadlier toxin. In 1932, Boris Karloff starred as a murderous and perverted Chinese crime lord in The Mask of Fu Manchu. The film appeared a year after Karloff had played the Monster in Frankenstein and the same year he would shamble forth as The Mummy. MGM briefly borrowed Karloff for the production of Mask. Based on a novel by Sax Rohmer, the archvillain Fu Manchu appears as equal parts mad scientist and super villain given to dressing as a Mandarin from the Han dynasty. Myrna Loy, who played the sadistically evil daughter of Manchu, had not yet found fame in the Thin Man series of films. When Mask appeared, the former dancer at Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard had starred as various femme fatales, what the silent era called a vamp. What audiences read as her “exotic” looks also found her cast in various roles as an Asian character at a time when Hollywood hired actual Asians only for comic effect or, more frequently, as street scene extras in so-called oriental adventures. A hit film that starred Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy in yellow-face, and for the purpose of portraying absurd caricatures of Asian villainy, stands as a bleak testament to American attitudes in this era. But the plot itself goes even further down the well of ruinous fantasy, creating a brutally racist pornography. In the climactic scene, Karloff dons the mask of Genghis Khan to which the plot has hazily attributed a degree of supernatural power. He stands before what he describes as “the hordes of Asia” and promises them the conquest of the world and, in a line forever associated with the film, calls on his followers to “Kill the white man and take his women!” The infamously nasty moment prompted a protest from the Chinese embassy in Washington when the film appeared. It’s some indication of the film’s effect when we consider that the Chinese ambassador had a great deal on his mind already in ’32 given the recent Japanese invasion of the Chinese mainland. The Mask of Fu Manchu taught another equally fiendish, if more subtle, lesson to its viewers. At the pinnacle of the mastermind’s power, he calls together “all the hordes of Asia” to overrun “the Western world. The film shows us the rogue’s gallery of the American mind, a gathering of global stereotypes. The followers of Fu Manchu are not only from East Asia. Some appear dressed in the traditional clothing of Arab Bedouins, others wear the fez of Turkey and North Africa, and a group appears that seems to represent a stereotype of barely clothed Pacific Islanders. Meanwhile, the guards of Fu Manchu are racist conceptions of sub-Saharan Africans, complete with loincloths. The “hordes of Asia” that threaten white men and “their” women are the peoples of most of the globe. These ideas continued to circulate during the Cold War, and white audiences proved hungry for images of the enemies of their empire. In 1952, Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” appeared at a local theater in Kearny, Nebraska, followed by a screening of Lugosi’s 1942 Black Dragons. Frank Chan, in character as the evil Chan Loo, could ensure a bigger crowd by blending “oriental” horrors so that, to the American mind confused by old ally China suddenly becoming the bad guy while Japan became a Cold War client, Asia itself could stand in for all manner of murky threats to white America. After all, anyone who saw the The Mask of Fu Manchu twenty years earlier already had some idea of the terror of “hordes of Asia.” The wax museum of American fears made the transference of hatred of the Japanese to a more generalized communist Asian a fairly easy process. Even to veterans who served in the Pacific, the geography of the region, its diversity of cultures, and its political complexities made it “inscrutable.” This word, symbolic of general American ignorance of Asian history and culture, became a racist stereotype of Asian people themselves. Japan, China, and soon a place called French Indochina, Vietnam, intertwined in the vague Asia of the American mind. The American imperial age has been built on such assumptions. The American takeover of Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century came with one army officer declaring that the people were “no more capable of self-government than the savages of Africa.” In the Philippines, an army private wrote that “no cruelty is too severe for these brainless monkeys.” These attitudes, which produced massacre, torture, and the building of detention camps, received a high-toned gloss from American officials at home who spoke of the need to “educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.” In more recent decades, talk of nation building, globalization, and spreading democratic values has blended with the language of race and stereotyped villainy.27 White supremacy has always been the cornerstone of American empire. Raw, colonialist, and racist notions continue to bubble like acid beneath the surface. In March and April of 2020, the president of the United States persistently referred to the novel coronavirus as “the Chinese virus.” At a rally for conservative college students held at a church in Arizona, Trump called COVID-19 “the Kung Flu,” earning him thunderous applause. Facing public criticism after numerous incidents of physical threats and violence against Asian Americans, Trump tamped down that language even as it enjoyed wide popularity on right-wing social media, podcasts, and radio programs. The idea that “Chinese labs” created the virus itself became a viral phenomenon.28 Insidious rumor legends can rip the social and the geopolitical fabric to tatters on their own. They take on darker forms when governments weaponize them. At the end of April 2020, intelligence analysts and current and former administration officials revealed that both the president and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exerted pressure on the CIA to find evidence of either an accidental or purposeful creation of the virus in a Chinese laboratory environment. The president even raised the possibility of suing the Chinese government ten million dollars for each American death. In the coming weeks, Pompeo went against the findings of most of the American intelligence community in asserting that some kind of Chinese maleficence caused the spread of the virus. Mounting evidence suggests that this rhetoric encouraged an outbreak of violence, including mass shootings and public attacks with edged weapons, against Asian Americans.29 The Trump administration found purchase by using these fears of “the East.” But this had been done before. Creating monsters to destroy, a set of “oriental horrors,” offered Americans a way to ignore the horror their atomic Frankenstein birthed into the world. A 1946 issue of Science magazine suggested that with the atomic bomb, “an unconquerable monster has been released.” In fact, the language of the horror film appeared even in the high-toned pages of The New York Times. In pondering the image of the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, William L. Laurence imagined it as a headless monster or a “funeral pyre” that suggested “the presence of the supernatural.” Or maybe, he mused, it looked a little like the Statue of Liberty.30 7.Future Imperfect FOR RAY BRADBURY, the atomic bomb represented the thing at the top of the stairs, the impending arms race a new dark carnival come to America unbidden, whispering seductive promises that could come to no good end. The aspiring writer still clattered away on his typewriter every day, publishing his first story in 1938, though receiving no money for it. A somewhat uncertain period followed in which he hoped to emulate his serial film heroes Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers by joining the army in World War II. Rejected because of his ridiculously poor eyesight, he attempted a brief career in some very minor New York plays but, by his own admission, possessed no acting talent whatsoever. His big break came in 1947 when, to his chagrin, his short story “Homecoming” received a rejection slip from Weird Tales magazine, the pulp that published the works of horror masters from H. P. Lovecraft to Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Feeling confident because his collection Dark Carnival had received good notices, he submitted the story “Homecoming” to Mademoiselle magazine. This unlikely effort paid off when Truman Capote, then an editorial assistant, happened to glance at the story on top of the magazine’s tottering slush pile. The story entranced the twenty-two-year-old Capote, who convinced his bosses to publish it. One of the first science fiction stories to appear in a mainstream magazine, it won an O. Henry Award in 1947. The politics of the forties and fifties drove Bradbury’s works of fantasy, horror, and sometimes frightening science futures. Thoroughly marinated in the world of early horror films and sci-fi fandom, Bradbury also took his writing cues from the likes of Edith Wharton, Thomas Wolfe, and his favorite author, Katherine Anne Porter. Porter’s stories about revolutionary Mexico may have influenced Bradbury’s 1950 story “The Highway,” in which, in an ironic immigration reversal, American refugees stream by the home of a Mexican campesino family. The tale presents the United States as utterly devastated by atomic war and one of the passing, abject Americans, a well-heeled group of young tourists traveling through Central America during the attack, despairingly tells the Mexican family that the end of the world has come. Suggesting that their lives could continue after the desolation of its aggressive northern neighbor, the father of the family ends the story by sardonically wondering aloud, “What do they mean ‘the world’?” When he was a young man, rocket ships and a gleaming sci-fi future were Bradbury’s passion. But so were the extinct dinosaurs. The reality of the bomb weighed heavy on him, social criticism leaking into his worlds of wonder. Bradbury’s 1950 “There Will Come Soft Rains” became one of the most famous, and most poignant, of fantastic tales that attempted to respond to the monsters of the atomic age. Appearing as one of the interconnected stories in his classic collection The Martian Chronicles, it evoked a post-nuclear suburb and a home of the future in which the vacuum cleaner runs unattended, happy hour cocktails mix themselves, and bridge tables pop out of walls while the soothing voice of the smart home asks the lady of the house what poem she’d like to hear read. The people are missing even as the machine continues to run. All that remains, in a phenomenon reported from Hiroshima, are the shadows of long-dead children at play and a man mowing a lawn, the outline of their cindered bodies burned into a wall by the indescribable temperatures rising from the heart of an atomic blast. Bradbury would once again write more hopeful stories of the human future, but the shadow of apocalypse and accompanying dystopia would continually bring the worlds of horror and science fiction together. This marked a significant departure from the first generation of sci-fi fans, whose interest in science (and politics) as much as fiction had informed their vision of the world. No group, out of all the fissiparous sci-fi fan clubs of the thirties, better represented this trend than the Futurians. The motley gathering began in New York City after splitting off from another science fiction league that wanted to keep politics out of their fandom. For the members of the Futurians—which included authors who later became enormously popular, like Frederik Pohl, Damon Knight, James Blish, Cyril Kornbluth, and occasional visitor Isaac Asimov—science fiction could become science fact in a future that had to include a new political regime. It would not be an American empire that brought a prosperous future. Indeed, the young idealists dreamed not only of the stars but of the red star that rose over Russia in the October Revolution of 1917. Looking back through the filter of the Cold War, some Americans today may be surprised at this hearty left-wing enthusiasm. But the Futurians reflected the political upheaval and free-flowing discussion of new possibilities of the thirties. In that decade, when the Great Depression appeared to have come to give capitalism its last rites, the seeming success story of the Soviet Union impressed numerous westerners. Stalin’s cruelties remained unknown. American communists, while hated by those on the far right, were known primarily as defenders of the unjustly executed Scottsboro Boys of Alabama and faithful allies to the labor unions starting to enjoy a series of successes in American life. The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) reached its largest membership in the decade, many of them very young. Its relatively small membership numbers belied the outsize influence of the CPUSA, which played a key role in both the largest strike in American history, the primarily southern Uprising of ’34, and one of the most successful, working hand in glove with the CIO in the 1937 auto strike. Indeed, even Hollywood films portrayed Stalin’s Soviet Union as admirable (as in the 1943 Mission to Moscow) or at least affectionately comical (as in German émigré Ernst Lubitsch’s Ninotchka). In 1939, Time magazine named Stalin, “Uncle Joe” to the burgeoning American left, as “Man of the Year.” Although the highly conservative ownership obviously despised Stalin, the magazine had to cite the undeniably rapid and successful transformation of Russia from a nearly medieval economy into an industrial powerhouse that weathered the Great Depression. In 1942, he received the same designation, the Soviet Union now an American ally. Awareness of Stalin’s crimes would come later. In the 1930s, communism, not American hegemony, looked like the future. Damon Knight, in his memoir of the Futurians and what became of them, remembered the group’s “mighty mission” to educate the science fiction fandom politically. Donald Wollheim, one of the leading lights of the group, delivered what Knight called “a fiery speech” on science fiction and revolution at a 1937 Philadelphia Fan Convention. The next year, the Futurians officially came into existence, attempting to produce a left-wing organ called Science Fiction Advance and meeting at halls loaned by the CPUSA or its Young Communist League.31 Despite their aspirations for a leftist revolution, the Futurians’ mission suffered from no real funding, no actual plan, internecine fighting, the occasional distraction of trying to create new science fiction pulp magazines or glom on to older ones, and the changed political atmosphere of postwar America in which it was supposedly better to be dead than Red. Moreover, none of the Futurians, except perhaps Frederik Pohl with his well-stocked library of socialist classics, seem to have known very much about Marxism. From the standpoint of the CPUSA, their understanding of revolutionary theory and dialectical materialism must have appeared ghastly, mixed up as it was with technocratic notions of utopians, jet packs, monsters from Venus, and spaceships. Knight perhaps sums up the nature of the Futurians when describing David Kyle, a young associate who may have been a Republican but “enjoyed playing at being Bolshevik—wearing a red hat and marching on May Day—he never took it seriously.”32 While the Futurians issued confused manifestos, alienated more than a few sci-fi fans with their stridency, and generally puttered about in lengthy meetings of motions, objections, and peculiar arguments, two men who shaped the future of horror and science fiction for the second half of the twentieth century had a much more focused agenda at the other end of the political spectrum. Rather than an international workers’ revolution, they imagined an empire guarded by science fiction weapons made reality. 8.Who Goes There? JOHN W. CAMPBELL was born in 1910, and his father abandoned the family by the 1920s after years of combat with the young boy’s peculiarly cruel mother. Indeed, when not a volcano of rage she played bizarre pranks on young John, including having her twin sister masquerade as her and then revealing the shadow play at especially embarrassing moments. This background gave Campbell a streak of paranoia as well as the need to escape into imaginative worlds that often reflected the horrors of real life. His best-known and wildly influential tale Who Goes There? became the inspiration for Howard Hawks’s The Thing from Another World (1951), reimagined by horror legend John Carpenter in his cult classic The Thing (1982). The story presented a monster from the stars who could look like anyone, deceiving you through the people you loved and trusted the most. If paranoid, Campbell was also brilliant. If brilliant, he could also be self-destructively undisciplined. Accepted to study physics at MIT, he was asked to leave during his first semester. He spent his college years at Duke University, barely passing his classes and churning out ZIP! BANG! POW! space operas that amounted to little more than Buck Rogers knockoffs. Marriage and a job no one else especially wanted made Campbell famous and more focused. In 1937, the man who wanted to write science fiction became an editor instead, taking over the pulp magazine Astounding Stories, rechristened by Campbell as Astounding Science Fiction. He quickly turned the pulp into his own bailiwick and the place where aspiring writers of the fantastic simply had to publish. Changing the title to Analog by 1960, Campbell made the monthly a finishing school for some of the greatest science fiction and horror talent of the twentieth century. Campbell himself could write sophisticated tales about alien worlds and even the longing that the idea of alien worlds could awaken. Who Goes There? channeled his own fears but also managed to tell a cracking good horror tale. It also resonated with the growing conspiratorial mood of mid-twentieth-century America. This allowed him to nurture talents like Isaac Asimov, who, as he struggled to publish his first story, visited Campbell for notes and encouragement nearly every month in 1938 even as the editor rejected each of his carefully typed tales. Robert A. Heinlein became Campbell’s earliest apprentice to reach sci-fi superstardom, a man many fans still insist is the greatest sci-fi writer of the twentieth century and who (like Asimov and Bradbury) had become a household name by the 1960s. Heinlein eventually turned from sci-fi writer into apologist for the American military juggernaut, a propagandist for a whites-only empire. Heinlein’s early life was a baffling combination of false starts and dead ends, both in his professional life and his whirligig political trajectory. Heinlein was born in 1907 and grew up in Kansas City. In his teenage years, Kansas City boomed, going from sleepy town with the mores of the American South to a major railway terminus plumped from the wealth brought by decades of a successful cattle industry. Although the city’s history into the twentieth century and up to the present offers a case study in the inevitable boom and bust cycles of American capitalism, growing up in the rough-hewn town turned mini metropolis deeply informed Heinlein’s worldview. He believed the world gave men—and with few exceptions his writing focused heavily on men—what they wrested from it. His politics would eventually show this influence. The family military tradition stretched back to the American war for independence and further shaped Heinlein. He entered the Naval Academy in 1925 with plans for a career as an officer. However, in a bit of misfortune he arguably never recovered from, Heinlein contracted tuberculosis and retired with disability pay in 1934. Heinlein became very interested in politics with the onset of the Great Depression, drawn particularly to the reformist socialism of Upton Sinclair. Known to most Americans today as the author of The Jungle, Sinclair wrote over one hundred books, many of them challenging the maleficence of the era’s industrial titans, from Henry Ford to John D. Rockefeller. Heinlein worked tirelessly for Sinclair’s effort to become the governor of California in 1934. To call Sinclair’s campaign controversial defines understatement. FDR refused his endorsement even though Sinclair ran as a Democrat. Earl Warren, future Supreme Court chief justice, described the effort to defeat Sinclair as a struggle “against radicalism and socialism.” So inspired did Heinlein become by Sinclair that he himself ran, and lost badly, for the California State Assembly. The Second World War and John W. Campbell changed Heinlein’s career path, his politics, and his worldview. Campbell began publishing his work in 1939, and Heinlein quickly became one of Astounding’s most popular and prolific writers. Isaac Asimov first met Campbell in this period, earning a look of irritation and displeasure when enthusiastically speaking of his attendance at a Futurians meeting. Asimov commented in his diary that Campbell seemed “a hidebound conservative.” Campbell’s paranoia shaded his ideas about government, world affairs, and eventually race in ways that affected Heinlein’s own drift to the right.33 World War II became the second defining event for Heinlein. Unable to serve in the military any longer after his illness, he worked instead as a civil engineer for the navy. His devotion to the cause also found expression in a 1941 novel called Sixth Column, in which an enemy Heinlein describes as PanAsians conquers the United States. A resistance movement emerges against what Heinlein insists on calling “the slantys,” who have brutally suppressed all freedoms and killed red-blooded Americans by the hundreds of thousands. The yellow peril has returned, Fu Manchu’s “hordes of Asia” are on the march, and Heinlein’s novel swims in the same cultural sludge as Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient.” Heinlein ingested all the libertarianism of Campbell. American success in the Second World War led him to add a fascination with brutal combat and military might. By the 1950s, Heinlein’s convoluted worldview can best be described as militaristic libertarianism, a challenging intellectual hobbyhorse to ride given that he had to square the idea of rugged individualism with a very powerful national security state. He managed it over decades and hundreds of thousands of words. The acceptance of America’s military power, and the communist threat, sometimes appeared allegorically in sci-fi horror films, as in the film Invaders from Mars (1953), in which science and the quick intervention of the armed forces save the United States. But the flood tide of such films sometimes ignored allegory altogether. The low-budget crowd-pleaser Project Moonbase (1953), story and screenplay by Heinlein, told of a distant future of 1970 in which a human being recently orbited earth. The astronaut responsible is the female Colonel Briteis, whose accomplishments in that future world do not protect her from egregious sexual harassment from her rival, Major Moore, who insists on calling her Colonel Bright Eyes, or her commanding general, who threatens to spank her. The film sends Moore and Briteis on a mission to the moon with a scientist who turns out to be a Russian spy. Crash-landing on the lunar surface, the Soviet agent dies, leaving Briteis and Moore stranded. But, so it turns out, that’s all to the good. Their commanding general orders them to set up “Moon Base One,” which will be a “perpetually menacing eye in the sky” to all “the enemies of freedom.” It’s Wernher von Braun’s dream of deadly orbital weapons platforms, a dream that would become one of the far right’s enduring fantasies in America. Meanwhile, the Pentagon orders the marriage of Colonel Briteis and the Major for the sake of “public opinion.” Briteis breathlessly accepts. Heinlein wrapped the film’s script by having the Pentagon promote Major Moore to brigadier general, ensuring he properly outranks his wife as they embark on their mission to protect “the safety of the free world.” In other words, raining down H-bombs on any “enemies of freedom” who might challenge American hegemony. The politics of empire appeared outside of Heinlein’s fictional worlds in his emerging activism. In 1958, he took out an ad in his local Colorado newspaper entitled “Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?” The tract—a response to his estranged friend Isaac Asimov’s involvement in the effort to convince Eisenhower to unilaterally end nuclear testing—urged Americans to accept the risks of nuclear war gladly. Heinlein insisted that even if the “willfully distorted” claims about the outcome of an atomic exchange were true, it would be preferable to “Communist enslavement.” Better irradiated than Red.34 The United States did not end unilateral testing but did enter an advantageous three-year test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Heinlein took no pleasure in this. Campbell suggested to him that his ad would do little good since, Campbell insisted, “the Common man” was in control and had no idea of “the systems he’s controlling.” Heinlein agreed and over the next decade wrote two novels that are manifestos as much as fiction. Starship Troopers appeared in 1959, imagining a future world where one can only exercise the right of suffrage if one engages in “Federal Service”—joining an interstellar military to wage a war of containment and conquest against insectoid aliens. The novel imagines a young male with little personal discipline, a little like a young Heinlein, transformed into a warrior by training and combat. The “Bugs” that the trooper and their massive fleet slaughter in droves are rather obvious representations of the American right’s understanding of the communist world—unthinking drones, they only follow their leader’s aggressive tendencies. Heinlein and his legion of fans mostly failed to notice that the starship troopers do much the same. The wildly successful novel became a model for a subgenre of militaristic science fiction, often with a right-wing slant, that burgeoned in popularity by the 1980s. Heinlein also single-handedly created the “space marine” trope that would appear everywhere from the sequel to Alien to video game franchises like Doom and Halo. Few admirers of the book and its many imitators noticed that Heinlein’s libertarian paradise where you earned your citizenship with violence looked very much like a totalitarian state. Several years later, in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Heinlein published Farnham’s Freehold (1964). The hero of the novel takes his rather nontraditional kinship group into a shelter while an atomic war rages above. As the atomic holocaust obliterates most life on earth, Farnham holds forth to his mistress, both sexy and a dutiful listener, about how the war would ensure “good genetics” since only the intelligent prepared properly while billions died aboveground. The United States was, he insists, “breeding slaves” but the war would create a “genetically purified” environment. In Heinlein’s survivalist fantasy, that’s exactly what happens. Rather than a radioactive wasteland, the new world is idyllic. Farnham’s compound becomes a refuge for “freedom loving peoples everywhere” where American flags fly and yet no government exists to collect taxes. Farnham’s Freehold shows the influence of Campbell, especially in its portrayal of Black people. The major obstacle to true paradise in Farnham’s “purified” world is a Trans-African Empire that enslaves whites and, indeed, cannibalizes them. In this white supremacist nightmare, white men are castrated, and their women used as sex slaves. We are back with Fu Manchu calling for the destruction of the white man and the “taking of his women.” The novel ends the only way it can. Farnham builds a wall around his paradise of one. Heinlein’s mentor was lost in racist fantasies. As Astounding/Analog sales declined and Campbell began to drink more heavily, he frequently used fan conventions to spew racist bile. In 1965, he proclaimed that the upheaval in Watts over police brutality proved that African Americans needed slavery in order to control their impulses. He regularly ranted against the most moderate aspects of the civil rights movement.35 An aging Campbell feared the world of the 1960s. His protégé, Heinlein, saw in a new, dangerous world the consummation of some of his darkest dreams. Heinlein would in turn stand as godfather to a new generation of writers, one in particular who would have some influence over American foreign policy. The United States didn’t have to fear the horrors from deep space. Perhaps the country could embody that horror to its enemies. By the 1960s, American military, economic, and diplomatic muscle reshaped the politics and even the geography of whole regions of the globe. The country had begun its journey to this apogee in 1917 and now its global reach fertilized poison flowers on almost every continent. But many Americans heard the weird carnival calliope tingling in the night air and sweated in fear. A letter to Time magazine, appalled at America’s use of the bomb, insisted that their own country represented “the new brutality” in the world, “a Frankenstein’s monster” committing crimes that could never be erased.36 Frankenstein’s monster offered the perfect metaphor for what the United States would next unleash. 9.Crime, Sadism, Monsters, Ghouls, Corpses ROBERT A. HEINLEIN and John W. Campbell’s vision of military might slaughtering insectoid monsters faced some ideological competition in the growing world of horror culture. Comic books, for a time after World War II, presented an alternative vision of the world and, in fact, of American history and society. Tobe Hooper and George A. Romero learned a different America from the gory panels of these comics. They met an America that didn’t deserve its imperial status, that clawed its way to power through a mound of corpses. Crime and horror comics, many of them appealing to adults as much as to children, challenged the popularity of superhero and funny animal stories that once dominated the genre. In the early fifties, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein took Entertaining Comics, popularly known as EC, in a direction they called the “new trend.” Inspired in part by 1930s and ’40s horror radio dramas like Lights Out and Inner Sanctum, they created horror comics that cast a gruesome shadow over the sunnier disposition American popular culture projected in the 1950s. In their title Crime Patrol, usually a collection of police procedurals and detective tales, they introduced stories with titles like “Return from the Grave” and “The Spectre in the Castle.” Crime Patrol became The Crypt of Terror just as their popular War Against Crime title became Vault of Horror.37 These comics mixed tales of familial discord inevitably leading to gruesome murders with stories of undead ghouls clawing out of the grave to harry the living. In the first style of story, Brooklyn-born EC artist Jack Kamen quipped that “there was no such thing as a happy couple household in EC” and remembered illustrating story after story in which couples “were always trying to bump each other off.” Such stories gleefully contradicted the postwar images of happy households, prosperous nests of male privilege, and consumerist fantasy, promulgated in advertisements, on television, and in popular magazines. The suburbs, where such fantasies allegedly took place, tamped down class conflict. For a brief period, the growing white American middle class tended to live side by side in nearly identical gimcrack homes with blue-collar workers seeming to have achieved a similar level of prosperity. In suburban sprawl, Harper’s Magazine insisted in 1953, “there is no wrong side of the tracks.” Such assertions would not age well as the muscle of American capital immiserated industrial workers and created a new economy by the 1970s. But for a time, the ability of most white suburban families to own a TV and an automobile and watch as their kids played together at backyard barbeques suggested that capitalism, not its deadly Soviet rival, had ended class conflict.38 Horror comics questioned this rosy picture. In their pages, housewives weaponized their sparkling kitchen appliances to dismember, parboil, and blend to mush their problematic patriarchs. Parents found themselves the victims of misfit children. Men dug graves for their spouses in backyards, the stink of a rotting corpse intermingling with the smell of newly mown grass. 10.Two-Fisted Tales WAS THERE a political motive behind EC? On the one hand, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein appeared to adopt a smash-and-grab style of attack on popular attitudes with no clear political agenda. In an advertisement for new writers in the February 1954 issue of Writer’s Digest, Gaines asked prospective authors to recall that “We love walking corpse stories” and tales in which “the villain tries to get away with murder—and probably does. No cops and robbers stories. Virtue doesn’t have to triumph over evil.” In a time that worked assiduously to maintain a frozen smile, it’s impossible to overemphasize how much this represented a call for anarchy. Moreover, while EC has received understandable credit (or blame) for pioneering such stories, nearly 150 different horror comic titles appeared in the early fifties from their rivals, most reveling in the same kind of brutal art and gruesome storytelling. Sometimes much more specific political critique of the American empire appeared from EC. Readers, including a new wave of adult readers, began to see the EC brand as a mark of quality and maturity—not to mention bloody images and bleak ideas hard to find in other nooks and crannies of popular culture. Horror remained the primary draw, and few companies other than EC managed to come up with a continuing stream of exceptionally weird ideas, macabre humor, and unforgettable artwork. But the work of Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood ensured EC horror would be tinctured with an even stronger dose of cultural criticism than The Crypt of Terror or Vault of Horror. A series of comics took on American imperialism past and present, often telling truer tales of American history than most of the era’s school textbooks. Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat, titles that seemed to promise childish conceptions of war, carried a radically different message. Kurtzman, who authored most of EC’s war comics, grew up in Brooklyn and the Bronx in the 1920s and ’30s. His family left Odessa after World War I. His stepfather (his father died when Kurtzman was very young) regularly read the radical Daily Worker and could be described as an active socialist at a time when the movement conceived of itself as deeply American and patriotic. Kurtzman joined the army soon after high school. Although trained as a rifleman, his talents as an artist and writer soon found him illustrating posters and camp newspapers. Wallace Wood (known to everyone in the EC bullpen as Woody) grew up in Minnesota, graduating high school near the end of World War II. He served briefly in the Merchant Marine and then as a paratrooper in the Army Airborne. In his early work for EC, horror from and in space became his first love and he excelled in imagining Lovecraftian creatures rearing their oily tentacles and oozing green slime. But Woody’s turn to war comics made horror much more visceral and, along with Kurtzman, created what can only be described as anti-war war comics. Kurtzman told an interviewer in 1972 that “all our stories really protested war.” Woody covered the panels of EC’s war comics with decaying body parts and, in one particularly haunting tale of trench warfare in the First World War, featured a rat crawling out of an empty eye socket in no-man’s-land. Even a story of the Revolutionary War, “Pell’s Point,” questioned the values of a gung ho Continental Army soldier who ends up bayonetted in a foolish and pointless show of bravado.39 Most astonishing of all, a 1953 Kurtzman/Wood tale called “Atom Bomb” followed the daily life of a Japanese family in Nagasaki. Wood drew bodies swept into a sky on fire but also the slow death of radiation sickness that followed. Kurtzman ended the story by showing a young survivor but also recording the grim statistics of the blast.40 This comic masterpiece appeared at a time when very few Americans understood the consequences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The U.S. government made a full-throated effort to squelch information about the death toll of the bomb and the effects of radiation sickness. John Hersey’s book had already passed out of the American consciousness, and in fact historian Paul Boyer suggests its account may have allowed readers to face the horror of the A-bomb and then literally “close the book on that episode.”41 EC encouraged readers young and old to reopen the black book of American crimes. Both their war and horror lines joined in a full-frontal assault on the values and assumptions of white Americans in the 1950s. Why did anyone want to read an attack on their values? David Hajdu has suggested that the success of EC emerged out of the fear of the times. The empty-eyed corpses that shambled from panic to panel in EC and their competition “could not have been far removed from the readers’ mental pictures of their own fate in the wake of the nuclear holocaust.” Maybe at least some Americans were terrified of what their values might do to them and the world.42 Not surprisingly, the efforts of EC and its artists and writers attracted plenty of unwanted attention. The FBI briefly investigated EC in the final year of the Korean War. An April 29, 1952, memo from Hoover’s office suggested that the government might render a charge of sedition against Gaines and even specific artists. EC comics, the memo read, “tend to discredit the army and undermine troop morale.”43 Other comic publishers faced similar scrutiny, none more than Lev Gleason of Lev Gleason Publications. His company’s series Crime Doesn’t Pay seemed to promise a moral message in its very title. It told stories from the perspective of criminals themselves. Although Gleason could point to the fact that the characters in these books did face the consequences of their actions in the final panels, the stories tended to build sympathy for bank robbers and crime lords in a fashion not dissimilar from gangster pictures of the thirties such as The Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Gleason also faced intense personal scrutiny from the FBI, who closely monitored his activities during World War II. In December of 1943, Hoover sent a memo to the special agent in charge of the New York bureau ordering the office to “immediately open a case” on Gleason that would “develop fully all information on his Communist activities.” Gleason does not seem to have ever been a member of the CPUSA, though he certainly worked with communists. The FBI investigation focused on three matters in particular: Gleason and his wife traveled to Mexico City for a meeting of an organization devoted to aiding refugees of the Spanish Civil War. He attended meetings of the left-wing Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. Most damning, from the perspective of Hoover’s men in black, Gleason wrote a letter to the editor of the Newcastle News that praised “our ally” the Soviet Union during World War II at a time when, in fact, the Soviet Union was our ally.44 The FBI lost interest in the investigation, possibly because heavier thunderheads emerged over the comics industry by 1953. A national panic developed over comics in the aftermath of the brutal but indecisive Korean War. Students of folklore describe such moments as a moral panic, a widespread sense that some kind of poisonous conspiracy planned to subvert society. A moral panic has far sharper incisors than what’s sometimes called an urban legend. A panic may begin with the sharing of baseless stories told as personal anecdotes. But it ends with legal and political authorities taking such stories seriously and announcing to the public that some insidious danger threatens the very foundations of national life. The great comic book scare had numerous sources in the 1950s. The actual content, both imagery and text, played more of a role than the problematic idea of “mass hysteria.” EC and their many imitators really did challenge some of the basic values of America’s dominant culture; in the lurid beauty of their pages, American family life became an abattoir, with spouses plotting each other’s demise while teenage rebellion took the form of homicide. The angry dead refused to stay in their graves, a disturbing image at any time but particularly after a half century of corpses being produced by global war. Artists suggested that war and the military represented pointless bloodletting and institutionalized sadism. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee led an investigation of possible links between what the era called “juvenile delinquency” and comics. His committee soon moved on to an investigation of organized crime for which he became famous. But the grassroots hand-wringing of parents, clergy, and civic leaders continued, their fears blooming an angry red. Parochial schools and PTAs held public burnings of comics, and now and again parents took it upon themselves to purify their households of the comic scourge. Some of these burnings involved students allegedly gathering up offensive comics themselves, although David Hajdu’s interviews with participants at several of these local events revealed that many of the students never read the comics anyway, while some may have developed an interest in them while stoking the bonfires. At a Catholic high school in New Jersey, one alum remembered years later that as they stacked comics for incineration, a pile developed of “jungle books, with their covers of heroines swinging from vines in leopard-skin bikinis.” That particular pile disappeared, saved from the conflagration by “several of the young crusaders” who hid it “under a step in the boys’ lavatory.”45 The war against comics coalesced at the national level in a series of Senate hearings culminating in the industry creating their own Comics Code. EC refused to comply, only to find they’d been abandoned. They would turn to the magazine format with many in their stable of artists, like Wally Wood, working for companies that created horror magazines like Creepy and Eerie to continue the EC tradition. The size and the amount of text in the new magazines allowed them to operate safely outside the Comics Code. Twenty-six publishers assented to the code and incorporated the Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) to administer its standards. Charles F. Murphy, a judge with a particular concern for the alleged outbreak of juvenile delinquency, headed the association. Most publishers felt they could keep sales up by sanitizing their comics while also destroying competitors who essentially depended on crime and horror fantasy. In a move that clearly suggested this mercenary motive, one of the first provisions of the new code banned the use of even the words horror and terror. The German émigré Fredric Wertham has usually been presented as the villain behind the death of EC’s glory days. His November 1953 Ladies’ Home Journal article “What Parents Don’t Know About Comic Books” appeared to lend scientific justification for parental anxiety. The book born from his somewhat limited reading of comics bore the dangerously sensationalist title Seduction of the Innocent. Wertham’s book appeared at a time when local police produced public service announcements like the Inglewood, California, police department’s “Boys Beware,” which insisted in the ugliest of terms that gay men are by definition sexual predators. Wertham’s willingness to tap into those dark energies remains unforgivable, particularly since it seems his own celebrity became his driving motivation as national fame beckoned.46 However, Wertham himself remains a complicated figure. He did not favor complete censorship of comics and his reputation as the incarnation of a killjoy has overshadowed his work on, for example, the Brown v. Board of Education case the same year he released Seduction of the Innocent. His work on Brown grew in part from the free psychiatric clinic he ran for African Americans in New York City, at a time when the Black community continued to be denied any access to mental health care beyond segregated and often brutal institutionalization. Influenced to some degree by the Frankfurt School’s critique of popular culture, he saw comics and television as narcotics for the masses, especially dangerous to the young.47 Wertham saved his harshest words for comics that related in any way to the supernatural. They were, he insisted, “horror, crime, sadism, monsters, ghouls, corpses dead and alive . . .” He unfortunately could not see that the best of these tales mirrored many of his own concerns over social justice and American apathy. In the many stories of nonconformist adolescents that peopled the pages of Vault and Crypt, parents are repeatedly shown as desensitized by exhausting work, television, and their afternoon martinis. EC even broached the topic of American racism at a moment when most white readers would have been unaware of a struggle for racial justice or its origins in the Civil War and Reconstruction era. The final comic published by the company in February of 1956, an issue of Incredible Science Fiction, featured a story called “Judgment Day!” in which a human astronaut visits a planet of orange automata that has long been at war with blue automata. The orange mechanicals, we learn, once enslaved their blue counterparts. The astronaut decides the planet has not advanced enough beyond the most savage prejudices to join an intergalactic alliance. As he blasts off to return to earth, he removes his helmet to reveal that he is an African American, a not-so-subtle note to the reader about the nature of the allegory they just read. The very moderate liberal appeal to tolerance in a science fiction tale proved too much for the CMAA. When Feldstein submitted the story for approval, Judge Murphy leaned back in his heavy leather chair and looked gimlet-eyed at the editor. “You can’t have a Negro,” Murphy declared flatly. Feldstein, genuinely shocked, asked what part of the Comics Code forbid the representation of Black people. Murphy said he had the authority to forbid it. Feldstein walked out. Back at the EC bullpen, the news made Gaines something more than furious. He was finished with comics. He let Murphy know that he planned to hold a press conference describing the effort to censor “Judgment Day!” and tell anyone who would listen that the Comics Code apparently had a deeply racist agenda. Murphy called Gaines and announced a sudden change of heart, but he bizarrely suggested that the final panel should be fine as long as the artist removed the beads of sweat popping from the character’s forehead. Apparently, Murphy considered an African American man sweating in a comic too suggestive. “Fuck you,” Gaines said, and slammed down the phone.48 EC published the story with only one change. Feldstein called attention to the controversial perspiration by adding to the text that “the instrument lights [of the spaceship] made the beads of perspiration on his dark skin twinkle like distant stars.” Gaines had largely been right when he suggested that the Comics Code allowed for racist caricature. In fact, white supremacist fantasies, ignored by the conservative critics of comics, flourished in “jungle adventure” stories not dissimilar from the mad-scientist-zombie-jungle-horror films in the forties, fifties, and sixties (explored in the next section of this book). But Wertham is not guilty by association. Part of his critique of comics in general, if not EC in particular, concerned how “jungle adventure” tales affected the self-esteem of Black children and encouraged a rancid racism in their white counterparts.49 William W. Savage Jr. explained the racist assumptions of this comic genre well when he described, in his wonderfully researched and written Commies, Cowboys, and Jungle Queens: Comic Books and America, 1945–1954, the “jungle lords and ladies” that all imitated Tarzan in stories that regarded Black people as “a form of fauna” not so different from “lions, panthers, snakes, [and] elephants.”50 The incredibly creative and perhaps surprisingly socially conscious horror and crime comics created some interesting work. Fans of EC, for example, included what would become a new generation of horror film directors who would completely reimagine how to tell tales of terror in a darkened theater. George A. Romero even drew on the visual style of comics, noting how they had influenced the way he shot and edited Dawn of the Dead.51 Perhaps Wertham was correct that comic creators engaged in a spree of “horror, crime, sadism, monsters.” What he missed is that such stories grew directly out of the tortured history of the nation. By the 1960s, more and more Americans would come to agree with Malcolm X, and EC comics, that they’d been sold an “American dream” but found themselves in an “American nightmare.”",

      "content": "1.Unidentified THE MONSTERS usually came from Mars. The bloody iron oxide glow and association with the god of war made our closest planetary neighbor in the void a natural jumping-off point for an extraterrestrial invasion. H. G. Wells predicted just such an attack in his 1897 tale The War of the Worlds, appearing in serialized form to the British public the same year the world met Bram Stoker’s Dracula. In Wells’s original vision the Martians came thirsting for our blood. Dying on their moldering planet, like the rotting five-hundred-year-old warlord in the Carpathians, the aliens hungered for a literal fresh transfusion of life. Mars and Transylvania had one thing in common. The old cultures, in British imperial myth, wanted, depended on, the vitality of great Britannia. Americans proved willing to believe the same about their growing empire. In 1939, a radio play by Orson Welles’s The Mercury Theatre on the Air narrated a version of The War of the Worlds in a fashion that convinced at least some listeners that Martian death rays scoured the landscape of New Jersey. Welles saw his production as part of the coalition building that many left-leaning artists and activists pursued in the thirties, a broad anti-fascist front. So he must have been delighted that at least some listeners misheard the program in such a way as to believe that the Nazis invaded the East Coast. In the year 1947, invaders filled the skies over the forty-eight states. By the middle of the summer, newspaper accounts dubbed their touring vehicles “flying saucers.” Most agree that the term can be traced to the private pilot and U.S. Forest Service employee Kenneth Arnold, who saw “nine, bright, saucer-like objects” flying at “incredible” speeds. At the same time, the idea of saucer-like crafts played an important role in the pulp sci-fi and horror magazines of the twenties and thirties, ensuring that the idea already held some currency in American culture. Arnold’s supposed sighting made an ephemeral cultural image into an icon. The Chicago Sun reported on June 26 that Arnold insisted, based on his flight experience, that the object sighted near Mount Rainier moved at speeds exceeding 1,200 miles per hour. “It’s impossible,” Arnold admitted, “but there it is.”1 The U.S. military agreed with Arnold on the impossibility of such a craft. Officials connected to the newly created Air Force, formerly the Army Air Forces, overanxiously denied the existence of any actual craft buzzing around up there. They invented the term unidentified flying objects (UFOs) since they knew from their own experience that nothing kills enthusiasm like a military acronym. UFO stuck, becoming a permanent part of American popular culture and lexicon. The acronym lost its original bureaucratic origins and came to mean “visiting and/or invading extraterrestrials” in general parlance, contrary to Air Force hopes that it simply means a thing in the sky that doesn’t matter because we can’t identify it and could well be a weather balloon, a hallucination, or a simple trick of the light. Gritting their teeth, everybody in the Pentagon with less than four stars busily worked to convince Americans there was nothing to worry about. They failed spectacularly. Then, they succeeded beyond their wildest hopes. Was the newly inaugurated Pentagon hiding secrets? Yes. Did it have to do with alien craft, crashing with some regularity in the desert Southwest? Sadly, no. Most Americans, at first, did not assume that horrors from outer space accounted for what writers on the topic later dubbed the summer of the flying saucers. The Second World War convinced many that the sightings related to a new kind of superweapon. Perhaps surprisingly, few seem to have assumed that these vehicles flying around unidentified represented a Soviet plot. Kenneth Arnold himself sent a telegram to Wright Field in Ohio expressing his “disappointment” that the Air Force gave no confirmation of the origin of what he had seen since he “felt certain they belonged to our government.” Arnold hoped that the commanding general and the Air Force scientists would take his concerns more seriously since he assumed that he’d seen “an instrument of destruction meant to be used in combination with our atom bomb.” Shouldn’t the American people know about this?2 Truman’s burgeoning national security state thought there was plenty the American people did not need to know. In 1947, the National Security Act created the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon, putting in place a cooperative and unitary military command structure. At least that’s all the American public assumed had happened. And, anyway, the new legislation looked about as interesting as changes to an administrative flowchart. Most took little notice. In fact, the act allowed for a complete reorientation of foreign policy, extremely powerful institutions not answerable to the democratic process, and what amounted to the unconstrained ability to wage secret wars anywhere around the globe. Historian Tom Engelhardt writes that the National Security Council became, in effect, the president’s “second cabinet, coordinating domestic, foreign, and military policies beyond the oversight of Congress or the public.” The new National Security Agency (NSA) quickly became a clearing house of data on American citizens as well as foreign powers. Under the act, the NSA did not even have to reveal its existence to the American public until 1975.3 A single short paragraph in the act created one of the most powerful agencies in American foreign policy over the next seventy years, a secret army answerable primarily to the president and his advisors. The CIA became, in effect, a new, secret branch of the armed forces with a mission broadly defined as the “analysis” of intelligence and the dangerously vague permission to conduct “clandestine activities.” In 1949, a wave of bad news from the fluctuating fronts of the Cold War led to a bill that exempted the agency from having to disclose “its size, budget, operations, and sources.”4 The sweeping powers of the new agency deeply concerned many senior officials and military leaders, even if the American public paid very little attention. In some cases, this opposition amounted to administrative turf wars. Hoover seemed especially concerned about what would become of his beloved FBI. Other critics sounded off with more serious concerns about what the NSA meant for democracy. More traditional military leaders and a few in the press warned of the creation of “an American ‘Gestapo.’” Several months before the CIA began operations, George C. Marshall, the top American military commander in World War II and secretary of state in 1947, sent a private memorandum to Truman that said in part that “the powers of the proposed agency seem almost unlimited and need clarification.” There is no record of a response.5 The culture of secrecy that emerged with the National Security Act carried direct implications for what would become the new American fears of invaders in flying saucers. The entire intelligence community and the Air Force took an interest in the reported phenomenon, though not because they thought (or knew) that aliens regularly visited some of the most isolated parts of the United States. Instead, the national security state very much needed a panic-free American public to carry out the Cold War geopolitical agenda. Advantageously for America’s foreign policy commissars, the Greenbaum effect began to do its work. Flying saucer enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists, without fail, latched on to conspiracy folklore with no basis in reality or uncovered secrets the government barely tried to keep hidden. Over the decades since the 1950s, UFO fans have frequently become excited about various smoking guns they are pretty sure the Freedom of Information Act, or the FBI’s own decision to release documents digitally, has allowed them to find. Anyone enthusiastic over U.S. government conspiracies would require a serious stockpile of cork, yarn, and thumbtacks to make enough murder boards to cover them all. And yet, the Greenbaum effect prevented any serious research into truly troubling matters. The desire to ferret out state secrets seldom included an examination of assassinations and the overthrow of foreign governments, the meaning of various obscure treaties, or the involvement of the U.S. military all over the globe. Instead, visitors from other worlds became the consuming passion, surely to the delight of the alphabet agencies raised to life by the National Security Act. Meanwhile, the CIA provided the less suspicious elements of the American public with a phrase that also helped them ignore what their country was really up to in the world. CIA Dispatch #1035-960, now widely available, reveals that the agency encouraged the use of the term conspiracy theory by the shapers of American opinion. “Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose” the document code-named PSYCH reads. In a series of talking points, the document urges that “assets” in the American news media be told that conspiracy theories “appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”6 The creation of an American consensus of ignorance about the crimes of empire seemed complete. The Greenbaum effect ensured that absurdities about little green men and lizard people kept the tin foil hat crowd busy. Meanwhile, the very term conspiracy theory and its associations successfully inoculated more skeptical Americans against the horrors of American interventionism, conflating evidence-free nonsense with realities that hid in plain sight. The national security state squared a very dark circle. 2.Crash Landings THE FBI released an influential bread-crumb trail to nowhere, referred to as the Hottel memo or the Roswell memo, to an eager public in the late 1970s. In it there’s some red meat for anyone hoping for a close encounter of any kind. In March of 1950, the special agent in charge of the D.C. office, Guy Hottel, reported to J. Edgar Hoover a rumor circulating in New Mexico that “an investigator for the Air Forces stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered.” According to the story, beings “three feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture” occupied each craft. Hoover never ordered a follow-up on the vague hearsay.7 Sounds suspicious, doesn’t it? When news of the released memo spread, the faithful believed it confirmed a government cover-up with the mention of New Mexico proving it. The reason for this “aha!” lay in another obscure 1947 incident that occurred soon after Kenneth Arnold experienced his flying saucer sighting: an Air Force craft crashed at a ranch near Roswell. Locals took up Arnold’s language and spoke of a “flying disc.” The front page of the Roswell Daily Record on July 8 came emblazoned with the headline “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region.” The Army Air Force sought to tamp down the story by dismissing the crash as a failed weather balloon and that seemed the end of l’affaire Roswell. Few continued to hold much interest in Roswell until the Hottel memo. True believers circulated it widely to the delight of UFO fans, who crowed over the sudden, supposed proof of a government cover-up at Roswell—never mind that the alleged deception occurred three years before the field office director’s report. In 1980, Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, the former a paranormal enthusiast who previously wrote about the Bermuda Triangle and other alleged paranormal phenomena, published the hugely popular book The Roswell Incident. Their false assertions, allegedly based on interviews with numerous eyewitnesses but actually jerry-built from informal chats with people who claimed to know eyewitnesses or someone who knew an eyewitness, became the template for the idea of a government conspiracy to cover up the supposed crash and discovery of an alien craft in the New Mexico desert. Every decade or so, there’s new interest in Roswell. In the 1990s, more books, often making contradictory claims, appeared about the supposed crash. Many of these news books seem to have been fueled by the enormous popularity of the television series The X-Files (1993–2002), a brilliant twist on the police procedural. Running for nine seasons, plus two feature films and a reboot, the franchise made use of the era’s fascination with conspiracy and suppression of the truth. At least “truths” related to aliens and assorted cryptids . . . never coups, assassinations, or quotidian tales about the building of hundreds of U.S. military bases on foreign soil. In 2011, the FBI’s digital history project called the Vault created renewed interest in the old story. The Vault was a kind of image-building project for the FBI, a joint effort with the National Archives to release about seven thousand unclassified documents to the public. The Guy Hottel memo sent to Hoover in 1950 quickly became the most popular. Indeed, to the chagrin of the FBI, mainstream news outlets reported on the memo as if it suggested a cover-up of the Roswell incident, ignoring that it constituted a third- or arguably fourth-hand account of rumors of an incident that seemed to warrant no further investigation. In April of 2011, just as the FBI launched the Vault, an ABC news report entitled “FBI Vault Reveals UFO, Roswell Files” again linked the memo, now available for more than thirty years, to the possibility of a government cover-up. The reportage would have left most readers with the lingering suspicion that there was more to the story, especially since the director of the New York Center for Extraterrestrial Research was the single person ABC chose to interview in depth. Described with the grammatical conundrum “a UFO supporter,” he insisted that the news would force the government to come clean about the truth behind the flying saucers. In 2013, the FBI reported that the memo had been viewed nearly a million times. Roswell continues to be a popular topic among UFO enthusiasts and in popular culture. In 1999, a cult TV show called Roswell ran for three seasons. A remake of the series launched in 2019. Why do Americans care so much about these kinds of stories? In June of 1997, a CNN/Time poll found that three-quarters of respondents believed the government covered up the incident at Roswell. The same survey found, confusingly, that more of those polled believed in a Roswell cover-up than believed in extraterrestrial life. Apparently, this comes from a general sense that the U.S. government must be up to something. Maybe it’s aliens? As we’ve already seen, the birth of the national security state played a decisive role in both creating and sustaining these illusions. The people, or small movements, that have come to be known as conspiracy theorists actually exist in a peculiar symbiosis with the desire of the Cold War state to engage in actual, rather complex conspiracies. In fact, the semi-seriousness with which the Pentagon, the CIA, and the FBI took flying saucer sightings points to the real horror of the era. The government was, for example, utterly deceptive about the nature of the 1947 crash near Roswell when the Air Force described the wreckage as a weather balloon. In 1995, an Air Force report quietly explained the entire Roswell incident, an explanation disregarded or ignored by anyone more interested in little green men than the politics of the Cold War. The crash, wrote Air Force investigators, appeared “consistent with balloon devices and most likely from the MOGUL balloons that had not been recovered.” In other words, America’s Cold War with Russia and the need to keep the empire’s secrets played a crucial role in the belief that monsters were descending from the stars.8 Project Mogul launched at the end of World War II, a classified collaboration between the U.S. Army Air Forces and New York University that used large clusters of balloons and radar reflectors to trace seismic activity possibly indicative of a Soviet atomic test. Mogul long remained classified since it inaugurated decades of aerial espionage conducted against the Soviet Union. This would come to include an embarrassing May 1960 incident in which the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 spy plan in their airspace and captured the pilot, forcing Eisenhower to admit that such flights had been carried out for years.9 But far more Americans know about Roswell and its supposed alien connections than their country’s tendency to violate the rest of the world’s airspace with impunity. And far more care. Why is this so? The answer lies in the directions taken by American horror in the Cold War. It has its genesis in the fact that the worst possible thing really is the truth in the story of the American empire and the fact that Americans are quite comfortable not knowing that. 3.Lone Gunmen THERE ARE plenty of fringe theorists in America who believe an astonishing variety of nonsense. The American public mocks them and buys hundreds of thousands of copies of their books, listens to their podcasts, and watches hours of series that air, and re-air, every 1970s theory about extraterrestrial life. The television series Ancient Aliens has run for eighteen seasons on what purports to be the History Channel, despite its bizarre mix of creationism, contradictory claims, and junk science. In Smithsonian, science writer Riley Black memorably called the popular series “some of the most noxious sludge in television’s bottomless chum bucket.” In her detailed article she explains a multitude of manufactured truths and notes how frequently the show describes fundamentalist Christians without formal advanced degrees as “biblical archeologists” and “paleontologists.”10 The misinformation industry thrives off America’s juvenile dance between consumer and commodity. The authors of the Roswell paperbacks that began appearing in the eighties are both absurd and rich from the desire of Americans to hold on to modern myths. In fact, the success of their claims makes perfect sense in a country where millions believed in and spread music producer Ray Santilli’s 1995 alien autopsy hoax, including a former CIA scientist who insisted the footage was real even after the revelation that Santilli used a foam alien to create it. Then there are academics like Courtney Brown, of the prestigious Emory University, who claimed to use telepathy to learn the true nature of the Hale-Bopp comet . . . the same psychic talents he used to communicate with Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth (Brown assures us they are also aliens). And, of course, Cory Hammond, whose nightmare visions of Satanists, mind control, and the CIA question American covert actions and manage to find all the wrong answers. These examples are easy to mock. They also often find a large audience, have their speculations taken seriously by major news outlets, and earn an odd kind of belief by Americans who, looking at the maelstrom of history, politics, and science, are so baffled that they throw up their hands and mutter, “Well, it could be, I guess.” Meanwhile, mass culture phenomena from films like the The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and The Parallax View (1974) presented the possibility of American institutions subverted at the highest level, often by outside powers (an international communist conspiracy in the first and a corporation in the other). Like the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), anyone you know might be a pod person and woe betide you if you try to convince the authorities. Or, more likely in American life, you’ll be considered a delusional paranoid by consumers who also turn your book into a best-seller while a film adaptation goes into development. The official keepers of state secrets have, since the end of World War II, been perfectly content to allow such theories to spread. For all the latent American concern over conspiracy, and the occasional pop culture celebration of heroes trying to figure out the score (“The Truth Is Out There” became the most instantly recognizable tagline of The X-Files), the paranoia or simple intrigue shown by the American public never focuses on getting to the bottom of actual conspiracies. There’s certainly evidence that the caretakers of the national security state understood the power of promoting false conspiracies to cover real ones. In 1952, Walter Bedell Smith, once Eisenhower’s chief of staff and at that time serving as director of the CIA, suggested that the UFO had some real potential in advancing U.S. interests. He encouraged his top lieutenants to “discuss the possible offensive or defensive utilization of these phenomenon for psychological warfare purposes.”11 The flying saucers did offer a much-needed distraction. Indeed, during the period that Americans watched the skies for extraterrestrial invaders, the highest echelons of the U.S. government successfully created an infrastructure for clandestine terror, overthrew two elected governments and waged a guerilla terrorist campaign against another, all the while hiding significant facts about the use of atomic weapons. General public ignorance of these facts offers a clear example that Americans want their conspiracies to involve only aliens, international cabals, or both. We want the monster out there, not in here with us. We accept the apex predator in the water that we can kill but not the American myths of the frontier turned into a psychopath with a chain saw fetish. Thus, when a whistleblower shows us the truth that’s actually out there, as Edward Snowden did by revealing the National Security Agency’s PRISM program that collected cell phone data on most Americans with the cooperation of companies like Verizon, most Americans brand them as a traitor. Snowden had to go into exile or face conviction under the draconian 1917 Espionage Act. (Passed as the United States entered World War I, this act had been used to imprison anyone who opposed the country’s entrance into the conflict.) He was not asked to share his thoughts on the History Channel and his book did not become a mainstream best-seller available in cheap paperback editions. In the 1940s and 1950s, suggestions like Kenneth Arnold’s claims are what really concerned the newborn national security state. What did Americans know about the nation’s new superweapons? Most important, could a panic over their power be prevented or the terror they caused become part of the public relations arsenal needed to keep the Cold War at a low boil? In the late 1940s, the U.S. government began preparing to do some pretty nasty business at home and abroad. An informed public might demand an accounting of the new agencies that sprang into existence after the National Security Act. What would happen if Americans ever really came to grips with the reality of atomic weapons? Perhaps they would balk at the apocalypse. 4.The Creatures with Atom Brains!! WE KNEW radiation killed. It’s impossible to imagine the army of radioactive monsters that crawled, slithered, and skittered toward fifties horror fans without noticing the role of the bomb. Susan Sontag’s essay “The Imagination of Disaster” takes seriously the desire of American filmgoers to look at destruction, its possibility and its outcome. Sontag, and the ruminations of a hundred commentors on genre film, have insisted that the Cold War and sci-fi horror must be explained as allegories for aliens as communists and creature features as atomic anxiety. What was missed in trying to understand the need to screen apocalyptic horror is Sontag’s point that there’s a fantasy being lived in these films, as much as a set of anxieties about the bombs from the sky and reds under the beds. Had she pondered this fantasy over the decades, Sontag might have concluded that it’s a central tenet of the citizens of empire. The destruction of America, restaged and replayed again and again, became a symbol of undefined and inexplicable grievance. Despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, Americans since World War II imagined themselves as the victims on the world stage. In 1949, when a civil war overthrew the brutal and corrupt Chiang Kai-shek, America believed it “lost China.” We feared the Soviets during decades when they had no way to deliver their tiny nuclear arsenal to the American mainland. Defeat in Vietnam became a myth of betrayal and victimization. The country’s culture remains beset with an unhealthy neurosis that allows it to ignore the overwhelming hegemony it exercises over most of the people on earth. The only country ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population has a fortress mentality, an inexplicable seething rage against the world. The country did not collectively forget its conscience in 1945. The bomb became a moral issue for millions of Americans after the elation over the war’s end. Close to the one-year anniversary of the first bomb falling on Hiroshima, the New Yorker published John Hersey’s account of the effects of the new weapon. Hersey forced Americans to wonder about the decision to use the bomb, his spare prose making it clear that Hiroshima was anything but a giant military base. The emotional effect of his article, soon published as a best-selling book, grew from his intimate portrayal of the effects of radioactivity on six survivors. Hersey, without falling into sentimentalism, described the deteriorating health of the six in ways that horrified readers. Readers learned that the bomb’s aftereffects included the rapid degeneration of stem cell tissue as the phosphorus in their bodies caused bones to glow hot with radiation. Their blood boiled with poison. Hersey reported that men had become sterile while young women simply ceased menstruating. Victims suffered intense pains from burns that had depilated skin down to cartilage. Hersey taught Americans the phrase radiation sickness. His work carefully, and sometimes even dryly, documented how the weaponized dust and debris, ionized with radium, that emerges out of the heart of an atomic explosion eviscerates human cells and mutates DNA. Perhaps for the first time in their lives, many Americans found themselves confronted with the Japanese people as human beings. But we must be careful. It would be easy to overstate the effect of Hersey’s book, and the efforts of other critics of the atom bomb. The sense of outrage over Pearl Harbor, and a profound lack of knowledge about the diplomatic and strategic context of the attack, clouded moral reasoning about the use of such a weapon. Americans already accepted the idea of LeMay’s “terror bombing,” a practice that actually killed more civilians than the twin A-bomb attacks in August of ’45, and, to many, the mass murder at Hiroshima and Nagasaki seemed like a quicker and more efficient version of the deadly air campaigns. Not everyone, even those who pondered Hersey’s spare but muscular account, came to grips with the fact that the bomb secreted a deadly element that rewrote DNA sequences, mutating human beings at the level of their basic code. Radiation killed tens of thousands in the months and years after the bombings. “So what?” many thought, and either put down Hersey’s book or never read it in the first place. After all, hadn’t the use of weapons of questionable morality already been a part of America’s “good war”? Marine and army forces from Guadalcanal to Tarawa to Okinawa deployed the flamethrower, a weapon repeatedly condemned in the twenties and thirties by the world community after its use in World War I. Wielded by a single soldier or marine, the fearful weapon incinerated the “bug hives,” pillboxes that held Japanese soldiers, portrayed in propaganda cartoons as an inhuman, insectoid enemy fanatically willing to die for the emperor. For many Americans, the bomb just seemed a bigger and bolder version of such tactics. In fact, perhaps one of the most common comments about the bomb in politics and journalism after August of ’45 touted it as an example of American know-how. The scruples shown by at least a sliver of the American public in the few years after their country dropped the world’s first atomic device went into a political coma after the Soviet Union announced it had atomic weapons. Code-named First Lightning, the American intelligence community also called the device Joe-1 in recognition that Joseph Stalin now possessed the bomb. The American public’s response contained the peculiar mixture of nationalist bravado and sheer panic that came to represent the American state of mind in the years after World War II. Less than a month after American spy planes detected Joe-1’s radioactive trail, Democratic senator of Connecticut Brien McMahon warned Americans against complacency and insisted that the development of conventional and atomic weapons must continue. An arms race had become central to preserving American prerogatives. McMahon’s view got the most attention, as it offered a narrative of immediate threat. In the meantime, no one paid any attention to the numerous scientists calling for a sweeping internationalization of scientific research and shared risk instead of national self-interest. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who became a critic of the Pentagon’s use of the weapon he played a pivotal role in creating, found himself stripped of his security clearance. After his last, difficult meeting with Harry Truman, the president told aides never to let that “son of a bitch” appear on his schedule again. The president, who, as a young man, wished the Great War to last longer so he could kill more Germans, didn’t care for the scientist’s moral scruples.12 The country seemed ready to enjoy Sontag’s imagination of disaster. In 1955, Creature with the Atom Brain became one of the many films to imagine a mad scientist who uses radiation for apocalyptic designs, specifically raising the dead. The villain of the piece is a Nazi scientist or, in other words, precisely the kind of person working on America’s radioactive arsenal through the auspices of Operation Paperclip. Viewers watched this peculiar reflection of reality on a double bill with It Came from Beneath the Sea, a tale of nuclear submarines and giant cephalopods weaponized by radiation. Though these seem like modern fairy tales concerned with the dangers of atomic weapons, their celebration of American military power left audiences assured of the need for America’s full-spectrum dominance. 5.We Gratefully Acknowledge the Cooperation of Those in Authority SCIENCE FICTION horror already worked to encourage trust in the national security state. In 1950, hoping to build on the “summer of the flying saucers” and the continuing alleged sightings, a tiny production company called Colonial Productions made the first feature film to deal with the phenomenon. They called it The Flying Saucer. Colonial included patriotic text at the film’s beginning that read, “We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of those in authority” for making the picture possible. “Those in authority” could not help being pleased with the film’s message, which combined action and America triumphing over their enemies with tough-guy antics and technological acuity. The Flying Saucer opens with sightings of the eponymous craft over a number of American cites. An unnamed American spy agency, clearly the new CIA, enlists Mike Trent, “a playboy, sportsman, and two-fisted drinker,” to investigate sightings in Alaska. Ominously for the logic of the Cold War, “undercover agents in a communist group” in Juneau were trying to locate and learn the tech behind the alien craft since it offered “a perfect delivery system” for the A-bomb. The intrepid Trent, after some romantic adventures and fisticuffs with Russian spies, discovers that an American scientist, not extraterrestrials, developed the saucer. This nod to Kenneth Arnold’s suspicions about a U.S. superweapon is tamped down as the last minutes become a race to prevent the Soviets from stealing the saucer (small enough to conceal in the basement of a log cabin). One communist agent briefly absconds with the craft, but the American scientist has rigged it to explode. Proclaiming “all of that settled,” playboy Trent decides to marry his blonde CIA handler and all’s well. The slipshod production of The Flying Saucer—probably at least thirty minutes of the hour-and-fifteen-minute running time is filled out by aerial and landscape footage of Alaska—did not prevent it from becoming a drive-in theater standby and even a mention, if a rather acidic one, in The New York Times (“A film called ‘The Flying Saucer’ flew into the Rialto yesterday,” wrote critic Bosley Crowther, “and . . . it can go right on flying”).13 Whatever the Times thought of it, an American public nervous that Joseph Stalin had an A-bomb proved ready for a flood tide of films featuring alien aggression and radioactive monsters, usually with a thinly veiled Cold War message. The basic formula for most science-fiction horror films of the decade uses the first act to introduce a threat from beyond the stars or, somewhat ironically, from under the sands of “the West,” a New Mexico of the mind where audiences would vaguely remember the Trinity test exploded the bomb into the world. In act two, Washington learns of the threat (usually because of a child or a scientist or a child and a scientist, almost always in a small town), and the filmmaker inserts World War II or Korean War footage to show tank treads rolling formidably in a long steel line, jeeps filled with combat troops, and a general mobilization against the threat. The scientist, sometimes with the help of another very pretty scientist/soon-to-be love interest, engineers a way the army can destroy the flying saucers or the giant ants or the mutated octopi. In the last act, the army, with a bit of scientific can-do, destroys the threat in a Hiroshima strike against the extraterrestrials. Sometimes there’s fallout, literal fallout, but that’s the price of peace. The success of these films, and the hundreds of them made between 1950 and about 1968, is equal parts celebration of American empire building and assurance from “those in authority” that the U.S. military could defeat any threat. The year 1949 had become a crucial turning point in American public opinion regarding the Cold War, a hardening of attitudes that overdetermined the political possibilities of the country for decades to come. The fantasy of disaster, the fantasy of being both victim and conqueror, played out on thousands of screens almost every night through the first two decades of the Cold War. America the victimized saw its post–World War II preeminence under siege. In the same year that Stalin could celebrate his nation being able to explode an atom bomb, the communist revolution in China headed by Mao-Tse Tung succeeded. This created shock and surprise in the United States, and perhaps even in Mao himself. Mao’s revolution solidified the American foreign policy establishment’s aggressive stance against an alleged international communist conspiracy. The somewhat moderate policy of “containment” advocated by George F. Kennan in ’46 called for a sort of diplomatic and economic seawall raised against a rising red tide. Many foreign policy wonks, and an increasingly paranoid right wing in both major political parties, entertained the possibility of communist influence at the highest levels of government. The phrase domino theory percolated among elites and soon the public, the logical fallacy of the slippery slope turned into a geopolitical confession of faith. If one country “went communist,” its neighbors would also tip over, one after another, into a sea of red. It’s a fantasy of loss of control, the need of empires through history to see every small act of independence as a threat. The United States had, in fact, already declared its vision of the postwar world, where if any nation refused the country’s influence, they were, by definition, a tool of Moscow. In 1946, Truman called for a massive aid package to the right-wing monarchy of Greece. The Greek government faced a communist insurgency comprised mostly of partisans who fought against the Nazis with Allied help since 1941. Stalin, perhaps the least revolutionary leader on the planet, took little interest in the conflict but did react with horror to Truman’s characterization of it. In a 1947 stem-winder of a speech, given to a joint session of Congress but directed at the Kremlin, the American president described the “terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists” who threatened “the very existence of the Greek state.” But he went further. “I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” The cynical use of rhetoric about “free peoples” aside, this seemed both a threat to Moscow and a declaration of war against the revolutionary aspirations of people from Africa to Asia to Latin America who labored under the centuries-old yoke of European imperialism. The Truman doctrine made it clear how America would use its military and economic power to stack the dominoes any way it wanted to. The United States pursued a course in Greece, soon to become a familiar pattern, in which American “advisors” and military hardware arrived in 1947 to prop up the repressive, but anti-communist, regime. The conservative Greek government survived to place in power a menagerie of criminals, economic oligarchs, and even some Nazi collaborators who earned U.S. approbation for their virulent anti-socialism.14 In Asia, Truman and his National Security Council poisoned relations with China for decades. The 1950 deployment of U.S. troops to South Korea to defend it against invasion from the communist North Korea fell within the parameters of “containment.” However, early successes led General Douglas MacArthur and some of Truman’s closest advisors to urge a full-scale invasion of North Korea, despite China’s explicit warning they would intervene if the United States took this step. American troops crossed the thirty-eighth parallel in the summer of 1950. In response, Chinese forces threw a punishing haymaker of an assault that forced the American army into retreat and even retook the South Korean capital of Seoul. After two years of talks, the deaths of 33,686 American soldiers, and perhaps as many as four million Korean dead in both the North and South, the conflict ended with the divided country having essentially the same borders it did in 1950 and a heavy, permanent American military presence along the restored border. Nearly every major city on the peninsula lay in ruins from American air power. Millions faced starvation. The city of Wonsan endured a forty-one-day, nearly twenty-four-hour shelling from American battleships that U.S. Rear Admiral Allan E. Smith concluded had been the longest and most destructive naval bombardment in human history.15 The catastrophic circumstances strengthened the hand of the most reactionary elements of the North Korean state. Today it remains one of the most isolated and repressive countries on earth. Generations of leaders with a bizarre, semi-mystical version of communism that ritualized a cult of personality around the “Dear Leader” rule an impoverished nation that’s nevertheless well on its way to becoming a nuclear power. The Korean War grimly affected U.S. foreign policy and democratic institutions. The specter of defeat after the Chinese intervention caused discontent and outright fear at the Pentagon and in the administration. Truman suggested at a news conference that field commanders could authorize the use of nuclear weapons and mused in his diary about a new Hiroshima that might bring a quick end to the conflict. The United States readied atomic weapons at bases in Japan. In the spring of 1951, the Joint Chiefs ordered an atomic attack on Manchuria—the very region where Chinese troops first fought the Japanese invasion as American allies—if China sent in more troops to consolidate its early gains. Paradoxically only the fanaticism of MacArthur caused the administration to pause. MacArthur wanted to go nuclear on China and the Soviet Union, and apparently he floated a plan to irradiate much of Asia in order to make a point. In pushing back against this psychotic suggestion, the Truman administration decided to stick with conventional warfare rather than annihilate the Korean peninsula.16 Defense spending boomed. The United States held a stockpile of two hundred atomic weapons in 1949. By 1960, when Kennedy claimed that Republicans had allowed a “missile gap” with the Soviet Union, America possessed eighteen thousand atomic devices. The idea of the missile gap emerged, according to the most distinguished historian of the CIA, from unsubstantiated claims by the agency, the USAF, and the defense industry that the Russians had five hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) able to strike anywhere in the United States. They actually possessed four, and three of those might not have made it off the ground. The Soviet Union would not achieve anything like missile parity until the late 1970s.17 The United States also accelerated research and testing of the hydrogen bomb, triumphantly called “the super bomb” by many in the defense establishment. First tested in the Pacific in the fall of ’52, the device contained one thousand times the force of the weapon dropped on Hiroshima. A crater that yawned two miles wide and almost a mile deep appeared on Enewetak Atoll and gave some hint of the new weapon’s power. Polls suggested that a slim majority of Americans wanted to see an end to nuclear testing. At the same time, sheer, unstoppable military power had come to hold a special place in the American people’s hearts. Paul Fussell describes the enormous tonnage of explosive power placed in the hands of individual America GIs that left Europe a scarred and blasted landscape. He writes that, despite hours of “marksmanship” practice U.S. soldiers engaged in with their M1 carbines, ace shooting and battlefield tactics became passé when “mass wiping-outs, artillery stonks, and frontal flamethrower assaults” could do the job. By late 1944, Europe looked as if the no-man’s-land of the Great War metastasized across the continent, enveloped major cities, and rolled over every acre of farmland and factory district. The men who fought the war, the staff officers who took note of the effect of the unfettered violence, and the commanding generals who ordered mini apocalypses unleashed on ancient European cities all came home with a deep appreciation for the American military machine’s ability to blow the absolute hell out of any obstacle and burn alive any possible threat.18 Horror science fiction accepted the logic of total military supremacy as well, especially when tied to the can-do spirit of science, often evoking the image of the scrappy American inventor. This archetype of the heroic innovator had long held a special place in American mythology. The new style of scares, with a few cinematically interesting exceptions, showed us a new kind of scientist, the opposite of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his crew of doubting Thomases. These new scientists work with the military, they answer to the call of duty, and there’s no question whose side they are on. The mad scientist had transformed into the patriotic scientist or simply the compliant one. Stanley Kubrick’s dark comedy Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb didn’t appear until 1964. By then, as the director well knew, too many Americans had developed a peculiar affection for the bomb. A popular flick called The Atomic Submarine appeared in 1959, and at the time, probably moved at least as many Americans as Kubrick’s arty, over-the-top parody. The Atomic Submarine took some cues from The Flying Saucer, even as it reimagined the alien invasion story by adding some Arctic adventure and even more slack-jawed militarism. The story involved the North Pole becoming a kind of Devil’s Triangle where American ships and subs have begun to disappear. Surely it must be some Soviet plot, and so the USS Tigershark, christened by the film “the deadliest atomic submarine in the U.S. fleet,” goes to investigate. The building of the USS Nautilus, the first submarine to use atomic power, inspired the film. The navy sent the sub to the Arctic waters in an effort not to find commies or to fight flying saucers, but to break submersion records and become the first watercraft to reach the geographic North Pole. The first attempt failed in July of 1958. A second effort succeeded, and the Eisenhower administration hoped the mission would counter the world’s perception of superior Soviet technology after the successful launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957. The Atomic Submarine also coiled into the belly of Cold War politics. A civilian peacenik scientist joins the crew for unconvincing plot reasons. He stands in for every member of the scientific community who warned about the effects of atom bombs and, in fact, exactly the kind of submarine he finds himself aboard. A chisel-chinned officer declares that the scientist’s anti-war statements are “open propaganda” and, worse, that he even shamed his own high-ranking naval officer dad into retirement and ill health. According to chisel-chin, the “press got in on it” and declared the scientist’s father “a warmonger.” Nonsense. In the actual 1950s, what destroyed Joseph McCarthy was not his disregard for civil liberties or even his grotesque, bullying public image. No one blinked an eye when he accused private citizens, or most of the State Department, of treasonous behavior. But when he went after the army, he went too far. The military may have been, other than Billy Graham, the decade’s most respected public institution. The Tigershark discovers a flying saucer at the North Pole inhabited by a tentacled one-eyed beanstalk intent on prepping planet earth for colonization. An intercontinental ballistic missile destroys the craft, but the sailors simply call it an ICBM without giving any explanation of what this meant. Clearly, the acronym had become as well known to the American public as UFO. A new mass militarism meant movie producers could count on their drive-in audience knowing the utter devastation such a device could wreak. There’s no room for dissenting voices aboard America’s atomic submarine. If you wanted to be a real American, not a communist flunky or worse, you had to come along fully for the ride. In the final scene, the peacenik scientist accepts atomic weapons as at least a necessary evil, admitting that “guys like the sailors” aboard the Tigershark, guys willing to unleash weapons of apocalyptic power when the order comes down, can save “us” from the invaders. America was not going to take any shit. 6.The Midnight Monster Show AMERICANS FROM all walks of life now believed they saw flying saucers, or flying somethings, careening across the skies. Films—not the ones best produced and now recalled as classics like The Thing from Another World (1951) or Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), but low-budget screamers, quickly produced and distributed widely and repeatedly at double bills in traditional theaters—helped shape the perception of these not-very-close encounters into alien invasions. But Martians or Venusians or the occasional unnamed extraterrestrial empire hungry for earth’s lifeblood provided many Americans with only some of the strange solaces of horror. The shiny steel surfaces of the flying saucer, mimicking the curvaceous modernism of both household appliances and the postwar automobile, took up only part of the shadows of the American mind. During the Second World War, Americans could venture out to venues on the home front to discover the frightful delights of horror’s first golden age. The monsters of their youth might have been cavorting with Abbott and Costello. But in cities and small towns across the country, the so-called spook show became a popular attraction, delivering live-action versions of the increasingly placid, predictable American horror film. In some respects, these local performances helped horror survive in the age of Frankenstein engaging in hijinks with Lou and Bud. Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors brought dark carnival delights across the country beginning in the 1940s. Dr. Silkini was actually Jack Baker from Toledo, Ohio. Baker’s show became the most popular of its kind, lasting until 1963. The traveling horror show included some traditional magic tricks, a séance played for laughs, and the occasional gag, like promising to show the audience an actual dead body only to lift the veil on a frozen chicken. But Baker served audiences some pretty strong stuff that went beyond these hijinks. He called the show’s most potent trick the Blackout, a skit in which he or one of his performers threatened to throw live snakes into the audience and then cut the lights, leading to inevitable screams as he flung a heavy, damp rope into the sudden darkness. Dr. Silkini really gave his audience the business at the show’s climax. The stage became a grand guignol gathering of what looked to be body parts in an art deco lab familiar to fans of the era’s many mad scientist films. Working with a hunchbacked assistant, Silkini brought the body to life with a fog and fireworks show of sparks and miniature explosions and Frankenstein’s monster himself. The monster would gruesomely strangle the hunchback and then shamble toward the audience just as Silkini dropped all the lights in the house. Screams edging into utter panic always followed. Universal Studios took a dim view of the unlicensed use of one of their marquee characters. However, Silkini managed to convince the studio’s legal department to allow him the rights to the character. Universal may have rightly understood that the popularity of the shows kept their classic monsters in undead circulation. In fact, Universal’s 1944 House of Frankenstein made use of a traveling midnight show (its ghost host played malevolently by Boris Karloff) in what seems a reluctant tribute to the rising popularity of Silkini and his many imitators. In fact, rescreening of classic, and perhaps some not-so-classic, horror films went hand in skeletal hand with the midnight shows. Silkini introduced the practice of “midnight bicycling” in which he rented out one venue to startle and entertain with his magic show and monster mash as well as a nearby movie palace the audience could bicycle to directly after his stage show to eat popcorn as eagerly as they gobbled down a horror film or bleak murder mystery. The midnight shows brought delicious excitement to small towns throughout the United States. Their appeal went beyond, and blended with, the outré character of the entertainment. The conventions of the event allowed teenagers, adults, and children to ignore curfew, young couples copping feels in the shadowy privacy of theaters while kids bicycled across town in the small hours. It’s challenging for contemporary readers to grasp how, in the quiet and often very homogenous town of the fifties, this allowed for a carnivalesque atmosphere edged with terror. But this was a white empire at play . . . and so not open to everyone. Segregation excluded many Americans from enjoying the pleasures of the midnight monster shows. During the height of Silkini and his many imitators’ popularity, state laws throughout the South and parts of the Midwest segregated all public spaces. De facto segregation in much of the rest of the United States prevailed. When Dr. Morris and His Weird House of Horrors brought their midnight show to the New Bern Theatre in North Carolina, the advertised “frightmare of monsters” was a whites-only affair. A poster for a “Mammoth Horror” event at the old vaudeville theater in Fort Smith, Arkansas, told “colored folks” that they would have to come to their own “exclusive”—that is, Jim Crow—performance.19 American racism brought out other ugly elements of the American id, fueling the empire’s suspicion and arrogance. In the atmosphere of the Cold War, seething prejudices against Asians and Asian Americans intertwined with the monster shows. The horror of movie monsters and dark magic mixed with a blighted representation of the enemies of the empire. A new midnight monster show illustrated this sinister side of the monstrous fun. In June of 1950, Bill Sachs reported for Billboard magazine that he recently caught Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient,” a “45-minute display” making its way through Kansas and Missouri. Sachs records the impressions of a reporter named Ray Amy, who watched what he described as “the snappiest and most clean cut of its type I’ve ever seen” in Kansas City in the early summer.20 Los Angeles–based Frank Chan performed as the villainous Chan Loo. Chan began his career as a magician working in the late 1930s at a tourist trap its promoter called China City. Developer Christine Sterling successfully created a kind of virtual Spanish mission on Olvera Street, a faux-historical rendition of a romanticized “mission days,” as cultural tourism usually termed the period that ignored the real costs of the conquest of California: destruction of Indigenous peoples and their culture by the spread of smallpox and forced baptisms that harried the region’s Chumash, Tataviam, and Tongva peoples like twin pale riders of plague and war.21 Sterling’s China City offered white Americans an equally patronizing representation of Chinese American life and indeed of Asia itself. Chan became one of the many Chinese Americans to receive some financial and social benefits from the project. Amid the false front of an imaginary China, people displaced by the destruction of L.A.’s original Chinatown in 1933 during the building of Union Station found jobs as performers, store owners, or practitioners of their traditional craft.22 Chinese American organizations in the thirties created the so-called New Chinatown on Broadway, which ultimately offered more autonomous opportunity for entrepreneurs in their community. China City, on the other hand, gave a performance space to people who already often played unidentified Asian extras for Hollywood studios, or in some cases, craftsmen whose families hailed from northern regions of China, where everything from handicraft to language and foodways could be vastly different from the country’s southern region, which most first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants once called home. Chan bridged a lot of these differences that held little interest for America audiences who wanted an imagined China. He blended very generalized symbols of his Chinese heritage with elements of traditional magic shows audiences had enjoyed since the late nineteenth century. Chan’s act promised “oriental mystery.” A contemporary photograph shows him dressed in elegant robes (most of the people who performed in China City wore costumes from a patchwork of varied periods in Chinese history with no concern for anachronism) while pulling a rabbit from a box painted with a lu-ung, or Chinese dragon.23 Chan followed in the footsteps of Dr. Silkini by creating a road show that combined his act with the American interest in horror. An accidental fire destroyed China City in 1948. Two years later, as the Korean War began, Chan built a career as Dr. Chan Loo, possibly using as inspiration Bela Lugosi’s 1932 Chandu the Magician. In promotional materials, Chan described himself as coming from a “long line of mystics,” including his father “a Seer as well as a magician,” who “in a letter to his son in 1932 gave an almost complete account of World War II which was to prove correct.”24 Two attractive young women appear on Chan’s poster. Their stage names are Allen Chin and Jessica Wong. They haves smiles as ripe as summer oranges and wear highly nontraditional kimonos cut high on the thigh. This obviously helped the show’s appeal. Chan traveled the country until the early 1960s. His formula promised a display of mystic art combined with the assurance that if you want to be scared, “this show will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. You will see the Wolf Man in person, the living Zombie and Igor the Hunchback . . . it’s sen-sational, weird, thrilling!” We shouldn’t underestimate the American public’s desire for the “thrilling” or the promise Chan made that “you’ll see gorgeous girls” along with a serving of monsters. But Chan’s mix of magic show and horror film offered the 1950s much more. He promised the “Horrors of the Orient,” a stylized Chinese dragon choking up fire and a partially decayed skull at the other end of the banner offering twin images of traditional scares from Asia and Europe. The “oriental horror” Chan proffered worked in part because of a long American suspicion about Asia exacerbated by Pearl Harbor and the subsequent conflict. By the 1950s, many Americans transferred the fear and hatred they felt toward Japan during the Second World War to a generalized Asian menace, a Cold War nightmare of the mind. This transference occurred all too easily since most Americans had limited knowledge of Asia and the Pacific world. The faux set pieces of China City encapsulated what most thought they knew, not simply about China but their mental construct of “Asian.” Moreover, the prejudices had roots deep in the previous century. Arriving in mid-nineteenth-century California to work in gold mines and then for the Central Pacific Railroad, Chinese laborers entered contracts with their employers best understood as indentured servitude. Though they made up about a quarter of the California labor force, the menial and deeply demeaning nature of their work did not prevent Chinese immigrants from being seen as insidious threats. In 1871, mobs burned and murdered their way through a section of Los Angeles called Calle de los Negros, slaughtering eighteen Chinese men. Between 1885 and 1887, eighty-six Chinese people died in shootings and lynchings.25 When a so-called Workingmen’s Party seized control of the city government of San Francisco in the 1870s, the new regime used their leverage to shape a revised state constitution that forbid citizenship for “any Chinese or Mongolian,” language that showed the general confusion about the identity and background of the new immigrants. Many white Californians and their representatives blamed an 1876 outbreak of smallpox on the Chinese community. The anti-Asian propaganda that resulted created a national, nonpartisan coalition opposed to the immigration of more Chinese people to America. This local boomlet of racism had a national counterpart. In 1882, Congress ended legal immigration with the Chinese Exclusion Act, continuously renewed until 1943, long after some Americans began to view the Chinese as victims of Japanese atrocities and, in ’41, as important allies against the Axis. According to leaders in California’s anti-Asian movement, in what continues as a common refrain about the anger against immigrants today, the Chinese would take American jobs and lower wages and, moreover, they were “utter heathens, treacherous, sensual, cowardly, and cruel.”26 This conception long poisoned American attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans. Ignorance and hatred of the Asian communities also worked dark magic with American foreign policy in Cold War attitudes toward China, the Korean War, and the disaster in Vietnam. Horror films extruded the poison of American fears and, in turn, brewed an even deadlier toxin. In 1932, Boris Karloff starred as a murderous and perverted Chinese crime lord in The Mask of Fu Manchu. The film appeared a year after Karloff had played the Monster in Frankenstein and the same year he would shamble forth as The Mummy. MGM briefly borrowed Karloff for the production of Mask. Based on a novel by Sax Rohmer, the archvillain Fu Manchu appears as equal parts mad scientist and super villain given to dressing as a Mandarin from the Han dynasty. Myrna Loy, who played the sadistically evil daughter of Manchu, had not yet found fame in the Thin Man series of films. When Mask appeared, the former dancer at Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard had starred as various femme fatales, what the silent era called a vamp. What audiences read as her “exotic” looks also found her cast in various roles as an Asian character at a time when Hollywood hired actual Asians only for comic effect or, more frequently, as street scene extras in so-called oriental adventures. A hit film that starred Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy in yellow-face, and for the purpose of portraying absurd caricatures of Asian villainy, stands as a bleak testament to American attitudes in this era. But the plot itself goes even further down the well of ruinous fantasy, creating a brutally racist pornography. In the climactic scene, Karloff dons the mask of Genghis Khan to which the plot has hazily attributed a degree of supernatural power. He stands before what he describes as “the hordes of Asia” and promises them the conquest of the world and, in a line forever associated with the film, calls on his followers to “Kill the white man and take his women!” The infamously nasty moment prompted a protest from the Chinese embassy in Washington when the film appeared. It’s some indication of the film’s effect when we consider that the Chinese ambassador had a great deal on his mind already in ’32 given the recent Japanese invasion of the Chinese mainland. The Mask of Fu Manchu taught another equally fiendish, if more subtle, lesson to its viewers. At the pinnacle of the mastermind’s power, he calls together “all the hordes of Asia” to overrun “the Western world. The film shows us the rogue’s gallery of the American mind, a gathering of global stereotypes. The followers of Fu Manchu are not only from East Asia. Some appear dressed in the traditional clothing of Arab Bedouins, others wear the fez of Turkey and North Africa, and a group appears that seems to represent a stereotype of barely clothed Pacific Islanders. Meanwhile, the guards of Fu Manchu are racist conceptions of sub-Saharan Africans, complete with loincloths. The “hordes of Asia” that threaten white men and “their” women are the peoples of most of the globe. These ideas continued to circulate during the Cold War, and white audiences proved hungry for images of the enemies of their empire. In 1952, Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” appeared at a local theater in Kearny, Nebraska, followed by a screening of Lugosi’s 1942 Black Dragons. Frank Chan, in character as the evil Chan Loo, could ensure a bigger crowd by blending “oriental” horrors so that, to the American mind confused by old ally China suddenly becoming the bad guy while Japan became a Cold War client, Asia itself could stand in for all manner of murky threats to white America. After all, anyone who saw the The Mask of Fu Manchu twenty years earlier already had some idea of the terror of “hordes of Asia.” The wax museum of American fears made the transference of hatred of the Japanese to a more generalized communist Asian a fairly easy process. Even to veterans who served in the Pacific, the geography of the region, its diversity of cultures, and its political complexities made it “inscrutable.” This word, symbolic of general American ignorance of Asian history and culture, became a racist stereotype of Asian people themselves. Japan, China, and soon a place called French Indochina, Vietnam, intertwined in the vague Asia of the American mind. The American imperial age has been built on such assumptions. The American takeover of Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century came with one army officer declaring that the people were “no more capable of self-government than the savages of Africa.” In the Philippines, an army private wrote that “no cruelty is too severe for these brainless monkeys.” These attitudes, which produced massacre, torture, and the building of detention camps, received a high-toned gloss from American officials at home who spoke of the need to “educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.” In more recent decades, talk of nation building, globalization, and spreading democratic values has blended with the language of race and stereotyped villainy.27 White supremacy has always been the cornerstone of American empire. Raw, colonialist, and racist notions continue to bubble like acid beneath the surface. In March and April of 2020, the president of the United States persistently referred to the novel coronavirus as “the Chinese virus.” At a rally for conservative college students held at a church in Arizona, Trump called COVID-19 “the Kung Flu,” earning him thunderous applause. Facing public criticism after numerous incidents of physical threats and violence against Asian Americans, Trump tamped down that language even as it enjoyed wide popularity on right-wing social media, podcasts, and radio programs. The idea that “Chinese labs” created the virus itself became a viral phenomenon.28 Insidious rumor legends can rip the social and the geopolitical fabric to tatters on their own. They take on darker forms when governments weaponize them. At the end of April 2020, intelligence analysts and current and former administration officials revealed that both the president and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exerted pressure on the CIA to find evidence of either an accidental or purposeful creation of the virus in a Chinese laboratory environment. The president even raised the possibility of suing the Chinese government ten million dollars for each American death. In the coming weeks, Pompeo went against the findings of most of the American intelligence community in asserting that some kind of Chinese maleficence caused the spread of the virus. Mounting evidence suggests that this rhetoric encouraged an outbreak of violence, including mass shootings and public attacks with edged weapons, against Asian Americans.29 The Trump administration found purchase by using these fears of “the East.” But this had been done before. Creating monsters to destroy, a set of “oriental horrors,” offered Americans a way to ignore the horror their atomic Frankenstein birthed into the world. A 1946 issue of Science magazine suggested that with the atomic bomb, “an unconquerable monster has been released.” In fact, the language of the horror film appeared even in the high-toned pages of The New York Times. In pondering the image of the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, William L. Laurence imagined it as a headless monster or a “funeral pyre” that suggested “the presence of the supernatural.” Or maybe, he mused, it looked a little like the Statue of Liberty.30 7.Future Imperfect FOR RAY BRADBURY, the atomic bomb represented the thing at the top of the stairs, the impending arms race a new dark carnival come to America unbidden, whispering seductive promises that could come to no good end. The aspiring writer still clattered away on his typewriter every day, publishing his first story in 1938, though receiving no money for it. A somewhat uncertain period followed in which he hoped to emulate his serial film heroes Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers by joining the army in World War II. Rejected because of his ridiculously poor eyesight, he attempted a brief career in some very minor New York plays but, by his own admission, possessed no acting talent whatsoever. His big break came in 1947 when, to his chagrin, his short story “Homecoming” received a rejection slip from Weird Tales magazine, the pulp that published the works of horror masters from H. P. Lovecraft to Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Feeling confident because his collection Dark Carnival had received good notices, he submitted the story “Homecoming” to Mademoiselle magazine. This unlikely effort paid off when Truman Capote, then an editorial assistant, happened to glance at the story on top of the magazine’s tottering slush pile. The story entranced the twenty-two-year-old Capote, who convinced his bosses to publish it. One of the first science fiction stories to appear in a mainstream magazine, it won an O. Henry Award in 1947. The politics of the forties and fifties drove Bradbury’s works of fantasy, horror, and sometimes frightening science futures. Thoroughly marinated in the world of early horror films and sci-fi fandom, Bradbury also took his writing cues from the likes of Edith Wharton, Thomas Wolfe, and his favorite author, Katherine Anne Porter. Porter’s stories about revolutionary Mexico may have influenced Bradbury’s 1950 story “The Highway,” in which, in an ironic immigration reversal, American refugees stream by the home of a Mexican campesino family. The tale presents the United States as utterly devastated by atomic war and one of the passing, abject Americans, a well-heeled group of young tourists traveling through Central America during the attack, despairingly tells the Mexican family that the end of the world has come. Suggesting that their lives could continue after the desolation of its aggressive northern neighbor, the father of the family ends the story by sardonically wondering aloud, “What do they mean ‘the world’?” When he was a young man, rocket ships and a gleaming sci-fi future were Bradbury’s passion. But so were the extinct dinosaurs. The reality of the bomb weighed heavy on him, social criticism leaking into his worlds of wonder. Bradbury’s 1950 “There Will Come Soft Rains” became one of the most famous, and most poignant, of fantastic tales that attempted to respond to the monsters of the atomic age. Appearing as one of the interconnected stories in his classic collection The Martian Chronicles, it evoked a post-nuclear suburb and a home of the future in which the vacuum cleaner runs unattended, happy hour cocktails mix themselves, and bridge tables pop out of walls while the soothing voice of the smart home asks the lady of the house what poem she’d like to hear read. The people are missing even as the machine continues to run. All that remains, in a phenomenon reported from Hiroshima, are the shadows of long-dead children at play and a man mowing a lawn, the outline of their cindered bodies burned into a wall by the indescribable temperatures rising from the heart of an atomic blast. Bradbury would once again write more hopeful stories of the human future, but the shadow of apocalypse and accompanying dystopia would continually bring the worlds of horror and science fiction together. This marked a significant departure from the first generation of sci-fi fans, whose interest in science (and politics) as much as fiction had informed their vision of the world. No group, out of all the fissiparous sci-fi fan clubs of the thirties, better represented this trend than the Futurians. The motley gathering began in New York City after splitting off from another science fiction league that wanted to keep politics out of their fandom. For the members of the Futurians—which included authors who later became enormously popular, like Frederik Pohl, Damon Knight, James Blish, Cyril Kornbluth, and occasional visitor Isaac Asimov—science fiction could become science fact in a future that had to include a new political regime. It would not be an American empire that brought a prosperous future. Indeed, the young idealists dreamed not only of the stars but of the red star that rose over Russia in the October Revolution of 1917. Looking back through the filter of the Cold War, some Americans today may be surprised at this hearty left-wing enthusiasm. But the Futurians reflected the political upheaval and free-flowing discussion of new possibilities of the thirties. In that decade, when the Great Depression appeared to have come to give capitalism its last rites, the seeming success story of the Soviet Union impressed numerous westerners. Stalin’s cruelties remained unknown. American communists, while hated by those on the far right, were known primarily as defenders of the unjustly executed Scottsboro Boys of Alabama and faithful allies to the labor unions starting to enjoy a series of successes in American life. The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) reached its largest membership in the decade, many of them very young. Its relatively small membership numbers belied the outsize influence of the CPUSA, which played a key role in both the largest strike in American history, the primarily southern Uprising of ’34, and one of the most successful, working hand in glove with the CIO in the 1937 auto strike. Indeed, even Hollywood films portrayed Stalin’s Soviet Union as admirable (as in the 1943 Mission to Moscow) or at least affectionately comical (as in German émigré Ernst Lubitsch’s Ninotchka). In 1939, Time magazine named Stalin, “Uncle Joe” to the burgeoning American left, as “Man of the Year.” Although the highly conservative ownership obviously despised Stalin, the magazine had to cite the undeniably rapid and successful transformation of Russia from a nearly medieval economy into an industrial powerhouse that weathered the Great Depression. In 1942, he received the same designation, the Soviet Union now an American ally. Awareness of Stalin’s crimes would come later. In the 1930s, communism, not American hegemony, looked like the future. Damon Knight, in his memoir of the Futurians and what became of them, remembered the group’s “mighty mission” to educate the science fiction fandom politically. Donald Wollheim, one of the leading lights of the group, delivered what Knight called “a fiery speech” on science fiction and revolution at a 1937 Philadelphia Fan Convention. The next year, the Futurians officially came into existence, attempting to produce a left-wing organ called Science Fiction Advance and meeting at halls loaned by the CPUSA or its Young Communist League.31 Despite their aspirations for a leftist revolution, the Futurians’ mission suffered from no real funding, no actual plan, internecine fighting, the occasional distraction of trying to create new science fiction pulp magazines or glom on to older ones, and the changed political atmosphere of postwar America in which it was supposedly better to be dead than Red. Moreover, none of the Futurians, except perhaps Frederik Pohl with his well-stocked library of socialist classics, seem to have known very much about Marxism. From the standpoint of the CPUSA, their understanding of revolutionary theory and dialectical materialism must have appeared ghastly, mixed up as it was with technocratic notions of utopians, jet packs, monsters from Venus, and spaceships. Knight perhaps sums up the nature of the Futurians when describing David Kyle, a young associate who may have been a Republican but “enjoyed playing at being Bolshevik—wearing a red hat and marching on May Day—he never took it seriously.”32 While the Futurians issued confused manifestos, alienated more than a few sci-fi fans with their stridency, and generally puttered about in lengthy meetings of motions, objections, and peculiar arguments, two men who shaped the future of horror and science fiction for the second half of the twentieth century had a much more focused agenda at the other end of the political spectrum. Rather than an international workers’ revolution, they imagined an empire guarded by science fiction weapons made reality. 8.Who Goes There? JOHN W. CAMPBELL was born in 1910, and his father abandoned the family by the 1920s after years of combat with the young boy’s peculiarly cruel mother. Indeed, when not a volcano of rage she played bizarre pranks on young John, including having her twin sister masquerade as her and then revealing the shadow play at especially embarrassing moments. This background gave Campbell a streak of paranoia as well as the need to escape into imaginative worlds that often reflected the horrors of real life. His best-known and wildly influential tale Who Goes There? became the inspiration for Howard Hawks’s The Thing from Another World (1951), reimagined by horror legend John Carpenter in his cult classic The Thing (1982). The story presented a monster from the stars who could look like anyone, deceiving you through the people you loved and trusted the most. If paranoid, Campbell was also brilliant. If brilliant, he could also be self-destructively undisciplined. Accepted to study physics at MIT, he was asked to leave during his first semester. He spent his college years at Duke University, barely passing his classes and churning out ZIP! BANG! POW! space operas that amounted to little more than Buck Rogers knockoffs. Marriage and a job no one else especially wanted made Campbell famous and more focused. In 1937, the man who wanted to write science fiction became an editor instead, taking over the pulp magazine Astounding Stories, rechristened by Campbell as Astounding Science Fiction. He quickly turned the pulp into his own bailiwick and the place where aspiring writers of the fantastic simply had to publish. Changing the title to Analog by 1960, Campbell made the monthly a finishing school for some of the greatest science fiction and horror talent of the twentieth century. Campbell himself could write sophisticated tales about alien worlds and even the longing that the idea of alien worlds could awaken. Who Goes There? channeled his own fears but also managed to tell a cracking good horror tale. It also resonated with the growing conspiratorial mood of mid-twentieth-century America. This allowed him to nurture talents like Isaac Asimov, who, as he struggled to publish his first story, visited Campbell for notes and encouragement nearly every month in 1938 even as the editor rejected each of his carefully typed tales. Robert A. Heinlein became Campbell’s earliest apprentice to reach sci-fi superstardom, a man many fans still insist is the greatest sci-fi writer of the twentieth century and who (like Asimov and Bradbury) had become a household name by the 1960s. Heinlein eventually turned from sci-fi writer into apologist for the American military juggernaut, a propagandist for a whites-only empire. Heinlein’s early life was a baffling combination of false starts and dead ends, both in his professional life and his whirligig political trajectory. Heinlein was born in 1907 and grew up in Kansas City. In his teenage years, Kansas City boomed, going from sleepy town with the mores of the American South to a major railway terminus plumped from the wealth brought by decades of a successful cattle industry. Although the city’s history into the twentieth century and up to the present offers a case study in the inevitable boom and bust cycles of American capitalism, growing up in the rough-hewn town turned mini metropolis deeply informed Heinlein’s worldview. He believed the world gave men—and with few exceptions his writing focused heavily on men—what they wrested from it. His politics would eventually show this influence. The family military tradition stretched back to the American war for independence and further shaped Heinlein. He entered the Naval Academy in 1925 with plans for a career as an officer. However, in a bit of misfortune he arguably never recovered from, Heinlein contracted tuberculosis and retired with disability pay in 1934. Heinlein became very interested in politics with the onset of the Great Depression, drawn particularly to the reformist socialism of Upton Sinclair. Known to most Americans today as the author of The Jungle, Sinclair wrote over one hundred books, many of them challenging the maleficence of the era’s industrial titans, from Henry Ford to John D. Rockefeller. Heinlein worked tirelessly for Sinclair’s effort to become the governor of California in 1934. To call Sinclair’s campaign controversial defines understatement. FDR refused his endorsement even though Sinclair ran as a Democrat. Earl Warren, future Supreme Court chief justice, described the effort to defeat Sinclair as a struggle “against radicalism and socialism.” So inspired did Heinlein become by Sinclair that he himself ran, and lost badly, for the California State Assembly. The Second World War and John W. Campbell changed Heinlein’s career path, his politics, and his worldview. Campbell began publishing his work in 1939, and Heinlein quickly became one of Astounding’s most popular and prolific writers. Isaac Asimov first met Campbell in this period, earning a look of irritation and displeasure when enthusiastically speaking of his attendance at a Futurians meeting. Asimov commented in his diary that Campbell seemed “a hidebound conservative.” Campbell’s paranoia shaded his ideas about government, world affairs, and eventually race in ways that affected Heinlein’s own drift to the right.33 World War II became the second defining event for Heinlein. Unable to serve in the military any longer after his illness, he worked instead as a civil engineer for the navy. His devotion to the cause also found expression in a 1941 novel called Sixth Column, in which an enemy Heinlein describes as PanAsians conquers the United States. A resistance movement emerges against what Heinlein insists on calling “the slantys,” who have brutally suppressed all freedoms and killed red-blooded Americans by the hundreds of thousands. The yellow peril has returned, Fu Manchu’s “hordes of Asia” are on the march, and Heinlein’s novel swims in the same cultural sludge as Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient.” Heinlein ingested all the libertarianism of Campbell. American success in the Second World War led him to add a fascination with brutal combat and military might. By the 1950s, Heinlein’s convoluted worldview can best be described as militaristic libertarianism, a challenging intellectual hobbyhorse to ride given that he had to square the idea of rugged individualism with a very powerful national security state. He managed it over decades and hundreds of thousands of words. The acceptance of America’s military power, and the communist threat, sometimes appeared allegorically in sci-fi horror films, as in the film Invaders from Mars (1953), in which science and the quick intervention of the armed forces save the United States. But the flood tide of such films sometimes ignored allegory altogether. The low-budget crowd-pleaser Project Moonbase (1953), story and screenplay by Heinlein, told of a distant future of 1970 in which a human being recently orbited earth. The astronaut responsible is the female Colonel Briteis, whose accomplishments in that future world do not protect her from egregious sexual harassment from her rival, Major Moore, who insists on calling her Colonel Bright Eyes, or her commanding general, who threatens to spank her. The film sends Moore and Briteis on a mission to the moon with a scientist who turns out to be a Russian spy. Crash-landing on the lunar surface, the Soviet agent dies, leaving Briteis and Moore stranded. But, so it turns out, that’s all to the good. Their commanding general orders them to set up “Moon Base One,” which will be a “perpetually menacing eye in the sky” to all “the enemies of freedom.” It’s Wernher von Braun’s dream of deadly orbital weapons platforms, a dream that would become one of the far right’s enduring fantasies in America. Meanwhile, the Pentagon orders the marriage of Colonel Briteis and the Major for the sake of “public opinion.” Briteis breathlessly accepts. Heinlein wrapped the film’s script by having the Pentagon promote Major Moore to brigadier general, ensuring he properly outranks his wife as they embark on their mission to protect “the safety of the free world.” In other words, raining down H-bombs on any “enemies of freedom” who might challenge American hegemony. The politics of empire appeared outside of Heinlein’s fictional worlds in his emerging activism. In 1958, he took out an ad in his local Colorado newspaper entitled “Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?” The tract—a response to his estranged friend Isaac Asimov’s involvement in the effort to convince Eisenhower to unilaterally end nuclear testing—urged Americans to accept the risks of nuclear war gladly. Heinlein insisted that even if the “willfully distorted” claims about the outcome of an atomic exchange were true, it would be preferable to “Communist enslavement.” Better irradiated than Red.34 The United States did not end unilateral testing but did enter an advantageous three-year test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Heinlein took no pleasure in this. Campbell suggested to him that his ad would do little good since, Campbell insisted, “the Common man” was in control and had no idea of “the systems he’s controlling.” Heinlein agreed and over the next decade wrote two novels that are manifestos as much as fiction. Starship Troopers appeared in 1959, imagining a future world where one can only exercise the right of suffrage if one engages in “Federal Service”—joining an interstellar military to wage a war of containment and conquest against insectoid aliens. The novel imagines a young male with little personal discipline, a little like a young Heinlein, transformed into a warrior by training and combat. The “Bugs” that the trooper and their massive fleet slaughter in droves are rather obvious representations of the American right’s understanding of the communist world—unthinking drones, they only follow their leader’s aggressive tendencies. Heinlein and his legion of fans mostly failed to notice that the starship troopers do much the same. The wildly successful novel became a model for a subgenre of militaristic science fiction, often with a right-wing slant, that burgeoned in popularity by the 1980s. Heinlein also single-handedly created the “space marine” trope that would appear everywhere from the sequel to Alien to video game franchises like Doom and Halo. Few admirers of the book and its many imitators noticed that Heinlein’s libertarian paradise where you earned your citizenship with violence looked very much like a totalitarian state. Several years later, in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Heinlein published Farnham’s Freehold (1964). The hero of the novel takes his rather nontraditional kinship group into a shelter while an atomic war rages above. As the atomic holocaust obliterates most life on earth, Farnham holds forth to his mistress, both sexy and a dutiful listener, about how the war would ensure “good genetics” since only the intelligent prepared properly while billions died aboveground. The United States was, he insists, “breeding slaves” but the war would create a “genetically purified” environment. In Heinlein’s survivalist fantasy, that’s exactly what happens. Rather than a radioactive wasteland, the new world is idyllic. Farnham’s compound becomes a refuge for “freedom loving peoples everywhere” where American flags fly and yet no government exists to collect taxes. Farnham’s Freehold shows the influence of Campbell, especially in its portrayal of Black people. The major obstacle to true paradise in Farnham’s “purified” world is a Trans-African Empire that enslaves whites and, indeed, cannibalizes them. In this white supremacist nightmare, white men are castrated, and their women used as sex slaves. We are back with Fu Manchu calling for the destruction of the white man and the “taking of his women.” The novel ends the only way it can. Farnham builds a wall around his paradise of one. Heinlein’s mentor was lost in racist fantasies. As Astounding/Analog sales declined and Campbell began to drink more heavily, he frequently used fan conventions to spew racist bile. In 1965, he proclaimed that the upheaval in Watts over police brutality proved that African Americans needed slavery in order to control their impulses. He regularly ranted against the most moderate aspects of the civil rights movement.35 An aging Campbell feared the world of the 1960s. His protégé, Heinlein, saw in a new, dangerous world the consummation of some of his darkest dreams. Heinlein would in turn stand as godfather to a new generation of writers, one in particular who would have some influence over American foreign policy. The United States didn’t have to fear the horrors from deep space. Perhaps the country could embody that horror to its enemies. By the 1960s, American military, economic, and diplomatic muscle reshaped the politics and even the geography of whole regions of the globe. The country had begun its journey to this apogee in 1917 and now its global reach fertilized poison flowers on almost every continent. But many Americans heard the weird carnival calliope tingling in the night air and sweated in fear. A letter to Time magazine, appalled at America’s use of the bomb, insisted that their own country represented “the new brutality” in the world, “a Frankenstein’s monster” committing crimes that could never be erased.36 Frankenstein’s monster offered the perfect metaphor for what the United States would next unleash. 9.Crime, Sadism, Monsters, Ghouls, Corpses ROBERT A. HEINLEIN and John W. Campbell’s vision of military might slaughtering insectoid monsters faced some ideological competition in the growing world of horror culture. Comic books, for a time after World War II, presented an alternative vision of the world and, in fact, of American history and society. Tobe Hooper and George A. Romero learned a different America from the gory panels of these comics. They met an America that didn’t deserve its imperial status, that clawed its way to power through a mound of corpses. Crime and horror comics, many of them appealing to adults as much as to children, challenged the popularity of superhero and funny animal stories that once dominated the genre. In the early fifties, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein took Entertaining Comics, popularly known as EC, in a direction they called the “new trend.” Inspired in part by 1930s and ’40s horror radio dramas like Lights Out and Inner Sanctum, they created horror comics that cast a gruesome shadow over the sunnier disposition American popular culture projected in the 1950s. In their title Crime Patrol, usually a collection of police procedurals and detective tales, they introduced stories with titles like “Return from the Grave” and “The Spectre in the Castle.” Crime Patrol became The Crypt of Terror just as their popular War Against Crime title became Vault of Horror.37 These comics mixed tales of familial discord inevitably leading to gruesome murders with stories of undead ghouls clawing out of the grave to harry the living. In the first style of story, Brooklyn-born EC artist Jack Kamen quipped that “there was no such thing as a happy couple household in EC” and remembered illustrating story after story in which couples “were always trying to bump each other off.” Such stories gleefully contradicted the postwar images of happy households, prosperous nests of male privilege, and consumerist fantasy, promulgated in advertisements, on television, and in popular magazines. The suburbs, where such fantasies allegedly took place, tamped down class conflict. For a brief period, the growing white American middle class tended to live side by side in nearly identical gimcrack homes with blue-collar workers seeming to have achieved a similar level of prosperity. In suburban sprawl, Harper’s Magazine insisted in 1953, “there is no wrong side of the tracks.” Such assertions would not age well as the muscle of American capital immiserated industrial workers and created a new economy by the 1970s. But for a time, the ability of most white suburban families to own a TV and an automobile and watch as their kids played together at backyard barbeques suggested that capitalism, not its deadly Soviet rival, had ended class conflict.38 Horror comics questioned this rosy picture. In their pages, housewives weaponized their sparkling kitchen appliances to dismember, parboil, and blend to mush their problematic patriarchs. Parents found themselves the victims of misfit children. Men dug graves for their spouses in backyards, the stink of a rotting corpse intermingling with the smell of newly mown grass. 10.Two-Fisted Tales WAS THERE a political motive behind EC? On the one hand, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein appeared to adopt a smash-and-grab style of attack on popular attitudes with no clear political agenda. In an advertisement for new writers in the February 1954 issue of Writer’s Digest, Gaines asked prospective authors to recall that “We love walking corpse stories” and tales in which “the villain tries to get away with murder—and probably does. No cops and robbers stories. Virtue doesn’t have to triumph over evil.” In a time that worked assiduously to maintain a frozen smile, it’s impossible to overemphasize how much this represented a call for anarchy. Moreover, while EC has received understandable credit (or blame) for pioneering such stories, nearly 150 different horror comic titles appeared in the early fifties from their rivals, most reveling in the same kind of brutal art and gruesome storytelling. Sometimes much more specific political critique of the American empire appeared from EC. Readers, including a new wave of adult readers, began to see the EC brand as a mark of quality and maturity—not to mention bloody images and bleak ideas hard to find in other nooks and crannies of popular culture. Horror remained the primary draw, and few companies other than EC managed to come up with a continuing stream of exceptionally weird ideas, macabre humor, and unforgettable artwork. But the work of Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood ensured EC horror would be tinctured with an even stronger dose of cultural criticism than The Crypt of Terror or Vault of Horror. A series of comics took on American imperialism past and present, often telling truer tales of American history than most of the era’s school textbooks. Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat, titles that seemed to promise childish conceptions of war, carried a radically different message. Kurtzman, who authored most of EC’s war comics, grew up in Brooklyn and the Bronx in the 1920s and ’30s. His family left Odessa after World War I. His stepfather (his father died when Kurtzman was very young) regularly read the radical Daily Worker and could be described as an active socialist at a time when the movement conceived of itself as deeply American and patriotic. Kurtzman joined the army soon after high school. Although trained as a rifleman, his talents as an artist and writer soon found him illustrating posters and camp newspapers. Wallace Wood (known to everyone in the EC bullpen as Woody) grew up in Minnesota, graduating high school near the end of World War II. He served briefly in the Merchant Marine and then as a paratrooper in the Army Airborne. In his early work for EC, horror from and in space became his first love and he excelled in imagining Lovecraftian creatures rearing their oily tentacles and oozing green slime. But Woody’s turn to war comics made horror much more visceral and, along with Kurtzman, created what can only be described as anti-war war comics. Kurtzman told an interviewer in 1972 that “all our stories really protested war.” Woody covered the panels of EC’s war comics with decaying body parts and, in one particularly haunting tale of trench warfare in the First World War, featured a rat crawling out of an empty eye socket in no-man’s-land. Even a story of the Revolutionary War, “Pell’s Point,” questioned the values of a gung ho Continental Army soldier who ends up bayonetted in a foolish and pointless show of bravado.39 Most astonishing of all, a 1953 Kurtzman/Wood tale called “Atom Bomb” followed the daily life of a Japanese family in Nagasaki. Wood drew bodies swept into a sky on fire but also the slow death of radiation sickness that followed. Kurtzman ended the story by showing a young survivor but also recording the grim statistics of the blast.40 This comic masterpiece appeared at a time when very few Americans understood the consequences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The U.S. government made a full-throated effort to squelch information about the death toll of the bomb and the effects of radiation sickness. John Hersey’s book had already passed out of the American consciousness, and in fact historian Paul Boyer suggests its account may have allowed readers to face the horror of the A-bomb and then literally “close the book on that episode.”41 EC encouraged readers young and old to reopen the black book of American crimes. Both their war and horror lines joined in a full-frontal assault on the values and assumptions of white Americans in the 1950s. Why did anyone want to read an attack on their values? David Hajdu has suggested that the success of EC emerged out of the fear of the times. The empty-eyed corpses that shambled from panic to panel in EC and their competition “could not have been far removed from the readers’ mental pictures of their own fate in the wake of the nuclear holocaust.” Maybe at least some Americans were terrified of what their values might do to them and the world.42 Not surprisingly, the efforts of EC and its artists and writers attracted plenty of unwanted attention. The FBI briefly investigated EC in the final year of the Korean War. An April 29, 1952, memo from Hoover’s office suggested that the government might render a charge of sedition against Gaines and even specific artists. EC comics, the memo read, “tend to discredit the army and undermine troop morale.”43 Other comic publishers faced similar scrutiny, none more than Lev Gleason of Lev Gleason Publications. His company’s series Crime Doesn’t Pay seemed to promise a moral message in its very title. It told stories from the perspective of criminals themselves. Although Gleason could point to the fact that the characters in these books did face the consequences of their actions in the final panels, the stories tended to build sympathy for bank robbers and crime lords in a fashion not dissimilar from gangster pictures of the thirties such as The Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Gleason also faced intense personal scrutiny from the FBI, who closely monitored his activities during World War II. In December of 1943, Hoover sent a memo to the special agent in charge of the New York bureau ordering the office to “immediately open a case” on Gleason that would “develop fully all information on his Communist activities.” Gleason does not seem to have ever been a member of the CPUSA, though he certainly worked with communists. The FBI investigation focused on three matters in particular: Gleason and his wife traveled to Mexico City for a meeting of an organization devoted to aiding refugees of the Spanish Civil War. He attended meetings of the left-wing Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. Most damning, from the perspective of Hoover’s men in black, Gleason wrote a letter to the editor of the Newcastle News that praised “our ally” the Soviet Union during World War II at a time when, in fact, the Soviet Union was our ally.44 The FBI lost interest in the investigation, possibly because heavier thunderheads emerged over the comics industry by 1953. A national panic developed over comics in the aftermath of the brutal but indecisive Korean War. Students of folklore describe such moments as a moral panic, a widespread sense that some kind of poisonous conspiracy planned to subvert society. A moral panic has far sharper incisors than what’s sometimes called an urban legend. A panic may begin with the sharing of baseless stories told as personal anecdotes. But it ends with legal and political authorities taking such stories seriously and announcing to the public that some insidious danger threatens the very foundations of national life. The great comic book scare had numerous sources in the 1950s. The actual content, both imagery and text, played more of a role than the problematic idea of “mass hysteria.” EC and their many imitators really did challenge some of the basic values of America’s dominant culture; in the lurid beauty of their pages, American family life became an abattoir, with spouses plotting each other’s demise while teenage rebellion took the form of homicide. The angry dead refused to stay in their graves, a disturbing image at any time but particularly after a half century of corpses being produced by global war. Artists suggested that war and the military represented pointless bloodletting and institutionalized sadism. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee led an investigation of possible links between what the era called “juvenile delinquency” and comics. His committee soon moved on to an investigation of organized crime for which he became famous. But the grassroots hand-wringing of parents, clergy, and civic leaders continued, their fears blooming an angry red. Parochial schools and PTAs held public burnings of comics, and now and again parents took it upon themselves to purify their households of the comic scourge. Some of these burnings involved students allegedly gathering up offensive comics themselves, although David Hajdu’s interviews with participants at several of these local events revealed that many of the students never read the comics anyway, while some may have developed an interest in them while stoking the bonfires. At a Catholic high school in New Jersey, one alum remembered years later that as they stacked comics for incineration, a pile developed of “jungle books, with their covers of heroines swinging from vines in leopard-skin bikinis.” That particular pile disappeared, saved from the conflagration by “several of the young crusaders” who hid it “under a step in the boys’ lavatory.”45 The war against comics coalesced at the national level in a series of Senate hearings culminating in the industry creating their own Comics Code. EC refused to comply, only to find they’d been abandoned. They would turn to the magazine format with many in their stable of artists, like Wally Wood, working for companies that created horror magazines like Creepy and Eerie to continue the EC tradition. The size and the amount of text in the new magazines allowed them to operate safely outside the Comics Code. Twenty-six publishers assented to the code and incorporated the Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) to administer its standards. Charles F. Murphy, a judge with a particular concern for the alleged outbreak of juvenile delinquency, headed the association. Most publishers felt they could keep sales up by sanitizing their comics while also destroying competitors who essentially depended on crime and horror fantasy. In a move that clearly suggested this mercenary motive, one of the first provisions of the new code banned the use of even the words horror and terror. The German émigré Fredric Wertham has usually been presented as the villain behind the death of EC’s glory days. His November 1953 Ladies’ Home Journal article “What Parents Don’t Know About Comic Books” appeared to lend scientific justification for parental anxiety. The book born from his somewhat limited reading of comics bore the dangerously sensationalist title Seduction of the Innocent. Wertham’s book appeared at a time when local police produced public service announcements like the Inglewood, California, police department’s “Boys Beware,” which insisted in the ugliest of terms that gay men are by definition sexual predators. Wertham’s willingness to tap into those dark energies remains unforgivable, particularly since it seems his own celebrity became his driving motivation as national fame beckoned.46 However, Wertham himself remains a complicated figure. He did not favor complete censorship of comics and his reputation as the incarnation of a killjoy has overshadowed his work on, for example, the Brown v. Board of Education case the same year he released Seduction of the Innocent. His work on Brown grew in part from the free psychiatric clinic he ran for African Americans in New York City, at a time when the Black community continued to be denied any access to mental health care beyond segregated and often brutal institutionalization. Influenced to some degree by the Frankfurt School’s critique of popular culture, he saw comics and television as narcotics for the masses, especially dangerous to the young.47 Wertham saved his harshest words for comics that related in any way to the supernatural. They were, he insisted, “horror, crime, sadism, monsters, ghouls, corpses dead and alive . . .” He unfortunately could not see that the best of these tales mirrored many of his own concerns over social justice and American apathy. In the many stories of nonconformist adolescents that peopled the pages of Vault and Crypt, parents are repeatedly shown as desensitized by exhausting work, television, and their afternoon martinis. EC even broached the topic of American racism at a moment when most white readers would have been unaware of a struggle for racial justice or its origins in the Civil War and Reconstruction era. The final comic published by the company in February of 1956, an issue of Incredible Science Fiction, featured a story called “Judgment Day!” in which a human astronaut visits a planet of orange automata that has long been at war with blue automata. The orange mechanicals, we learn, once enslaved their blue counterparts. The astronaut decides the planet has not advanced enough beyond the most savage prejudices to join an intergalactic alliance. As he blasts off to return to earth, he removes his helmet to reveal that he is an African American, a not-so-subtle note to the reader about the nature of the allegory they just read. The very moderate liberal appeal to tolerance in a science fiction tale proved too much for the CMAA. When Feldstein submitted the story for approval, Judge Murphy leaned back in his heavy leather chair and looked gimlet-eyed at the editor. “You can’t have a Negro,” Murphy declared flatly. Feldstein, genuinely shocked, asked what part of the Comics Code forbid the representation of Black people. Murphy said he had the authority to forbid it. Feldstein walked out. Back at the EC bullpen, the news made Gaines something more than furious. He was finished with comics. He let Murphy know that he planned to hold a press conference describing the effort to censor “Judgment Day!” and tell anyone who would listen that the Comics Code apparently had a deeply racist agenda. Murphy called Gaines and announced a sudden change of heart, but he bizarrely suggested that the final panel should be fine as long as the artist removed the beads of sweat popping from the character’s forehead. Apparently, Murphy considered an African American man sweating in a comic too suggestive. “Fuck you,” Gaines said, and slammed down the phone.48 EC published the story with only one change. Feldstein called attention to the controversial perspiration by adding to the text that “the instrument lights [of the spaceship] made the beads of perspiration on his dark skin twinkle like distant stars.” Gaines had largely been right when he suggested that the Comics Code allowed for racist caricature. In fact, white supremacist fantasies, ignored by the conservative critics of comics, flourished in “jungle adventure” stories not dissimilar from the mad-scientist-zombie-jungle-horror films in the forties, fifties, and sixties (explored in the next section of this book). But Wertham is not guilty by association. Part of his critique of comics in general, if not EC in particular, concerned how “jungle adventure” tales affected the self-esteem of Black children and encouraged a rancid racism in their white counterparts.49 William W. Savage Jr. explained the racist assumptions of this comic genre well when he described, in his wonderfully researched and written Commies, Cowboys, and Jungle Queens: Comic Books and America, 1945–1954, the “jungle lords and ladies” that all imitated Tarzan in stories that regarded Black people as “a form of fauna” not so different from “lions, panthers, snakes, [and] elephants.”50 The incredibly creative and perhaps surprisingly socially conscious horror and crime comics created some interesting work. Fans of EC, for example, included what would become a new generation of horror film directors who would completely reimagine how to tell tales of terror in a darkened theater. George A. Romero even drew on the visual style of comics, noting how they had influenced the way he shot and edited Dawn of the Dead.51 Perhaps Wertham was correct that comic creators engaged in a spree of “horror, crime, sadism, monsters.” What he missed is that such stories grew directly out of the tortured history of the nation. By the 1960s, more and more Americans would come to agree with Malcolm X, and EC comics, that they’d been sold an “American dream” but found themselves in an “American nightmare.”",

      "content": "1.Unidentified THE MONSTERS usually came from Mars. The bloody iron oxide glow and association with the god of war made our closest planetary neighbor in the void a natural jumping-off point for an extraterrestrial invasion. H. G. Wells predicted just such an attack in his 1897 tale The War of the Worlds, appearing in serialized form to the British public the same year the world met Bram Stoker’s Dracula. In Wells’s original vision the Martians came thirsting for our blood. Dying on their moldering planet, like the rotting five-hundred-year-old warlord in the Carpathians, the aliens hungered for a literal fresh transfusion of life. Mars and Transylvania had one thing in common. The old cultures, in British imperial myth, wanted, depended on, the vitality of great Britannia. Americans proved willing to believe the same about their growing empire. In 1939, a radio play by Orson Welles’s The Mercury Theatre on the Air narrated a version of The War of the Worlds in a fashion that convinced at least some listeners that Martian death rays scoured the landscape of New Jersey. Welles saw his production as part of the coalition building that many left-leaning artists and activists pursued in the thirties, a broad anti-fascist front. So he must have been delighted that at least some listeners misheard the program in such a way as to believe that the Nazis invaded the East Coast. In the year 1947, invaders filled the skies over the forty-eight states. By the middle of the summer, newspaper accounts dubbed their touring vehicles “flying saucers.” Most agree that the term can be traced to the private pilot and U.S. Forest Service employee Kenneth Arnold, who saw “nine, bright, saucer-like objects” flying at “incredible” speeds. At the same time, the idea of saucer-like crafts played an important role in the pulp sci-fi and horror magazines of the twenties and thirties, ensuring that the idea already held some currency in American culture. Arnold’s supposed sighting made an ephemeral cultural image into an icon. The Chicago Sun reported on June 26 that Arnold insisted, based on his flight experience, that the object sighted near Mount Rainier moved at speeds exceeding 1,200 miles per hour. “It’s impossible,” Arnold admitted, “but there it is.”1 The U.S. military agreed with Arnold on the impossibility of such a craft. Officials connected to the newly created Air Force, formerly the Army Air Forces, overanxiously denied the existence of any actual craft buzzing around up there. They invented the term unidentified flying objects (UFOs) since they knew from their own experience that nothing kills enthusiasm like a military acronym. UFO stuck, becoming a permanent part of American popular culture and lexicon. The acronym lost its original bureaucratic origins and came to mean “visiting and/or invading extraterrestrials” in general parlance, contrary to Air Force hopes that it simply means a thing in the sky that doesn’t matter because we can’t identify it and could well be a weather balloon, a hallucination, or a simple trick of the light. Gritting their teeth, everybody in the Pentagon with less than four stars busily worked to convince Americans there was nothing to worry about. They failed spectacularly. Then, they succeeded beyond their wildest hopes. Was the newly inaugurated Pentagon hiding secrets? Yes. Did it have to do with alien craft, crashing with some regularity in the desert Southwest? Sadly, no. Most Americans, at first, did not assume that horrors from outer space accounted for what writers on the topic later dubbed the summer of the flying saucers. The Second World War convinced many that the sightings related to a new kind of superweapon. Perhaps surprisingly, few seem to have assumed that these vehicles flying around unidentified represented a Soviet plot. Kenneth Arnold himself sent a telegram to Wright Field in Ohio expressing his “disappointment” that the Air Force gave no confirmation of the origin of what he had seen since he “felt certain they belonged to our government.” Arnold hoped that the commanding general and the Air Force scientists would take his concerns more seriously since he assumed that he’d seen “an instrument of destruction meant to be used in combination with our atom bomb.” Shouldn’t the American people know about this?2 Truman’s burgeoning national security state thought there was plenty the American people did not need to know. In 1947, the National Security Act created the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon, putting in place a cooperative and unitary military command structure. At least that’s all the American public assumed had happened. And, anyway, the new legislation looked about as interesting as changes to an administrative flowchart. Most took little notice. In fact, the act allowed for a complete reorientation of foreign policy, extremely powerful institutions not answerable to the democratic process, and what amounted to the unconstrained ability to wage secret wars anywhere around the globe. Historian Tom Engelhardt writes that the National Security Council became, in effect, the president’s “second cabinet, coordinating domestic, foreign, and military policies beyond the oversight of Congress or the public.” The new National Security Agency (NSA) quickly became a clearing house of data on American citizens as well as foreign powers. Under the act, the NSA did not even have to reveal its existence to the American public until 1975.3 A single short paragraph in the act created one of the most powerful agencies in American foreign policy over the next seventy years, a secret army answerable primarily to the president and his advisors. The CIA became, in effect, a new, secret branch of the armed forces with a mission broadly defined as the “analysis” of intelligence and the dangerously vague permission to conduct “clandestine activities.” In 1949, a wave of bad news from the fluctuating fronts of the Cold War led to a bill that exempted the agency from having to disclose “its size, budget, operations, and sources.”4 The sweeping powers of the new agency deeply concerned many senior officials and military leaders, even if the American public paid very little attention. In some cases, this opposition amounted to administrative turf wars. Hoover seemed especially concerned about what would become of his beloved FBI. Other critics sounded off with more serious concerns about what the NSA meant for democracy. More traditional military leaders and a few in the press warned of the creation of “an American ‘Gestapo.’” Several months before the CIA began operations, George C. Marshall, the top American military commander in World War II and secretary of state in 1947, sent a private memorandum to Truman that said in part that “the powers of the proposed agency seem almost unlimited and need clarification.” There is no record of a response.5 The culture of secrecy that emerged with the National Security Act carried direct implications for what would become the new American fears of invaders in flying saucers. The entire intelligence community and the Air Force took an interest in the reported phenomenon, though not because they thought (or knew) that aliens regularly visited some of the most isolated parts of the United States. Instead, the national security state very much needed a panic-free American public to carry out the Cold War geopolitical agenda. Advantageously for America’s foreign policy commissars, the Greenbaum effect began to do its work. Flying saucer enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists, without fail, latched on to conspiracy folklore with no basis in reality or uncovered secrets the government barely tried to keep hidden. Over the decades since the 1950s, UFO fans have frequently become excited about various smoking guns they are pretty sure the Freedom of Information Act, or the FBI’s own decision to release documents digitally, has allowed them to find. Anyone enthusiastic over U.S. government conspiracies would require a serious stockpile of cork, yarn, and thumbtacks to make enough murder boards to cover them all. And yet, the Greenbaum effect prevented any serious research into truly troubling matters. The desire to ferret out state secrets seldom included an examination of assassinations and the overthrow of foreign governments, the meaning of various obscure treaties, or the involvement of the U.S. military all over the globe. Instead, visitors from other worlds became the consuming passion, surely to the delight of the alphabet agencies raised to life by the National Security Act. Meanwhile, the CIA provided the less suspicious elements of the American public with a phrase that also helped them ignore what their country was really up to in the world. CIA Dispatch #1035-960, now widely available, reveals that the agency encouraged the use of the term conspiracy theory by the shapers of American opinion. “Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose” the document code-named PSYCH reads. In a series of talking points, the document urges that “assets” in the American news media be told that conspiracy theories “appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”6 The creation of an American consensus of ignorance about the crimes of empire seemed complete. The Greenbaum effect ensured that absurdities about little green men and lizard people kept the tin foil hat crowd busy. Meanwhile, the very term conspiracy theory and its associations successfully inoculated more skeptical Americans against the horrors of American interventionism, conflating evidence-free nonsense with realities that hid in plain sight. The national security state squared a very dark circle. 2.Crash Landings THE FBI released an influential bread-crumb trail to nowhere, referred to as the Hottel memo or the Roswell memo, to an eager public in the late 1970s. In it there’s some red meat for anyone hoping for a close encounter of any kind. In March of 1950, the special agent in charge of the D.C. office, Guy Hottel, reported to J. Edgar Hoover a rumor circulating in New Mexico that “an investigator for the Air Forces stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered.” According to the story, beings “three feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture” occupied each craft. Hoover never ordered a follow-up on the vague hearsay.7 Sounds suspicious, doesn’t it? When news of the released memo spread, the faithful believed it confirmed a government cover-up with the mention of New Mexico proving it. The reason for this “aha!” lay in another obscure 1947 incident that occurred soon after Kenneth Arnold experienced his flying saucer sighting: an Air Force craft crashed at a ranch near Roswell. Locals took up Arnold’s language and spoke of a “flying disc.” The front page of the Roswell Daily Record on July 8 came emblazoned with the headline “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region.” The Army Air Force sought to tamp down the story by dismissing the crash as a failed weather balloon and that seemed the end of l’affaire Roswell. Few continued to hold much interest in Roswell until the Hottel memo. True believers circulated it widely to the delight of UFO fans, who crowed over the sudden, supposed proof of a government cover-up at Roswell—never mind that the alleged deception occurred three years before the field office director’s report. In 1980, Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, the former a paranormal enthusiast who previously wrote about the Bermuda Triangle and other alleged paranormal phenomena, published the hugely popular book The Roswell Incident. Their false assertions, allegedly based on interviews with numerous eyewitnesses but actually jerry-built from informal chats with people who claimed to know eyewitnesses or someone who knew an eyewitness, became the template for the idea of a government conspiracy to cover up the supposed crash and discovery of an alien craft in the New Mexico desert. Every decade or so, there’s new interest in Roswell. In the 1990s, more books, often making contradictory claims, appeared about the supposed crash. Many of these news books seem to have been fueled by the enormous popularity of the television series The X-Files (1993–2002), a brilliant twist on the police procedural. Running for nine seasons, plus two feature films and a reboot, the franchise made use of the era’s fascination with conspiracy and suppression of the truth. At least “truths” related to aliens and assorted cryptids . . . never coups, assassinations, or quotidian tales about the building of hundreds of U.S. military bases on foreign soil. In 2011, the FBI’s digital history project called the Vault created renewed interest in the old story. The Vault was a kind of image-building project for the FBI, a joint effort with the National Archives to release about seven thousand unclassified documents to the public. The Guy Hottel memo sent to Hoover in 1950 quickly became the most popular. Indeed, to the chagrin of the FBI, mainstream news outlets reported on the memo as if it suggested a cover-up of the Roswell incident, ignoring that it constituted a third- or arguably fourth-hand account of rumors of an incident that seemed to warrant no further investigation. In April of 2011, just as the FBI launched the Vault, an ABC news report entitled “FBI Vault Reveals UFO, Roswell Files” again linked the memo, now available for more than thirty years, to the possibility of a government cover-up. The reportage would have left most readers with the lingering suspicion that there was more to the story, especially since the director of the New York Center for Extraterrestrial Research was the single person ABC chose to interview in depth. Described with the grammatical conundrum “a UFO supporter,” he insisted that the news would force the government to come clean about the truth behind the flying saucers. In 2013, the FBI reported that the memo had been viewed nearly a million times. Roswell continues to be a popular topic among UFO enthusiasts and in popular culture. In 1999, a cult TV show called Roswell ran for three seasons. A remake of the series launched in 2019. Why do Americans care so much about these kinds of stories? In June of 1997, a CNN/Time poll found that three-quarters of respondents believed the government covered up the incident at Roswell. The same survey found, confusingly, that more of those polled believed in a Roswell cover-up than believed in extraterrestrial life. Apparently, this comes from a general sense that the U.S. government must be up to something. Maybe it’s aliens? As we’ve already seen, the birth of the national security state played a decisive role in both creating and sustaining these illusions. The people, or small movements, that have come to be known as conspiracy theorists actually exist in a peculiar symbiosis with the desire of the Cold War state to engage in actual, rather complex conspiracies. In fact, the semi-seriousness with which the Pentagon, the CIA, and the FBI took flying saucer sightings points to the real horror of the era. The government was, for example, utterly deceptive about the nature of the 1947 crash near Roswell when the Air Force described the wreckage as a weather balloon. In 1995, an Air Force report quietly explained the entire Roswell incident, an explanation disregarded or ignored by anyone more interested in little green men than the politics of the Cold War. The crash, wrote Air Force investigators, appeared “consistent with balloon devices and most likely from the MOGUL balloons that had not been recovered.” In other words, America’s Cold War with Russia and the need to keep the empire’s secrets played a crucial role in the belief that monsters were descending from the stars.8 Project Mogul launched at the end of World War II, a classified collaboration between the U.S. Army Air Forces and New York University that used large clusters of balloons and radar reflectors to trace seismic activity possibly indicative of a Soviet atomic test. Mogul long remained classified since it inaugurated decades of aerial espionage conducted against the Soviet Union. This would come to include an embarrassing May 1960 incident in which the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 spy plan in their airspace and captured the pilot, forcing Eisenhower to admit that such flights had been carried out for years.9 But far more Americans know about Roswell and its supposed alien connections than their country’s tendency to violate the rest of the world’s airspace with impunity. And far more care. Why is this so? The answer lies in the directions taken by American horror in the Cold War. It has its genesis in the fact that the worst possible thing really is the truth in the story of the American empire and the fact that Americans are quite comfortable not knowing that. 3.Lone Gunmen THERE ARE plenty of fringe theorists in America who believe an astonishing variety of nonsense. The American public mocks them and buys hundreds of thousands of copies of their books, listens to their podcasts, and watches hours of series that air, and re-air, every 1970s theory about extraterrestrial life. The television series Ancient Aliens has run for eighteen seasons on what purports to be the History Channel, despite its bizarre mix of creationism, contradictory claims, and junk science. In Smithsonian, science writer Riley Black memorably called the popular series “some of the most noxious sludge in television’s bottomless chum bucket.” In her detailed article she explains a multitude of manufactured truths and notes how frequently the show describes fundamentalist Christians without formal advanced degrees as “biblical archeologists” and “paleontologists.”10 The misinformation industry thrives off America’s juvenile dance between consumer and commodity. The authors of the Roswell paperbacks that began appearing in the eighties are both absurd and rich from the desire of Americans to hold on to modern myths. In fact, the success of their claims makes perfect sense in a country where millions believed in and spread music producer Ray Santilli’s 1995 alien autopsy hoax, including a former CIA scientist who insisted the footage was real even after the revelation that Santilli used a foam alien to create it. Then there are academics like Courtney Brown, of the prestigious Emory University, who claimed to use telepathy to learn the true nature of the Hale-Bopp comet . . . the same psychic talents he used to communicate with Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth (Brown assures us they are also aliens). And, of course, Cory Hammond, whose nightmare visions of Satanists, mind control, and the CIA question American covert actions and manage to find all the wrong answers. These examples are easy to mock. They also often find a large audience, have their speculations taken seriously by major news outlets, and earn an odd kind of belief by Americans who, looking at the maelstrom of history, politics, and science, are so baffled that they throw up their hands and mutter, “Well, it could be, I guess.” Meanwhile, mass culture phenomena from films like the The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and The Parallax View (1974) presented the possibility of American institutions subverted at the highest level, often by outside powers (an international communist conspiracy in the first and a corporation in the other). Like the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), anyone you know might be a pod person and woe betide you if you try to convince the authorities. Or, more likely in American life, you’ll be considered a delusional paranoid by consumers who also turn your book into a best-seller while a film adaptation goes into development. The official keepers of state secrets have, since the end of World War II, been perfectly content to allow such theories to spread. For all the latent American concern over conspiracy, and the occasional pop culture celebration of heroes trying to figure out the score (“The Truth Is Out There” became the most instantly recognizable tagline of The X-Files), the paranoia or simple intrigue shown by the American public never focuses on getting to the bottom of actual conspiracies. There’s certainly evidence that the caretakers of the national security state understood the power of promoting false conspiracies to cover real ones. In 1952, Walter Bedell Smith, once Eisenhower’s chief of staff and at that time serving as director of the CIA, suggested that the UFO had some real potential in advancing U.S. interests. He encouraged his top lieutenants to “discuss the possible offensive or defensive utilization of these phenomenon for psychological warfare purposes.”11 The flying saucers did offer a much-needed distraction. Indeed, during the period that Americans watched the skies for extraterrestrial invaders, the highest echelons of the U.S. government successfully created an infrastructure for clandestine terror, overthrew two elected governments and waged a guerilla terrorist campaign against another, all the while hiding significant facts about the use of atomic weapons. General public ignorance of these facts offers a clear example that Americans want their conspiracies to involve only aliens, international cabals, or both. We want the monster out there, not in here with us. We accept the apex predator in the water that we can kill but not the American myths of the frontier turned into a psychopath with a chain saw fetish. Thus, when a whistleblower shows us the truth that’s actually out there, as Edward Snowden did by revealing the National Security Agency’s PRISM program that collected cell phone data on most Americans with the cooperation of companies like Verizon, most Americans brand them as a traitor. Snowden had to go into exile or face conviction under the draconian 1917 Espionage Act. (Passed as the United States entered World War I, this act had been used to imprison anyone who opposed the country’s entrance into the conflict.) He was not asked to share his thoughts on the History Channel and his book did not become a mainstream best-seller available in cheap paperback editions. In the 1940s and 1950s, suggestions like Kenneth Arnold’s claims are what really concerned the newborn national security state. What did Americans know about the nation’s new superweapons? Most important, could a panic over their power be prevented or the terror they caused become part of the public relations arsenal needed to keep the Cold War at a low boil? In the late 1940s, the U.S. government began preparing to do some pretty nasty business at home and abroad. An informed public might demand an accounting of the new agencies that sprang into existence after the National Security Act. What would happen if Americans ever really came to grips with the reality of atomic weapons? Perhaps they would balk at the apocalypse. 4.The Creatures with Atom Brains!! WE KNEW radiation killed. It’s impossible to imagine the army of radioactive monsters that crawled, slithered, and skittered toward fifties horror fans without noticing the role of the bomb. Susan Sontag’s essay “The Imagination of Disaster” takes seriously the desire of American filmgoers to look at destruction, its possibility and its outcome. Sontag, and the ruminations of a hundred commentors on genre film, have insisted that the Cold War and sci-fi horror must be explained as allegories for aliens as communists and creature features as atomic anxiety. What was missed in trying to understand the need to screen apocalyptic horror is Sontag’s point that there’s a fantasy being lived in these films, as much as a set of anxieties about the bombs from the sky and reds under the beds. Had she pondered this fantasy over the decades, Sontag might have concluded that it’s a central tenet of the citizens of empire. The destruction of America, restaged and replayed again and again, became a symbol of undefined and inexplicable grievance. Despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, Americans since World War II imagined themselves as the victims on the world stage. In 1949, when a civil war overthrew the brutal and corrupt Chiang Kai-shek, America believed it “lost China.” We feared the Soviets during decades when they had no way to deliver their tiny nuclear arsenal to the American mainland. Defeat in Vietnam became a myth of betrayal and victimization. The country’s culture remains beset with an unhealthy neurosis that allows it to ignore the overwhelming hegemony it exercises over most of the people on earth. The only country ever to use an atomic device against a civilian population has a fortress mentality, an inexplicable seething rage against the world. The country did not collectively forget its conscience in 1945. The bomb became a moral issue for millions of Americans after the elation over the war’s end. Close to the one-year anniversary of the first bomb falling on Hiroshima, the New Yorker published John Hersey’s account of the effects of the new weapon. Hersey forced Americans to wonder about the decision to use the bomb, his spare prose making it clear that Hiroshima was anything but a giant military base. The emotional effect of his article, soon published as a best-selling book, grew from his intimate portrayal of the effects of radioactivity on six survivors. Hersey, without falling into sentimentalism, described the deteriorating health of the six in ways that horrified readers. Readers learned that the bomb’s aftereffects included the rapid degeneration of stem cell tissue as the phosphorus in their bodies caused bones to glow hot with radiation. Their blood boiled with poison. Hersey reported that men had become sterile while young women simply ceased menstruating. Victims suffered intense pains from burns that had depilated skin down to cartilage. Hersey taught Americans the phrase radiation sickness. His work carefully, and sometimes even dryly, documented how the weaponized dust and debris, ionized with radium, that emerges out of the heart of an atomic explosion eviscerates human cells and mutates DNA. Perhaps for the first time in their lives, many Americans found themselves confronted with the Japanese people as human beings. But we must be careful. It would be easy to overstate the effect of Hersey’s book, and the efforts of other critics of the atom bomb. The sense of outrage over Pearl Harbor, and a profound lack of knowledge about the diplomatic and strategic context of the attack, clouded moral reasoning about the use of such a weapon. Americans already accepted the idea of LeMay’s “terror bombing,” a practice that actually killed more civilians than the twin A-bomb attacks in August of ’45, and, to many, the mass murder at Hiroshima and Nagasaki seemed like a quicker and more efficient version of the deadly air campaigns. Not everyone, even those who pondered Hersey’s spare but muscular account, came to grips with the fact that the bomb secreted a deadly element that rewrote DNA sequences, mutating human beings at the level of their basic code. Radiation killed tens of thousands in the months and years after the bombings. “So what?” many thought, and either put down Hersey’s book or never read it in the first place. After all, hadn’t the use of weapons of questionable morality already been a part of America’s “good war”? Marine and army forces from Guadalcanal to Tarawa to Okinawa deployed the flamethrower, a weapon repeatedly condemned in the twenties and thirties by the world community after its use in World War I. Wielded by a single soldier or marine, the fearful weapon incinerated the “bug hives,” pillboxes that held Japanese soldiers, portrayed in propaganda cartoons as an inhuman, insectoid enemy fanatically willing to die for the emperor. For many Americans, the bomb just seemed a bigger and bolder version of such tactics. In fact, perhaps one of the most common comments about the bomb in politics and journalism after August of ’45 touted it as an example of American know-how. The scruples shown by at least a sliver of the American public in the few years after their country dropped the world’s first atomic device went into a political coma after the Soviet Union announced it had atomic weapons. Code-named First Lightning, the American intelligence community also called the device Joe-1 in recognition that Joseph Stalin now possessed the bomb. The American public’s response contained the peculiar mixture of nationalist bravado and sheer panic that came to represent the American state of mind in the years after World War II. Less than a month after American spy planes detected Joe-1’s radioactive trail, Democratic senator of Connecticut Brien McMahon warned Americans against complacency and insisted that the development of conventional and atomic weapons must continue. An arms race had become central to preserving American prerogatives. McMahon’s view got the most attention, as it offered a narrative of immediate threat. In the meantime, no one paid any attention to the numerous scientists calling for a sweeping internationalization of scientific research and shared risk instead of national self-interest. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who became a critic of the Pentagon’s use of the weapon he played a pivotal role in creating, found himself stripped of his security clearance. After his last, difficult meeting with Harry Truman, the president told aides never to let that “son of a bitch” appear on his schedule again. The president, who, as a young man, wished the Great War to last longer so he could kill more Germans, didn’t care for the scientist’s moral scruples.12 The country seemed ready to enjoy Sontag’s imagination of disaster. In 1955, Creature with the Atom Brain became one of the many films to imagine a mad scientist who uses radiation for apocalyptic designs, specifically raising the dead. The villain of the piece is a Nazi scientist or, in other words, precisely the kind of person working on America’s radioactive arsenal through the auspices of Operation Paperclip. Viewers watched this peculiar reflection of reality on a double bill with It Came from Beneath the Sea, a tale of nuclear submarines and giant cephalopods weaponized by radiation. Though these seem like modern fairy tales concerned with the dangers of atomic weapons, their celebration of American military power left audiences assured of the need for America’s full-spectrum dominance. 5.We Gratefully Acknowledge the Cooperation of Those in Authority SCIENCE FICTION horror already worked to encourage trust in the national security state. In 1950, hoping to build on the “summer of the flying saucers” and the continuing alleged sightings, a tiny production company called Colonial Productions made the first feature film to deal with the phenomenon. They called it The Flying Saucer. Colonial included patriotic text at the film’s beginning that read, “We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of those in authority” for making the picture possible. “Those in authority” could not help being pleased with the film’s message, which combined action and America triumphing over their enemies with tough-guy antics and technological acuity. The Flying Saucer opens with sightings of the eponymous craft over a number of American cites. An unnamed American spy agency, clearly the new CIA, enlists Mike Trent, “a playboy, sportsman, and two-fisted drinker,” to investigate sightings in Alaska. Ominously for the logic of the Cold War, “undercover agents in a communist group” in Juneau were trying to locate and learn the tech behind the alien craft since it offered “a perfect delivery system” for the A-bomb. The intrepid Trent, after some romantic adventures and fisticuffs with Russian spies, discovers that an American scientist, not extraterrestrials, developed the saucer. This nod to Kenneth Arnold’s suspicions about a U.S. superweapon is tamped down as the last minutes become a race to prevent the Soviets from stealing the saucer (small enough to conceal in the basement of a log cabin). One communist agent briefly absconds with the craft, but the American scientist has rigged it to explode. Proclaiming “all of that settled,” playboy Trent decides to marry his blonde CIA handler and all’s well. The slipshod production of The Flying Saucer—probably at least thirty minutes of the hour-and-fifteen-minute running time is filled out by aerial and landscape footage of Alaska—did not prevent it from becoming a drive-in theater standby and even a mention, if a rather acidic one, in The New York Times (“A film called ‘The Flying Saucer’ flew into the Rialto yesterday,” wrote critic Bosley Crowther, “and . . . it can go right on flying”).13 Whatever the Times thought of it, an American public nervous that Joseph Stalin had an A-bomb proved ready for a flood tide of films featuring alien aggression and radioactive monsters, usually with a thinly veiled Cold War message. The basic formula for most science-fiction horror films of the decade uses the first act to introduce a threat from beyond the stars or, somewhat ironically, from under the sands of “the West,” a New Mexico of the mind where audiences would vaguely remember the Trinity test exploded the bomb into the world. In act two, Washington learns of the threat (usually because of a child or a scientist or a child and a scientist, almost always in a small town), and the filmmaker inserts World War II or Korean War footage to show tank treads rolling formidably in a long steel line, jeeps filled with combat troops, and a general mobilization against the threat. The scientist, sometimes with the help of another very pretty scientist/soon-to-be love interest, engineers a way the army can destroy the flying saucers or the giant ants or the mutated octopi. In the last act, the army, with a bit of scientific can-do, destroys the threat in a Hiroshima strike against the extraterrestrials. Sometimes there’s fallout, literal fallout, but that’s the price of peace. The success of these films, and the hundreds of them made between 1950 and about 1968, is equal parts celebration of American empire building and assurance from “those in authority” that the U.S. military could defeat any threat. The year 1949 had become a crucial turning point in American public opinion regarding the Cold War, a hardening of attitudes that overdetermined the political possibilities of the country for decades to come. The fantasy of disaster, the fantasy of being both victim and conqueror, played out on thousands of screens almost every night through the first two decades of the Cold War. America the victimized saw its post–World War II preeminence under siege. In the same year that Stalin could celebrate his nation being able to explode an atom bomb, the communist revolution in China headed by Mao-Tse Tung succeeded. This created shock and surprise in the United States, and perhaps even in Mao himself. Mao’s revolution solidified the American foreign policy establishment’s aggressive stance against an alleged international communist conspiracy. The somewhat moderate policy of “containment” advocated by George F. Kennan in ’46 called for a sort of diplomatic and economic seawall raised against a rising red tide. Many foreign policy wonks, and an increasingly paranoid right wing in both major political parties, entertained the possibility of communist influence at the highest levels of government. The phrase domino theory percolated among elites and soon the public, the logical fallacy of the slippery slope turned into a geopolitical confession of faith. If one country “went communist,” its neighbors would also tip over, one after another, into a sea of red. It’s a fantasy of loss of control, the need of empires through history to see every small act of independence as a threat. The United States had, in fact, already declared its vision of the postwar world, where if any nation refused the country’s influence, they were, by definition, a tool of Moscow. In 1946, Truman called for a massive aid package to the right-wing monarchy of Greece. The Greek government faced a communist insurgency comprised mostly of partisans who fought against the Nazis with Allied help since 1941. Stalin, perhaps the least revolutionary leader on the planet, took little interest in the conflict but did react with horror to Truman’s characterization of it. In a 1947 stem-winder of a speech, given to a joint session of Congress but directed at the Kremlin, the American president described the “terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists” who threatened “the very existence of the Greek state.” But he went further. “I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” The cynical use of rhetoric about “free peoples” aside, this seemed both a threat to Moscow and a declaration of war against the revolutionary aspirations of people from Africa to Asia to Latin America who labored under the centuries-old yoke of European imperialism. The Truman doctrine made it clear how America would use its military and economic power to stack the dominoes any way it wanted to. The United States pursued a course in Greece, soon to become a familiar pattern, in which American “advisors” and military hardware arrived in 1947 to prop up the repressive, but anti-communist, regime. The conservative Greek government survived to place in power a menagerie of criminals, economic oligarchs, and even some Nazi collaborators who earned U.S. approbation for their virulent anti-socialism.14 In Asia, Truman and his National Security Council poisoned relations with China for decades. The 1950 deployment of U.S. troops to South Korea to defend it against invasion from the communist North Korea fell within the parameters of “containment.” However, early successes led General Douglas MacArthur and some of Truman’s closest advisors to urge a full-scale invasion of North Korea, despite China’s explicit warning they would intervene if the United States took this step. American troops crossed the thirty-eighth parallel in the summer of 1950. In response, Chinese forces threw a punishing haymaker of an assault that forced the American army into retreat and even retook the South Korean capital of Seoul. After two years of talks, the deaths of 33,686 American soldiers, and perhaps as many as four million Korean dead in both the North and South, the conflict ended with the divided country having essentially the same borders it did in 1950 and a heavy, permanent American military presence along the restored border. Nearly every major city on the peninsula lay in ruins from American air power. Millions faced starvation. The city of Wonsan endured a forty-one-day, nearly twenty-four-hour shelling from American battleships that U.S. Rear Admiral Allan E. Smith concluded had been the longest and most destructive naval bombardment in human history.15 The catastrophic circumstances strengthened the hand of the most reactionary elements of the North Korean state. Today it remains one of the most isolated and repressive countries on earth. Generations of leaders with a bizarre, semi-mystical version of communism that ritualized a cult of personality around the “Dear Leader” rule an impoverished nation that’s nevertheless well on its way to becoming a nuclear power. The Korean War grimly affected U.S. foreign policy and democratic institutions. The specter of defeat after the Chinese intervention caused discontent and outright fear at the Pentagon and in the administration. Truman suggested at a news conference that field commanders could authorize the use of nuclear weapons and mused in his diary about a new Hiroshima that might bring a quick end to the conflict. The United States readied atomic weapons at bases in Japan. In the spring of 1951, the Joint Chiefs ordered an atomic attack on Manchuria—the very region where Chinese troops first fought the Japanese invasion as American allies—if China sent in more troops to consolidate its early gains. Paradoxically only the fanaticism of MacArthur caused the administration to pause. MacArthur wanted to go nuclear on China and the Soviet Union, and apparently he floated a plan to irradiate much of Asia in order to make a point. In pushing back against this psychotic suggestion, the Truman administration decided to stick with conventional warfare rather than annihilate the Korean peninsula.16 Defense spending boomed. The United States held a stockpile of two hundred atomic weapons in 1949. By 1960, when Kennedy claimed that Republicans had allowed a “missile gap” with the Soviet Union, America possessed eighteen thousand atomic devices. The idea of the missile gap emerged, according to the most distinguished historian of the CIA, from unsubstantiated claims by the agency, the USAF, and the defense industry that the Russians had five hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) able to strike anywhere in the United States. They actually possessed four, and three of those might not have made it off the ground. The Soviet Union would not achieve anything like missile parity until the late 1970s.17 The United States also accelerated research and testing of the hydrogen bomb, triumphantly called “the super bomb” by many in the defense establishment. First tested in the Pacific in the fall of ’52, the device contained one thousand times the force of the weapon dropped on Hiroshima. A crater that yawned two miles wide and almost a mile deep appeared on Enewetak Atoll and gave some hint of the new weapon’s power. Polls suggested that a slim majority of Americans wanted to see an end to nuclear testing. At the same time, sheer, unstoppable military power had come to hold a special place in the American people’s hearts. Paul Fussell describes the enormous tonnage of explosive power placed in the hands of individual America GIs that left Europe a scarred and blasted landscape. He writes that, despite hours of “marksmanship” practice U.S. soldiers engaged in with their M1 carbines, ace shooting and battlefield tactics became passé when “mass wiping-outs, artillery stonks, and frontal flamethrower assaults” could do the job. By late 1944, Europe looked as if the no-man’s-land of the Great War metastasized across the continent, enveloped major cities, and rolled over every acre of farmland and factory district. The men who fought the war, the staff officers who took note of the effect of the unfettered violence, and the commanding generals who ordered mini apocalypses unleashed on ancient European cities all came home with a deep appreciation for the American military machine’s ability to blow the absolute hell out of any obstacle and burn alive any possible threat.18 Horror science fiction accepted the logic of total military supremacy as well, especially when tied to the can-do spirit of science, often evoking the image of the scrappy American inventor. This archetype of the heroic innovator had long held a special place in American mythology. The new style of scares, with a few cinematically interesting exceptions, showed us a new kind of scientist, the opposite of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his crew of doubting Thomases. These new scientists work with the military, they answer to the call of duty, and there’s no question whose side they are on. The mad scientist had transformed into the patriotic scientist or simply the compliant one. Stanley Kubrick’s dark comedy Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb didn’t appear until 1964. By then, as the director well knew, too many Americans had developed a peculiar affection for the bomb. A popular flick called The Atomic Submarine appeared in 1959, and at the time, probably moved at least as many Americans as Kubrick’s arty, over-the-top parody. The Atomic Submarine took some cues from The Flying Saucer, even as it reimagined the alien invasion story by adding some Arctic adventure and even more slack-jawed militarism. The story involved the North Pole becoming a kind of Devil’s Triangle where American ships and subs have begun to disappear. Surely it must be some Soviet plot, and so the USS Tigershark, christened by the film “the deadliest atomic submarine in the U.S. fleet,” goes to investigate. The building of the USS Nautilus, the first submarine to use atomic power, inspired the film. The navy sent the sub to the Arctic waters in an effort not to find commies or to fight flying saucers, but to break submersion records and become the first watercraft to reach the geographic North Pole. The first attempt failed in July of 1958. A second effort succeeded, and the Eisenhower administration hoped the mission would counter the world’s perception of superior Soviet technology after the successful launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957. The Atomic Submarine also coiled into the belly of Cold War politics. A civilian peacenik scientist joins the crew for unconvincing plot reasons. He stands in for every member of the scientific community who warned about the effects of atom bombs and, in fact, exactly the kind of submarine he finds himself aboard. A chisel-chinned officer declares that the scientist’s anti-war statements are “open propaganda” and, worse, that he even shamed his own high-ranking naval officer dad into retirement and ill health. According to chisel-chin, the “press got in on it” and declared the scientist’s father “a warmonger.” Nonsense. In the actual 1950s, what destroyed Joseph McCarthy was not his disregard for civil liberties or even his grotesque, bullying public image. No one blinked an eye when he accused private citizens, or most of the State Department, of treasonous behavior. But when he went after the army, he went too far. The military may have been, other than Billy Graham, the decade’s most respected public institution. The Tigershark discovers a flying saucer at the North Pole inhabited by a tentacled one-eyed beanstalk intent on prepping planet earth for colonization. An intercontinental ballistic missile destroys the craft, but the sailors simply call it an ICBM without giving any explanation of what this meant. Clearly, the acronym had become as well known to the American public as UFO. A new mass militarism meant movie producers could count on their drive-in audience knowing the utter devastation such a device could wreak. There’s no room for dissenting voices aboard America’s atomic submarine. If you wanted to be a real American, not a communist flunky or worse, you had to come along fully for the ride. In the final scene, the peacenik scientist accepts atomic weapons as at least a necessary evil, admitting that “guys like the sailors” aboard the Tigershark, guys willing to unleash weapons of apocalyptic power when the order comes down, can save “us” from the invaders. America was not going to take any shit. 6.The Midnight Monster Show AMERICANS FROM all walks of life now believed they saw flying saucers, or flying somethings, careening across the skies. Films—not the ones best produced and now recalled as classics like The Thing from Another World (1951) or Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), but low-budget screamers, quickly produced and distributed widely and repeatedly at double bills in traditional theaters—helped shape the perception of these not-very-close encounters into alien invasions. But Martians or Venusians or the occasional unnamed extraterrestrial empire hungry for earth’s lifeblood provided many Americans with only some of the strange solaces of horror. The shiny steel surfaces of the flying saucer, mimicking the curvaceous modernism of both household appliances and the postwar automobile, took up only part of the shadows of the American mind. During the Second World War, Americans could venture out to venues on the home front to discover the frightful delights of horror’s first golden age. The monsters of their youth might have been cavorting with Abbott and Costello. But in cities and small towns across the country, the so-called spook show became a popular attraction, delivering live-action versions of the increasingly placid, predictable American horror film. In some respects, these local performances helped horror survive in the age of Frankenstein engaging in hijinks with Lou and Bud. Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors brought dark carnival delights across the country beginning in the 1940s. Dr. Silkini was actually Jack Baker from Toledo, Ohio. Baker’s show became the most popular of its kind, lasting until 1963. The traveling horror show included some traditional magic tricks, a séance played for laughs, and the occasional gag, like promising to show the audience an actual dead body only to lift the veil on a frozen chicken. But Baker served audiences some pretty strong stuff that went beyond these hijinks. He called the show’s most potent trick the Blackout, a skit in which he or one of his performers threatened to throw live snakes into the audience and then cut the lights, leading to inevitable screams as he flung a heavy, damp rope into the sudden darkness. Dr. Silkini really gave his audience the business at the show’s climax. The stage became a grand guignol gathering of what looked to be body parts in an art deco lab familiar to fans of the era’s many mad scientist films. Working with a hunchbacked assistant, Silkini brought the body to life with a fog and fireworks show of sparks and miniature explosions and Frankenstein’s monster himself. The monster would gruesomely strangle the hunchback and then shamble toward the audience just as Silkini dropped all the lights in the house. Screams edging into utter panic always followed. Universal Studios took a dim view of the unlicensed use of one of their marquee characters. However, Silkini managed to convince the studio’s legal department to allow him the rights to the character. Universal may have rightly understood that the popularity of the shows kept their classic monsters in undead circulation. In fact, Universal’s 1944 House of Frankenstein made use of a traveling midnight show (its ghost host played malevolently by Boris Karloff) in what seems a reluctant tribute to the rising popularity of Silkini and his many imitators. In fact, rescreening of classic, and perhaps some not-so-classic, horror films went hand in skeletal hand with the midnight shows. Silkini introduced the practice of “midnight bicycling” in which he rented out one venue to startle and entertain with his magic show and monster mash as well as a nearby movie palace the audience could bicycle to directly after his stage show to eat popcorn as eagerly as they gobbled down a horror film or bleak murder mystery. The midnight shows brought delicious excitement to small towns throughout the United States. Their appeal went beyond, and blended with, the outré character of the entertainment. The conventions of the event allowed teenagers, adults, and children to ignore curfew, young couples copping feels in the shadowy privacy of theaters while kids bicycled across town in the small hours. It’s challenging for contemporary readers to grasp how, in the quiet and often very homogenous town of the fifties, this allowed for a carnivalesque atmosphere edged with terror. But this was a white empire at play . . . and so not open to everyone. Segregation excluded many Americans from enjoying the pleasures of the midnight monster shows. During the height of Silkini and his many imitators’ popularity, state laws throughout the South and parts of the Midwest segregated all public spaces. De facto segregation in much of the rest of the United States prevailed. When Dr. Morris and His Weird House of Horrors brought their midnight show to the New Bern Theatre in North Carolina, the advertised “frightmare of monsters” was a whites-only affair. A poster for a “Mammoth Horror” event at the old vaudeville theater in Fort Smith, Arkansas, told “colored folks” that they would have to come to their own “exclusive”—that is, Jim Crow—performance.19 American racism brought out other ugly elements of the American id, fueling the empire’s suspicion and arrogance. In the atmosphere of the Cold War, seething prejudices against Asians and Asian Americans intertwined with the monster shows. The horror of movie monsters and dark magic mixed with a blighted representation of the enemies of the empire. A new midnight monster show illustrated this sinister side of the monstrous fun. In June of 1950, Bill Sachs reported for Billboard magazine that he recently caught Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient,” a “45-minute display” making its way through Kansas and Missouri. Sachs records the impressions of a reporter named Ray Amy, who watched what he described as “the snappiest and most clean cut of its type I’ve ever seen” in Kansas City in the early summer.20 Los Angeles–based Frank Chan performed as the villainous Chan Loo. Chan began his career as a magician working in the late 1930s at a tourist trap its promoter called China City. Developer Christine Sterling successfully created a kind of virtual Spanish mission on Olvera Street, a faux-historical rendition of a romanticized “mission days,” as cultural tourism usually termed the period that ignored the real costs of the conquest of California: destruction of Indigenous peoples and their culture by the spread of smallpox and forced baptisms that harried the region’s Chumash, Tataviam, and Tongva peoples like twin pale riders of plague and war.21 Sterling’s China City offered white Americans an equally patronizing representation of Chinese American life and indeed of Asia itself. Chan became one of the many Chinese Americans to receive some financial and social benefits from the project. Amid the false front of an imaginary China, people displaced by the destruction of L.A.’s original Chinatown in 1933 during the building of Union Station found jobs as performers, store owners, or practitioners of their traditional craft.22 Chinese American organizations in the thirties created the so-called New Chinatown on Broadway, which ultimately offered more autonomous opportunity for entrepreneurs in their community. China City, on the other hand, gave a performance space to people who already often played unidentified Asian extras for Hollywood studios, or in some cases, craftsmen whose families hailed from northern regions of China, where everything from handicraft to language and foodways could be vastly different from the country’s southern region, which most first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants once called home. Chan bridged a lot of these differences that held little interest for America audiences who wanted an imagined China. He blended very generalized symbols of his Chinese heritage with elements of traditional magic shows audiences had enjoyed since the late nineteenth century. Chan’s act promised “oriental mystery.” A contemporary photograph shows him dressed in elegant robes (most of the people who performed in China City wore costumes from a patchwork of varied periods in Chinese history with no concern for anachronism) while pulling a rabbit from a box painted with a lu-ung, or Chinese dragon.23 Chan followed in the footsteps of Dr. Silkini by creating a road show that combined his act with the American interest in horror. An accidental fire destroyed China City in 1948. Two years later, as the Korean War began, Chan built a career as Dr. Chan Loo, possibly using as inspiration Bela Lugosi’s 1932 Chandu the Magician. In promotional materials, Chan described himself as coming from a “long line of mystics,” including his father “a Seer as well as a magician,” who “in a letter to his son in 1932 gave an almost complete account of World War II which was to prove correct.”24 Two attractive young women appear on Chan’s poster. Their stage names are Allen Chin and Jessica Wong. They haves smiles as ripe as summer oranges and wear highly nontraditional kimonos cut high on the thigh. This obviously helped the show’s appeal. Chan traveled the country until the early 1960s. His formula promised a display of mystic art combined with the assurance that if you want to be scared, “this show will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. You will see the Wolf Man in person, the living Zombie and Igor the Hunchback . . . it’s sen-sational, weird, thrilling!” We shouldn’t underestimate the American public’s desire for the “thrilling” or the promise Chan made that “you’ll see gorgeous girls” along with a serving of monsters. But Chan’s mix of magic show and horror film offered the 1950s much more. He promised the “Horrors of the Orient,” a stylized Chinese dragon choking up fire and a partially decayed skull at the other end of the banner offering twin images of traditional scares from Asia and Europe. The “oriental horror” Chan proffered worked in part because of a long American suspicion about Asia exacerbated by Pearl Harbor and the subsequent conflict. By the 1950s, many Americans transferred the fear and hatred they felt toward Japan during the Second World War to a generalized Asian menace, a Cold War nightmare of the mind. This transference occurred all too easily since most Americans had limited knowledge of Asia and the Pacific world. The faux set pieces of China City encapsulated what most thought they knew, not simply about China but their mental construct of “Asian.” Moreover, the prejudices had roots deep in the previous century. Arriving in mid-nineteenth-century California to work in gold mines and then for the Central Pacific Railroad, Chinese laborers entered contracts with their employers best understood as indentured servitude. Though they made up about a quarter of the California labor force, the menial and deeply demeaning nature of their work did not prevent Chinese immigrants from being seen as insidious threats. In 1871, mobs burned and murdered their way through a section of Los Angeles called Calle de los Negros, slaughtering eighteen Chinese men. Between 1885 and 1887, eighty-six Chinese people died in shootings and lynchings.25 When a so-called Workingmen’s Party seized control of the city government of San Francisco in the 1870s, the new regime used their leverage to shape a revised state constitution that forbid citizenship for “any Chinese or Mongolian,” language that showed the general confusion about the identity and background of the new immigrants. Many white Californians and their representatives blamed an 1876 outbreak of smallpox on the Chinese community. The anti-Asian propaganda that resulted created a national, nonpartisan coalition opposed to the immigration of more Chinese people to America. This local boomlet of racism had a national counterpart. In 1882, Congress ended legal immigration with the Chinese Exclusion Act, continuously renewed until 1943, long after some Americans began to view the Chinese as victims of Japanese atrocities and, in ’41, as important allies against the Axis. According to leaders in California’s anti-Asian movement, in what continues as a common refrain about the anger against immigrants today, the Chinese would take American jobs and lower wages and, moreover, they were “utter heathens, treacherous, sensual, cowardly, and cruel.”26 This conception long poisoned American attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans. Ignorance and hatred of the Asian communities also worked dark magic with American foreign policy in Cold War attitudes toward China, the Korean War, and the disaster in Vietnam. Horror films extruded the poison of American fears and, in turn, brewed an even deadlier toxin. In 1932, Boris Karloff starred as a murderous and perverted Chinese crime lord in The Mask of Fu Manchu. The film appeared a year after Karloff had played the Monster in Frankenstein and the same year he would shamble forth as The Mummy. MGM briefly borrowed Karloff for the production of Mask. Based on a novel by Sax Rohmer, the archvillain Fu Manchu appears as equal parts mad scientist and super villain given to dressing as a Mandarin from the Han dynasty. Myrna Loy, who played the sadistically evil daughter of Manchu, had not yet found fame in the Thin Man series of films. When Mask appeared, the former dancer at Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard had starred as various femme fatales, what the silent era called a vamp. What audiences read as her “exotic” looks also found her cast in various roles as an Asian character at a time when Hollywood hired actual Asians only for comic effect or, more frequently, as street scene extras in so-called oriental adventures. A hit film that starred Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy in yellow-face, and for the purpose of portraying absurd caricatures of Asian villainy, stands as a bleak testament to American attitudes in this era. But the plot itself goes even further down the well of ruinous fantasy, creating a brutally racist pornography. In the climactic scene, Karloff dons the mask of Genghis Khan to which the plot has hazily attributed a degree of supernatural power. He stands before what he describes as “the hordes of Asia” and promises them the conquest of the world and, in a line forever associated with the film, calls on his followers to “Kill the white man and take his women!” The infamously nasty moment prompted a protest from the Chinese embassy in Washington when the film appeared. It’s some indication of the film’s effect when we consider that the Chinese ambassador had a great deal on his mind already in ’32 given the recent Japanese invasion of the Chinese mainland. The Mask of Fu Manchu taught another equally fiendish, if more subtle, lesson to its viewers. At the pinnacle of the mastermind’s power, he calls together “all the hordes of Asia” to overrun “the Western world. The film shows us the rogue’s gallery of the American mind, a gathering of global stereotypes. The followers of Fu Manchu are not only from East Asia. Some appear dressed in the traditional clothing of Arab Bedouins, others wear the fez of Turkey and North Africa, and a group appears that seems to represent a stereotype of barely clothed Pacific Islanders. Meanwhile, the guards of Fu Manchu are racist conceptions of sub-Saharan Africans, complete with loincloths. The “hordes of Asia” that threaten white men and “their” women are the peoples of most of the globe. These ideas continued to circulate during the Cold War, and white audiences proved hungry for images of the enemies of their empire. In 1952, Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” appeared at a local theater in Kearny, Nebraska, followed by a screening of Lugosi’s 1942 Black Dragons. Frank Chan, in character as the evil Chan Loo, could ensure a bigger crowd by blending “oriental” horrors so that, to the American mind confused by old ally China suddenly becoming the bad guy while Japan became a Cold War client, Asia itself could stand in for all manner of murky threats to white America. After all, anyone who saw the The Mask of Fu Manchu twenty years earlier already had some idea of the terror of “hordes of Asia.” The wax museum of American fears made the transference of hatred of the Japanese to a more generalized communist Asian a fairly easy process. Even to veterans who served in the Pacific, the geography of the region, its diversity of cultures, and its political complexities made it “inscrutable.” This word, symbolic of general American ignorance of Asian history and culture, became a racist stereotype of Asian people themselves. Japan, China, and soon a place called French Indochina, Vietnam, intertwined in the vague Asia of the American mind. The American imperial age has been built on such assumptions. The American takeover of Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century came with one army officer declaring that the people were “no more capable of self-government than the savages of Africa.” In the Philippines, an army private wrote that “no cruelty is too severe for these brainless monkeys.” These attitudes, which produced massacre, torture, and the building of detention camps, received a high-toned gloss from American officials at home who spoke of the need to “educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.” In more recent decades, talk of nation building, globalization, and spreading democratic values has blended with the language of race and stereotyped villainy.27 White supremacy has always been the cornerstone of American empire. Raw, colonialist, and racist notions continue to bubble like acid beneath the surface. In March and April of 2020, the president of the United States persistently referred to the novel coronavirus as “the Chinese virus.” At a rally for conservative college students held at a church in Arizona, Trump called COVID-19 “the Kung Flu,” earning him thunderous applause. Facing public criticism after numerous incidents of physical threats and violence against Asian Americans, Trump tamped down that language even as it enjoyed wide popularity on right-wing social media, podcasts, and radio programs. The idea that “Chinese labs” created the virus itself became a viral phenomenon.28 Insidious rumor legends can rip the social and the geopolitical fabric to tatters on their own. They take on darker forms when governments weaponize them. At the end of April 2020, intelligence analysts and current and former administration officials revealed that both the president and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exerted pressure on the CIA to find evidence of either an accidental or purposeful creation of the virus in a Chinese laboratory environment. The president even raised the possibility of suing the Chinese government ten million dollars for each American death. In the coming weeks, Pompeo went against the findings of most of the American intelligence community in asserting that some kind of Chinese maleficence caused the spread of the virus. Mounting evidence suggests that this rhetoric encouraged an outbreak of violence, including mass shootings and public attacks with edged weapons, against Asian Americans.29 The Trump administration found purchase by using these fears of “the East.” But this had been done before. Creating monsters to destroy, a set of “oriental horrors,” offered Americans a way to ignore the horror their atomic Frankenstein birthed into the world. A 1946 issue of Science magazine suggested that with the atomic bomb, “an unconquerable monster has been released.” In fact, the language of the horror film appeared even in the high-toned pages of The New York Times. In pondering the image of the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, William L. Laurence imagined it as a headless monster or a “funeral pyre” that suggested “the presence of the supernatural.” Or maybe, he mused, it looked a little like the Statue of Liberty.30 7.Future Imperfect FOR RAY BRADBURY, the atomic bomb represented the thing at the top of the stairs, the impending arms race a new dark carnival come to America unbidden, whispering seductive promises that could come to no good end. The aspiring writer still clattered away on his typewriter every day, publishing his first story in 1938, though receiving no money for it. A somewhat uncertain period followed in which he hoped to emulate his serial film heroes Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers by joining the army in World War II. Rejected because of his ridiculously poor eyesight, he attempted a brief career in some very minor New York plays but, by his own admission, possessed no acting talent whatsoever. His big break came in 1947 when, to his chagrin, his short story “Homecoming” received a rejection slip from Weird Tales magazine, the pulp that published the works of horror masters from H. P. Lovecraft to Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Feeling confident because his collection Dark Carnival had received good notices, he submitted the story “Homecoming” to Mademoiselle magazine. This unlikely effort paid off when Truman Capote, then an editorial assistant, happened to glance at the story on top of the magazine’s tottering slush pile. The story entranced the twenty-two-year-old Capote, who convinced his bosses to publish it. One of the first science fiction stories to appear in a mainstream magazine, it won an O. Henry Award in 1947. The politics of the forties and fifties drove Bradbury’s works of fantasy, horror, and sometimes frightening science futures. Thoroughly marinated in the world of early horror films and sci-fi fandom, Bradbury also took his writing cues from the likes of Edith Wharton, Thomas Wolfe, and his favorite author, Katherine Anne Porter. Porter’s stories about revolutionary Mexico may have influenced Bradbury’s 1950 story “The Highway,” in which, in an ironic immigration reversal, American refugees stream by the home of a Mexican campesino family. The tale presents the United States as utterly devastated by atomic war and one of the passing, abject Americans, a well-heeled group of young tourists traveling through Central America during the attack, despairingly tells the Mexican family that the end of the world has come. Suggesting that their lives could continue after the desolation of its aggressive northern neighbor, the father of the family ends the story by sardonically wondering aloud, “What do they mean ‘the world’?” When he was a young man, rocket ships and a gleaming sci-fi future were Bradbury’s passion. But so were the extinct dinosaurs. The reality of the bomb weighed heavy on him, social criticism leaking into his worlds of wonder. Bradbury’s 1950 “There Will Come Soft Rains” became one of the most famous, and most poignant, of fantastic tales that attempted to respond to the monsters of the atomic age. Appearing as one of the interconnected stories in his classic collection The Martian Chronicles, it evoked a post-nuclear suburb and a home of the future in which the vacuum cleaner runs unattended, happy hour cocktails mix themselves, and bridge tables pop out of walls while the soothing voice of the smart home asks the lady of the house what poem she’d like to hear read. The people are missing even as the machine continues to run. All that remains, in a phenomenon reported from Hiroshima, are the shadows of long-dead children at play and a man mowing a lawn, the outline of their cindered bodies burned into a wall by the indescribable temperatures rising from the heart of an atomic blast. Bradbury would once again write more hopeful stories of the human future, but the shadow of apocalypse and accompanying dystopia would continually bring the worlds of horror and science fiction together. This marked a significant departure from the first generation of sci-fi fans, whose interest in science (and politics) as much as fiction had informed their vision of the world. No group, out of all the fissiparous sci-fi fan clubs of the thirties, better represented this trend than the Futurians. The motley gathering began in New York City after splitting off from another science fiction league that wanted to keep politics out of their fandom. For the members of the Futurians—which included authors who later became enormously popular, like Frederik Pohl, Damon Knight, James Blish, Cyril Kornbluth, and occasional visitor Isaac Asimov—science fiction could become science fact in a future that had to include a new political regime. It would not be an American empire that brought a prosperous future. Indeed, the young idealists dreamed not only of the stars but of the red star that rose over Russia in the October Revolution of 1917. Looking back through the filter of the Cold War, some Americans today may be surprised at this hearty left-wing enthusiasm. But the Futurians reflected the political upheaval and free-flowing discussion of new possibilities of the thirties. In that decade, when the Great Depression appeared to have come to give capitalism its last rites, the seeming success story of the Soviet Union impressed numerous westerners. Stalin’s cruelties remained unknown. American communists, while hated by those on the far right, were known primarily as defenders of the unjustly executed Scottsboro Boys of Alabama and faithful allies to the labor unions starting to enjoy a series of successes in American life. The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) reached its largest membership in the decade, many of them very young. Its relatively small membership numbers belied the outsize influence of the CPUSA, which played a key role in both the largest strike in American history, the primarily southern Uprising of ’34, and one of the most successful, working hand in glove with the CIO in the 1937 auto strike. Indeed, even Hollywood films portrayed Stalin’s Soviet Union as admirable (as in the 1943 Mission to Moscow) or at least affectionately comical (as in German émigré Ernst Lubitsch’s Ninotchka). In 1939, Time magazine named Stalin, “Uncle Joe” to the burgeoning American left, as “Man of the Year.” Although the highly conservative ownership obviously despised Stalin, the magazine had to cite the undeniably rapid and successful transformation of Russia from a nearly medieval economy into an industrial powerhouse that weathered the Great Depression. In 1942, he received the same designation, the Soviet Union now an American ally. Awareness of Stalin’s crimes would come later. In the 1930s, communism, not American hegemony, looked like the future. Damon Knight, in his memoir of the Futurians and what became of them, remembered the group’s “mighty mission” to educate the science fiction fandom politically. Donald Wollheim, one of the leading lights of the group, delivered what Knight called “a fiery speech” on science fiction and revolution at a 1937 Philadelphia Fan Convention. The next year, the Futurians officially came into existence, attempting to produce a left-wing organ called Science Fiction Advance and meeting at halls loaned by the CPUSA or its Young Communist League.31 Despite their aspirations for a leftist revolution, the Futurians’ mission suffered from no real funding, no actual plan, internecine fighting, the occasional distraction of trying to create new science fiction pulp magazines or glom on to older ones, and the changed political atmosphere of postwar America in which it was supposedly better to be dead than Red. Moreover, none of the Futurians, except perhaps Frederik Pohl with his well-stocked library of socialist classics, seem to have known very much about Marxism. From the standpoint of the CPUSA, their understanding of revolutionary theory and dialectical materialism must have appeared ghastly, mixed up as it was with technocratic notions of utopians, jet packs, monsters from Venus, and spaceships. Knight perhaps sums up the nature of the Futurians when describing David Kyle, a young associate who may have been a Republican but “enjoyed playing at being Bolshevik—wearing a red hat and marching on May Day—he never took it seriously.”32 While the Futurians issued confused manifestos, alienated more than a few sci-fi fans with their stridency, and generally puttered about in lengthy meetings of motions, objections, and peculiar arguments, two men who shaped the future of horror and science fiction for the second half of the twentieth century had a much more focused agenda at the other end of the political spectrum. Rather than an international workers’ revolution, they imagined an empire guarded by science fiction weapons made reality. 8.Who Goes There? JOHN W. CAMPBELL was born in 1910, and his father abandoned the family by the 1920s after years of combat with the young boy’s peculiarly cruel mother. Indeed, when not a volcano of rage she played bizarre pranks on young John, including having her twin sister masquerade as her and then revealing the shadow play at especially embarrassing moments. This background gave Campbell a streak of paranoia as well as the need to escape into imaginative worlds that often reflected the horrors of real life. His best-known and wildly influential tale Who Goes There? became the inspiration for Howard Hawks’s The Thing from Another World (1951), reimagined by horror legend John Carpenter in his cult classic The Thing (1982). The story presented a monster from the stars who could look like anyone, deceiving you through the people you loved and trusted the most. If paranoid, Campbell was also brilliant. If brilliant, he could also be self-destructively undisciplined. Accepted to study physics at MIT, he was asked to leave during his first semester. He spent his college years at Duke University, barely passing his classes and churning out ZIP! BANG! POW! space operas that amounted to little more than Buck Rogers knockoffs. Marriage and a job no one else especially wanted made Campbell famous and more focused. In 1937, the man who wanted to write science fiction became an editor instead, taking over the pulp magazine Astounding Stories, rechristened by Campbell as Astounding Science Fiction. He quickly turned the pulp into his own bailiwick and the place where aspiring writers of the fantastic simply had to publish. Changing the title to Analog by 1960, Campbell made the monthly a finishing school for some of the greatest science fiction and horror talent of the twentieth century. Campbell himself could write sophisticated tales about alien worlds and even the longing that the idea of alien worlds could awaken. Who Goes There? channeled his own fears but also managed to tell a cracking good horror tale. It also resonated with the growing conspiratorial mood of mid-twentieth-century America. This allowed him to nurture talents like Isaac Asimov, who, as he struggled to publish his first story, visited Campbell for notes and encouragement nearly every month in 1938 even as the editor rejected each of his carefully typed tales. Robert A. Heinlein became Campbell’s earliest apprentice to reach sci-fi superstardom, a man many fans still insist is the greatest sci-fi writer of the twentieth century and who (like Asimov and Bradbury) had become a household name by the 1960s. Heinlein eventually turned from sci-fi writer into apologist for the American military juggernaut, a propagandist for a whites-only empire. Heinlein’s early life was a baffling combination of false starts and dead ends, both in his professional life and his whirligig political trajectory. Heinlein was born in 1907 and grew up in Kansas City. In his teenage years, Kansas City boomed, going from sleepy town with the mores of the American South to a major railway terminus plumped from the wealth brought by decades of a successful cattle industry. Although the city’s history into the twentieth century and up to the present offers a case study in the inevitable boom and bust cycles of American capitalism, growing up in the rough-hewn town turned mini metropolis deeply informed Heinlein’s worldview. He believed the world gave men—and with few exceptions his writing focused heavily on men—what they wrested from it. His politics would eventually show this influence. The family military tradition stretched back to the American war for independence and further shaped Heinlein. He entered the Naval Academy in 1925 with plans for a career as an officer. However, in a bit of misfortune he arguably never recovered from, Heinlein contracted tuberculosis and retired with disability pay in 1934. Heinlein became very interested in politics with the onset of the Great Depression, drawn particularly to the reformist socialism of Upton Sinclair. Known to most Americans today as the author of The Jungle, Sinclair wrote over one hundred books, many of them challenging the maleficence of the era’s industrial titans, from Henry Ford to John D. Rockefeller. Heinlein worked tirelessly for Sinclair’s effort to become the governor of California in 1934. To call Sinclair’s campaign controversial defines understatement. FDR refused his endorsement even though Sinclair ran as a Democrat. Earl Warren, future Supreme Court chief justice, described the effort to defeat Sinclair as a struggle “against radicalism and socialism.” So inspired did Heinlein become by Sinclair that he himself ran, and lost badly, for the California State Assembly. The Second World War and John W. Campbell changed Heinlein’s career path, his politics, and his worldview. Campbell began publishing his work in 1939, and Heinlein quickly became one of Astounding’s most popular and prolific writers. Isaac Asimov first met Campbell in this period, earning a look of irritation and displeasure when enthusiastically speaking of his attendance at a Futurians meeting. Asimov commented in his diary that Campbell seemed “a hidebound conservative.” Campbell’s paranoia shaded his ideas about government, world affairs, and eventually race in ways that affected Heinlein’s own drift to the right.33 World War II became the second defining event for Heinlein. Unable to serve in the military any longer after his illness, he worked instead as a civil engineer for the navy. His devotion to the cause also found expression in a 1941 novel called Sixth Column, in which an enemy Heinlein describes as PanAsians conquers the United States. A resistance movement emerges against what Heinlein insists on calling “the slantys,” who have brutally suppressed all freedoms and killed red-blooded Americans by the hundreds of thousands. The yellow peril has returned, Fu Manchu’s “hordes of Asia” are on the march, and Heinlein’s novel swims in the same cultural sludge as Dr. Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient.” Heinlein ingested all the libertarianism of Campbell. American success in the Second World War led him to add a fascination with brutal combat and military might. By the 1950s, Heinlein’s convoluted worldview can best be described as militaristic libertarianism, a challenging intellectual hobbyhorse to ride given that he had to square the idea of rugged individualism with a very powerful national security state. He managed it over decades and hundreds of thousands of words. The acceptance of America’s military power, and the communist threat, sometimes appeared allegorically in sci-fi horror films, as in the film Invaders from Mars (1953), in which science and the quick intervention of the armed forces save the United States. But the flood tide of such films sometimes ignored allegory altogether. The low-budget crowd-pleaser Project Moonbase (1953), story and screenplay by Heinlein, told of a distant future of 1970 in which a human being recently orbited earth. The astronaut responsible is the female Colonel Briteis, whose accomplishments in that future world do not protect her from egregious sexual harassment from her rival, Major Moore, who insists on calling her Colonel Bright Eyes, or her commanding general, who threatens to spank her. The film sends Moore and Briteis on a mission to the moon with a scientist who turns out to be a Russian spy. Crash-landing on the lunar surface, the Soviet agent dies, leaving Briteis and Moore stranded. But, so it turns out, that’s all to the good. Their commanding general orders them to set up “Moon Base One,” which will be a “perpetually menacing eye in the sky” to all “the enemies of freedom.” It’s Wernher von Braun’s dream of deadly orbital weapons platforms, a dream that would become one of the far right’s enduring fantasies in America. Meanwhile, the Pentagon orders the marriage of Colonel Briteis and the Major for the sake of “public opinion.” Briteis breathlessly accepts. Heinlein wrapped the film’s script by having the Pentagon promote Major Moore to brigadier general, ensuring he properly outranks his wife as they embark on their mission to protect “the safety of the free world.” In other words, raining down H-bombs on any “enemies of freedom” who might challenge American hegemony. The politics of empire appeared outside of Heinlein’s fictional worlds in his emerging activism. In 1958, he took out an ad in his local Colorado newspaper entitled “Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?” The tract—a response to his estranged friend Isaac Asimov’s involvement in the effort to convince Eisenhower to unilaterally end nuclear testing—urged Americans to accept the risks of nuclear war gladly. Heinlein insisted that even if the “willfully distorted” claims about the outcome of an atomic exchange were true, it would be preferable to “Communist enslavement.” Better irradiated than Red.34 The United States did not end unilateral testing but did enter an advantageous three-year test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Heinlein took no pleasure in this. Campbell suggested to him that his ad would do little good since, Campbell insisted, “the Common man” was in control and had no idea of “the systems he’s controlling.” Heinlein agreed and over the next decade wrote two novels that are manifestos as much as fiction. Starship Troopers appeared in 1959, imagining a future world where one can only exercise the right of suffrage if one engages in “Federal Service”—joining an interstellar military to wage a war of containment and conquest against insectoid aliens. The novel imagines a young male with little personal discipline, a little like a young Heinlein, transformed into a warrior by training and combat. The “Bugs” that the trooper and their massive fleet slaughter in droves are rather obvious representations of the American right’s understanding of the communist world—unthinking drones, they only follow their leader’s aggressive tendencies. Heinlein and his legion of fans mostly failed to notice that the starship troopers do much the same. The wildly successful novel became a model for a subgenre of militaristic science fiction, often with a right-wing slant, that burgeoned in popularity by the 1980s. Heinlein also single-handedly created the “space marine” trope that would appear everywhere from the sequel to Alien to video game franchises like Doom and Halo. Few admirers of the book and its many imitators noticed that Heinlein’s libertarian paradise where you earned your citizenship with violence looked very much like a totalitarian state. Several years later, in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Heinlein published Farnham’s Freehold (1964). The hero of the novel takes his rather nontraditional kinship group into a shelter while an atomic war rages above. As the atomic holocaust obliterates most life on earth, Farnham holds forth to his mistress, both sexy and a dutiful listener, about how the war would ensure “good genetics” since only the intelligent prepared properly while billions died aboveground. The United States was, he insists, “breeding slaves” but the war would create a “genetically purified” environment. In Heinlein’s survivalist fantasy, that’s exactly what happens. Rather than a radioactive wasteland, the new world is idyllic. Farnham’s compound becomes a refuge for “freedom loving peoples everywhere” where American flags fly and yet no government exists to collect taxes. Farnham’s Freehold shows the influence of Campbell, especially in its portrayal of Black people. The major obstacle to true paradise in Farnham’s “purified” world is a Trans-African Empire that enslaves whites and, indeed, cannibalizes them. In this white supremacist nightmare, white men are castrated, and their women used as sex slaves. We are back with Fu Manchu calling for the destruction of the white man and the “taking of his women.” The novel ends the only way it can. Farnham builds a wall around his paradise of one. Heinlein’s mentor was lost in racist fantasies. As Astounding/Analog sales declined and Campbell began to drink more heavily, he frequently used fan conventions to spew racist bile. In 1965, he proclaimed that the upheaval in Watts over police brutality proved that African Americans needed slavery in order to control their impulses. He regularly ranted against the most moderate aspects of the civil rights movement.35 An aging Campbell feared the world of the 1960s. His protégé, Heinlein, saw in a new, dangerous world the consummation of some of his darkest dreams. Heinlein would in turn stand as godfather to a new generation of writers, one in particular who would have some influence over American foreign policy. The United States didn’t have to fear the horrors from deep space. Perhaps the country could embody that horror to its enemies. By the 1960s, American military, economic, and diplomatic muscle reshaped the politics and even the geography of whole regions of the globe. The country had begun its journey to this apogee in 1917 and now its global reach fertilized poison flowers on almost every continent. But many Americans heard the weird carnival calliope tingling in the night air and sweated in fear. A letter to Time magazine, appalled at America’s use of the bomb, insisted that their own country represented “the new brutality” in the world, “a Frankenstein’s monster” committing crimes that could never be erased.36 Frankenstein’s monster offered the perfect metaphor for what the United States would next unleash. 9.Crime, Sadism, Monsters, Ghouls, Corpses ROBERT A. HEINLEIN and John W. Campbell’s vision of military might slaughtering insectoid monsters faced some ideological competition in the growing world of horror culture. Comic books, for a time after World War II, presented an alternative vision of the world and, in fact, of American history and society. Tobe Hooper and George A. Romero learned a different America from the gory panels of these comics. They met an America that didn’t deserve its imperial status, that clawed its way to power through a mound of corpses. Crime and horror comics, many of them appealing to adults as much as to children, challenged the popularity of superhero and funny animal stories that once dominated the genre. In the early fifties, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein took Entertaining Comics, popularly known as EC, in a direction they called the “new trend.” Inspired in part by 1930s and ’40s horror radio dramas like Lights Out and Inner Sanctum, they created horror comics that cast a gruesome shadow over the sunnier disposition American popular culture projected in the 1950s. In their title Crime Patrol, usually a collection of police procedurals and detective tales, they introduced stories with titles like “Return from the Grave” and “The Spectre in the Castle.” Crime Patrol became The Crypt of Terror just as their popular War Against Crime title became Vault of Horror.37 These comics mixed tales of familial discord inevitably leading to gruesome murders with stories of undead ghouls clawing out of the grave to harry the living. In the first style of story, Brooklyn-born EC artist Jack Kamen quipped that “there was no such thing as a happy couple household in EC” and remembered illustrating story after story in which couples “were always trying to bump each other off.” Such stories gleefully contradicted the postwar images of happy households, prosperous nests of male privilege, and consumerist fantasy, promulgated in advertisements, on television, and in popular magazines. The suburbs, where such fantasies allegedly took place, tamped down class conflict. For a brief period, the growing white American middle class tended to live side by side in nearly identical gimcrack homes with blue-collar workers seeming to have achieved a similar level of prosperity. In suburban sprawl, Harper’s Magazine insisted in 1953, “there is no wrong side of the tracks.” Such assertions would not age well as the muscle of American capital immiserated industrial workers and created a new economy by the 1970s. But for a time, the ability of most white suburban families to own a TV and an automobile and watch as their kids played together at backyard barbeques suggested that capitalism, not its deadly Soviet rival, had ended class conflict.38 Horror comics questioned this rosy picture. In their pages, housewives weaponized their sparkling kitchen appliances to dismember, parboil, and blend to mush their problematic patriarchs. Parents found themselves the victims of misfit children. Men dug graves for their spouses in backyards, the stink of a rotting corpse intermingling with the smell of newly mown grass. 10.Two-Fisted Tales WAS THERE a political motive behind EC? On the one hand, Bill Gaines and Al Feldstein appeared to adopt a smash-and-grab style of attack on popular attitudes with no clear political agenda. In an advertisement for new writers in the February 1954 issue of Writer’s Digest, Gaines asked prospective authors to recall that “We love walking corpse stories” and tales in which “the villain tries to get away with murder—and probably does. No cops and robbers stories. Virtue doesn’t have to triumph over evil.” In a time that worked assiduously to maintain a frozen smile, it’s impossible to overemphasize how much this represented a call for anarchy. Moreover, while EC has received understandable credit (or blame) for pioneering such stories, nearly 150 different horror comic titles appeared in the early fifties from their rivals, most reveling in the same kind of brutal art and gruesome storytelling. Sometimes much more specific political critique of the American empire appeared from EC. Readers, including a new wave of adult readers, began to see the EC brand as a mark of quality and maturity—not to mention bloody images and bleak ideas hard to find in other nooks and crannies of popular culture. Horror remained the primary draw, and few companies other than EC managed to come up with a continuing stream of exceptionally weird ideas, macabre humor, and unforgettable artwork. But the work of Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood ensured EC horror would be tinctured with an even stronger dose of cultural criticism than The Crypt of Terror or Vault of Horror. A series of comics took on American imperialism past and present, often telling truer tales of American history than most of the era’s school textbooks. Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat, titles that seemed to promise childish conceptions of war, carried a radically different message. Kurtzman, who authored most of EC’s war comics, grew up in Brooklyn and the Bronx in the 1920s and ’30s. His family left Odessa after World War I. His stepfather (his father died when Kurtzman was very young) regularly read the radical Daily Worker and could be described as an active socialist at a time when the movement conceived of itself as deeply American and patriotic. Kurtzman joined the army soon after high school. Although trained as a rifleman, his talents as an artist and writer soon found him illustrating posters and camp newspapers. Wallace Wood (known to everyone in the EC bullpen as Woody) grew up in Minnesota, graduating high school near the end of World War II. He served briefly in the Merchant Marine and then as a paratrooper in the Army Airborne. In his early work for EC, horror from and in space became his first love and he excelled in imagining Lovecraftian creatures rearing their oily tentacles and oozing green slime. But Woody’s turn to war comics made horror much more visceral and, along with Kurtzman, created what can only be described as anti-war war comics. Kurtzman told an interviewer in 1972 that “all our stories really protested war.” Woody covered the panels of EC’s war comics with decaying body parts and, in one particularly haunting tale of trench warfare in the First World War, featured a rat crawling out of an empty eye socket in no-man’s-land. Even a story of the Revolutionary War, “Pell’s Point,” questioned the values of a gung ho Continental Army soldier who ends up bayonetted in a foolish and pointless show of bravado.39 Most astonishing of all, a 1953 Kurtzman/Wood tale called “Atom Bomb” followed the daily life of a Japanese family in Nagasaki. Wood drew bodies swept into a sky on fire but also the slow death of radiation sickness that followed. Kurtzman ended the story by showing a young survivor but also recording the grim statistics of the blast.40 This comic masterpiece appeared at a time when very few Americans understood the consequences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The U.S. government made a full-throated effort to squelch information about the death toll of the bomb and the effects of radiation sickness. John Hersey’s book had already passed out of the American consciousness, and in fact historian Paul Boyer suggests its account may have allowed readers to face the horror of the A-bomb and then literally “close the book on that episode.”41 EC encouraged readers young and old to reopen the black book of American crimes. Both their war and horror lines joined in a full-frontal assault on the values and assumptions of white Americans in the 1950s. Why did anyone want to read an attack on their values? David Hajdu has suggested that the success of EC emerged out of the fear of the times. The empty-eyed corpses that shambled from panic to panel in EC and their competition “could not have been far removed from the readers’ mental pictures of their own fate in the wake of the nuclear holocaust.” Maybe at least some Americans were terrified of what their values might do to them and the world.42 Not surprisingly, the efforts of EC and its artists and writers attracted plenty of unwanted attention. The FBI briefly investigated EC in the final year of the Korean War. An April 29, 1952, memo from Hoover’s office suggested that the government might render a charge of sedition against Gaines and even specific artists. EC comics, the memo read, “tend to discredit the army and undermine troop morale.”43 Other comic publishers faced similar scrutiny, none more than Lev Gleason of Lev Gleason Publications. His company’s series Crime Doesn’t Pay seemed to promise a moral message in its very title. It told stories from the perspective of criminals themselves. Although Gleason could point to the fact that the characters in these books did face the consequences of their actions in the final panels, the stories tended to build sympathy for bank robbers and crime lords in a fashion not dissimilar from gangster pictures of the thirties such as The Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Gleason also faced intense personal scrutiny from the FBI, who closely monitored his activities during World War II. In December of 1943, Hoover sent a memo to the special agent in charge of the New York bureau ordering the office to “immediately open a case” on Gleason that would “develop fully all information on his Communist activities.” Gleason does not seem to have ever been a member of the CPUSA, though he certainly worked with communists. The FBI investigation focused on three matters in particular: Gleason and his wife traveled to Mexico City for a meeting of an organization devoted to aiding refugees of the Spanish Civil War. He attended meetings of the left-wing Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. Most damning, from the perspective of Hoover’s men in black, Gleason wrote a letter to the editor of the Newcastle News that praised “our ally” the Soviet Union during World War II at a time when, in fact, the Soviet Union was our ally.44 The FBI lost interest in the investigation, possibly because heavier thunderheads emerged over the comics industry by 1953. A national panic developed over comics in the aftermath of the brutal but indecisive Korean War. Students of folklore describe such moments as a moral panic, a widespread sense that some kind of poisonous conspiracy planned to subvert society. A moral panic has far sharper incisors than what’s sometimes called an urban legend. A panic may begin with the sharing of baseless stories told as personal anecdotes. But it ends with legal and political authorities taking such stories seriously and announcing to the public that some insidious danger threatens the very foundations of national life. The great comic book scare had numerous sources in the 1950s. The actual content, both imagery and text, played more of a role than the problematic idea of “mass hysteria.” EC and their many imitators really did challenge some of the basic values of America’s dominant culture; in the lurid beauty of their pages, American family life became an abattoir, with spouses plotting each other’s demise while teenage rebellion took the form of homicide. The angry dead refused to stay in their graves, a disturbing image at any time but particularly after a half century of corpses being produced by global war. Artists suggested that war and the military represented pointless bloodletting and institutionalized sadism. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee led an investigation of possible links between what the era called “juvenile delinquency” and comics. His committee soon moved on to an investigation of organized crime for which he became famous. But the grassroots hand-wringing of parents, clergy, and civic leaders continued, their fears blooming an angry red. Parochial schools and PTAs held public burnings of comics, and now and again parents took it upon themselves to purify their households of the comic scourge. Some of these burnings involved students allegedly gathering up offensive comics themselves, although David Hajdu’s interviews with participants at several of these local events revealed that many of the students never read the comics anyway, while some may have developed an interest in them while stoking the bonfires. At a Catholic high school in New Jersey, one alum remembered years later that as they stacked comics for incineration, a pile developed of “jungle books, with their covers of heroines swinging from vines in leopard-skin bikinis.” That particular pile disappeared, saved from the conflagration by “several of the young crusaders” who hid it “under a step in the boys’ lavatory.”45 The war against comics coalesced at the national level in a series of Senate hearings culminating in the industry creating their own Comics Code. EC refused to comply, only to find they’d been abandoned. They would turn to the magazine format with many in their stable of artists, like Wally Wood, working for companies that created horror magazines like Creepy and Eerie to continue the EC tradition. The size and the amount of text in the new magazines allowed them to operate safely outside the Comics Code. Twenty-six publishers assented to the code and incorporated the Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) to administer its standards. Charles F. Murphy, a judge with a particular concern for the alleged outbreak of juvenile delinquency, headed the association. Most publishers felt they could keep sales up by sanitizing their comics while also destroying competitors who essentially depended on crime and horror fantasy. In a move that clearly suggested this mercenary motive, one of the first provisions of the new code banned the use of even the words horror and terror. The German émigré Fredric Wertham has usually been presented as the villain behind the death of EC’s glory days. His November 1953 Ladies’ Home Journal article “What Parents Don’t Know About Comic Books” appeared to lend scientific justification for parental anxiety. The book born from his somewhat limited reading of comics bore the dangerously sensationalist title Seduction of the Innocent. Wertham’s book appeared at a time when local police produced public service announcements like the Inglewood, California, police department’s “Boys Beware,” which insisted in the ugliest of terms that gay men are by definition sexual predators. Wertham’s willingness to tap into those dark energies remains unforgivable, particularly since it seems his own celebrity became his driving motivation as national fame beckoned.46 However, Wertham himself remains a complicated figure. He did not favor complete censorship of comics and his reputation as the incarnation of a killjoy has overshadowed his work on, for example, the Brown v. Board of Education case the same year he released Seduction of the Innocent. His work on Brown grew in part from the free psychiatric clinic he ran for African Americans in New York City, at a time when the Black community continued to be denied any access to mental health care beyond segregated and often brutal institutionalization. Influenced to some degree by the Frankfurt School’s critique of popular culture, he saw comics and television as narcotics for the masses, especially dangerous to the young.47 Wertham saved his harshest words for comics that related in any way to the supernatural. They were, he insisted, “horror, crime, sadism, monsters, ghouls, corpses dead and alive . . .” He unfortunately could not see that the best of these tales mirrored many of his own concerns over social justice and American apathy. In the many stories of nonconformist adolescents that peopled the pages of Vault and Crypt, parents are repeatedly shown as desensitized by exhausting work, television, and their afternoon martinis. EC even broached the topic of American racism at a moment when most white readers would have been unaware of a struggle for racial justice or its origins in the Civil War and Reconstruction era. The final comic published by the company in February of 1956, an issue of Incredible Science Fiction, featured a story called “Judgment Day!” in which a human astronaut visits a planet of orange automata that has long been at war with blue automata. The orange mechanicals, we learn, once enslaved their blue counterparts. The astronaut decides the planet has not advanced enough beyond the most savage prejudices to join an intergalactic alliance. As he blasts off to return to earth, he removes his helmet to reveal that he is an African American, a not-so-subtle note to the reader about the nature of the allegory they just read. The very moderate liberal appeal to tolerance in a science fiction tale proved too much for the CMAA. When Feldstein submitted the story for approval, Judge Murphy leaned back in his heavy leather chair and looked gimlet-eyed at the editor. “You can’t have a Negro,” Murphy declared flatly. Feldstein, genuinely shocked, asked what part of the Comics Code forbid the representation of Black people. Murphy said he had the authority to forbid it. Feldstein walked out. Back at the EC bullpen, the news made Gaines something more than furious. He was finished with comics. He let Murphy know that he planned to hold a press conference describing the effort to censor “Judgment Day!” and tell anyone who would listen that the Comics Code apparently had a deeply racist agenda. Murphy called Gaines and announced a sudden change of heart, but he bizarrely suggested that the final panel should be fine as long as the artist removed the beads of sweat popping from the character’s forehead. Apparently, Murphy considered an African American man sweating in a comic too suggestive. “Fuck you,” Gaines said, and slammed down the phone.48 EC published the story with only one change. Feldstein called attention to the controversial perspiration by adding to the text that “the instrument lights [of the spaceship] made the beads of perspiration on his dark skin twinkle like distant stars.” Gaines had largely been right when he suggested that the Comics Code allowed for racist caricature. In fact, white supremacist fantasies, ignored by the conservative critics of comics, flourished in “jungle adventure” stories not dissimilar from the mad-scientist-zombie-jungle-horror films in the forties, fifties, and sixties (explored in the next section of this book). But Wertham is not guilty by association. Part of his critique of comics in general, if not EC in particular, concerned how “jungle adventure” tales affected the self-esteem of Black children and encouraged a rancid racism in their white counterparts.49 William W. Savage Jr. explained the racist assumptions of this comic genre well when he described, in his wonderfully researched and written Commies, Cowboys, and Jungle Queens: Comic Books and America, 1945–1954, the “jungle lords and ladies” that all imitated Tarzan in stories that regarded Black people as “a form of fauna” not so different from “lions, panthers, snakes, [and] elephants.”50 The incredibly creative and perhaps surprisingly socially conscious horror and crime comics created some interesting work. Fans of EC, for example, included what would become a new generation of horror film directors who would completely reimagine how to tell tales of terror in a darkened theater. George A. Romero even drew on the visual style of comics, noting how they had influenced the way he shot and edited Dawn of the Dead.51 Perhaps Wertham was correct that comic creators engaged in a spree of “horror, crime, sadism, monsters.” What he missed is that such stories grew directly out of the tortured history of the nation. By the 1960s, more and more Americans would come to agree with Malcolm X, and EC comics, that they’d been sold an “American dream” but found themselves in an “American nightmare.”",

      "title": "1.Black Magic Island",
      "content": "1.Black Magic Island WHITE ZOMBIE (1932) is all atmosphere. It’s a film of shadow, jungle, and cemeteries, the ground itself extruding fog and dread. The undead menacingly stumble in the tropical night, their frightening cadence moving in disturbing rhythm with the drums from the blind, hot darkness. Not everyone saw its charms. Mocking the film in a July 1932 review, a reviewer for The New York Times snarked that “Necromancers waved their sinister hands from the screen of the Rivoli yesterday and tried to hypnotize blondes into killing their boyfriends. A legion of individuals, with deceased minds but alert bodies, threw butlers into subterranean streams.”1 It may have sounded ludicrous, but the flick had something going for it. Bela Lugosi played Murder Legendre, a sorcerer who knows the secrets of the dead and the undead. His role in the low-budget effort seemed an odd choice for the actor, fresh off the box office bonanza of Dracula. Lugosi’s role in the film may seem inexplicable, but the film’s subject could not have been more relevant. The generation born at the turn of the twentieth century held an enormous interest in Haiti since, by 1932, the United States had occupied the country for seventeen years. The 1915 invasion of Haiti by American troops could have been predicted by anyone who watched the trajectory of American power. Haiti seemed predestined to attract American attention. After its revolution in the 1790s, it became the first republic of African peoples in the new world. This meant, as historian Raphael Dalleo wrote in his book American Imperialism’s Undead, that “Haiti represented the idea that black people could be agents of world history.” White America, North and South, trembled at Haiti’s example during the antebellum slave regime. Following the Civil War, as slavery ended but segregation took its place, Haiti remained a bothersome symbol to a country whose mainstream politicians regularly and openly spoke of America as “a white man’s country.”2 Although the very existence of Haiti rankled many Americans, other variables ultimately led to the invasion and occupation. The administration of Woodrow Wilson agreed with American corporate interests that the island, long closed to the incursion of the American market, had to be seized. U.S. corporate interests shuddered at a provision in the Haitian constitution forbidding foreigners from owning land, an assertion of independence galling to the values of global piracy. The City Bank of New York, now the financial conglomerate Citigroup, demanded the deletion of this provision to facilitate the building of a railroad. The U.S. Marines promptly expropriated the land of farmers, and much of Haiti became a plantation economy in the 1920s.3 White Zombie probed Americans’ fears about Haiti and legitimated them. The long-suffering country became a world of sorcery and superstition during the occupation. The best-selling 1929 book The Magic Island by William Seabrook described the mélange of African, Arawak, and European traditions called Vodun (or “spirit” in the African Fon and Ewe languages) as a wicked necromancy that demanded the drinking of blood and resurrected the dead as shambling zombies. In 1927, the forty-three-year-old Seabrook had published a tale of his travels in the Middle East that emphasized the allegedly exotic and uncanny nature of the region carved up by Britain, France, and the United States after the Great War. He went to Haiti to do some similar ideological work, at times criticizing the attitudes of Marine officers but also emphasizing the alleged “economic prosperity and political peace” brought by “our own benevolent American protectorate.” The supposedly wicked nature of Vodun ultimately justified the American seizure of the island. Although his attitudes about the tradition are complicated (he could describe the “beauty” of a Vodun ceremony), Seabrook ultimately decided to use adjectives like monstrous, obscene, or forbidding to seduce the American reader eager to hear of a black magic island. Haiti as a country dominated by “voodoo” quickly became a standard part of the American horror tradition. Readers of horror pulps such as Weird Tales, best-known today as the outlet for the work of H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, encountered stories like the December 1924 tale “Voodoo.” Written by Arthur J. Burks, a marine during the early part of the occupation, the story reads like a fictional travelogue in which an American soldier rescues his buddy from “a devilish ceremony.” Burks’s version of Vodun did not include zombies but described other diabolical features like “a priestess of the serpent” planning to sacrifice a teenaged girl. In August of 1925, Burks wrote another occult tale set in Haiti called “Black Medicine,” which presented the islanders as worshippers of a demonic green serpent.4 The pedigree of White Zombie, like much in the American horror tradition, lay in the emergence of the United States as a postwar global colossus. Frightful and titillating to white audiences, it played to American fascination with the peoples it ruled. It also legitimized that rule by telling white America it had to suppress the evils lurking in the night. White Zombie borrows from themes found in the 1930s golden age of horror. There’s a bit of the “old dark house” concept, only it’s an old dark plantation in the jungle rather than a mansion on a lonely moor suffering through another dark and stormy night. A young couple, Madeleine and Neil, are set to marry in the Caribbean because the hopeful husband works at “the Bank of Port Au Prince,” a notable theme given the role of American banking interests in the invasion of Haiti. The plantation owner desires the bride-to-be and enlists the aid of Legendre the zombie master. Legendre poisons Madeleine on her wedding night only to bring her back as the slave of the plantation owner. Advertising for the film promised audiences that the heroine (played by beauty Madge Bellamy) would have to “perform his every desire.” Sadly, for audiences hoping for salacious material, they only got to see Bellamy play the piano with a thousand-yard stare. Filmed just before the Motion Picture Production Code went into effect, the film does show the audience her compelling figure while wiggling into her trousseau. As native women help with her voluminous undergarments, we see her nearly weep with horror when she hears drums in the night. By today’s standards, the scene is more than modest but certainly offered strong sauce for 1932. The sexual subtext remains throughout and the implications of a white blonde being a physical and mental captive in Haiti are allowed to smolder. In early notices, Lugosi’s eyes and magical grip appear abstracted in a sea of jungle green on a poster that promises “with these zombie eyes he rendered her powerless.” After Madeleine’s undeath, the wronged husband pines away for the return of his blonde, but on learning from a sympathetic missionary that she may have become a zombie and “fallen into the hands of natives,” he drunkenly raves, “not that . . . better death than that!” White Zombie gave viewers all manner of bewildering messages about Haiti. On the one hand, it showed the exploitation of the labor of native peoples. One of the most intriguing set pieces takes place in a sugarcane mill. Zombified workers drudge bundles of cane to the top of a catwalk to drop into the mill’s churning blades. Moving in a stolid trance, the undead look more or less like any set of workers toiling under the burdens of plantation labor . . . or of underpaid, disregarded “free” labor. The film even evokes the history of slavery on the island and the new world more generally. A missionary who befriends the unlucky couple makes the historically dubious claim that the pharmaceutical magic necessary for making a zombie came “from Africa” and, farther back, “civilizations old when Egypt was young.” Americans are lights of civilization and morality. “Haiti is full of nonsense and superstition,” insists the missionary, who wants to defeat Legendre’s plan so that he can bring the light of truth to the island he portrays as lousy with “witch doctors.” White audiences left Lugosi’s new hit with their sense of racial superiority intact. This would have been true whether they walked out of the theater with the ugly racist porn of a white woman captive to native desires on their mind or the sense that the uncivilized native peoples of the world needed America’s help to escape “nonsense and superstition.” In fact, by 1932, Americans had believed this about the Caribbean, Latin America, and much of the Pacific world for decades. 2.Jungle Fever THE UNITED States opened the twentieth century by taking on the decayed Spanish empire in Cuba and annexing the Hawaiian Islands. President William McKinley baldly asserted that that United States needed the latter for a military base. Toppling Spanish control over Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines would create more complex problems. In order to build a new, more fluid imperial style, American leadership developed patterns of rhetoric, control, and explosive violence used throughout the century. Cuban leaders, who fought against Spanish rule for decades, looked uneasily at American occupation forces even as they hoped for the best. They would be deeply disappointed. In 1901, an army appropriations bill in Congress came tainted with poison for Cuban democracy. The Platt Amendment, inserted into the new Cuban constitution at gunpoint, allowed the United States a laundry list of privileges on the enormous island and capped them all by giving the United States the right to intervene in the country’s affairs at any time. Cuba’s economy belonged to American corporations for sixty years and the people would be ruled by a series of dictators selected by the United States.5 The Philippines, an enormous archipelago of nearly eight thousand separate islands, proved more challenging to dominate. After winning freedom from the Spanish, Filipino insurgents continued the fight for years against American forces that refused to end their occupation. American troops killed thousands of Filipino fighters and civilians caught in the crossfire. American forces introduced a torture method later known as waterboarding and even more egregious forms of torture that included pumping seawater into the veins of suspected insurgents. The United States came to rule the Philippines but never annexed it outright and granted the country limited independence in 1946, leaving behind military bases and handpicked pro-American dictators. The brutal experiment in the Philippines allowed American leaders to construct a sense of American nationalism with clear borders while extending economic and military power with a limitless circumference. American leaders at home had their eyes on markets. Moreover, politicians proved less wary of talking in terms of empire than they would later in the twentieth century. President McKinley spoke of a civilizing and Christianizing mission, but in the Senate, Henry Cabot Lodge simply described the need for military bases that would open the promising market of China and “the far East” more generally. White supremacy at home became the justification for intervention abroad. At the beginning of the twentieth century, state laws ignored the Fifteenth Amendment and part of the legacy of the American Civil War by disenfranchising African Americans. Beginning in 1876, accusations of voter fraud became the bludgeon to use against the Black vote. Meanwhile, the country accepted de facto and de jure segregation of all public life and services with the blessing of the Supreme Court. American soldiers in the Philippines used racist epithets with roots in American slavery to describe the islands’ peoples alongside a new phrase with uncertain origin, gugus. Scholars have suggested it’s a mocking term for a language the American invaders did not understand or perhaps a word for sex workers on the islands.6 Gugu became the gruesome word gook, a dehumanizing term that has followed the American flag all over the globe. By 1920, during the occupation of Haiti, a reporter for The Nation noted that American troops called the Haitians this term and treated them “with every variety of contempt, insult, and brutality.” He described how American officers spoke of trips to the island’s interior to, in the marines’ words, “bump off gooks” with comparisons made to duck hunting. The racist term reappeared in the Korean War and, most infamously, the Vietnam War.7 White supremacy at home shaped foreign policy abroad. Though remembered in many American history textbooks as an idealist, Woodrow Wilson took the United States into the Great War, now generally referred to as World War I, with a mission of empire building grounded in his own conception of white supremacy. A Southerner by birth, Wilson famously praised the deeply racist film The Birth of a Nation (1915) and remained a defender of Jim Crow segregation throughout his life. Wilson’s attitude toward African Americans extended not only to Haitians but to the Mexican people as well. The Wilson administration staged several “interventions” and “expeditions” into the nation aflame with revolutionary fervor, allegedly as a “punitive” response to the raids of Pancho Villa along the New Mexico–Texas border. John J. Pershing, who pursued Geronimo in 1886 and savaged the Filipino insurgents, attempted and failed to capture Villa. Two years later, Wilson appointed Pershing to lead American forces in the Great War. Pershing’s careless use of American lives led to catastrophic losses given the United States actively participated in the global war for only a few months. The effects of early American forays into imperial conquest remain with us. Haiti never recovered from its years of occupation and would face future American invasions and occupations. White anger simmered at Mexico and Mexican Americans, a hatred of the conquered by the conqueror. The anger became explosive violence. Lynch mobs terrorized the Tejano community from 1916 into the 1920s. The Texas state government effectively disenfranchised all Latinos through poll taxes, the same method used to take ballots away from African Americans in much of the South. One Texas rancher called for “detention camps along the border” and the building of infrastructure to allow the American military ingress into Mexico. Historian Stephen Hahn estimates that several thousand Tejanos died at the hands of white mobs, the police, and the military in the years after the Pershing invasion.8 Today, the United States maintains a military presence, and allows paramilitary vigilantes to operate, along the border with Mexico, protecting the territory seized from the country in the nineteenth century. In 2019, in Texas alone, the United States held 14,500 people in precisely the kind of concentration camps called for in the 1910s. Despite this legacy, Wilson’s rhetoric about “self-determination” in his “Fourteen Points” (Georges Clemenceau quipped that “The good Lord had only ten!”) burnished his image as an early globalist. Behind the scenes, the American government made clear its real intent. Wilson’s secretary of state, Robert Lansing, insisted that the language of self-determination did not apply to “races, peoples or communities whose state of barbarism or ignorance deprive them of the capacity to choose intelligently their political affiliations.” The lands with “devilish ceremonies” would remain subject to the American world order. White Zombie suggested a horrifying paradox, one that American military and economic power would never allow. The phrase banana republic still makes the rounds, even used since the eighties as the theme for a clothing store catering to youthful, middlebrow tastes. It’s meant to evoke a tropical dictatorship, absurdly corrupt and laughably underdeveloped. While used by most Americans to express disdain for foreign institutions, the phrase first appeared as an epithet for American maleficence in Central America. O. Henry in his 1904 short story “The Admiral” first used the term in relation to Honduras. In that country, the New York/Boston–based United Fruit Company acquired vast lands and ownership of most of the railways and ports. In 1911, the company used its own funds to pay for a coup that installed a dictator more amenable to United Fruit’s neocolonial policy. Zombie republics might be a better descriptor for many of the countries where American corporate and military power exercised control. Stripped of economic resources and moving at the direction of United States–supported puppet dictators, they represented decayed versions of hopes for autonomy and independence, the rotting corpses of colonial states subject to American necromancy. 3.Bombs and Movies GERMAN THINKERS forced to emigrate to the United States from Nazi Germany in the thirties, particularly philosophers and social critics like Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, worried that an American equivalent of European fascism could easily emerge in their new homeland. They feared that, as in Weimar Germany, the crass nature of American pop culture softened up the brain for fascism. “Automobiles, bombs, and movies,” they wrote, all did their part in assuring mainstream America that the concept of an American way of life was not a belief but just common sense. Adorno and his colleagues are usually loosely grouped together as the Frankfurt School, named after the original site of their research institute in Frankfurt, Germany. In a bleak irony, the institute for Marxist studies established by primarily Jewish thinkers there became the home of Germany’s major Zyklon B manufacturing plants. The reputation of the Frankfurt School has been fusty and fraught. They not only seemed like a squad for the fun police in their distaste for popular culture, but sometimes as the reactionaries they certainly were not. Adorno, for example, critiqued the use of rock music in anti-war protests during the 1960s in such a way that he appeared to criticize the idea of protest itself. Now and again, they just seemed absurd, as when Adorno wondered aloud about the fascist proclivities of escalators—one had to surrender one’s autonomy to ride one, after all. It did not help their reputation with the sixties generation, or later generations, that Adorno and his colleagues often chose to be abstruse and abstract when they could have easily explained. More recently, scholars and a wider literary culture have decided the fussy Frankfurt School might have been on to something after all. Alex Ross, a contemporary writer for the New Yorker fascinated with this band of émigré culture critics, wrote that Adorno would have looked grimly at how the twenty-first century proved him right. In a prescient warning in 2014, Ross wrote that much of our social media landscape looks very much like an Adornoesque nightmare. “Technology conspires with populism,” he suggested, “to create an ideologically vacant dictatorship of likes.” In 2016, Stuart Jeffries, author of a collective biography of the Frankfurt School critics, told Vox that Trump speaks in a “stream-of-consciousness gibberish” free of “thought” and “historical memory.” Jeffries sees him as a product of exactly what Adorno feared. He folded “pop entertainment into politics” and created a “spectacle” that requires nothing but attention to thrive.9 Long before the “dictatorship of likes,” small genre films did shape how white America looked at the rest of the world. While empire dared not speak its name since the early years of the twentieth century, horror films often relentlessly hammered home its racist logic. In everyday conversation, we use the term ideology to mean something like “a political position held to with some conviction.” Since the nineteenth century, its denotative meaning has been a set of ideas that everything from media to market values asks us to accept as “common sense” or “the way things are.” The most ideological documents are precisely those we don’t perceive as ideological . . . maybe even those it seems laughable to perceive as such. What works better than an advertisement that makes fun of advertising, or a film that manages us with the camera’s privileged point of view? Horror in American culture has been more than a catharsis, more than a reflection of anxieties, more than the need to test the limits of our fears. It has played an integral role in what Adorno called “the culture industry.” The manufacture of dark images of the allegedly primitive corners of the earth has been a thrumming cog in the machine of empire. If we take the best of the Frankfurt School at its word, the horror film proved a necessary element in the American public’s acceptance of, and even entertainment through, America’s imperial ambitions. Warning in 1933 about the popularity of King Kong, a film that became something of an archetype for films that combined horror with the alleged primitivism of most of the world, Adorno described it as a tale of Americans who, without realizing it, agreed to be cast as “walk-on parts in a monster documentary.” 4.Welcome (Back) to the Jungle IN 1941, just as the United States entered the Second World War, King of the Zombies attempted to tell a story of rough-and-ready agents of the OSS (forerunner to the CIA) combating an unnamed foreign government on a Caribbean island “somewhere between Puerto Rico and Cuba.” This seems an absurdly obtuse reference to Haiti. But in truth it’s scripted as a nonspecific anywhere, the savage jungle of imperial imagination. Crash-landing on the island, the two white agents and their African American valet, Jefferson Jackson, find a plantation house where Dr. Sangre (“Dr. Blood”) pretends to be a refugee from Nazi-controlled Vienna. In fact, Sangre blends science and an alliance with a “voodoo priestess” in a nefarious scheme that involves kidnapping a rear admiral of a foreign nation and seizing the Panama Canal, one of the early twentieth-century outposts of American imperial power. Sangre’s dastardly plot is to use a “voodoo ceremony” and his army of zombies to force the captive admiral to reveal the “canal zone defenses” for “his government.” Most of the American audience likely assumed the alleged Austrian refugee worked for Hitler but, depending on where they fell on the political spectrum, might have placed him in the employ of Stalin. King of the Zombies makes full use of racist imagery that delighted and frightened white audiences all at once. Dr. Sangre’s zombies are “big black ones,” as an OSS agent affirms. Later in the film, an agent calls them Sangre’s “ape men.” Meanwhile the accomplished Black humorist Mantan Moreland embodied the American stereotype of African American men with Jefferson Jackson, complete with malapropisms and a perpetually pop-eyed expression. Moreland remains one of the great forgotten talents of midcentury Hollywood, his reputation obscured by the racist cartoons he was forced to pantomime if he wanted to work at all.10 King of the Zombies shows an important side of horror science fiction too often ignored in the forties and fifties. It’s easy to see the metaphor for communist invasion and infiltration in the flying saucers flitting about the screens of the era. But there’s another side to the horror culture of World War II and the decades that followed. Americans obsessed over invasion, but it was not only communist powers coming to American shores. Filmmakers found the public hungry for various kinds of colonial horror, films in which representatives of white civilization are the invaders in imagined Latin Americas and Africas, meeting with the “superstition” of “primitives” that turns out to be all too real. Americans did not even have to turn to film to get an entrée of primitivism matched with horror. At the 1939 New York World’s Fair in Flushing, the “South Seas” exhibit offered a “zombie-themed restaurant,” showing once again the way the geographies of monster and empire could collapse into one another. The theme of racism and American power appeared at the fair in the form of African Americans portraying natives in the fair’s “Jungleland” and minstrel singers like Bill “Bojangles” Robinson performing. These representations of the atavistic subjects of the American empire becomes all the more striking when considering the 1939 fair’s celebration of “The World of Tomorrow.”11 These are entertainments aimed at the perpetually aggrieved empire. White America imagined itself becoming the victim of an invasion from beyond, but it also listened to stories of how it could become the victim of people of color abroad. Jungle horror legitimized racism at home and offered a rationale for an aggressive foreign policy, the creation of zombie republics. Bride of the Gorilla (1951) takes place in what appears to be Dutch Guiana (now Surinam) in Latin America. But the contradictory messages the audience had to read in the geography of the B-movie tell us much about Cold War America’s understanding of the world and its place in it. The mix of characters the film presented as foreign, even though they are in their homeland, are represented as Asian, other times African, and only vaguely Latin American. The only real geography is a nondescript “jungle” that narrator Lon Chaney Jr. describes as “lush, green . . . as old as time” and willing to “[take] the law into its own hands.” It’s a new frontier, pilgrim. Curt Siodmak, émigré (and escapee) from Hitler’s Germany, wrote the screenplay. A successful novelist by the fifties, Siodmak is also known for his better-than-it had-to-be script for The Wolf Man. Contending with much lower production values and a sillier plot, Bride of the Gorilla managed to be somewhat literate even with its racist assumption that the non-white peoples of the globe represented a malignant threat to American power. The Van Gelder estate becomes the “old dark plantation” in Bride of the Gorilla. We’re never told the cash crop or where the story takes place. The audience only knows it’s somewhere all white people agree is not in the civilized world. The jungle itself becomes a monstrous, mysterious entity working its will through a witch doctor who witnesses the white overseer murder the plantation owner. Adultery and subsequent marriage to the plantation mistress are the crimes that the jungle unleashes its wrath against, not the colonial economy or the overseer’s sexual exploitation of Indigenous people shown early in the film. A white man has taken a wealthier white man’s woman and the punishment will be . . . becoming black and then turning into a primate. The jungle takes away his whiteness and then makes him something inhuman. It’s the threat implied in the phrase white zombie in another form. Konga (1961) followed a similar heavily racialized theme. The audience receives a more exact geography this time: the dangerous monster comes from Africa, specifically Uganda. When Konga appeared, the British protectorate smoldered with rising nationalist sentiment that some in the United States, nearly inevitably, connected with socialism. British rule had been somewhat benign in Uganda. However, benign in an imperial context meant that indentured servanthood rather than genocide became the fate of many of the Indigenous peoples. Discontent roiled the country, which won its independence in 1962. In Konga, the colonies came home. A mad scientist has spent a year “with friendly natives” where he met the omnipresent “witch doctor,” who taught him how to use “seeds to control his subjects.” Konga the chimp comes home to London and transforms into Konga the monster, rampaging through the city like his obvious giant ape ancestor King Kong. Colonial independence meant monsters at home. The United States would, a few years after Uganda’s independence, endorse British and Israeli intelligence efforts to install Idi Amin. In the 1970s, the CIA helped supply him with arms. A bit like Konga, the brutal regime in Uganda would be a joint British and American production.12 But did anyone really take away these kinds of political messages from low-budget horror films? They were only movies, right? Horror films told audiences that if they left the United States for anywhere but Europe, they’d find it really was a jungle out there. Sitting, maybe giggling, through King of the Zombies and Bride of the Gorilla, shoes sticky on the popcorn-butter-splattered floor, white audiences could sit back and learn why theirs was just the best nation ever. The rest of the world seemed filled with superstition and sorcerers, mad scientists and their monsters. The non-white world probably needed an invasion, a first strike. Corporate and political interests helped produce the real “monster documentary.” In Guatemala, next door to the earlier zombie republic of Honduras, United Fruit even seized control of the postal service to ensure fast delivery of their product. The company would eventually own three and a half million acres in Central America and the Caribbean. Most of this land underwent a process best described as agricultural fracking, a transformation of small holdings into banana and sugarcane plantations and vast tracts of land for railroads and ports to ensure Americans received a steady supply of fresh bananas. In the second half of the twentieth century, United Fruit, today rebranded as Chiquita Brands International, could count on American foreign policy to conform to its designs. In the 1950s, Eisenhower’s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, best known for his streetfighter style of anti-communism, performed legal work for United Fruit. So did his brother, CIA Director Allen Dulles. In 1954, the CIA orchestrated a coup against the government of Jacobo Árbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala, when he nationalized almost half of United Fruit’s holdings as part of his plans for agrarian reform. The Dulles brothers saw Árbenz as a crypto-communist with ties to Moscow even though their own intelligence reports concluded no such thing. The CIA trained a small army of mercenaries and funneled arms through Honduras and Nicaragua, right-wing dictatorships dependent on the United States. Bombing runs by CIA pilots convinced Guatemalans and their president they would face a full-scale invasion by the United States. America’s clandestine service further created chaos in the country by suggesting the occurrence of an alien invasion. Planting false tales of all kinds and then taking over a shortwave radio station, CIA operatives warned of flying saucer sightings and plans by the government to close churches and force everyone to worship Stalin. Bombing and assassinations proved even more convincing, of course, though clearly some CIA field agents had been listening to Walter Bedell Smith when he suggested the use of space invaders for psychological warfare. CIA black ops specialist E. Howard Hunt said frankly that the United States wanted “a terror campaign” and compared the work done in Guatemala positively to the fear inspired by Nazi Stuka bombers over Poland.13 The terror campaign worked. Árbenz chose to step down and go into exile and a military junta headed by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas seized control of the country, and thus did the United States. The United Fruit Company benefitted enormously from the coup, again showing the degree to which capitalism drove the American empire. In fact, the New Orleans–based corporation helped finance the effort. A CIA cable two years before the government’s overthrow assured the Pentagon that “[redacted] officials of the United Fruit Company have promised financial aid. [Redacted] and Castillo met in Baton Rouge, LA in December . . . [Redacted] will get money in Honduras and deliver it to Castillo in that country.”14 If the seizure of the country by the right-wing dictatorship proved a boon for United Fruit and its stockholders, a curse fell on the people of Guatemala. Outlawing labor unions and indeed any effort by campesinos to organize politically represented the least of the regime’s crimes. Castillo imprisoned tens of thousands of people for “communist sympathies,” all at the advice of Allen Dulles. The resulting Guatemalan Civil War resulted in the deaths of two hundred thousand civilians over several decades, years in which the U.S. government provided the regime with hundreds of millions of dollars.15 The United States sought to perfect the small-footprint empire. Why occupy a country and annex territory when covert ops, corporate interest, off-the-books murders, and proxy armies could install American assets as dictators? The year before the intervention in Guatemala, an American-led coup in Iran overthrew the elected prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq because he favored the nationalization of foreign oil interests. Placing the unpopular Reza Shah Pahlavi on the throne, the CIA and U.S. special forces turned the republic into a monarchical police state.16 Films shaped American conceptions about Latin America, the nature of the Cold War, white supremacy, and the prerogatives of the United States around the world. It is hard not to see the kind of soft power even B-movies could exercise on public opinion and its underlying attitudes. In fact, outside of a few slapstick comedies that made light of mustachioed generals ruling “banana republics,” Americans saw no real representations of Latin America and the Caribbean other than horror. Moviegoers had their choice of bizarrely lighthearted romps concerned with corruption and military dictatorship in the tropics (with, of course, no hint that the United States funded and armed these regimes) or frightening portrayals of exotic jungles of temptation and terror where the king of the zombies, ancient curses, and threats to white women and white manhood waited. Send in the marines, somebody. America’s vast colonial undertaking in the twentieth century bundled together packet injections of geopolitical ambition, folklore, rumor legends, and films to shape the acceptance of the empire. Films and bombs, as the Frankfurt School argued, kept the United States on its imperial course while the American people played their walk-on parts in a monster doc. 5.Night(s) of the Living Dead ERIC BLAIR, known to the world as George Orwell, sat in his cabin on the isolated Scottish isle of Jura. The chill of the Hebrides wind competed with the smoky warmth of burning peat in the fireplace. Orwell scrawled out his final and most famous work, Ninety Eighty-Four: A Novel, usually published today as 1984. Right-wing libertarians have sometimes seized on the book as a critique of activist government, or in their rhetoric “the nanny state.” In fact, Orwell himself held to what we would label democratic socialism and admired communist thinker Leon Trotsky. Killed by a Stalinist assassin in Mexico in 1940, Trotsky appeared as a revolutionary betrayed by authoritarians in both Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell joined a Trotskyite brigade during the Spanish Civil War as part of the effort to defeat Francisco Franco’s fascist legions. Orwell died in 1950, tubercular and beset with pneumonia and strep he apparently contracted on an ill-considered boat trip in the frigid waters of the Inner Hebrides. His predications of a despotic future served as a critique of Stalinism in his own time even as they effectively predicted the power of surveillance and lack of privacy of our contemporary moment. He also accurately predicted every superpower’s need for an enemy. Certainly between 1941 and 1975, the idea first presented in 1984 that we “had always been at war with Eastasia” seemed a quantum expression of American foreign policy and public opinion. The names and geographic locations of the cultures their government obliged them to hate proved confusing to many Americans. But that was more than acceptable to foreign policy elites. In part, as horror films revealed when they showed Americans a peculiar mash-up of places decidedly NOT-AMERICA, confusion was the point. Fear and hatred of the Japanese during World War II became hatred and fear of China. The baffling nature of the Korean War for most Americans, the reality that American soldiers and other U.N. forces actively engaged both North Korean and Chinese forces, helped shape a sense that we “had always been at war with Eastasia,” although, just like the slogan in 1984, this represented a revision of history, a willful forgetting, and a racist set of assumptions that allowed white America to see Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam as some version of Fu Manchu’s “Asiatic hordes.” The Soviet Union could be bundled into the eastern monstrosity, with serious foreign policy analysts, writers, and artists describing Russia as attracted by Bolshevism because of its history of “oriental despotism.”17 At home, as the story of Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” showed, hatred of Japan could easily be replaced by hatred of China. The opposite had been effected during the Second World War when an outbreak of assaults on Asian people after Pearl Harbor had become indiscriminate. Just before Christmas in 1941, Life magazine ran a piece entitled “How to Tell Japs from Chinese.” The piece in America’s most popular magazine essentially told readers that if they wished to assault someone, make sure to look for the alleged telltale signs of the Japanese “massively boned head” as opposed to the “delicately boned” features of the Chinese. The Chinese, meanwhile, wore “the rational calm of tolerant realists” while the Japanese face is “humorless” and “ruthless.”18 The roving imperial eye saw a jungle everywhere, from West Africa to the Middle East, from the Pacific and Asian countries to all of South America. By the 1960s, Americans focused these attitudes on the ancient society of Vietnam. Readers should know that Vietnam (explored later in this book because of its immense importance) became a horror landscape of American nightmares about its ability to assert its global hegemony. Left-leaning guerillas, many of them fighting for their national independence since the Japanese seized the country, drove out their former colonial masters, the French, after the decisive 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu. The Truman administration footed the bill for the French struggle, paying up to two-thirds of their costs in Southeast Asia between 1950 and 1952.19 Following Eisenhower’s inauguration in 1953, his administration continued support for the French and, under the banner of anti-communism, eventually took over for France as colonial overlord. The 1954 Geneva Accords allowed for a French withdrawal, a supposedly temporary division of Vietnam into North and South, and an election in two years that would unite the country. The United States prevented the election from happening, certain that the socialist hero of the wars against Japan and France, Ho Chi Minh, would emerge victorious. Political rhetoric at home sought to hide these facts. Most Americans believed by the early 1960s that North Vietnam, a “foreign communist power,” invaded South Vietnam, and the United States, wisely or not, intervened against an aggressor nation. In fact, Americans, who largely supported some level of intervention, had really no idea that they had become embroiled in a civil war. Even fewer knew their leaders sided with a corrupt, inept, and brutal regime, a zombie republic ensorcelled from nothing by the United States, which never managed to convince the South Vietnamese of its legitimacy. Ngo Dinh Diem ruled South Vietnam with the support of important American business and military leaders. Diem’s regime, however, helped the communist cause in the South thrive through the draconian actions of his secret police and attempts to uproot native Vietnamese Buddhism. It’s a sign of the clueless authoritarianism of Diem and his numerous replacements that, as much as some South Vietnamese feared the communists, they could never see their own government as a real alternative. John F. Kennedy, still for many Americans the iconic president, received a pass on the escalation of the conflict in popular memory. The facts are not on the side of his admirers. Most any textbook will tell you that the first Marine combat brigades appeared in Vietnam in 1965. Technically, this is true. But by the time of his assassination in 1963, Kennedy deployed close to seventeen thousand troops in Vietnam officially classified as “advisors.” Indeed, one of the few times the highly conservative comedian Bob Hope, by the sixties out of fashion with the young, managed a chuckle out of American GIs when he acknowledged this reality. When Hope performed his first Vietnamese Christmas Show in 1964, he started his set for the thousands assembled by gleefully hailing them with “Hello, advisors!”20 The Geneva Accords limited “advisors and observers” to under seven hundred. The United States ignored this limit just as it ignored the provision for a national election to settle the conflict. Kennedy insisted that Americans did not engage in combat even as it became clear that American pilots oversaw and took part in napalm raids. Dow Chemical developed an improved version of the vicious, inflammable jelly since the “terror bombings” of World War II, hotter and longer burning. Life magazine ran a story in January of 1963 about an American aircraft allegedly piloted by Vietnamese airmen trained by American observers. Historian of the Vietnam War Christian G. Appy writes, “the caption was written by editors still willing to parrot the official fiction.”21 The use of deadly bioweapons and the secret war being waged against North Vietnam continued the trajectory of American foreign policy that began with the seizure of the Philippines. The kind of conflict the Vietnam War became, the willingness of a small group of political elites to sacrifice human life in the hundreds of thousands, clearly appears in the earliest days of American involvement. By 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson had deployed over five hundred thousand U.S. troops to Vietnam. Moreover, the belief that the United States could win the war through pure attrition, slaughtering so many Vietnamese that the conflict would simply end when the country became a desolation, took the military command structure down the darkest of paths. The military hierarchy, from lieutenants all the way up to commanding general William Westmoreland, demanded the production of “body count” to such a degree that platoons sometimes competed in their accumulation of corpses.22 The death toll among the Vietnamese people, of all political shades, went exponential. After 1968’s Tet Offensive rocked the United States back on its heels, the American military responded with devastating violence. As the war dragged on, artillery strikes, B-52 bombing runs, shells hurled from battleships offshore, and incessant machine-gun fire on the ground and from Huey and Chinook helicopters above expended more firepower than used by all sides in the Second World War. By 1970, U.S. forces used 128,400 tons of munitions a month. The sheer amount of firepower, including chemical weapons and the poisonous defoliant Agent Orange, vaporized entire villages. A conservative New York Times estimate of Vietnamese causalities, dependent on U.S. military and South Vietnamese army sources alone, concluded that North Vietnam and “Viet Cong” suffered close to one million deaths with no tally for the wounded or any real separation between “civilians” and “Viet Cong.” A reported 20,587 South Vietnamese believed to have been sympathizers died at the hands of their own government, aided by the CIA. Indeed, these numbers are vastly underinflated given that official CIA totals for their Operation Phoenix program claimed to have killed more than 20,000 “VC.”23 Significant attention has been paid to the atrocity of the 1968 My Lai massacre, the work of that legion of Charlies, Charlie Company of the Eleventh Brigade. Such incidents, often excused by the military brass as the acts of “a few bad apples,” are representative of the decimation of the country systematically ordered by the Pentagon and carried out with weaponry that went far beyond what a single platoon could accomplish. Journalist and historian Nick Turse closely examined the record of American atrocities in Vietnam using primarily veteran accounts and archived war crimes investigations by the U.S. Army. He found that, for example, the 1968 Operation Speedy Express campaign in the Mekong Delta unleashed F-4 Phantoms dropping a massive tonnage of napalm on civilian hamlets, swift boats machine-gunning anyone who ran from U.S. forces among the rice paddies, B-52s raining down unimaginable carnage, and SEAL teams joining regular infantry in what had become a 350-kilometer-wide free-fire zone.24 As charred corpses covered South Asia, the year 1968 introduced the world to a new kind of fictional terror, a kind of horror that belonged very much to the times. George A. Romero turned twenty-eight that year. Since his graduation from college in 1960, his dreams of becoming a filmmaker were limited to work on commercials and filming a segment of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood that assured children that having their tonsils taken out really wasn’t so bad. As the war escalated, Romero made an independent film that rattled the nation in ways it didn’t quite understand. Americans just knew it scared them in ways vampires, flying saucers, and giant bugs couldn’t manage. What if America became a zombie republic? Romero’s Night of the Living Dead became a surprise hit at small theaters and drive-ins all over the country. Although in no sense a political allegory, nerves already raw sizzled with the film’s allusions to a country facing an Armageddon, violent dissension, and a world in which the Black hero died in the end at the hands of a white police force providing tactical support for a white lynch mob. Romero’s zombies are rotting embodiments of the war at home. Unlike the overwhelming majority of gothic horror films since the 1930s, the monsters are not in a far-off land, an imagined Europe, or a collage of the non-white world. Romero doesn’t separate the horror of the undead from a group of survivors who hate one another as much as the monsters who want to make them into a meal. “They’re all kinda insane,” Romero said of the group. Their isolation from one another in the midst of the apocalypse is, he said, “the most frightening thing” about the horror masterpiece.25 Romero’s creatures are masterless ronin of death. They don’t embody, as in White Zombie and its imitators, white America’s fear and anxiety over its colonial projects abroad. No sorcerer wielding the power of voodoo has called them forth. They are not a monstrous metaphor for colonization and the unfree labor that accompanies it. But they are still very much monsters of empire. In Romero’s world, the American government created them. A space probe brought back “radiation” from Venus that caused the dead to rise. Moreover, in one brilliant scene, Romero rewrites the script of most of the science fiction horror of the 1950s and ’60s. Rather than banding together against the threat, scientists and generals argue with one another in front of the media about what Americans should know and what they should be lied to about. We get the sneaking suspicion that the military-academic-industrial complex made it possible for our fellow Americans to eat us for dinner. Like the survivors in the farmhouse, “they’re all kinda insane.” Romero chose Duane Jones, a young African American actor, to portray the lead role of Ben. Although the director always insisted he did not select Jones based on his race, this in no way suggests Romero failed to understand the implication of his selection. He worked on his small-budget masterpiece on location in western Pennsylvania during a year in which the freedom struggle entered a critical new phase in the fight against white supremacy. Night was released a few months after an assassin with a highly suspicious background took the life of Martin Luther King Jr. Romero likely refused to comment on Jones’s race because he never wanted to suggest he’d selected the extraordinary actor simply because of his skin color. It’s the no-nonsense, won’t-take-any-shit, fire-raging-in-the-belly attitude that Jones brought to the role that matters. He represents the embodiment of the angry Black man, a construct worried over by white editorialists, the monstrous archetype that white politicians later invented terms for like superpredator and thug to inspire fear and new voting patterns among suburban whites.26 Romero surrounds Ben with white America under siege. An aging 1950s couple trades vicious barbs with one another as the husband tries to play patriarch to the household. But his time has passed. Barbra, a young white woman, is comatose. A rural Ken and Barbie doll couple are directionless. A decayed and cannibalized body lies at the top of the stairs before Ben removes it, a fleshless skull with empty voids for eyes urgently invoking the photographs and film footage of the corpses of Vietnam. They sit in the abandoned farmhouse. It’s the dead West, the Spahn ranch, the Texas cannibals’ homestead, the last house on the left. It’s the haunted castle of American frontier expansion gone to seed. The besieged microcosm of America hears conflicting reports from scientists and military leaders. Unlike in many of the sci-fi horror films of the time, the military will not come to save us. The scientists working for the Pentagon and a proliferation of national security agencies cannot be trusted and may have even been the cause of the outbreak. The bleak ending leaves us with a corpse, part of the mound of corpses produced by American racism, police power ensuring white interests had the protection of a well-armed lynch mob, the violence of the state outsourced to a backwoods paramilitary. This mistrust of the Pentagon, deeply intertwined with the protest culture of the anti-war movement, reversed the somnolent message of so much of fifties and early sixties horror culture. Kyle William Bishop, author of American Zombie Gothic, writes that Romero viewed films like Invisible Invaders (1959) and The Earth Dies Screaming (1964) in which aliens bent on conquest reanimate the dead. He also loved more literate sci-fi epics like Howard Hawks’s 1951 The Thing from Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still. In these films, Bishop writes, “the soldier’s first reaction upon encountering life from another planet is to shoot first and ask questions later.” In this new zombie tale for a new generation, Romero ruthlessly critiqued this blinkered use of violence, a theme he returned to throughout his film career.27 In 1968, Romero saw the beginning of the reign of the dead. In the years ahead, his new kind of zombie would become America’s most popular monster and one that he, along with others, would consistently use to critique American values. The United States continued to busily create zombie republics abroad. But in the American collective imagination, the dead began to return to the homestead, indomitable and hungry. 6.The Null Zone IN THE June 1968 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, two competing ads appeared side by side. They revealed two alternative ideas about American imperial power among the most influential science fiction writers of the second half of the twentieth century. One read, “We the undersigned believe the United States must remain in Vietnam to fulfill its responsibilities to the people of that country.” On the facing page, readers saw a slightly longer list of names under the words “We oppose the participation of the United States in the war in Vietnam.” The same issue included the announcement of a contest entitled “What would you do about the Vietnam War?” The best five answers would receive a one-hundred-dollar cash prize. Throughout the 1960s, Galaxy was known for publishing a wide array of science fiction tales, including Ray Bradbury’s short story “The Fireman,” which became the basis for Fahrenheit 451. In contrast to earlier science fiction magazines, editors H. L. Gold and Frederik Pohl sought to propel their work beyond its reputation as the space-adventure-for-boys genre. Galaxy hoped publishing tales with social commentary or that made use of parody and satire would help solidify SF as a serious literary phenomenon. Kate Wilhelm and Judith Merril circulated the first call for a petition against the escalating war. Wilhelm became a multiple Nebula winner, one of the highest honors for speculative fiction, for her stories of postapocalyptic American landscapes. Merril, one of the most politically sophisticated of the somewhat directionless Futurians, joined the Trotskyite movement after realizing the brutal, and in many respects anti-socialist, direction Stalin took the Soviet Union in the thirties. By the 1960s, she actively engaged in anti-war activities while churning out a host of tales centered on nuclear nightmare scenarios. Both women expected a near-universal condemnation of the American war in Asia from their fellow writers. Perhaps they should not have been surprised by Robert A. Heinlein’s response. Heinlein’s position regarding race, the utter supremacy of the U.S. military, and even enthusiasm for atomic weapons almost guaranteed his adamant refusal to sign. In fact, Heinlein wrote a novel, Glory Road, in 1963 that presaged the later popularity of military techno-thrillers like those of Tom Clancy. In it, an embittered Korean War veteran goes to Vietnam to fight communists, lamenting that in Korea “we weren’t allowed to win” and excoriating American society for its “weakness” in not using nuclear weapons. In an obvious allusion to his Starship Troopers fantasy of space marines waging a fascist war against monstrous bugs, Glory Road compares the “natives” of Vietnam with “insects.” Another signer of the pro-war proclamation, Joe Poyer, authored a nonfiction piece for archconservative John W. Campbell’s Analog Science Fiction and Fact suggesting that capitalism and democracy would triumph over insurgent wars of liberation in the developing world by using futuristic weaponry. In one of Poyer’s short stories, a Green Beret tricked out with war tech like some combination of the Predator and Iron Man hunts and kills his human targets mercilessly, a new incarnation of Heinlein’s Starship Troopers brutally extirpating the enemy in South Asia instead of outer space. In the same tale, the U.S. military deploys droplets of “deadly radioactive waste” to create what Poyer called “the null zone.” Commenting on the signers behind the pro-war ad, historian H. Bruce Franklin notes that it “reads like a roll call of champions of super science and supermen, of manly and military virtue . . .” Jerry Pournelle offers the best example of a writer soon to play a walk-on roll in the monster doc of the American empire. A protégé of Heinlein’s, he built an entire career around the notion of American supremacy using sci-fi-inspired weaponry to destroy monsters, particularly those he saw embodied in nations and peoples resistant to American power.28 Pournelle served in the Korean War where he, paradoxically, joined the Communist Party. He later called this “misplaced idealism” and made a whiplash-inducing swing to the other end of the political spectrum. He became an advocate of an America First position while pushing Heinlein’s monster-slaying fantasies and racist nightmares to their logical conclusion. Pournelle worked for a few years in the aerospace industry, where his interest in the killing power of science flourished. In the late 1950s, as an employee of Boeing, he imagined the design of a new high-tech killing machine he called “Project Thor,” which could rain tungsten steel rods from space platforms with the destructive force of nuclear weapons, minus the radioactive fallout. While producing more and more science fiction, he continued to work with high-tech weaponry, specifically new designs for the next-gen ballistic missiles of the 1970s. Like Wernher von Braun and Heinlein himself, Pournelle became a key component in the American right’s fascination with space exploration and its possibilities for raining destruction from orbit on America’s enemies.29 Later in life, Pournelle found it charming to describe his politics as “somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan.” His extremist worldview and interest in space exploration, high-tech weapons, and science fiction frequently gelled. His tales bristled with space marines and futuristic versions of America’s “technowar.” The line between slaughtering monstrous humanoids in space and the American imperial adventure dissolved in his coauthorship of the textbook The Strategy of Technology. Used in courses at West Point, the volume declared that “3 megatons of small nuclear bombs” would be enough to win the Vietnam War.30 Pournelle and Heinlein continued to believe the Vietnam War could be won by turning soldiers and marines into starship troopers and using futuristic weapons of annihilation. The development of the neutron bomb became important to both writers, a weapon often described in the popular press, using tones of fear or wonder, as “a death ray.” The low-yield weapon explodes radiation into the air, killing people while doing minimal damage to physical structures or vehicles. Deployed as tactical weapons on the battlefield, they would have a devastating effect, neutrons eating human tissue like vermin swarming in a dumpster. Pournelle, in a later incarnation as a military strategist and advisor in the Reagan administration, played a role in the effort to deploy such weapons in Europe in the 1980s. Americans should have been appalled that genre writers of sci-fi fiction horror fantasies helped create the Pershing II missile crisis, an extraordinarily dangerous Cold War moment when the placement of these medium-range nuclear devices and aggressive U.S. “war games” in Europe convinced the Soviets that Reagan planned a preemptive strike. But, given the secrecy long surrounding American foreign policy, the public had no clue how close they came to the “null zone.” Pournelle remerged in the twenty-first century as an advocate for the Ballistic Missile Defense System fantasies of the second Bush administration. As late as 2010, he praised the neutron bomb for its ability to keep the “Red hordes” at bay.31 The willingness to see the war in Southeast Asia as a testing ground for the most hideous weapons of empire explains the massive number of civilian casualties in that long war. The counterculture became inexplicably enraptured with Heinlein’s solipsistic fantasy Stranger in a Strange Land, while he and his protégés wondered why the United States didn’t simply eliminate “the bugs” that resisted the American invasion. Perhaps Charles Manson had really understood Heinlein’s message of “disincorporating” one’s enemies. Kill the bugs, kill the piggies, do something witchy. Several generations of sci-fi warriors who lived their fantasies of killing monsters in print must have been pleased that so many of America’s leaders shared their views, into and beyond the Vietnam War. In fact, one administration after another indulged in the right wing of science fiction’s militarist fantasies when encountering threats to the extension of American power. If we had atomic weapons, why not use them again? Truman pondered their lethal application in Korea. Then, in 1954, Eisenhower considered their use against North Vietnam. Even before Vietnam became unwinnable, the Pentagon Papers revealed the National Security Council placed nuclear weapons on the table. In 1968, William Westmoreland, head of all military operations in Southeast Asia, recommended nuking much of East Asia as the fighting, and public opinion at home, began to turn against the war effort. In fact, even after the war ended, Westmoreland lamented that politicians refused to employ “small tactical nuclear weapons” in order to “tell Hanoi something.”32 The Vietnam War, an issue in American life for nearly a decade, threw its murderous shadow over the history of American horror. Many of the phantasmagoric forms that have haunted the country for the last fifty years came to unnatural life in the jungles of Vietnam. Generals and politicians, the real ones and the Archie Bunkers in their armchairs at home, engaged in an orgy of mythic thinking about the war empire lost. For some, these legends took the form of very literal monsters. 7.Empire’s Missing Links IN THE summer of 1966, marines of First Force Recon Company set out to build a helicopter landing pad in South Vietnam’s Quang Tri Province, one of the most contested regions of the war. Part of a larger effort dubbed Operation Prairie, First Recon began a “reconnaissance in force” to patrol for NLF soldiers (National Liberation Front, better known in American parlance as the Viet Cong or VC). While working on the landing zone near a hill they called “the Rock Pile,” the official report notes that the platoon encountered “some playful rock apes” that “engaged in some rock tossing contests with the Marines.” Supposedly this high-spirited encounter continued until a surprise attack by the NLF halted work on the helipad and resulted in a deadly firefight.33 “Rock apes” could be so casually mentioned in an after-action report because the existence of such creatures had become part of the everyday chatter among troops in Vietnam. Most soldiers in Vietnam probably knew they were part of the native fauna, either gibbons or a red-shanked monkey called the douc (some reports of rock apes insist they had red hair). Gibbons in particular chilled numerous American marines and soldiers with their unearthly screams, banshees in the jungle night. In remembering strange experiences of the war, sometimes a decade or two later, some veterans found that the rock apes took on a much more monstrous form. Marine Anthony Goodrich recalled “it was so damn dark in the jungle” that “rock apes” had an easy time moving around and terrifying patrols. Goodrich even awoke one night thinking a fellow marine had shaken him out of sleep to take his watch, to find a rock ape “about three feet high” sitting on his chest. His screaming woke his entire platoon, who later ribbed him about the incident. Goodrich told an interviewer he had heard about these creatures since his arrival in Vietnam but at first believed they were, in his words, “old wives’ tales.” He then claims he learned that they were “brought south” by the North Vietnamese, essentially becoming weaponized monsters for the communist cause.34 The supernatural “jungle people” appeared suddenly, using tactics not dissimilar from the ambuscades of NLF fighters. The commonalities seemed so obvious to American troops that many rock ape anecdotes told during the war concerned soldiers certain they had been set upon by VC only to express relief upon finding a terrifying cryptid. These stories often took on an even more sinister turn with the tales of ma, or phantoms, that inhabited the dense jungle, precisely the regions that the NLF found most effective for launching surprise attacks on American platoon patrols and makeshift bases. Nearly a half century since the end of the Vietnam War, such stories have proliferated. Many of the stories are connected to the beliefs of the Hmong, a discreet ethnic group in Laos and along the Cambodian border with no loyalty to either the South Vietnamese government or the promises of communism. The CIA saw them as the perfect instrument for counterinsurgency operations. Supposedly, the Hmong passed the tale of jungle phantoms or jungle people on to American CIA agents, special forces, and mercenaries. In more recent retellings, “locals” told marines about the “reanimated corpses” who lived in the jungles. Military.com, a site dedicated to news of interest to veterans and a clearinghouse for information on VA benefits, ran a spring 2019 story about Vietnam’s “ghouls of the jungle,” which insists that American troops “began reporting ghostly figures moving supernaturally through the trees.” Meanwhile, it claims, “others reported fanged creatures with black eyes.” Bizarrely, the article ends by claiming the walking dead could move about in the day because “the triple canopy jungle” kept the sun out and is “the real reason the military developed Agent Orange and napalm.”35 Stories of phantoms in the jungle, like the encounters with cryptid rock apes, may have been a function of memory and amnesia, the delicate process of forgetfulness that plays an integral role in the trauma of war. An adult male gibbon moving through the high trees at night would certainly seem a monstrous phantom to nervous, watchful soldiers. Getting spooked by a monkey would be cause for laughter and relief if the other option involved a grenade tossed out of the steaming darkness or the explosive rattle of an AK-47. Platoon jokes quickly became legend in the retelling. Certainly, there’s no evidence of the existence of rock apes. The memory of them as communist-controlled monsters owes more to the mad scientist/malignant magician films of the Vietnam veteran’s childhood than reality. The real missing link here may be how modern memory of the rock ape connects to the catastrophic use of chemical warfare. By the end of the Vietnam War the United States had dropped more than four hundred thousand pounds of napalm on the Vietnamese people. This represented four times the amount used against Japan in the “terror bombings” that Curtis LeMay admitted had been so egregious that “if we’d lost the war, we’d all have been prosecuted as war criminals.” This fact helps explain why a respected veterans’ site might venture the claim that the use of chemical defoliants, defoliants of plants and humans, may have cleared the jungle of monsters.36 These fanciful creatures provided a way to talk, perhaps half-seriously at times, about the mad science practiced in Vietnam. Telling a story about fanged ghouls with black eyes doesn’t unsettle as much as a viciously burning jelly dropped on civilians and combatants, leaving them forever scarred. A mythic creature hiding in the dark seems charming in comparison to the dumping of tons of a defoliant that had long-range consequences for American soldiers as well as the people and ecosystem of Vietnam. But monsters contain multitudes and seldom have a univocal meaning. Stories of a creature intertwined with America’s guilt and shame over Vietnam, and the near impossibility of negotiating the meaning of the conflict, helped make a monster. These cryptid legends from the battlefield prepared the way for the belief, still making the rounds among cryptid enthusiasts in the 2020s, that the monsters of Vietnam, as in Konga, made their way back to the homeland of the empire. Ken Gerhard, a self-described cryptozoologist who has had an enormously successful career talking about everything from Bigfoot to werewolves on numerous basic cable networks, believes that at least one of the rock apes of Vietnam came home to America. He was, Gerhard claims, shipped home by a former air force pilot in 1965 “using a body bag.” Gerhard appeared in the 2019 Travel Channel series In Search of Monsters, which asked, “Is it possible that one of the monsters of Vietnam made it to North America?” Gerhard makes his claim based on the bizarre tale of the Minnesota Iceman, a complicated fable of an air force veteran, a sideshow act, the CIA’s connection to the heroin trade, and even the Smithsonian Institution. It’s a tale that reveals much about the interrelationship of horror and empire, how a monster story acts as a cover story for some of the stranger covert ops of the Cold War. 8.The Creature in a Grave of Ice!! THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN (1957) featured Peter Cushing as a cryptid hunter at the roof of the world. Cushing soon earned much more fame for his roles as Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein in Hammer studio’s now classic reboots. But this film, released in the United States as The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, transmogrified over the years into a cult classic, portions of it even influencing the cult indie film The Blair Witch Project (1999). The film drew on contemporary fascination with both Bigfoot and the Yeti. It also drilled into a vein of geopolitical weirdness that intertwined monster tales, espionage, and American imperial adventurism. Retired air force veteran Frank D. Hansen unwittingly helped foment this strange corner of the historical meaning of Vietnam. In 1967 he began exhibiting an ape-like creature encased in ice at carnivals, shopping centers, and supermarket parking lots. Hansen previously made extra cash on the county fair circuit showing off antique tractors, including “the world’s oldest John Deere,” which proved especially popular among Midwestern farm equipment enthusiasts. But nothing he ever exhibited became as popular as the thing soon christened the Minnesota Iceman. Hansen’s scam might have remained just a popular regional sideshow attraction. Unfortunately for him, he attracted the attention of two fringe zoologists, Bernard Heuvelmans and Ivan T. Sanderson. Heuvelmans, known for a combination of encyclopedic research and jaw-dropping leaps in logic, may have coined the term cryptozoology. His lifelong love of Jules Verne and the 1925 classic film The Lost World made him playfully open to all manner of wondrous, and highly dubious, claims. In 1948, he encountered a decidedly unscientific article by Sanderson in the Saturday Evening Post entitled “There Could Be Dinosaurs.” He soon wrote On the Track of Unknown Animals, which, in a stroke of luck, appeared about two years before the first supposed sightings of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. Sanderson himself had been a popular nature writer who found a much larger audience for “unexplained phenomenon” in the wake of the ’47 summer of the flying saucers. His alliance with Heuvelmans emerged when their mutual admiration society found funding from the exquisitely named Texas oilman Tom Slick. Slick, who had already footed the bill for several expeditions searching for the Abominable Snowman in the Himalayas, freely dispensed cash to the Sanderson-Heuvelmans research team until his death in 1962.37 The pair, no longer having the financing of the Texas oil industry to go Yeti-hunting in Nepal, looked for mystery closer to home. Hansen seems to have believed, at first, that the cryptid hunters’ interest in his iceman could increase the popularity of his creature already touring much of the Midwest and occasionally as far south as Louisiana. He did insist that Sanderson and Heuvelmans neither open the glass case nor shatter the ice that held his creature. Obviously, this failed to offer anything like the conditions required for empirical research. Nevertheless, both men wrote extensive papers on their limited observations that provided pages of information on the “morphology” of the form they could barely see beneath Hansen’s sideshow trappings. Sanderson and Heuvelmans bought into the idea that the specimen represented a lost human ancestor that continued to live in the remote regions of the world. Sanderson’s writing on the subject would appear, not in scientific journals, but rather in science fiction and “men’s magazines” such as Argosy, for which Sanderson served as “science editor.” Heuvelmans published a book that claimed Hansen had an example of a Neanderthal man, living contemporaneously with humans. And that it had come to America from Vietnam. The origins of the Minnesota Iceman provoked so much speculation because Hansen himself told three different and utterly conflicting stories about how he came into possession of the specimen. In the most elaborate narrative, a Japanese whaling ship discovered the creature blocked in ice and floating in the frigid waters off Kamchatka. Somehow “Red China” ended up with the specimen and, just as mysteriously, the creature found its way to Hansen through “a Chinese gentleman of British nationality” in Hong Kong. In this iteration of the tale, Hansen had pulled off some Cold War cryptid espionage and managed to wrest the monsters from “the reds.” This seems to have been the story he told of the creature’s origins at the 1967 Minnesota State Fair. Hansen presented the alleged creature to patrons in its “grave of ice” according to the August 10 Ironwood Daily Globe. Other attractions on offer included “Big Willie, the world’s largest alligator” and an invitation to “Take the Trip the Hippies Take,” a drug-free psychedelic light show that offered anodyne thrills to the squares. Sometimes Hansen suggested he had possession of the creature after its purchase by a “Hollywood millionaire.” This second version of the story simply suggested that an unnamed benefactor who collected oddities owned the icebound monster but, for reasons never explained, allowed Hansen to tour the county fairs with a missing link in human evolution. The unlikely tale spread that this mysterious Hollywood patron was none other than James Stewart, a rumor that Hansen encouraged. Stewart had been a combat pilot, like Hanson, though during World War II. But there may have been a much better reason why the star of It’s a Wonderful Life and some of Hitchcock’s most chilling thrillers found his way into the tale of the Minnesota Iceman. A decade earlier, Stewart played a decidedly weird role in the story of the Pangboche hand. A cryptid hunter named Peter Byrne, financed by Tom Slick, had discovered an alleged “hand of the Yeti” at a Buddhist monastery in Pangboche, Nepal, in 1957. Formerly isolated, the monastery attracted paying tourists for its supposed Yeti relics in the fifties, particularly after Edmund Hillary’s successful ascent of nearby Mount Everest in 1953. Finding the monks unwilling to part with the attraction, Byrne returned in 1959 and, after getting the monk standing watch thoroughly plastered, stole one finger from the object. He then replaced it with a human finger that he handily (sorry) brought along. There’s obvious speculation about where he found a detached human digit. In all likelihood, he snapped it off one of the hundred or so frozen corpses of dead climbers that have proliferated on the Himalayas since the early twentieth century, bodies fellow climbers have been unable to bury or remove because of weather conditions and logistics. Given that customs agents tend to frown on the export of human remains in a carry-on bag, Slick contacted Stewart, vacationing with his wife, Gloria, in Calcutta. Stewart long held a fascination with natural history and readily agreed to help. Gloria stuffed the finger in her lingerie bag and, as Slick expected, no one rummaged through the celebrity’s luggage. Told and retold, the true story of Stewart’s adventure in extractive tourism only helped the prospects of Hansen’s sideshow.38 As the Minnesota Iceman gained more attention, Hansen came to prefer a story that he perhaps saw as unfalsifiable. He attempted to make canonical the tale that he himself shot the creature while hunting in Minnesota and encased it in a block of ice and a glass canister to preserve it. Heuvelmans wanted a more interesting and perhaps timelier story, and so he looked to Southeast Asia. 9.Drugs, Cryptids, and Covert Ops THE MINNESOTA Iceman becoming entangled in the story of the CIA’s secret war in Laos may seem a bizarre coincidence. But, in fact, cryptid hunting and covert ops often had an intertwined history. Author Colin Dickey discovered that a surprising number of Yeti hunters in the fifties and sixties had some link to various intelligence agencies, so much so that he writes, “the hunt for the Yeti was inescapably tied to Cold War politics.” The Soviet Union thought the same. The state-run newspaper Izvestia claimed that the hunt for the snowmen masked an effort at “the subversion of Communist China.” The New York Times reporter who wrote about this could barely contain their sarcasm about the Kremlin’s apparent nervousness over Tom Slick’s interest in the “abominable snowman.”39 But the Soviets had been right. In 1965, mountaineers connected to U.S. intelligence attempted to set up a sensor on a Himalayan peak, without the knowledge of the Nepalese government, that allowed surveillance of Chinese atomic capabilities. The Kremlin likely suspected a less paranormal reason for the expeditions since the CIA used a hunt for Noah’s Ark along the Turkish-Soviet border to gather photographic intelligence as early as 1949.40 Heuvelmans needed a story better than Yeti fingers hidden in Gloria Stewart’s underwear. His book Neanderthal: The Strange Saga of the Minnesota Iceman, first published in 1974, provided the background for Ken Gerhard’s claim that “body bags” had been used to bring a monster from Vietnam. While admitting that his narrative was in part “based on conjecture,” this rather enormous caveat did not prevent Heuvelmans from strongly affirming that Hansen located the “bizarre hairy man” in Southeast Asia. In this telling, Hansen probably had no idea of the scientific discovery he made but saw financial profit in the specimen. So he arranged for the thing encased in ice to return to the States in a body bag. “What better place to hide a corpse,” Heuvelmans has Hansen reason, “than in a container normally used to carry corpses?”41 In hopes of buttressing this claim, Heuvelmans told a story that readers might find as bizarre as that of the iceman. He insisted that nearly anything could make its way from the major airport of Da Nang to California. How? He explained a large drug-trafficking operation the CIA and the U.S. military carried out to fund pro-American insurgencies in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This of course sounds a bit like a theory in need of a tinfoil hat for its parturition. Unfortunately, the story of the drug trafficking by the United States during the Vietnam war is true.42 In 1971, The Washington Post reported that the CIA had long denied any knowledge of drug trafficking in Vietnam and neighboring regions. However, the article showed the CIA armed and trained tribal groups like the Hmong who grew opium, necessary to produce heroin. The agency also made convenient deals with leaders of the Hmong. One of these warlords, General Vang Pao, convinced the CIA to build an airstrip that allowed the transport of refined heroin. By 1972, 70 percent of the world’s opium came from the region on the Thai, Myanmar, and Laotian border where the Hmong and the CIA worked together against the red menace.43 There’s little evidence that Air America, the name for the CIA’s airlift projects in South Asia, directly facilitated large-scale shipments of heroin to the United States. Nor did CIA agents directly engage in the distribution and sale of the drug, or at least no reliable evidence has appeared to prove such a thing. But the fact that the CIA facilitated the trade remains indisputable. Although often considered a false conspiracy theory of the left, even the CIA’s official examination of the issue admitted that while there was an “unequivocal” restriction on large packages of opium, it remained possible that smaller amounts had been shipped by CIA contractors. The agency preferred to allow assets like General Pao to move drugs in complicated schemes for the funding of counterinsurgency groups, a pattern that would become increasingly common, and insidious, in the coming decades, showing up in the Rube Goldberg machine Oliver North built to fund the Contras in the 1980s. Heuvelmans discusses the close involvement of the CIA and the heroin trade only because of his interest in how an alleged monster made its way to America. He makes it clear that he could not care less about how the American empire used heroin as a leveraging tool with local clients in its expansive South Asian war. What he calls the “scientific Watergate” that led to a lack of interest in his Neanderthal man represented for him the real scandal. After the kerfuffle raised by Sanderson and Heuvelmans over the iceman, Hansen became very nervous. Heuvelmans made the claim, even before the publication of his book, that Hansen illegally obtained a new link in human evolution that still survived in isolated parts of the globe. The claim interested a skeptical John R. Napier, a primatologist with the Smithsonian Institution, who sought to examine the specimen for himself. Hansen tired of the attention and probably knew his iceman would soon be revealed as a fraud. He allowed Napier to examine what he called “a latex model” of the iceman and said that he would no longer display the original for fear it would become damaged. The public lost interest and the Smithsonian concluded that the only version they had been allowed to see of the monster from Vietnam had been a work of special effects. The Minnesota Iceman dropped, for a time, out of public memory until a revival of interest in cryptids in the early twenty-first century.44 Hansen’s family sold the latex model on eBay in 2013. Hansen’s iceman, once connected to both the body bags of the war dead and shadowy covert operations throughout Southeast Asia, can be viewed today at the Museum of the Weird in Austin, Texas. However, a version of Heuvelmans’s strange saga of the connection between the rock apes of Vietnam and the Minnesota Iceman has appeared in every iteration of the story on basic cable’s popular cryptid-hunter shows into the 2020s. 10.They Own the Night A SIGNIFICANT part of the American memory of Vietnam concerns homecomings, or more precisely the homecoming gone sour. Numerous legends, which often became widely and deeply held beliefs, cluster around the warrior who fails to come home. It’s nearly impossible not to see such stories as grassroots metaphor manufacturing, stories that simplify or reimagine the complexities of a lost war. Monsters with their origin in Vietnam, predators in the Mekong delta’s rice fields, that made their way to America comported with how Americans saw the Vietnamese people. Increasingly, Americans told stories about the horror of Vietnam that ignored American culpability in the catastrophe and shifted the focus to unexplained creatures and ghost stories, a haunted ride on the midway of the country’s dark carnival. In 2018, a University of Notre Dame alumnus posted on the university’s class of 1969 blog about a strange night in 1967. Domer Costantini worked that summer for a construction company, “grueling” work that he describes as leaving him physically and mentally exhausted. On a hot July evening, he made his way from the work site to his parents’ home in the Bronx. Costantini regularly passed Gleason’s Funeral Home in the half-mile walk from the subway to his family’s apartment, and on this night, he saw an old high school friend he had not seen for two years, Gerald L. Fox, known to everyone in the neighborhood as Jerry. The “solitary figure” lingered in front of the mortuary and seemed to want to talk, but a weary Costantini begged off and offered a plan to meet up with his school chum another time. He arrived home to learn from his mother that Fox died in a firefight on July 12, 1967. The funeral would be held the following day at Gleason’s. Rational explanations for Costantini’s experience are probably obvious to the reader. He was tired, he saw a friend who reminded him of Jerry, and he probably did not learn of his death that night. But fifty years of misremembering corrupted the timeline, and his very real grief over Jerry’s death created a very genuine haunting. When Costantini attempted to recall the events half a century after they occurred, what came to his mind was his unwillingness to greet his friend, to welcome him home. He would write in 2018, “Who was I and what am I to have shunned an American hero?” Costantini became so invested in the tale that he and his wife traveled to Vietnam, and he wears a wristband that reads “PFC Gerald L. Fox / US 12 Jul 67.” Monster tales can become personal expressions of grief rooted in the many sorrows of empire.45 Point Pleasant, West Virginia, is a tiny Ohio Valley town near a major tributary of the Kanawha River with a population of less than five thousand people. Its Main Street stores shuttered early in the 1960s. At that time, its only claim to fame seems to have been an 1805 house-raising during which a falling log killed Mark Twain’s grandfather. No significant tourist industry seemed likely to germinate from this anecdote. Point Pleasant remained a sleepy hamlet even as residents worried over news of the escalating war in Vietnam, the growing strength of the anti-war movement, and the freedom struggle led by Black Americans demanding economic rights as well as the ballot. But these things appeared to many residents of the isolated town like news from another world. Soon enough, other worlds seemed to swirl around them. On November 16, 1966, the Pittsburgh Press reported that a couple driving near the town was chased “by a birdlike creature” with “red eyes.” On November 27, 1966, a teenager saw “a huge gray figure” that she estimated as being six to seven feet tall with “large, round, fiercely glowing red eyes that focused on her with hypnotic effect.” She watched in horror as “a pair of wings unfolded from its back.”46 UFO enthusiasts and cryptid hunters proved quick to see the Mothman sightings wrapped in our deadly embrace of the Vietnam War. At the time of the sightings, the Pentagon deployed more than two hundred thousand American troops in Vietnam, with former vice president and soon to become presidential candidate Richard Nixon calling for five hundred thousand. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara worried that although the enemy seemed to suffer casualties beyond counting, “there is no sign of a break in enemy morale . . . in the countryside the enemy almost completely controls the night.”47 Did something else control the night? John A. Keel certainly thought so, claiming in his enormously popular book The Mothman Prophecies that numerous UFO sightings had occurred in Southeast Asia in 1966 to 1967. He quoted PFC Earl Morrison, who claimed he and two buddies saw “what looked like wings, like a bat’s, only it was gigantic” near Da Nang. The figure gave off an unearthly greenish hue, though the soldiers claimed its nude body was obsidian. The creature then began flapping its wings and rose into the air. The whole experience, Morrison remembered, lasted “three or four minutes.” Private Morrison’s sighting may have been especially detailed but was frequently repeated in more general terms regarding UFOs, bright lights, and sometimes “enemy helicopters” that neither the North Vietnamese army or the NLF could have accessed. Pete Mazzola, a soldier who later founded a UFOlogy institute, claimed to see “bright objects” appear over rice fields when guerillas pinned down his patrol with heavy fire. Similar reports occurred until the end of the war. Why did soldiers need these stories? On one level, they are hazy incidents occurring in the fog of battle, interpreted according to the flying saucer films and creature features of the soldier’s childhood. A few cases may have been sightings of secretive missions by the CIA either into Laos and Cambodia or the agency’s shadowy Project Phoenix. The tortured memory and the political upheaval caused by defeat in the Vietnam War are more essential to the spread and interest in these stories than the easily explained sightings. The real conspiracies that the citizens of a democracy should speak out about, such as the CIA’s involvement in drug trafficking, become explanations for how a hairy beast could have been transported home from Vietnam. The black helicopters of conspiracy fantasy are reason to distrust the government but not the use of chemical weapons or the murder and maiming of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the most extensive bombing campaign in modern history. In the case of the Vietnam War, the language of monsters hides, rather than reveals, the real horrors of history. Horror films and racism continued as boon companions even as George A. Romero changed the politics of monsters. A new wave of Fu Manchu films became popular in Britain and the United States, helmed by Hammer horror star Christopher Lee as the dastardly mastermind. In precisely the years when the Vietnam War escalated, 1965 to 1969, Lee appeared in no less than five stories of the Asian crime lord in forgettable but popular flicks like The Vengeance of Fu Manchu and The Brides of Fu Manchu. The “Asiatic hordes” continued to batter down the doors of the Western world, if only in the fevered imagination of the American empire. 11.The Ghost of a Previous Nightmare THE UNITED States saw itself under siege even as it projected military and economic power around the globe. In February of 1962, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, formerly an executive with the Ford Motor Company, warned Americans not only that their government called on them to support an apocalyptic arms race, but also that they needed to support wars that are “often not wars at all.” This peculiar admonition, to support a thing that’s not really the thing you think it is, grew from the Kennedy administration’s concern about Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev’s verbal and often material support for “wars of liberation” in the former colonial, or in some cases newly colonized, world.48 When is a war not really a war? McNamara forcefully, if at the time mysteriously, stated his case by talking of a shadow realm in which “the force of world communism operates in the twilight zone between political subversion and quasi-military action.” Of course, the United States in its role as protector of world capitalism operated in this same murky dimension for much of the twentieth century, so murky that many Americans didn’t even know it. McNamara wanted to evoke his boss’s memorable inauguration speech of 1960 when he imagined the Cold War as a “long twilight struggle.” But the phrase the twilight zone had another meaning for many in 1962. Rod Serling had become a successful television writer by the time he invited Americans to ponder their fears, and their politics, in the twilight zone. But Serling was intensely frustrated. In an interview with the young, hard-charging reporter Mike Wallace, Serling complained about constantly having to “battle sponsors and agencies.” Thinking in part of the soporific the network had made of A Town Has Turned to Dust, he told Wallace he didn’t want “to compromise all the time, which in essence is what the television writer does if he wants to put on controversial themes.” Serling also once wrote a political drama for television titled Playhouse 90, but sponsors did not allow his senators to discuss politics, party affiliation, or any current issue. He later noted that “in retrospect, I probably would have had a much more adult play had I made it science fiction, put it in the year 2057, and peopled the Senate with robots.” In other words, if he’d “had a Martian say it.”49 Critics called Serling “television’s angry young man” even before his relentless pasquinades of American society. His daughter Jodi Serling remembers the anger but said it never came from “conceit,” calling her father “a gentle, kind man.” He had, she said, returned from the war “broken . . . He had to start a whole new life, and he used writing as a form of therapy.” His therapy became a conversation with American ideals revealing their true face, seen in his worry over America’s romance with the atom, the possibility that these weapons would not only destroy democracy but create an extinction event.50 Serling’s concerns went beyond the obvious issue of America’s world-ending weapons. Could democracy survive in a militarized state? What happened to freedom of speech and basic ideals of identity in a society that built its foreign policy around bases and bombs, client states and conquest? Could America be great or even good when it appeared the empire might swallow the nation? These anxieties run through every season of The Twilight Zone. The fascism Serling wanted to fight as a high school kid could happen here. Maybe it had already begun. In episodes like “The Obsolete Man,” Serling asked if any element of the First Amendment could survive in a militarized society. Although the episode is sometimes read as an indictment of Stalinism or totalitarianism more generally, Serling’s experiences with the soft censorship of capitalism made him particularly critical of any efforts to limit the spread of ideas in his country. The Twilight Zone did not completely escape the stealth campaign of American censorship. Ratings behemoths like Leave It to Beaver and Gunsmoke dominated the television landscape, while The Twilight Zone appeared Friday nights at 10:00 p.m., late-night TV in the early sixties. The odd hour and some of the themes prevented Serling’s masterpiece from even coming close to the top-rated shows in audience share. But, running for five seasons, Serling’s peculiar TV show created what we today call a cult following, and a very devoted cult at that. Fan clubs of the show, most of them made up of adolescents or college students, emerged around the country. Nevertheless, CBS executives consistently worried about the show’s content, its ratings, and its budget. Serling pressed on, sometimes creating alternate Americas that looked all too familiar. “The Obsolete Man” reads as so heavy-handed today that viewers, just like those in 1961, could easily identify the good guy versus the evil state. At times, Serling wrote or adapted tales for TV that showed the more subtle seductions of fascism. In “He’s Alive”—an homage to the horror tradition’s frequent use of Frankenstein’s moment of “It’s alive!”—Serling introduces us to what he calls “a bush-league Führer” played by Dennis Hopper. He cannot get his fellow Americans to listen to his bile until he’s visited by the the “ghost of a previous nightmare,” the shade of Hitler himself. In the closing monologue, Serling asks his audience to directly ponder the episode’s message. Remember . . . when he comes to your town. Remember it when you hear his voice speaking out through others. Remember it when you hear a name called, a minority attacked, any blind, unreasoning assault on a people or any human being. He’s alive because through these things we keep him alive. But could Serling’s viewers remember this wisdom in a country terrified of outside menace and willing to make a totem of their weapons of mass destruction? As Serling’s Twilight Zone completed its fifth and final season in 1964, the United States intervened and sometimes established a permanent occupation force in countries most Americans could not locate on a map. In January 1964, The Twilight Zone did not appear in CBS’s announcement of its fall schedule and Serling publicly expressed doubt that the show could survive. It did not. Efforts to re-create the show as Rod Serling’s Wax Museum came to nothing, largely because Serling would not do a show that failed to use science fiction and horror for the purpose of social criticism. He loudly complained that everyone from his agents to studio executives wanted him “stuck in a graveyard every week” to introduce a television version of “C-movies.” Serling didn’t need a television vehicle for social criticism. He found the Vietnam War deplorable and spoke out strongly against it in language that much of white, mainstream America found extreme. In December of 1968, Serling delivered a speech to students at Moorpark College in California. Even before he delivered his remarks, he stirred up controversy. The college’s conservative administration demanded that all official campus lecturers sign a loyalty oath to the United States. Serling took umbrage at this, saying that he had already taken an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic when he fought in the Second World War. His body still ached from the wounds he’d received for his country. He held to the conviction that repeated declarations of loyalty to the state cleared the way for fascism. Serling did not sign the oath but the students wanted to hear him anyway, so he gave an informal talk to hundreds of undergraduates without the college’s approval (and without a speaker’s fee). In it, he briefly excoriated the idea of loyalty oaths, comparing them to demands made on citizens in fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. While critiquing the new fascism, Serling took the opportunity to address police brutality, very much on the minds of the sixties generation after the 1968 Democratic National Convention the previous summer when Mayor Richard J. Daley unleashed the police in a wave of violence against anti-war protestors. Serling dismissed the idea that the protestors offered provocation since, he strenuously argued, no possible provocation existed for a “representative of law and order wading in with a billy club under the pretense of saving the sovereign city of Chicago.” Serling went further. Aware that police riots against white students received far more attention than the history of violence against Black people, he scorned the use of law and order in politics, saying it amounted to “a battle slogan.” Nixon and his creatures used the phrase in the ’68 presidential election as a code, assuring white Americans that civil rights legislation did not mean an end to systemic racism enforced with real and threatened violence. Serling noted that “law and order” seemed important only when used as a rhetorical tool. Where, he demanded to know, had the crusaders of law and order been when “four little Negro girls were bombed to pieces in a Birmingham church” or “when three young civil rights workers were slaughtered in Mississippi.” What about a call for law and order during “the bombing of over a hundred churches in the south in the past five years”? Given this, he bluntly asserted in terms that have contemporary application, “It’s hardly a revelation to me that the young people in this country take a dim view of our current uptightness when it comes to street rioting . . . on the scale of misbehavior, the black man who takes a torch to a building or breaks a window to loot, and does so out of passion, is less the criminal than the white man who puts his torch to human beings . . .” In the very same speech, Serling asserted that, even as public opinion began to turn against America’s invasion of Vietnam, few understood or accepted the real meaning of the war. Rather than protecting South Vietnam from the unprovoked aggression of the North, we had allowed “twenty-thousand dead American boys” while “half a million civilians [were put] to a torch” to interfere with a civil war in which the United States sided with a corrupt regime that did not have the support of the people. “So,” he wondered aloud, “what, indeed, are we defending there?”51 Serling died in June of 1975 following coronary bypass surgery. His family had a history of heart irregularities, in Serling’s case exacerbated by smoking as many as four packs of cigarettes a day since World War II. At the time of his death, he suffered with depression, despite some very significant and critically acclaimed writing done for an off-kilter western called The Loner and his newest TV series, Night Gallery. He felt that, as studio execs tried to make Night Gallery competitive with the hugely popular detective series Mannix, social content had given way to “the need for producing simple and unconvincing frights.” Meanwhile, he often commented that while The Twilight Zone had been a mixed bag of excellent, good, bad, and terrible episodes, he also thought it the most politically relevant work of his career. Yet, he doubted it would survive in American memory. He could not have been more wrong. The memory and increasing relevance of Serling’s work entwined with the hopes and anxieties of a new generation of filmmakers like George A. Romero. Like Rod Serling, they did not want to simply “hang out in a graveyard” and raise some ghouls for suspense. A new generation of filmmakers wanted to comment, to make statements, to make important films. A new breaker of horror washed over America, a bleak and chilled wave inundating late-twentieth-century America’s imperial dream. A backlash against this critique would also wash over the American landscape, at times seeming to carry all before it. 12.Bats Leaving, Virgins Bleeding BELA LUGOSI last played Dracula on the silver screen for giggles in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). The forties served Lugosi manifold frustrations, even for a film career hobbled since before World War II. In one of his final films with Boris Karloff, Black Friday (1940), Lugosi played an unconvincing crime boss. He had so little screen time that he could almost be considered an extra. In the following decade, his career cratered with the low-budget attempt at comedy Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla. A spoof on the mad scientist genre, the film tapped into a new science fiction fascination with gorillas gone wild. The few who saw the film perhaps remembered Lugosi’s Murders in the Rue Morgue. He certainly brought a little bit of the light of a dying star to the flop meant as a vehicle for comedians Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, forgotten celebrities whose act amounted to plagiarism of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis’s shtick. Bela Lugosi died on August 16, 1956. It’s a legend that the seventy-three-year-old asked to be buried in one of his several Dracula capes. But his family believed he would have wanted it so. They laid Lugosi to rest in the cloak of the vampire who stalked his career. The death of Lugosi came at a moment when American horror had undergone a complete transformation. A new sensibility emerged even while flying saucers hovered threateningly and giant mutations rose from their prehistoric sleep as humanity harnessed, and lost control of, the power of the atom. Audiences remained fascinated with such films and even flocked to revivals of the ideas about invasion and infiltration they represented. But American horror changed as the American empire changed. Lugosi’s White Zombie joined the Fu Manchu series in creating for Americans a Manichean world of supernatural villainy, a constant threat to American values. The Red Scare and the growing disaster of Vietnam convinced a significant portion of the American public that infiltrators and enemies lurked everywhere, even though the projection of American military and economic power—inciting coups, propping up dangerous regimes, arming proxy fighters, building a vast network of bases, airfields, and military prisons in client states and colonial possessions—encapsulated the real story of global politics. The sounds of the calliope continued to vibrate menacingly in the darkness as the 1970s began. Like the macabre traveling show of Bradbury’s imagination, things happened in the sightless black of America’s new night. Slasher films reanimated the murderous intent of empire for the big screen. A bizarre, seemingly premodern, obsession with demonic evil rode the backs of a generation. A razor-edged counterstroke by American militarism drowned the dreams of the sixties and seventies in bloody waters.",

      "content": "1.Black Magic Island WHITE ZOMBIE (1932) is all atmosphere. It’s a film of shadow, jungle, and cemeteries, the ground itself extruding fog and dread. The undead menacingly stumble in the tropical night, their frightening cadence moving in disturbing rhythm with the drums from the blind, hot darkness. Not everyone saw its charms. Mocking the film in a July 1932 review, a reviewer for The New York Times snarked that “Necromancers waved their sinister hands from the screen of the Rivoli yesterday and tried to hypnotize blondes into killing their boyfriends. A legion of individuals, with deceased minds but alert bodies, threw butlers into subterranean streams.”1 It may have sounded ludicrous, but the flick had something going for it. Bela Lugosi played Murder Legendre, a sorcerer who knows the secrets of the dead and the undead. His role in the low-budget effort seemed an odd choice for the actor, fresh off the box office bonanza of Dracula. Lugosi’s role in the film may seem inexplicable, but the film’s subject could not have been more relevant. The generation born at the turn of the twentieth century held an enormous interest in Haiti since, by 1932, the United States had occupied the country for seventeen years. The 1915 invasion of Haiti by American troops could have been predicted by anyone who watched the trajectory of American power. Haiti seemed predestined to attract American attention. After its revolution in the 1790s, it became the first republic of African peoples in the new world. This meant, as historian Raphael Dalleo wrote in his book American Imperialism’s Undead, that “Haiti represented the idea that black people could be agents of world history.” White America, North and South, trembled at Haiti’s example during the antebellum slave regime. Following the Civil War, as slavery ended but segregation took its place, Haiti remained a bothersome symbol to a country whose mainstream politicians regularly and openly spoke of America as “a white man’s country.”2 Although the very existence of Haiti rankled many Americans, other variables ultimately led to the invasion and occupation. The administration of Woodrow Wilson agreed with American corporate interests that the island, long closed to the incursion of the American market, had to be seized. U.S. corporate interests shuddered at a provision in the Haitian constitution forbidding foreigners from owning land, an assertion of independence galling to the values of global piracy. The City Bank of New York, now the financial conglomerate Citigroup, demanded the deletion of this provision to facilitate the building of a railroad. The U.S. Marines promptly expropriated the land of farmers, and much of Haiti became a plantation economy in the 1920s.3 White Zombie probed Americans’ fears about Haiti and legitimated them. The long-suffering country became a world of sorcery and superstition during the occupation. The best-selling 1929 book The Magic Island by William Seabrook described the mélange of African, Arawak, and European traditions called Vodun (or “spirit” in the African Fon and Ewe languages) as a wicked necromancy that demanded the drinking of blood and resurrected the dead as shambling zombies. In 1927, the forty-three-year-old Seabrook had published a tale of his travels in the Middle East that emphasized the allegedly exotic and uncanny nature of the region carved up by Britain, France, and the United States after the Great War. He went to Haiti to do some similar ideological work, at times criticizing the attitudes of Marine officers but also emphasizing the alleged “economic prosperity and political peace” brought by “our own benevolent American protectorate.” The supposedly wicked nature of Vodun ultimately justified the American seizure of the island. Although his attitudes about the tradition are complicated (he could describe the “beauty” of a Vodun ceremony), Seabrook ultimately decided to use adjectives like monstrous, obscene, or forbidding to seduce the American reader eager to hear of a black magic island. Haiti as a country dominated by “voodoo” quickly became a standard part of the American horror tradition. Readers of horror pulps such as Weird Tales, best-known today as the outlet for the work of H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, encountered stories like the December 1924 tale “Voodoo.” Written by Arthur J. Burks, a marine during the early part of the occupation, the story reads like a fictional travelogue in which an American soldier rescues his buddy from “a devilish ceremony.” Burks’s version of Vodun did not include zombies but described other diabolical features like “a priestess of the serpent” planning to sacrifice a teenaged girl. In August of 1925, Burks wrote another occult tale set in Haiti called “Black Medicine,” which presented the islanders as worshippers of a demonic green serpent.4 The pedigree of White Zombie, like much in the American horror tradition, lay in the emergence of the United States as a postwar global colossus. Frightful and titillating to white audiences, it played to American fascination with the peoples it ruled. It also legitimized that rule by telling white America it had to suppress the evils lurking in the night. White Zombie borrows from themes found in the 1930s golden age of horror. There’s a bit of the “old dark house” concept, only it’s an old dark plantation in the jungle rather than a mansion on a lonely moor suffering through another dark and stormy night. A young couple, Madeleine and Neil, are set to marry in the Caribbean because the hopeful husband works at “the Bank of Port Au Prince,” a notable theme given the role of American banking interests in the invasion of Haiti. The plantation owner desires the bride-to-be and enlists the aid of Legendre the zombie master. Legendre poisons Madeleine on her wedding night only to bring her back as the slave of the plantation owner. Advertising for the film promised audiences that the heroine (played by beauty Madge Bellamy) would have to “perform his every desire.” Sadly, for audiences hoping for salacious material, they only got to see Bellamy play the piano with a thousand-yard stare. Filmed just before the Motion Picture Production Code went into effect, the film does show the audience her compelling figure while wiggling into her trousseau. As native women help with her voluminous undergarments, we see her nearly weep with horror when she hears drums in the night. By today’s standards, the scene is more than modest but certainly offered strong sauce for 1932. The sexual subtext remains throughout and the implications of a white blonde being a physical and mental captive in Haiti are allowed to smolder. In early notices, Lugosi’s eyes and magical grip appear abstracted in a sea of jungle green on a poster that promises “with these zombie eyes he rendered her powerless.” After Madeleine’s undeath, the wronged husband pines away for the return of his blonde, but on learning from a sympathetic missionary that she may have become a zombie and “fallen into the hands of natives,” he drunkenly raves, “not that . . . better death than that!” White Zombie gave viewers all manner of bewildering messages about Haiti. On the one hand, it showed the exploitation of the labor of native peoples. One of the most intriguing set pieces takes place in a sugarcane mill. Zombified workers drudge bundles of cane to the top of a catwalk to drop into the mill’s churning blades. Moving in a stolid trance, the undead look more or less like any set of workers toiling under the burdens of plantation labor . . . or of underpaid, disregarded “free” labor. The film even evokes the history of slavery on the island and the new world more generally. A missionary who befriends the unlucky couple makes the historically dubious claim that the pharmaceutical magic necessary for making a zombie came “from Africa” and, farther back, “civilizations old when Egypt was young.” Americans are lights of civilization and morality. “Haiti is full of nonsense and superstition,” insists the missionary, who wants to defeat Legendre’s plan so that he can bring the light of truth to the island he portrays as lousy with “witch doctors.” White audiences left Lugosi’s new hit with their sense of racial superiority intact. This would have been true whether they walked out of the theater with the ugly racist porn of a white woman captive to native desires on their mind or the sense that the uncivilized native peoples of the world needed America’s help to escape “nonsense and superstition.” In fact, by 1932, Americans had believed this about the Caribbean, Latin America, and much of the Pacific world for decades. 2.Jungle Fever THE UNITED States opened the twentieth century by taking on the decayed Spanish empire in Cuba and annexing the Hawaiian Islands. President William McKinley baldly asserted that that United States needed the latter for a military base. Toppling Spanish control over Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines would create more complex problems. In order to build a new, more fluid imperial style, American leadership developed patterns of rhetoric, control, and explosive violence used throughout the century. Cuban leaders, who fought against Spanish rule for decades, looked uneasily at American occupation forces even as they hoped for the best. They would be deeply disappointed. In 1901, an army appropriations bill in Congress came tainted with poison for Cuban democracy. The Platt Amendment, inserted into the new Cuban constitution at gunpoint, allowed the United States a laundry list of privileges on the enormous island and capped them all by giving the United States the right to intervene in the country’s affairs at any time. Cuba’s economy belonged to American corporations for sixty years and the people would be ruled by a series of dictators selected by the United States.5 The Philippines, an enormous archipelago of nearly eight thousand separate islands, proved more challenging to dominate. After winning freedom from the Spanish, Filipino insurgents continued the fight for years against American forces that refused to end their occupation. American troops killed thousands of Filipino fighters and civilians caught in the crossfire. American forces introduced a torture method later known as waterboarding and even more egregious forms of torture that included pumping seawater into the veins of suspected insurgents. The United States came to rule the Philippines but never annexed it outright and granted the country limited independence in 1946, leaving behind military bases and handpicked pro-American dictators. The brutal experiment in the Philippines allowed American leaders to construct a sense of American nationalism with clear borders while extending economic and military power with a limitless circumference. American leaders at home had their eyes on markets. Moreover, politicians proved less wary of talking in terms of empire than they would later in the twentieth century. President McKinley spoke of a civilizing and Christianizing mission, but in the Senate, Henry Cabot Lodge simply described the need for military bases that would open the promising market of China and “the far East” more generally. White supremacy at home became the justification for intervention abroad. At the beginning of the twentieth century, state laws ignored the Fifteenth Amendment and part of the legacy of the American Civil War by disenfranchising African Americans. Beginning in 1876, accusations of voter fraud became the bludgeon to use against the Black vote. Meanwhile, the country accepted de facto and de jure segregation of all public life and services with the blessing of the Supreme Court. American soldiers in the Philippines used racist epithets with roots in American slavery to describe the islands’ peoples alongside a new phrase with uncertain origin, gugus. Scholars have suggested it’s a mocking term for a language the American invaders did not understand or perhaps a word for sex workers on the islands.6 Gugu became the gruesome word gook, a dehumanizing term that has followed the American flag all over the globe. By 1920, during the occupation of Haiti, a reporter for The Nation noted that American troops called the Haitians this term and treated them “with every variety of contempt, insult, and brutality.” He described how American officers spoke of trips to the island’s interior to, in the marines’ words, “bump off gooks” with comparisons made to duck hunting. The racist term reappeared in the Korean War and, most infamously, the Vietnam War.7 White supremacy at home shaped foreign policy abroad. Though remembered in many American history textbooks as an idealist, Woodrow Wilson took the United States into the Great War, now generally referred to as World War I, with a mission of empire building grounded in his own conception of white supremacy. A Southerner by birth, Wilson famously praised the deeply racist film The Birth of a Nation (1915) and remained a defender of Jim Crow segregation throughout his life. Wilson’s attitude toward African Americans extended not only to Haitians but to the Mexican people as well. The Wilson administration staged several “interventions” and “expeditions” into the nation aflame with revolutionary fervor, allegedly as a “punitive” response to the raids of Pancho Villa along the New Mexico–Texas border. John J. Pershing, who pursued Geronimo in 1886 and savaged the Filipino insurgents, attempted and failed to capture Villa. Two years later, Wilson appointed Pershing to lead American forces in the Great War. Pershing’s careless use of American lives led to catastrophic losses given the United States actively participated in the global war for only a few months. The effects of early American forays into imperial conquest remain with us. Haiti never recovered from its years of occupation and would face future American invasions and occupations. White anger simmered at Mexico and Mexican Americans, a hatred of the conquered by the conqueror. The anger became explosive violence. Lynch mobs terrorized the Tejano community from 1916 into the 1920s. The Texas state government effectively disenfranchised all Latinos through poll taxes, the same method used to take ballots away from African Americans in much of the South. One Texas rancher called for “detention camps along the border” and the building of infrastructure to allow the American military ingress into Mexico. Historian Stephen Hahn estimates that several thousand Tejanos died at the hands of white mobs, the police, and the military in the years after the Pershing invasion.8 Today, the United States maintains a military presence, and allows paramilitary vigilantes to operate, along the border with Mexico, protecting the territory seized from the country in the nineteenth century. In 2019, in Texas alone, the United States held 14,500 people in precisely the kind of concentration camps called for in the 1910s. Despite this legacy, Wilson’s rhetoric about “self-determination” in his “Fourteen Points” (Georges Clemenceau quipped that “The good Lord had only ten!”) burnished his image as an early globalist. Behind the scenes, the American government made clear its real intent. Wilson’s secretary of state, Robert Lansing, insisted that the language of self-determination did not apply to “races, peoples or communities whose state of barbarism or ignorance deprive them of the capacity to choose intelligently their political affiliations.” The lands with “devilish ceremonies” would remain subject to the American world order. White Zombie suggested a horrifying paradox, one that American military and economic power would never allow. The phrase banana republic still makes the rounds, even used since the eighties as the theme for a clothing store catering to youthful, middlebrow tastes. It’s meant to evoke a tropical dictatorship, absurdly corrupt and laughably underdeveloped. While used by most Americans to express disdain for foreign institutions, the phrase first appeared as an epithet for American maleficence in Central America. O. Henry in his 1904 short story “The Admiral” first used the term in relation to Honduras. In that country, the New York/Boston–based United Fruit Company acquired vast lands and ownership of most of the railways and ports. In 1911, the company used its own funds to pay for a coup that installed a dictator more amenable to United Fruit’s neocolonial policy. Zombie republics might be a better descriptor for many of the countries where American corporate and military power exercised control. Stripped of economic resources and moving at the direction of United States–supported puppet dictators, they represented decayed versions of hopes for autonomy and independence, the rotting corpses of colonial states subject to American necromancy. 3.Bombs and Movies GERMAN THINKERS forced to emigrate to the United States from Nazi Germany in the thirties, particularly philosophers and social critics like Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, worried that an American equivalent of European fascism could easily emerge in their new homeland. They feared that, as in Weimar Germany, the crass nature of American pop culture softened up the brain for fascism. “Automobiles, bombs, and movies,” they wrote, all did their part in assuring mainstream America that the concept of an American way of life was not a belief but just common sense. Adorno and his colleagues are usually loosely grouped together as the Frankfurt School, named after the original site of their research institute in Frankfurt, Germany. In a bleak irony, the institute for Marxist studies established by primarily Jewish thinkers there became the home of Germany’s major Zyklon B manufacturing plants. The reputation of the Frankfurt School has been fusty and fraught. They not only seemed like a squad for the fun police in their distaste for popular culture, but sometimes as the reactionaries they certainly were not. Adorno, for example, critiqued the use of rock music in anti-war protests during the 1960s in such a way that he appeared to criticize the idea of protest itself. Now and again, they just seemed absurd, as when Adorno wondered aloud about the fascist proclivities of escalators—one had to surrender one’s autonomy to ride one, after all. It did not help their reputation with the sixties generation, or later generations, that Adorno and his colleagues often chose to be abstruse and abstract when they could have easily explained. More recently, scholars and a wider literary culture have decided the fussy Frankfurt School might have been on to something after all. Alex Ross, a contemporary writer for the New Yorker fascinated with this band of émigré culture critics, wrote that Adorno would have looked grimly at how the twenty-first century proved him right. In a prescient warning in 2014, Ross wrote that much of our social media landscape looks very much like an Adornoesque nightmare. “Technology conspires with populism,” he suggested, “to create an ideologically vacant dictatorship of likes.” In 2016, Stuart Jeffries, author of a collective biography of the Frankfurt School critics, told Vox that Trump speaks in a “stream-of-consciousness gibberish” free of “thought” and “historical memory.” Jeffries sees him as a product of exactly what Adorno feared. He folded “pop entertainment into politics” and created a “spectacle” that requires nothing but attention to thrive.9 Long before the “dictatorship of likes,” small genre films did shape how white America looked at the rest of the world. While empire dared not speak its name since the early years of the twentieth century, horror films often relentlessly hammered home its racist logic. In everyday conversation, we use the term ideology to mean something like “a political position held to with some conviction.” Since the nineteenth century, its denotative meaning has been a set of ideas that everything from media to market values asks us to accept as “common sense” or “the way things are.” The most ideological documents are precisely those we don’t perceive as ideological . . . maybe even those it seems laughable to perceive as such. What works better than an advertisement that makes fun of advertising, or a film that manages us with the camera’s privileged point of view? Horror in American culture has been more than a catharsis, more than a reflection of anxieties, more than the need to test the limits of our fears. It has played an integral role in what Adorno called “the culture industry.” The manufacture of dark images of the allegedly primitive corners of the earth has been a thrumming cog in the machine of empire. If we take the best of the Frankfurt School at its word, the horror film proved a necessary element in the American public’s acceptance of, and even entertainment through, America’s imperial ambitions. Warning in 1933 about the popularity of King Kong, a film that became something of an archetype for films that combined horror with the alleged primitivism of most of the world, Adorno described it as a tale of Americans who, without realizing it, agreed to be cast as “walk-on parts in a monster documentary.” 4.Welcome (Back) to the Jungle IN 1941, just as the United States entered the Second World War, King of the Zombies attempted to tell a story of rough-and-ready agents of the OSS (forerunner to the CIA) combating an unnamed foreign government on a Caribbean island “somewhere between Puerto Rico and Cuba.” This seems an absurdly obtuse reference to Haiti. But in truth it’s scripted as a nonspecific anywhere, the savage jungle of imperial imagination. Crash-landing on the island, the two white agents and their African American valet, Jefferson Jackson, find a plantation house where Dr. Sangre (“Dr. Blood”) pretends to be a refugee from Nazi-controlled Vienna. In fact, Sangre blends science and an alliance with a “voodoo priestess” in a nefarious scheme that involves kidnapping a rear admiral of a foreign nation and seizing the Panama Canal, one of the early twentieth-century outposts of American imperial power. Sangre’s dastardly plot is to use a “voodoo ceremony” and his army of zombies to force the captive admiral to reveal the “canal zone defenses” for “his government.” Most of the American audience likely assumed the alleged Austrian refugee worked for Hitler but, depending on where they fell on the political spectrum, might have placed him in the employ of Stalin. King of the Zombies makes full use of racist imagery that delighted and frightened white audiences all at once. Dr. Sangre’s zombies are “big black ones,” as an OSS agent affirms. Later in the film, an agent calls them Sangre’s “ape men.” Meanwhile the accomplished Black humorist Mantan Moreland embodied the American stereotype of African American men with Jefferson Jackson, complete with malapropisms and a perpetually pop-eyed expression. Moreland remains one of the great forgotten talents of midcentury Hollywood, his reputation obscured by the racist cartoons he was forced to pantomime if he wanted to work at all.10 King of the Zombies shows an important side of horror science fiction too often ignored in the forties and fifties. It’s easy to see the metaphor for communist invasion and infiltration in the flying saucers flitting about the screens of the era. But there’s another side to the horror culture of World War II and the decades that followed. Americans obsessed over invasion, but it was not only communist powers coming to American shores. Filmmakers found the public hungry for various kinds of colonial horror, films in which representatives of white civilization are the invaders in imagined Latin Americas and Africas, meeting with the “superstition” of “primitives” that turns out to be all too real. Americans did not even have to turn to film to get an entrée of primitivism matched with horror. At the 1939 New York World’s Fair in Flushing, the “South Seas” exhibit offered a “zombie-themed restaurant,” showing once again the way the geographies of monster and empire could collapse into one another. The theme of racism and American power appeared at the fair in the form of African Americans portraying natives in the fair’s “Jungleland” and minstrel singers like Bill “Bojangles” Robinson performing. These representations of the atavistic subjects of the American empire becomes all the more striking when considering the 1939 fair’s celebration of “The World of Tomorrow.”11 These are entertainments aimed at the perpetually aggrieved empire. White America imagined itself becoming the victim of an invasion from beyond, but it also listened to stories of how it could become the victim of people of color abroad. Jungle horror legitimized racism at home and offered a rationale for an aggressive foreign policy, the creation of zombie republics. Bride of the Gorilla (1951) takes place in what appears to be Dutch Guiana (now Surinam) in Latin America. But the contradictory messages the audience had to read in the geography of the B-movie tell us much about Cold War America’s understanding of the world and its place in it. The mix of characters the film presented as foreign, even though they are in their homeland, are represented as Asian, other times African, and only vaguely Latin American. The only real geography is a nondescript “jungle” that narrator Lon Chaney Jr. describes as “lush, green . . . as old as time” and willing to “[take] the law into its own hands.” It’s a new frontier, pilgrim. Curt Siodmak, émigré (and escapee) from Hitler’s Germany, wrote the screenplay. A successful novelist by the fifties, Siodmak is also known for his better-than-it had-to-be script for The Wolf Man. Contending with much lower production values and a sillier plot, Bride of the Gorilla managed to be somewhat literate even with its racist assumption that the non-white peoples of the globe represented a malignant threat to American power. The Van Gelder estate becomes the “old dark plantation” in Bride of the Gorilla. We’re never told the cash crop or where the story takes place. The audience only knows it’s somewhere all white people agree is not in the civilized world. The jungle itself becomes a monstrous, mysterious entity working its will through a witch doctor who witnesses the white overseer murder the plantation owner. Adultery and subsequent marriage to the plantation mistress are the crimes that the jungle unleashes its wrath against, not the colonial economy or the overseer’s sexual exploitation of Indigenous people shown early in the film. A white man has taken a wealthier white man’s woman and the punishment will be . . . becoming black and then turning into a primate. The jungle takes away his whiteness and then makes him something inhuman. It’s the threat implied in the phrase white zombie in another form. Konga (1961) followed a similar heavily racialized theme. The audience receives a more exact geography this time: the dangerous monster comes from Africa, specifically Uganda. When Konga appeared, the British protectorate smoldered with rising nationalist sentiment that some in the United States, nearly inevitably, connected with socialism. British rule had been somewhat benign in Uganda. However, benign in an imperial context meant that indentured servanthood rather than genocide became the fate of many of the Indigenous peoples. Discontent roiled the country, which won its independence in 1962. In Konga, the colonies came home. A mad scientist has spent a year “with friendly natives” where he met the omnipresent “witch doctor,” who taught him how to use “seeds to control his subjects.” Konga the chimp comes home to London and transforms into Konga the monster, rampaging through the city like his obvious giant ape ancestor King Kong. Colonial independence meant monsters at home. The United States would, a few years after Uganda’s independence, endorse British and Israeli intelligence efforts to install Idi Amin. In the 1970s, the CIA helped supply him with arms. A bit like Konga, the brutal regime in Uganda would be a joint British and American production.12 But did anyone really take away these kinds of political messages from low-budget horror films? They were only movies, right? Horror films told audiences that if they left the United States for anywhere but Europe, they’d find it really was a jungle out there. Sitting, maybe giggling, through King of the Zombies and Bride of the Gorilla, shoes sticky on the popcorn-butter-splattered floor, white audiences could sit back and learn why theirs was just the best nation ever. The rest of the world seemed filled with superstition and sorcerers, mad scientists and their monsters. The non-white world probably needed an invasion, a first strike. Corporate and political interests helped produce the real “monster documentary.” In Guatemala, next door to the earlier zombie republic of Honduras, United Fruit even seized control of the postal service to ensure fast delivery of their product. The company would eventually own three and a half million acres in Central America and the Caribbean. Most of this land underwent a process best described as agricultural fracking, a transformation of small holdings into banana and sugarcane plantations and vast tracts of land for railroads and ports to ensure Americans received a steady supply of fresh bananas. In the second half of the twentieth century, United Fruit, today rebranded as Chiquita Brands International, could count on American foreign policy to conform to its designs. In the 1950s, Eisenhower’s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, best known for his streetfighter style of anti-communism, performed legal work for United Fruit. So did his brother, CIA Director Allen Dulles. In 1954, the CIA orchestrated a coup against the government of Jacobo Árbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala, when he nationalized almost half of United Fruit’s holdings as part of his plans for agrarian reform. The Dulles brothers saw Árbenz as a crypto-communist with ties to Moscow even though their own intelligence reports concluded no such thing. The CIA trained a small army of mercenaries and funneled arms through Honduras and Nicaragua, right-wing dictatorships dependent on the United States. Bombing runs by CIA pilots convinced Guatemalans and their president they would face a full-scale invasion by the United States. America’s clandestine service further created chaos in the country by suggesting the occurrence of an alien invasion. Planting false tales of all kinds and then taking over a shortwave radio station, CIA operatives warned of flying saucer sightings and plans by the government to close churches and force everyone to worship Stalin. Bombing and assassinations proved even more convincing, of course, though clearly some CIA field agents had been listening to Walter Bedell Smith when he suggested the use of space invaders for psychological warfare. CIA black ops specialist E. Howard Hunt said frankly that the United States wanted “a terror campaign” and compared the work done in Guatemala positively to the fear inspired by Nazi Stuka bombers over Poland.13 The terror campaign worked. Árbenz chose to step down and go into exile and a military junta headed by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas seized control of the country, and thus did the United States. The United Fruit Company benefitted enormously from the coup, again showing the degree to which capitalism drove the American empire. In fact, the New Orleans–based corporation helped finance the effort. A CIA cable two years before the government’s overthrow assured the Pentagon that “[redacted] officials of the United Fruit Company have promised financial aid. [Redacted] and Castillo met in Baton Rouge, LA in December . . . [Redacted] will get money in Honduras and deliver it to Castillo in that country.”14 If the seizure of the country by the right-wing dictatorship proved a boon for United Fruit and its stockholders, a curse fell on the people of Guatemala. Outlawing labor unions and indeed any effort by campesinos to organize politically represented the least of the regime’s crimes. Castillo imprisoned tens of thousands of people for “communist sympathies,” all at the advice of Allen Dulles. The resulting Guatemalan Civil War resulted in the deaths of two hundred thousand civilians over several decades, years in which the U.S. government provided the regime with hundreds of millions of dollars.15 The United States sought to perfect the small-footprint empire. Why occupy a country and annex territory when covert ops, corporate interest, off-the-books murders, and proxy armies could install American assets as dictators? The year before the intervention in Guatemala, an American-led coup in Iran overthrew the elected prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq because he favored the nationalization of foreign oil interests. Placing the unpopular Reza Shah Pahlavi on the throne, the CIA and U.S. special forces turned the republic into a monarchical police state.16 Films shaped American conceptions about Latin America, the nature of the Cold War, white supremacy, and the prerogatives of the United States around the world. It is hard not to see the kind of soft power even B-movies could exercise on public opinion and its underlying attitudes. In fact, outside of a few slapstick comedies that made light of mustachioed generals ruling “banana republics,” Americans saw no real representations of Latin America and the Caribbean other than horror. Moviegoers had their choice of bizarrely lighthearted romps concerned with corruption and military dictatorship in the tropics (with, of course, no hint that the United States funded and armed these regimes) or frightening portrayals of exotic jungles of temptation and terror where the king of the zombies, ancient curses, and threats to white women and white manhood waited. Send in the marines, somebody. America’s vast colonial undertaking in the twentieth century bundled together packet injections of geopolitical ambition, folklore, rumor legends, and films to shape the acceptance of the empire. Films and bombs, as the Frankfurt School argued, kept the United States on its imperial course while the American people played their walk-on parts in a monster doc. 5.Night(s) of the Living Dead ERIC BLAIR, known to the world as George Orwell, sat in his cabin on the isolated Scottish isle of Jura. The chill of the Hebrides wind competed with the smoky warmth of burning peat in the fireplace. Orwell scrawled out his final and most famous work, Ninety Eighty-Four: A Novel, usually published today as 1984. Right-wing libertarians have sometimes seized on the book as a critique of activist government, or in their rhetoric “the nanny state.” In fact, Orwell himself held to what we would label democratic socialism and admired communist thinker Leon Trotsky. Killed by a Stalinist assassin in Mexico in 1940, Trotsky appeared as a revolutionary betrayed by authoritarians in both Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell joined a Trotskyite brigade during the Spanish Civil War as part of the effort to defeat Francisco Franco’s fascist legions. Orwell died in 1950, tubercular and beset with pneumonia and strep he apparently contracted on an ill-considered boat trip in the frigid waters of the Inner Hebrides. His predications of a despotic future served as a critique of Stalinism in his own time even as they effectively predicted the power of surveillance and lack of privacy of our contemporary moment. He also accurately predicted every superpower’s need for an enemy. Certainly between 1941 and 1975, the idea first presented in 1984 that we “had always been at war with Eastasia” seemed a quantum expression of American foreign policy and public opinion. The names and geographic locations of the cultures their government obliged them to hate proved confusing to many Americans. But that was more than acceptable to foreign policy elites. In part, as horror films revealed when they showed Americans a peculiar mash-up of places decidedly NOT-AMERICA, confusion was the point. Fear and hatred of the Japanese during World War II became hatred and fear of China. The baffling nature of the Korean War for most Americans, the reality that American soldiers and other U.N. forces actively engaged both North Korean and Chinese forces, helped shape a sense that we “had always been at war with Eastasia,” although, just like the slogan in 1984, this represented a revision of history, a willful forgetting, and a racist set of assumptions that allowed white America to see Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam as some version of Fu Manchu’s “Asiatic hordes.” The Soviet Union could be bundled into the eastern monstrosity, with serious foreign policy analysts, writers, and artists describing Russia as attracted by Bolshevism because of its history of “oriental despotism.”17 At home, as the story of Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” showed, hatred of Japan could easily be replaced by hatred of China. The opposite had been effected during the Second World War when an outbreak of assaults on Asian people after Pearl Harbor had become indiscriminate. Just before Christmas in 1941, Life magazine ran a piece entitled “How to Tell Japs from Chinese.” The piece in America’s most popular magazine essentially told readers that if they wished to assault someone, make sure to look for the alleged telltale signs of the Japanese “massively boned head” as opposed to the “delicately boned” features of the Chinese. The Chinese, meanwhile, wore “the rational calm of tolerant realists” while the Japanese face is “humorless” and “ruthless.”18 The roving imperial eye saw a jungle everywhere, from West Africa to the Middle East, from the Pacific and Asian countries to all of South America. By the 1960s, Americans focused these attitudes on the ancient society of Vietnam. Readers should know that Vietnam (explored later in this book because of its immense importance) became a horror landscape of American nightmares about its ability to assert its global hegemony. Left-leaning guerillas, many of them fighting for their national independence since the Japanese seized the country, drove out their former colonial masters, the French, after the decisive 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu. The Truman administration footed the bill for the French struggle, paying up to two-thirds of their costs in Southeast Asia between 1950 and 1952.19 Following Eisenhower’s inauguration in 1953, his administration continued support for the French and, under the banner of anti-communism, eventually took over for France as colonial overlord. The 1954 Geneva Accords allowed for a French withdrawal, a supposedly temporary division of Vietnam into North and South, and an election in two years that would unite the country. The United States prevented the election from happening, certain that the socialist hero of the wars against Japan and France, Ho Chi Minh, would emerge victorious. Political rhetoric at home sought to hide these facts. Most Americans believed by the early 1960s that North Vietnam, a “foreign communist power,” invaded South Vietnam, and the United States, wisely or not, intervened against an aggressor nation. In fact, Americans, who largely supported some level of intervention, had really no idea that they had become embroiled in a civil war. Even fewer knew their leaders sided with a corrupt, inept, and brutal regime, a zombie republic ensorcelled from nothing by the United States, which never managed to convince the South Vietnamese of its legitimacy. Ngo Dinh Diem ruled South Vietnam with the support of important American business and military leaders. Diem’s regime, however, helped the communist cause in the South thrive through the draconian actions of his secret police and attempts to uproot native Vietnamese Buddhism. It’s a sign of the clueless authoritarianism of Diem and his numerous replacements that, as much as some South Vietnamese feared the communists, they could never see their own government as a real alternative. John F. Kennedy, still for many Americans the iconic president, received a pass on the escalation of the conflict in popular memory. The facts are not on the side of his admirers. Most any textbook will tell you that the first Marine combat brigades appeared in Vietnam in 1965. Technically, this is true. But by the time of his assassination in 1963, Kennedy deployed close to seventeen thousand troops in Vietnam officially classified as “advisors.” Indeed, one of the few times the highly conservative comedian Bob Hope, by the sixties out of fashion with the young, managed a chuckle out of American GIs when he acknowledged this reality. When Hope performed his first Vietnamese Christmas Show in 1964, he started his set for the thousands assembled by gleefully hailing them with “Hello, advisors!”20 The Geneva Accords limited “advisors and observers” to under seven hundred. The United States ignored this limit just as it ignored the provision for a national election to settle the conflict. Kennedy insisted that Americans did not engage in combat even as it became clear that American pilots oversaw and took part in napalm raids. Dow Chemical developed an improved version of the vicious, inflammable jelly since the “terror bombings” of World War II, hotter and longer burning. Life magazine ran a story in January of 1963 about an American aircraft allegedly piloted by Vietnamese airmen trained by American observers. Historian of the Vietnam War Christian G. Appy writes, “the caption was written by editors still willing to parrot the official fiction.”21 The use of deadly bioweapons and the secret war being waged against North Vietnam continued the trajectory of American foreign policy that began with the seizure of the Philippines. The kind of conflict the Vietnam War became, the willingness of a small group of political elites to sacrifice human life in the hundreds of thousands, clearly appears in the earliest days of American involvement. By 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson had deployed over five hundred thousand U.S. troops to Vietnam. Moreover, the belief that the United States could win the war through pure attrition, slaughtering so many Vietnamese that the conflict would simply end when the country became a desolation, took the military command structure down the darkest of paths. The military hierarchy, from lieutenants all the way up to commanding general William Westmoreland, demanded the production of “body count” to such a degree that platoons sometimes competed in their accumulation of corpses.22 The death toll among the Vietnamese people, of all political shades, went exponential. After 1968’s Tet Offensive rocked the United States back on its heels, the American military responded with devastating violence. As the war dragged on, artillery strikes, B-52 bombing runs, shells hurled from battleships offshore, and incessant machine-gun fire on the ground and from Huey and Chinook helicopters above expended more firepower than used by all sides in the Second World War. By 1970, U.S. forces used 128,400 tons of munitions a month. The sheer amount of firepower, including chemical weapons and the poisonous defoliant Agent Orange, vaporized entire villages. A conservative New York Times estimate of Vietnamese causalities, dependent on U.S. military and South Vietnamese army sources alone, concluded that North Vietnam and “Viet Cong” suffered close to one million deaths with no tally for the wounded or any real separation between “civilians” and “Viet Cong.” A reported 20,587 South Vietnamese believed to have been sympathizers died at the hands of their own government, aided by the CIA. Indeed, these numbers are vastly underinflated given that official CIA totals for their Operation Phoenix program claimed to have killed more than 20,000 “VC.”23 Significant attention has been paid to the atrocity of the 1968 My Lai massacre, the work of that legion of Charlies, Charlie Company of the Eleventh Brigade. Such incidents, often excused by the military brass as the acts of “a few bad apples,” are representative of the decimation of the country systematically ordered by the Pentagon and carried out with weaponry that went far beyond what a single platoon could accomplish. Journalist and historian Nick Turse closely examined the record of American atrocities in Vietnam using primarily veteran accounts and archived war crimes investigations by the U.S. Army. He found that, for example, the 1968 Operation Speedy Express campaign in the Mekong Delta unleashed F-4 Phantoms dropping a massive tonnage of napalm on civilian hamlets, swift boats machine-gunning anyone who ran from U.S. forces among the rice paddies, B-52s raining down unimaginable carnage, and SEAL teams joining regular infantry in what had become a 350-kilometer-wide free-fire zone.24 As charred corpses covered South Asia, the year 1968 introduced the world to a new kind of fictional terror, a kind of horror that belonged very much to the times. George A. Romero turned twenty-eight that year. Since his graduation from college in 1960, his dreams of becoming a filmmaker were limited to work on commercials and filming a segment of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood that assured children that having their tonsils taken out really wasn’t so bad. As the war escalated, Romero made an independent film that rattled the nation in ways it didn’t quite understand. Americans just knew it scared them in ways vampires, flying saucers, and giant bugs couldn’t manage. What if America became a zombie republic? Romero’s Night of the Living Dead became a surprise hit at small theaters and drive-ins all over the country. Although in no sense a political allegory, nerves already raw sizzled with the film’s allusions to a country facing an Armageddon, violent dissension, and a world in which the Black hero died in the end at the hands of a white police force providing tactical support for a white lynch mob. Romero’s zombies are rotting embodiments of the war at home. Unlike the overwhelming majority of gothic horror films since the 1930s, the monsters are not in a far-off land, an imagined Europe, or a collage of the non-white world. Romero doesn’t separate the horror of the undead from a group of survivors who hate one another as much as the monsters who want to make them into a meal. “They’re all kinda insane,” Romero said of the group. Their isolation from one another in the midst of the apocalypse is, he said, “the most frightening thing” about the horror masterpiece.25 Romero’s creatures are masterless ronin of death. They don’t embody, as in White Zombie and its imitators, white America’s fear and anxiety over its colonial projects abroad. No sorcerer wielding the power of voodoo has called them forth. They are not a monstrous metaphor for colonization and the unfree labor that accompanies it. But they are still very much monsters of empire. In Romero’s world, the American government created them. A space probe brought back “radiation” from Venus that caused the dead to rise. Moreover, in one brilliant scene, Romero rewrites the script of most of the science fiction horror of the 1950s and ’60s. Rather than banding together against the threat, scientists and generals argue with one another in front of the media about what Americans should know and what they should be lied to about. We get the sneaking suspicion that the military-academic-industrial complex made it possible for our fellow Americans to eat us for dinner. Like the survivors in the farmhouse, “they’re all kinda insane.” Romero chose Duane Jones, a young African American actor, to portray the lead role of Ben. Although the director always insisted he did not select Jones based on his race, this in no way suggests Romero failed to understand the implication of his selection. He worked on his small-budget masterpiece on location in western Pennsylvania during a year in which the freedom struggle entered a critical new phase in the fight against white supremacy. Night was released a few months after an assassin with a highly suspicious background took the life of Martin Luther King Jr. Romero likely refused to comment on Jones’s race because he never wanted to suggest he’d selected the extraordinary actor simply because of his skin color. It’s the no-nonsense, won’t-take-any-shit, fire-raging-in-the-belly attitude that Jones brought to the role that matters. He represents the embodiment of the angry Black man, a construct worried over by white editorialists, the monstrous archetype that white politicians later invented terms for like superpredator and thug to inspire fear and new voting patterns among suburban whites.26 Romero surrounds Ben with white America under siege. An aging 1950s couple trades vicious barbs with one another as the husband tries to play patriarch to the household. But his time has passed. Barbra, a young white woman, is comatose. A rural Ken and Barbie doll couple are directionless. A decayed and cannibalized body lies at the top of the stairs before Ben removes it, a fleshless skull with empty voids for eyes urgently invoking the photographs and film footage of the corpses of Vietnam. They sit in the abandoned farmhouse. It’s the dead West, the Spahn ranch, the Texas cannibals’ homestead, the last house on the left. It’s the haunted castle of American frontier expansion gone to seed. The besieged microcosm of America hears conflicting reports from scientists and military leaders. Unlike in many of the sci-fi horror films of the time, the military will not come to save us. The scientists working for the Pentagon and a proliferation of national security agencies cannot be trusted and may have even been the cause of the outbreak. The bleak ending leaves us with a corpse, part of the mound of corpses produced by American racism, police power ensuring white interests had the protection of a well-armed lynch mob, the violence of the state outsourced to a backwoods paramilitary. This mistrust of the Pentagon, deeply intertwined with the protest culture of the anti-war movement, reversed the somnolent message of so much of fifties and early sixties horror culture. Kyle William Bishop, author of American Zombie Gothic, writes that Romero viewed films like Invisible Invaders (1959) and The Earth Dies Screaming (1964) in which aliens bent on conquest reanimate the dead. He also loved more literate sci-fi epics like Howard Hawks’s 1951 The Thing from Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still. In these films, Bishop writes, “the soldier’s first reaction upon encountering life from another planet is to shoot first and ask questions later.” In this new zombie tale for a new generation, Romero ruthlessly critiqued this blinkered use of violence, a theme he returned to throughout his film career.27 In 1968, Romero saw the beginning of the reign of the dead. In the years ahead, his new kind of zombie would become America’s most popular monster and one that he, along with others, would consistently use to critique American values. The United States continued to busily create zombie republics abroad. But in the American collective imagination, the dead began to return to the homestead, indomitable and hungry. 6.The Null Zone IN THE June 1968 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, two competing ads appeared side by side. They revealed two alternative ideas about American imperial power among the most influential science fiction writers of the second half of the twentieth century. One read, “We the undersigned believe the United States must remain in Vietnam to fulfill its responsibilities to the people of that country.” On the facing page, readers saw a slightly longer list of names under the words “We oppose the participation of the United States in the war in Vietnam.” The same issue included the announcement of a contest entitled “What would you do about the Vietnam War?” The best five answers would receive a one-hundred-dollar cash prize. Throughout the 1960s, Galaxy was known for publishing a wide array of science fiction tales, including Ray Bradbury’s short story “The Fireman,” which became the basis for Fahrenheit 451. In contrast to earlier science fiction magazines, editors H. L. Gold and Frederik Pohl sought to propel their work beyond its reputation as the space-adventure-for-boys genre. Galaxy hoped publishing tales with social commentary or that made use of parody and satire would help solidify SF as a serious literary phenomenon. Kate Wilhelm and Judith Merril circulated the first call for a petition against the escalating war. Wilhelm became a multiple Nebula winner, one of the highest honors for speculative fiction, for her stories of postapocalyptic American landscapes. Merril, one of the most politically sophisticated of the somewhat directionless Futurians, joined the Trotskyite movement after realizing the brutal, and in many respects anti-socialist, direction Stalin took the Soviet Union in the thirties. By the 1960s, she actively engaged in anti-war activities while churning out a host of tales centered on nuclear nightmare scenarios. Both women expected a near-universal condemnation of the American war in Asia from their fellow writers. Perhaps they should not have been surprised by Robert A. Heinlein’s response. Heinlein’s position regarding race, the utter supremacy of the U.S. military, and even enthusiasm for atomic weapons almost guaranteed his adamant refusal to sign. In fact, Heinlein wrote a novel, Glory Road, in 1963 that presaged the later popularity of military techno-thrillers like those of Tom Clancy. In it, an embittered Korean War veteran goes to Vietnam to fight communists, lamenting that in Korea “we weren’t allowed to win” and excoriating American society for its “weakness” in not using nuclear weapons. In an obvious allusion to his Starship Troopers fantasy of space marines waging a fascist war against monstrous bugs, Glory Road compares the “natives” of Vietnam with “insects.” Another signer of the pro-war proclamation, Joe Poyer, authored a nonfiction piece for archconservative John W. Campbell’s Analog Science Fiction and Fact suggesting that capitalism and democracy would triumph over insurgent wars of liberation in the developing world by using futuristic weaponry. In one of Poyer’s short stories, a Green Beret tricked out with war tech like some combination of the Predator and Iron Man hunts and kills his human targets mercilessly, a new incarnation of Heinlein’s Starship Troopers brutally extirpating the enemy in South Asia instead of outer space. In the same tale, the U.S. military deploys droplets of “deadly radioactive waste” to create what Poyer called “the null zone.” Commenting on the signers behind the pro-war ad, historian H. Bruce Franklin notes that it “reads like a roll call of champions of super science and supermen, of manly and military virtue . . .” Jerry Pournelle offers the best example of a writer soon to play a walk-on roll in the monster doc of the American empire. A protégé of Heinlein’s, he built an entire career around the notion of American supremacy using sci-fi-inspired weaponry to destroy monsters, particularly those he saw embodied in nations and peoples resistant to American power.28 Pournelle served in the Korean War where he, paradoxically, joined the Communist Party. He later called this “misplaced idealism” and made a whiplash-inducing swing to the other end of the political spectrum. He became an advocate of an America First position while pushing Heinlein’s monster-slaying fantasies and racist nightmares to their logical conclusion. Pournelle worked for a few years in the aerospace industry, where his interest in the killing power of science flourished. In the late 1950s, as an employee of Boeing, he imagined the design of a new high-tech killing machine he called “Project Thor,” which could rain tungsten steel rods from space platforms with the destructive force of nuclear weapons, minus the radioactive fallout. While producing more and more science fiction, he continued to work with high-tech weaponry, specifically new designs for the next-gen ballistic missiles of the 1970s. Like Wernher von Braun and Heinlein himself, Pournelle became a key component in the American right’s fascination with space exploration and its possibilities for raining destruction from orbit on America’s enemies.29 Later in life, Pournelle found it charming to describe his politics as “somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan.” His extremist worldview and interest in space exploration, high-tech weapons, and science fiction frequently gelled. His tales bristled with space marines and futuristic versions of America’s “technowar.” The line between slaughtering monstrous humanoids in space and the American imperial adventure dissolved in his coauthorship of the textbook The Strategy of Technology. Used in courses at West Point, the volume declared that “3 megatons of small nuclear bombs” would be enough to win the Vietnam War.30 Pournelle and Heinlein continued to believe the Vietnam War could be won by turning soldiers and marines into starship troopers and using futuristic weapons of annihilation. The development of the neutron bomb became important to both writers, a weapon often described in the popular press, using tones of fear or wonder, as “a death ray.” The low-yield weapon explodes radiation into the air, killing people while doing minimal damage to physical structures or vehicles. Deployed as tactical weapons on the battlefield, they would have a devastating effect, neutrons eating human tissue like vermin swarming in a dumpster. Pournelle, in a later incarnation as a military strategist and advisor in the Reagan administration, played a role in the effort to deploy such weapons in Europe in the 1980s. Americans should have been appalled that genre writers of sci-fi fiction horror fantasies helped create the Pershing II missile crisis, an extraordinarily dangerous Cold War moment when the placement of these medium-range nuclear devices and aggressive U.S. “war games” in Europe convinced the Soviets that Reagan planned a preemptive strike. But, given the secrecy long surrounding American foreign policy, the public had no clue how close they came to the “null zone.” Pournelle remerged in the twenty-first century as an advocate for the Ballistic Missile Defense System fantasies of the second Bush administration. As late as 2010, he praised the neutron bomb for its ability to keep the “Red hordes” at bay.31 The willingness to see the war in Southeast Asia as a testing ground for the most hideous weapons of empire explains the massive number of civilian casualties in that long war. The counterculture became inexplicably enraptured with Heinlein’s solipsistic fantasy Stranger in a Strange Land, while he and his protégés wondered why the United States didn’t simply eliminate “the bugs” that resisted the American invasion. Perhaps Charles Manson had really understood Heinlein’s message of “disincorporating” one’s enemies. Kill the bugs, kill the piggies, do something witchy. Several generations of sci-fi warriors who lived their fantasies of killing monsters in print must have been pleased that so many of America’s leaders shared their views, into and beyond the Vietnam War. In fact, one administration after another indulged in the right wing of science fiction’s militarist fantasies when encountering threats to the extension of American power. If we had atomic weapons, why not use them again? Truman pondered their lethal application in Korea. Then, in 1954, Eisenhower considered their use against North Vietnam. Even before Vietnam became unwinnable, the Pentagon Papers revealed the National Security Council placed nuclear weapons on the table. In 1968, William Westmoreland, head of all military operations in Southeast Asia, recommended nuking much of East Asia as the fighting, and public opinion at home, began to turn against the war effort. In fact, even after the war ended, Westmoreland lamented that politicians refused to employ “small tactical nuclear weapons” in order to “tell Hanoi something.”32 The Vietnam War, an issue in American life for nearly a decade, threw its murderous shadow over the history of American horror. Many of the phantasmagoric forms that have haunted the country for the last fifty years came to unnatural life in the jungles of Vietnam. Generals and politicians, the real ones and the Archie Bunkers in their armchairs at home, engaged in an orgy of mythic thinking about the war empire lost. For some, these legends took the form of very literal monsters. 7.Empire’s Missing Links IN THE summer of 1966, marines of First Force Recon Company set out to build a helicopter landing pad in South Vietnam’s Quang Tri Province, one of the most contested regions of the war. Part of a larger effort dubbed Operation Prairie, First Recon began a “reconnaissance in force” to patrol for NLF soldiers (National Liberation Front, better known in American parlance as the Viet Cong or VC). While working on the landing zone near a hill they called “the Rock Pile,” the official report notes that the platoon encountered “some playful rock apes” that “engaged in some rock tossing contests with the Marines.” Supposedly this high-spirited encounter continued until a surprise attack by the NLF halted work on the helipad and resulted in a deadly firefight.33 “Rock apes” could be so casually mentioned in an after-action report because the existence of such creatures had become part of the everyday chatter among troops in Vietnam. Most soldiers in Vietnam probably knew they were part of the native fauna, either gibbons or a red-shanked monkey called the douc (some reports of rock apes insist they had red hair). Gibbons in particular chilled numerous American marines and soldiers with their unearthly screams, banshees in the jungle night. In remembering strange experiences of the war, sometimes a decade or two later, some veterans found that the rock apes took on a much more monstrous form. Marine Anthony Goodrich recalled “it was so damn dark in the jungle” that “rock apes” had an easy time moving around and terrifying patrols. Goodrich even awoke one night thinking a fellow marine had shaken him out of sleep to take his watch, to find a rock ape “about three feet high” sitting on his chest. His screaming woke his entire platoon, who later ribbed him about the incident. Goodrich told an interviewer he had heard about these creatures since his arrival in Vietnam but at first believed they were, in his words, “old wives’ tales.” He then claims he learned that they were “brought south” by the North Vietnamese, essentially becoming weaponized monsters for the communist cause.34 The supernatural “jungle people” appeared suddenly, using tactics not dissimilar from the ambuscades of NLF fighters. The commonalities seemed so obvious to American troops that many rock ape anecdotes told during the war concerned soldiers certain they had been set upon by VC only to express relief upon finding a terrifying cryptid. These stories often took on an even more sinister turn with the tales of ma, or phantoms, that inhabited the dense jungle, precisely the regions that the NLF found most effective for launching surprise attacks on American platoon patrols and makeshift bases. Nearly a half century since the end of the Vietnam War, such stories have proliferated. Many of the stories are connected to the beliefs of the Hmong, a discreet ethnic group in Laos and along the Cambodian border with no loyalty to either the South Vietnamese government or the promises of communism. The CIA saw them as the perfect instrument for counterinsurgency operations. Supposedly, the Hmong passed the tale of jungle phantoms or jungle people on to American CIA agents, special forces, and mercenaries. In more recent retellings, “locals” told marines about the “reanimated corpses” who lived in the jungles. Military.com, a site dedicated to news of interest to veterans and a clearinghouse for information on VA benefits, ran a spring 2019 story about Vietnam’s “ghouls of the jungle,” which insists that American troops “began reporting ghostly figures moving supernaturally through the trees.” Meanwhile, it claims, “others reported fanged creatures with black eyes.” Bizarrely, the article ends by claiming the walking dead could move about in the day because “the triple canopy jungle” kept the sun out and is “the real reason the military developed Agent Orange and napalm.”35 Stories of phantoms in the jungle, like the encounters with cryptid rock apes, may have been a function of memory and amnesia, the delicate process of forgetfulness that plays an integral role in the trauma of war. An adult male gibbon moving through the high trees at night would certainly seem a monstrous phantom to nervous, watchful soldiers. Getting spooked by a monkey would be cause for laughter and relief if the other option involved a grenade tossed out of the steaming darkness or the explosive rattle of an AK-47. Platoon jokes quickly became legend in the retelling. Certainly, there’s no evidence of the existence of rock apes. The memory of them as communist-controlled monsters owes more to the mad scientist/malignant magician films of the Vietnam veteran’s childhood than reality. The real missing link here may be how modern memory of the rock ape connects to the catastrophic use of chemical warfare. By the end of the Vietnam War the United States had dropped more than four hundred thousand pounds of napalm on the Vietnamese people. This represented four times the amount used against Japan in the “terror bombings” that Curtis LeMay admitted had been so egregious that “if we’d lost the war, we’d all have been prosecuted as war criminals.” This fact helps explain why a respected veterans’ site might venture the claim that the use of chemical defoliants, defoliants of plants and humans, may have cleared the jungle of monsters.36 These fanciful creatures provided a way to talk, perhaps half-seriously at times, about the mad science practiced in Vietnam. Telling a story about fanged ghouls with black eyes doesn’t unsettle as much as a viciously burning jelly dropped on civilians and combatants, leaving them forever scarred. A mythic creature hiding in the dark seems charming in comparison to the dumping of tons of a defoliant that had long-range consequences for American soldiers as well as the people and ecosystem of Vietnam. But monsters contain multitudes and seldom have a univocal meaning. Stories of a creature intertwined with America’s guilt and shame over Vietnam, and the near impossibility of negotiating the meaning of the conflict, helped make a monster. These cryptid legends from the battlefield prepared the way for the belief, still making the rounds among cryptid enthusiasts in the 2020s, that the monsters of Vietnam, as in Konga, made their way back to the homeland of the empire. Ken Gerhard, a self-described cryptozoologist who has had an enormously successful career talking about everything from Bigfoot to werewolves on numerous basic cable networks, believes that at least one of the rock apes of Vietnam came home to America. He was, Gerhard claims, shipped home by a former air force pilot in 1965 “using a body bag.” Gerhard appeared in the 2019 Travel Channel series In Search of Monsters, which asked, “Is it possible that one of the monsters of Vietnam made it to North America?” Gerhard makes his claim based on the bizarre tale of the Minnesota Iceman, a complicated fable of an air force veteran, a sideshow act, the CIA’s connection to the heroin trade, and even the Smithsonian Institution. It’s a tale that reveals much about the interrelationship of horror and empire, how a monster story acts as a cover story for some of the stranger covert ops of the Cold War. 8.The Creature in a Grave of Ice!! THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN (1957) featured Peter Cushing as a cryptid hunter at the roof of the world. Cushing soon earned much more fame for his roles as Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein in Hammer studio’s now classic reboots. But this film, released in the United States as The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, transmogrified over the years into a cult classic, portions of it even influencing the cult indie film The Blair Witch Project (1999). The film drew on contemporary fascination with both Bigfoot and the Yeti. It also drilled into a vein of geopolitical weirdness that intertwined monster tales, espionage, and American imperial adventurism. Retired air force veteran Frank D. Hansen unwittingly helped foment this strange corner of the historical meaning of Vietnam. In 1967 he began exhibiting an ape-like creature encased in ice at carnivals, shopping centers, and supermarket parking lots. Hansen previously made extra cash on the county fair circuit showing off antique tractors, including “the world’s oldest John Deere,” which proved especially popular among Midwestern farm equipment enthusiasts. But nothing he ever exhibited became as popular as the thing soon christened the Minnesota Iceman. Hansen’s scam might have remained just a popular regional sideshow attraction. Unfortunately for him, he attracted the attention of two fringe zoologists, Bernard Heuvelmans and Ivan T. Sanderson. Heuvelmans, known for a combination of encyclopedic research and jaw-dropping leaps in logic, may have coined the term cryptozoology. His lifelong love of Jules Verne and the 1925 classic film The Lost World made him playfully open to all manner of wondrous, and highly dubious, claims. In 1948, he encountered a decidedly unscientific article by Sanderson in the Saturday Evening Post entitled “There Could Be Dinosaurs.” He soon wrote On the Track of Unknown Animals, which, in a stroke of luck, appeared about two years before the first supposed sightings of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. Sanderson himself had been a popular nature writer who found a much larger audience for “unexplained phenomenon” in the wake of the ’47 summer of the flying saucers. His alliance with Heuvelmans emerged when their mutual admiration society found funding from the exquisitely named Texas oilman Tom Slick. Slick, who had already footed the bill for several expeditions searching for the Abominable Snowman in the Himalayas, freely dispensed cash to the Sanderson-Heuvelmans research team until his death in 1962.37 The pair, no longer having the financing of the Texas oil industry to go Yeti-hunting in Nepal, looked for mystery closer to home. Hansen seems to have believed, at first, that the cryptid hunters’ interest in his iceman could increase the popularity of his creature already touring much of the Midwest and occasionally as far south as Louisiana. He did insist that Sanderson and Heuvelmans neither open the glass case nor shatter the ice that held his creature. Obviously, this failed to offer anything like the conditions required for empirical research. Nevertheless, both men wrote extensive papers on their limited observations that provided pages of information on the “morphology” of the form they could barely see beneath Hansen’s sideshow trappings. Sanderson and Heuvelmans bought into the idea that the specimen represented a lost human ancestor that continued to live in the remote regions of the world. Sanderson’s writing on the subject would appear, not in scientific journals, but rather in science fiction and “men’s magazines” such as Argosy, for which Sanderson served as “science editor.” Heuvelmans published a book that claimed Hansen had an example of a Neanderthal man, living contemporaneously with humans. And that it had come to America from Vietnam. The origins of the Minnesota Iceman provoked so much speculation because Hansen himself told three different and utterly conflicting stories about how he came into possession of the specimen. In the most elaborate narrative, a Japanese whaling ship discovered the creature blocked in ice and floating in the frigid waters off Kamchatka. Somehow “Red China” ended up with the specimen and, just as mysteriously, the creature found its way to Hansen through “a Chinese gentleman of British nationality” in Hong Kong. In this iteration of the tale, Hansen had pulled off some Cold War cryptid espionage and managed to wrest the monsters from “the reds.” This seems to have been the story he told of the creature’s origins at the 1967 Minnesota State Fair. Hansen presented the alleged creature to patrons in its “grave of ice” according to the August 10 Ironwood Daily Globe. Other attractions on offer included “Big Willie, the world’s largest alligator” and an invitation to “Take the Trip the Hippies Take,” a drug-free psychedelic light show that offered anodyne thrills to the squares. Sometimes Hansen suggested he had possession of the creature after its purchase by a “Hollywood millionaire.” This second version of the story simply suggested that an unnamed benefactor who collected oddities owned the icebound monster but, for reasons never explained, allowed Hansen to tour the county fairs with a missing link in human evolution. The unlikely tale spread that this mysterious Hollywood patron was none other than James Stewart, a rumor that Hansen encouraged. Stewart had been a combat pilot, like Hanson, though during World War II. But there may have been a much better reason why the star of It’s a Wonderful Life and some of Hitchcock’s most chilling thrillers found his way into the tale of the Minnesota Iceman. A decade earlier, Stewart played a decidedly weird role in the story of the Pangboche hand. A cryptid hunter named Peter Byrne, financed by Tom Slick, had discovered an alleged “hand of the Yeti” at a Buddhist monastery in Pangboche, Nepal, in 1957. Formerly isolated, the monastery attracted paying tourists for its supposed Yeti relics in the fifties, particularly after Edmund Hillary’s successful ascent of nearby Mount Everest in 1953. Finding the monks unwilling to part with the attraction, Byrne returned in 1959 and, after getting the monk standing watch thoroughly plastered, stole one finger from the object. He then replaced it with a human finger that he handily (sorry) brought along. There’s obvious speculation about where he found a detached human digit. In all likelihood, he snapped it off one of the hundred or so frozen corpses of dead climbers that have proliferated on the Himalayas since the early twentieth century, bodies fellow climbers have been unable to bury or remove because of weather conditions and logistics. Given that customs agents tend to frown on the export of human remains in a carry-on bag, Slick contacted Stewart, vacationing with his wife, Gloria, in Calcutta. Stewart long held a fascination with natural history and readily agreed to help. Gloria stuffed the finger in her lingerie bag and, as Slick expected, no one rummaged through the celebrity’s luggage. Told and retold, the true story of Stewart’s adventure in extractive tourism only helped the prospects of Hansen’s sideshow.38 As the Minnesota Iceman gained more attention, Hansen came to prefer a story that he perhaps saw as unfalsifiable. He attempted to make canonical the tale that he himself shot the creature while hunting in Minnesota and encased it in a block of ice and a glass canister to preserve it. Heuvelmans wanted a more interesting and perhaps timelier story, and so he looked to Southeast Asia. 9.Drugs, Cryptids, and Covert Ops THE MINNESOTA Iceman becoming entangled in the story of the CIA’s secret war in Laos may seem a bizarre coincidence. But, in fact, cryptid hunting and covert ops often had an intertwined history. Author Colin Dickey discovered that a surprising number of Yeti hunters in the fifties and sixties had some link to various intelligence agencies, so much so that he writes, “the hunt for the Yeti was inescapably tied to Cold War politics.” The Soviet Union thought the same. The state-run newspaper Izvestia claimed that the hunt for the snowmen masked an effort at “the subversion of Communist China.” The New York Times reporter who wrote about this could barely contain their sarcasm about the Kremlin’s apparent nervousness over Tom Slick’s interest in the “abominable snowman.”39 But the Soviets had been right. In 1965, mountaineers connected to U.S. intelligence attempted to set up a sensor on a Himalayan peak, without the knowledge of the Nepalese government, that allowed surveillance of Chinese atomic capabilities. The Kremlin likely suspected a less paranormal reason for the expeditions since the CIA used a hunt for Noah’s Ark along the Turkish-Soviet border to gather photographic intelligence as early as 1949.40 Heuvelmans needed a story better than Yeti fingers hidden in Gloria Stewart’s underwear. His book Neanderthal: The Strange Saga of the Minnesota Iceman, first published in 1974, provided the background for Ken Gerhard’s claim that “body bags” had been used to bring a monster from Vietnam. While admitting that his narrative was in part “based on conjecture,” this rather enormous caveat did not prevent Heuvelmans from strongly affirming that Hansen located the “bizarre hairy man” in Southeast Asia. In this telling, Hansen probably had no idea of the scientific discovery he made but saw financial profit in the specimen. So he arranged for the thing encased in ice to return to the States in a body bag. “What better place to hide a corpse,” Heuvelmans has Hansen reason, “than in a container normally used to carry corpses?”41 In hopes of buttressing this claim, Heuvelmans told a story that readers might find as bizarre as that of the iceman. He insisted that nearly anything could make its way from the major airport of Da Nang to California. How? He explained a large drug-trafficking operation the CIA and the U.S. military carried out to fund pro-American insurgencies in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This of course sounds a bit like a theory in need of a tinfoil hat for its parturition. Unfortunately, the story of the drug trafficking by the United States during the Vietnam war is true.42 In 1971, The Washington Post reported that the CIA had long denied any knowledge of drug trafficking in Vietnam and neighboring regions. However, the article showed the CIA armed and trained tribal groups like the Hmong who grew opium, necessary to produce heroin. The agency also made convenient deals with leaders of the Hmong. One of these warlords, General Vang Pao, convinced the CIA to build an airstrip that allowed the transport of refined heroin. By 1972, 70 percent of the world’s opium came from the region on the Thai, Myanmar, and Laotian border where the Hmong and the CIA worked together against the red menace.43 There’s little evidence that Air America, the name for the CIA’s airlift projects in South Asia, directly facilitated large-scale shipments of heroin to the United States. Nor did CIA agents directly engage in the distribution and sale of the drug, or at least no reliable evidence has appeared to prove such a thing. But the fact that the CIA facilitated the trade remains indisputable. Although often considered a false conspiracy theory of the left, even the CIA’s official examination of the issue admitted that while there was an “unequivocal” restriction on large packages of opium, it remained possible that smaller amounts had been shipped by CIA contractors. The agency preferred to allow assets like General Pao to move drugs in complicated schemes for the funding of counterinsurgency groups, a pattern that would become increasingly common, and insidious, in the coming decades, showing up in the Rube Goldberg machine Oliver North built to fund the Contras in the 1980s. Heuvelmans discusses the close involvement of the CIA and the heroin trade only because of his interest in how an alleged monster made its way to America. He makes it clear that he could not care less about how the American empire used heroin as a leveraging tool with local clients in its expansive South Asian war. What he calls the “scientific Watergate” that led to a lack of interest in his Neanderthal man represented for him the real scandal. After the kerfuffle raised by Sanderson and Heuvelmans over the iceman, Hansen became very nervous. Heuvelmans made the claim, even before the publication of his book, that Hansen illegally obtained a new link in human evolution that still survived in isolated parts of the globe. The claim interested a skeptical John R. Napier, a primatologist with the Smithsonian Institution, who sought to examine the specimen for himself. Hansen tired of the attention and probably knew his iceman would soon be revealed as a fraud. He allowed Napier to examine what he called “a latex model” of the iceman and said that he would no longer display the original for fear it would become damaged. The public lost interest and the Smithsonian concluded that the only version they had been allowed to see of the monster from Vietnam had been a work of special effects. The Minnesota Iceman dropped, for a time, out of public memory until a revival of interest in cryptids in the early twenty-first century.44 Hansen’s family sold the latex model on eBay in 2013. Hansen’s iceman, once connected to both the body bags of the war dead and shadowy covert operations throughout Southeast Asia, can be viewed today at the Museum of the Weird in Austin, Texas. However, a version of Heuvelmans’s strange saga of the connection between the rock apes of Vietnam and the Minnesota Iceman has appeared in every iteration of the story on basic cable’s popular cryptid-hunter shows into the 2020s. 10.They Own the Night A SIGNIFICANT part of the American memory of Vietnam concerns homecomings, or more precisely the homecoming gone sour. Numerous legends, which often became widely and deeply held beliefs, cluster around the warrior who fails to come home. It’s nearly impossible not to see such stories as grassroots metaphor manufacturing, stories that simplify or reimagine the complexities of a lost war. Monsters with their origin in Vietnam, predators in the Mekong delta’s rice fields, that made their way to America comported with how Americans saw the Vietnamese people. Increasingly, Americans told stories about the horror of Vietnam that ignored American culpability in the catastrophe and shifted the focus to unexplained creatures and ghost stories, a haunted ride on the midway of the country’s dark carnival. In 2018, a University of Notre Dame alumnus posted on the university’s class of 1969 blog about a strange night in 1967. Domer Costantini worked that summer for a construction company, “grueling” work that he describes as leaving him physically and mentally exhausted. On a hot July evening, he made his way from the work site to his parents’ home in the Bronx. Costantini regularly passed Gleason’s Funeral Home in the half-mile walk from the subway to his family’s apartment, and on this night, he saw an old high school friend he had not seen for two years, Gerald L. Fox, known to everyone in the neighborhood as Jerry. The “solitary figure” lingered in front of the mortuary and seemed to want to talk, but a weary Costantini begged off and offered a plan to meet up with his school chum another time. He arrived home to learn from his mother that Fox died in a firefight on July 12, 1967. The funeral would be held the following day at Gleason’s. Rational explanations for Costantini’s experience are probably obvious to the reader. He was tired, he saw a friend who reminded him of Jerry, and he probably did not learn of his death that night. But fifty years of misremembering corrupted the timeline, and his very real grief over Jerry’s death created a very genuine haunting. When Costantini attempted to recall the events half a century after they occurred, what came to his mind was his unwillingness to greet his friend, to welcome him home. He would write in 2018, “Who was I and what am I to have shunned an American hero?” Costantini became so invested in the tale that he and his wife traveled to Vietnam, and he wears a wristband that reads “PFC Gerald L. Fox / US 12 Jul 67.” Monster tales can become personal expressions of grief rooted in the many sorrows of empire.45 Point Pleasant, West Virginia, is a tiny Ohio Valley town near a major tributary of the Kanawha River with a population of less than five thousand people. Its Main Street stores shuttered early in the 1960s. At that time, its only claim to fame seems to have been an 1805 house-raising during which a falling log killed Mark Twain’s grandfather. No significant tourist industry seemed likely to germinate from this anecdote. Point Pleasant remained a sleepy hamlet even as residents worried over news of the escalating war in Vietnam, the growing strength of the anti-war movement, and the freedom struggle led by Black Americans demanding economic rights as well as the ballot. But these things appeared to many residents of the isolated town like news from another world. Soon enough, other worlds seemed to swirl around them. On November 16, 1966, the Pittsburgh Press reported that a couple driving near the town was chased “by a birdlike creature” with “red eyes.” On November 27, 1966, a teenager saw “a huge gray figure” that she estimated as being six to seven feet tall with “large, round, fiercely glowing red eyes that focused on her with hypnotic effect.” She watched in horror as “a pair of wings unfolded from its back.”46 UFO enthusiasts and cryptid hunters proved quick to see the Mothman sightings wrapped in our deadly embrace of the Vietnam War. At the time of the sightings, the Pentagon deployed more than two hundred thousand American troops in Vietnam, with former vice president and soon to become presidential candidate Richard Nixon calling for five hundred thousand. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara worried that although the enemy seemed to suffer casualties beyond counting, “there is no sign of a break in enemy morale . . . in the countryside the enemy almost completely controls the night.”47 Did something else control the night? John A. Keel certainly thought so, claiming in his enormously popular book The Mothman Prophecies that numerous UFO sightings had occurred in Southeast Asia in 1966 to 1967. He quoted PFC Earl Morrison, who claimed he and two buddies saw “what looked like wings, like a bat’s, only it was gigantic” near Da Nang. The figure gave off an unearthly greenish hue, though the soldiers claimed its nude body was obsidian. The creature then began flapping its wings and rose into the air. The whole experience, Morrison remembered, lasted “three or four minutes.” Private Morrison’s sighting may have been especially detailed but was frequently repeated in more general terms regarding UFOs, bright lights, and sometimes “enemy helicopters” that neither the North Vietnamese army or the NLF could have accessed. Pete Mazzola, a soldier who later founded a UFOlogy institute, claimed to see “bright objects” appear over rice fields when guerillas pinned down his patrol with heavy fire. Similar reports occurred until the end of the war. Why did soldiers need these stories? On one level, they are hazy incidents occurring in the fog of battle, interpreted according to the flying saucer films and creature features of the soldier’s childhood. A few cases may have been sightings of secretive missions by the CIA either into Laos and Cambodia or the agency’s shadowy Project Phoenix. The tortured memory and the political upheaval caused by defeat in the Vietnam War are more essential to the spread and interest in these stories than the easily explained sightings. The real conspiracies that the citizens of a democracy should speak out about, such as the CIA’s involvement in drug trafficking, become explanations for how a hairy beast could have been transported home from Vietnam. The black helicopters of conspiracy fantasy are reason to distrust the government but not the use of chemical weapons or the murder and maiming of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the most extensive bombing campaign in modern history. In the case of the Vietnam War, the language of monsters hides, rather than reveals, the real horrors of history. Horror films and racism continued as boon companions even as George A. Romero changed the politics of monsters. A new wave of Fu Manchu films became popular in Britain and the United States, helmed by Hammer horror star Christopher Lee as the dastardly mastermind. In precisely the years when the Vietnam War escalated, 1965 to 1969, Lee appeared in no less than five stories of the Asian crime lord in forgettable but popular flicks like The Vengeance of Fu Manchu and The Brides of Fu Manchu. The “Asiatic hordes” continued to batter down the doors of the Western world, if only in the fevered imagination of the American empire. 11.The Ghost of a Previous Nightmare THE UNITED States saw itself under siege even as it projected military and economic power around the globe. In February of 1962, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, formerly an executive with the Ford Motor Company, warned Americans not only that their government called on them to support an apocalyptic arms race, but also that they needed to support wars that are “often not wars at all.” This peculiar admonition, to support a thing that’s not really the thing you think it is, grew from the Kennedy administration’s concern about Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev’s verbal and often material support for “wars of liberation” in the former colonial, or in some cases newly colonized, world.48 When is a war not really a war? McNamara forcefully, if at the time mysteriously, stated his case by talking of a shadow realm in which “the force of world communism operates in the twilight zone between political subversion and quasi-military action.” Of course, the United States in its role as protector of world capitalism operated in this same murky dimension for much of the twentieth century, so murky that many Americans didn’t even know it. McNamara wanted to evoke his boss’s memorable inauguration speech of 1960 when he imagined the Cold War as a “long twilight struggle.” But the phrase the twilight zone had another meaning for many in 1962. Rod Serling had become a successful television writer by the time he invited Americans to ponder their fears, and their politics, in the twilight zone. But Serling was intensely frustrated. In an interview with the young, hard-charging reporter Mike Wallace, Serling complained about constantly having to “battle sponsors and agencies.” Thinking in part of the soporific the network had made of A Town Has Turned to Dust, he told Wallace he didn’t want “to compromise all the time, which in essence is what the television writer does if he wants to put on controversial themes.” Serling also once wrote a political drama for television titled Playhouse 90, but sponsors did not allow his senators to discuss politics, party affiliation, or any current issue. He later noted that “in retrospect, I probably would have had a much more adult play had I made it science fiction, put it in the year 2057, and peopled the Senate with robots.” In other words, if he’d “had a Martian say it.”49 Critics called Serling “television’s angry young man” even before his relentless pasquinades of American society. His daughter Jodi Serling remembers the anger but said it never came from “conceit,” calling her father “a gentle, kind man.” He had, she said, returned from the war “broken . . . He had to start a whole new life, and he used writing as a form of therapy.” His therapy became a conversation with American ideals revealing their true face, seen in his worry over America’s romance with the atom, the possibility that these weapons would not only destroy democracy but create an extinction event.50 Serling’s concerns went beyond the obvious issue of America’s world-ending weapons. Could democracy survive in a militarized state? What happened to freedom of speech and basic ideals of identity in a society that built its foreign policy around bases and bombs, client states and conquest? Could America be great or even good when it appeared the empire might swallow the nation? These anxieties run through every season of The Twilight Zone. The fascism Serling wanted to fight as a high school kid could happen here. Maybe it had already begun. In episodes like “The Obsolete Man,” Serling asked if any element of the First Amendment could survive in a militarized society. Although the episode is sometimes read as an indictment of Stalinism or totalitarianism more generally, Serling’s experiences with the soft censorship of capitalism made him particularly critical of any efforts to limit the spread of ideas in his country. The Twilight Zone did not completely escape the stealth campaign of American censorship. Ratings behemoths like Leave It to Beaver and Gunsmoke dominated the television landscape, while The Twilight Zone appeared Friday nights at 10:00 p.m., late-night TV in the early sixties. The odd hour and some of the themes prevented Serling’s masterpiece from even coming close to the top-rated shows in audience share. But, running for five seasons, Serling’s peculiar TV show created what we today call a cult following, and a very devoted cult at that. Fan clubs of the show, most of them made up of adolescents or college students, emerged around the country. Nevertheless, CBS executives consistently worried about the show’s content, its ratings, and its budget. Serling pressed on, sometimes creating alternate Americas that looked all too familiar. “The Obsolete Man” reads as so heavy-handed today that viewers, just like those in 1961, could easily identify the good guy versus the evil state. At times, Serling wrote or adapted tales for TV that showed the more subtle seductions of fascism. In “He’s Alive”—an homage to the horror tradition’s frequent use of Frankenstein’s moment of “It’s alive!”—Serling introduces us to what he calls “a bush-league Führer” played by Dennis Hopper. He cannot get his fellow Americans to listen to his bile until he’s visited by the the “ghost of a previous nightmare,” the shade of Hitler himself. In the closing monologue, Serling asks his audience to directly ponder the episode’s message. Remember . . . when he comes to your town. Remember it when you hear his voice speaking out through others. Remember it when you hear a name called, a minority attacked, any blind, unreasoning assault on a people or any human being. He’s alive because through these things we keep him alive. But could Serling’s viewers remember this wisdom in a country terrified of outside menace and willing to make a totem of their weapons of mass destruction? As Serling’s Twilight Zone completed its fifth and final season in 1964, the United States intervened and sometimes established a permanent occupation force in countries most Americans could not locate on a map. In January 1964, The Twilight Zone did not appear in CBS’s announcement of its fall schedule and Serling publicly expressed doubt that the show could survive. It did not. Efforts to re-create the show as Rod Serling’s Wax Museum came to nothing, largely because Serling would not do a show that failed to use science fiction and horror for the purpose of social criticism. He loudly complained that everyone from his agents to studio executives wanted him “stuck in a graveyard every week” to introduce a television version of “C-movies.” Serling didn’t need a television vehicle for social criticism. He found the Vietnam War deplorable and spoke out strongly against it in language that much of white, mainstream America found extreme. In December of 1968, Serling delivered a speech to students at Moorpark College in California. Even before he delivered his remarks, he stirred up controversy. The college’s conservative administration demanded that all official campus lecturers sign a loyalty oath to the United States. Serling took umbrage at this, saying that he had already taken an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic when he fought in the Second World War. His body still ached from the wounds he’d received for his country. He held to the conviction that repeated declarations of loyalty to the state cleared the way for fascism. Serling did not sign the oath but the students wanted to hear him anyway, so he gave an informal talk to hundreds of undergraduates without the college’s approval (and without a speaker’s fee). In it, he briefly excoriated the idea of loyalty oaths, comparing them to demands made on citizens in fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. While critiquing the new fascism, Serling took the opportunity to address police brutality, very much on the minds of the sixties generation after the 1968 Democratic National Convention the previous summer when Mayor Richard J. Daley unleashed the police in a wave of violence against anti-war protestors. Serling dismissed the idea that the protestors offered provocation since, he strenuously argued, no possible provocation existed for a “representative of law and order wading in with a billy club under the pretense of saving the sovereign city of Chicago.” Serling went further. Aware that police riots against white students received far more attention than the history of violence against Black people, he scorned the use of law and order in politics, saying it amounted to “a battle slogan.” Nixon and his creatures used the phrase in the ’68 presidential election as a code, assuring white Americans that civil rights legislation did not mean an end to systemic racism enforced with real and threatened violence. Serling noted that “law and order” seemed important only when used as a rhetorical tool. Where, he demanded to know, had the crusaders of law and order been when “four little Negro girls were bombed to pieces in a Birmingham church” or “when three young civil rights workers were slaughtered in Mississippi.” What about a call for law and order during “the bombing of over a hundred churches in the south in the past five years”? Given this, he bluntly asserted in terms that have contemporary application, “It’s hardly a revelation to me that the young people in this country take a dim view of our current uptightness when it comes to street rioting . . . on the scale of misbehavior, the black man who takes a torch to a building or breaks a window to loot, and does so out of passion, is less the criminal than the white man who puts his torch to human beings . . .” In the very same speech, Serling asserted that, even as public opinion began to turn against America’s invasion of Vietnam, few understood or accepted the real meaning of the war. Rather than protecting South Vietnam from the unprovoked aggression of the North, we had allowed “twenty-thousand dead American boys” while “half a million civilians [were put] to a torch” to interfere with a civil war in which the United States sided with a corrupt regime that did not have the support of the people. “So,” he wondered aloud, “what, indeed, are we defending there?”51 Serling died in June of 1975 following coronary bypass surgery. His family had a history of heart irregularities, in Serling’s case exacerbated by smoking as many as four packs of cigarettes a day since World War II. At the time of his death, he suffered with depression, despite some very significant and critically acclaimed writing done for an off-kilter western called The Loner and his newest TV series, Night Gallery. He felt that, as studio execs tried to make Night Gallery competitive with the hugely popular detective series Mannix, social content had given way to “the need for producing simple and unconvincing frights.” Meanwhile, he often commented that while The Twilight Zone had been a mixed bag of excellent, good, bad, and terrible episodes, he also thought it the most politically relevant work of his career. Yet, he doubted it would survive in American memory. He could not have been more wrong. The memory and increasing relevance of Serling’s work entwined with the hopes and anxieties of a new generation of filmmakers like George A. Romero. Like Rod Serling, they did not want to simply “hang out in a graveyard” and raise some ghouls for suspense. A new generation of filmmakers wanted to comment, to make statements, to make important films. A new breaker of horror washed over America, a bleak and chilled wave inundating late-twentieth-century America’s imperial dream. A backlash against this critique would also wash over the American landscape, at times seeming to carry all before it. 12.Bats Leaving, Virgins Bleeding BELA LUGOSI last played Dracula on the silver screen for giggles in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). The forties served Lugosi manifold frustrations, even for a film career hobbled since before World War II. In one of his final films with Boris Karloff, Black Friday (1940), Lugosi played an unconvincing crime boss. He had so little screen time that he could almost be considered an extra. In the following decade, his career cratered with the low-budget attempt at comedy Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla. A spoof on the mad scientist genre, the film tapped into a new science fiction fascination with gorillas gone wild. The few who saw the film perhaps remembered Lugosi’s Murders in the Rue Morgue. He certainly brought a little bit of the light of a dying star to the flop meant as a vehicle for comedians Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, forgotten celebrities whose act amounted to plagiarism of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis’s shtick. Bela Lugosi died on August 16, 1956. It’s a legend that the seventy-three-year-old asked to be buried in one of his several Dracula capes. But his family believed he would have wanted it so. They laid Lugosi to rest in the cloak of the vampire who stalked his career. The death of Lugosi came at a moment when American horror had undergone a complete transformation. A new sensibility emerged even while flying saucers hovered threateningly and giant mutations rose from their prehistoric sleep as humanity harnessed, and lost control of, the power of the atom. Audiences remained fascinated with such films and even flocked to revivals of the ideas about invasion and infiltration they represented. But American horror changed as the American empire changed. Lugosi’s White Zombie joined the Fu Manchu series in creating for Americans a Manichean world of supernatural villainy, a constant threat to American values. The Red Scare and the growing disaster of Vietnam convinced a significant portion of the American public that infiltrators and enemies lurked everywhere, even though the projection of American military and economic power—inciting coups, propping up dangerous regimes, arming proxy fighters, building a vast network of bases, airfields, and military prisons in client states and colonial possessions—encapsulated the real story of global politics. The sounds of the calliope continued to vibrate menacingly in the darkness as the 1970s began. Like the macabre traveling show of Bradbury’s imagination, things happened in the sightless black of America’s new night. Slasher films reanimated the murderous intent of empire for the big screen. A bizarre, seemingly premodern, obsession with demonic evil rode the backs of a generation. A razor-edged counterstroke by American militarism drowned the dreams of the sixties and seventies in bloody waters.",

The undead menacingly stumble in the tropical night, their frightening cadence moving in disturbing rhythm with the drums from the blind, hot darkness. Not everyone saw its charms. Mocking the film in a July 1932 review, a reviewer for The New York Times snarked that “Necromancers waved their sinister hands from the screen of the Rivoli yesterday and tried to hypnotize blondes into killing their boyfriends. A legion of individuals, with deceased minds but alert bodies, threw butlers into subterranean streams.”1 It may have sounded ludicrous, but the flick had something going for it. Bela Lugosi played Murder Legendre, a sorcerer who knows the secrets of the dead and the undead. His role in the low-budget effort seemed an odd choice for the actor, fresh off the box office bonanza of Dracula. Lugosi’s role in the film may seem inexplicable, but the film’s subject could not have been more relevant. The generation born at the turn of the twentieth century held an enormous interest in Haiti since, by 1932, the United States had occupied the country for seventeen years. The 1915 invasion of Haiti by American troops could have been predicted by anyone who watched the trajectory of American power. Haiti seemed predestined to attract American attention. After its revolution in the 1790s, it became the first republic of African peoples in the new world. This meant, as historian Raphael Dalleo wrote in his book American Imperialism’s Undead, that “Haiti represented the idea that black people could be agents of world history.” White America, North and South, trembled at Haiti’s example during the antebellum slave regime. Following the Civil War, as slavery ended but segregation took its place, Haiti remained a bothersome symbol to a country whose mainstream politicians regularly and openly spoke of America as “a white man’s country.”2 Although the very existence of Haiti rankled many Americans, other variables ultimately led to the invasion and occupation. The administration of Woodrow Wilson agreed with American corporate interests that the island, long closed to the incursion of the American market, had to be seized. U.S. corporate interests shuddered at a provision in the Haitian constitution forbidding foreigners from owning land, an assertion of independence galling to the values of global piracy. The City Bank of New York, now the financial conglomerate Citigroup, demanded the deletion of this provision to facilitate the building of a railroad. The U.S. Marines promptly expropriated the land of farmers, and much of Haiti became a plantation economy in the 1920s.3 White Zombie probed Americans’ fears about Haiti and legitimated them. The long-suffering country became a world of sorcery and superstition during the occupation. The best-selling 1929 book The Magic Island by William Seabrook described the mélange of African, Arawak, and European traditions called Vodun (or “spirit” in the African Fon and Ewe languages) as a wicked necromancy that demanded the drinking of blood and resurrected the dead as shambling zombies. In 1927, the forty-three-year-old Seabrook had published a tale of his travels in the Middle East that emphasized the allegedly exotic and uncanny nature of the region carved up by Britain, France, and the United States after the Great War. He went to Haiti to do some similar ideological work, at times criticizing the attitudes of Marine officers but also emphasizing the alleged “economic prosperity and political peace” brought by “our own benevolent American protectorate.” The supposedly wicked nature of Vodun ultimately justified the American seizure of the island. Although his attitudes about the tradition are complicated (he could describe the “beauty” of a Vodun ceremony), Seabrook ultimately decided to use adjectives like monstrous, obscene, or forbidding to seduce the American reader eager to hear of a black magic island. Haiti as a country dominated by “voodoo” quickly became a standard part of the American horror tradition. Readers of horror pulps such as Weird Tales, best-known today as the outlet for the work of H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, encountered stories like the December 1924 tale “Voodoo.” Written by Arthur J. Burks, a marine during the early part of the occupation, the story reads like a fictional travelogue in which an American soldier rescues his buddy from “a devilish ceremony.” Burks’s version of Vodun did not include zombies but described other diabolical features like “a priestess of the serpent” planning to sacrifice a teenaged girl. In August of 1925, Burks wrote another occult tale set in Haiti called “Black Medicine,” which presented the islanders as worshippers of a demonic green serpent.4 The pedigree of White Zombie, like much in the American horror tradition, lay in the emergence of the United States as a postwar global colossus. Frightful and titillating to white audiences, it played to American fascination with the peoples it ruled. It also legitimized that rule by telling white America it had to suppress the evils lurking in the night. White Zombie borrows from themes found in the 1930s golden age of horror. There’s a bit of the “old dark house” concept, only it’s an old dark plantation in the jungle rather than a mansion on a lonely moor suffering through another dark and stormy night. A young couple, Madeleine and Neil, are set to marry in the Caribbean because the hopeful husband works at “the Bank of Port Au Prince,” a notable theme given the role of American banking interests in the invasion of Haiti. The plantation owner desires the bride-to-be and enlists the aid of Legendre the zombie master. Legendre poisons Madeleine on her wedding night only to bring her back as the slave of the plantation owner. Advertising for the film promised audiences that the heroine (played by beauty Madge Bellamy) would have to “perform his every desire.” Sadly, for audiences hoping for salacious material, they only got to see Bellamy play the piano with a thousand-yard stare. Filmed just before the Motion Picture Production Code went into effect, the film does show the audience her compelling figure while wiggling into her trousseau. As native women help with her voluminous undergarments, we see her nearly weep with horror when she hears drums in the night. By today’s standards, the scene is more than modest but certainly offered strong sauce for 1932. The sexual subtext remains throughout and the implications of a white blonde being a physical and mental captive in Haiti are allowed to smolder. In early notices, Lugosi’s eyes and magical grip appear abstracted in a sea of jungle green on a poster that promises “with these zombie eyes he rendered her powerless.” After Madeleine’s undeath, the wronged husband pines away for the return of his blonde, but on learning from a sympathetic missionary that she may have become a zombie and “fallen into the hands of natives,” he drunkenly raves, “not that . . . better death than that!” White Zombie gave viewers all manner of bewildering messages about Haiti. On the one hand, it showed the exploitation of the labor of native peoples. One of the most intriguing set pieces takes place in a sugarcane mill. Zombified workers drudge bundles of cane to the top of a catwalk to drop into the mill’s churning blades. Moving in a stolid trance, the undead look more or less like any set of workers toiling under the burdens of plantation labor . . . or of underpaid, disregarded “free” labor. The film even evokes the history of slavery on the island and the new world more generally. A missionary who befriends the unlucky couple makes the historically dubious claim that the pharmaceutical magic necessary for making a zombie came “from Africa” and, farther back, “civilizations old when Egypt was young.” Americans are lights of civilization and morality. “Haiti is full of nonsense and superstition,” insists the missionary, who wants to defeat Legendre’s plan so that he can bring the light of truth to the island he portrays as lousy with “witch doctors.” White audiences left Lugosi’s new hit with their sense of racial superiority intact. This would have been true whether they walked out of the theater with the ugly racist porn of a white woman captive to native desires on their mind or the sense that the uncivilized native peoples of the world needed America’s help to escape “nonsense and superstition.” In fact, by 1932, Americans had believed this about the Caribbean, Latin America, and much of the Pacific world for decades. 2.Jungle Fever THE UNITED States opened the twentieth century by taking on the decayed Spanish empire in Cuba and annexing the Hawaiian Islands. President William McKinley baldly asserted that that United States needed the latter for a military base. Toppling Spanish control over Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines would create more complex problems. In order to build a new, more fluid imperial style, American leadership developed patterns of rhetoric, control, and explosive violence used throughout the century. Cuban leaders, who fought against Spanish rule for decades, looked uneasily at American occupation forces even as they hoped for the best. They would be deeply disappointed. In 1901, an army appropriations bill in Congress came tainted with poison for Cuban democracy. The Platt Amendment, inserted into the new Cuban constitution at gunpoint, allowed the United States a laundry list of privileges on the enormous island and capped them all by giving the United States the right to intervene in the country’s affairs at any time. Cuba’s economy belonged to American corporations for sixty years and the people would be ruled by a series of dictators selected by the United States.5 The Philippines, an enormous archipelago of nearly eight thousand separate islands, proved more challenging to dominate. After winning freedom from the Spanish, Filipino insurgents continued the fight for years against American forces that refused to end their occupation. American troops killed thousands of Filipino fighters and civilians caught in the crossfire. American forces introduced a torture method later known as waterboarding and even more egregious forms of torture that included pumping seawater into the veins of suspected insurgents. The United States came to rule the Philippines but never annexed it outright and granted the country limited independence in 1946, leaving behind military bases and handpicked pro-American dictators. The brutal experiment in the Philippines allowed American leaders to construct a sense of American nationalism with clear borders while extending economic and military power with a limitless circumference. American leaders at home had their eyes on markets. Moreover, politicians proved less wary of talking in terms of empire than they would later in the twentieth century. President McKinley spoke of a civilizing and Christianizing mission, but in the Senate, Henry Cabot Lodge simply described the need for military bases that would open the promising market of China and “the far East” more generally. White supremacy at home became the justification for intervention abroad. At the beginning of the twentieth century, state laws ignored the Fifteenth Amendment and part of the legacy of the American Civil War by disenfranchising African Americans. Beginning in 1876, accusations of voter fraud became the bludgeon to use against the Black vote. Meanwhile, the country accepted de facto and de jure segregation of all public life and services with the blessing of the Supreme Court. American soldiers in the Philippines used racist epithets with roots in American slavery to describe the islands’ peoples alongside a new phrase with uncertain origin, gugus. Scholars have suggested it’s a mocking term for a language the American invaders did not understand or perhaps a word for sex workers on the islands.6 Gugu became the gruesome word gook, a dehumanizing term that has followed the American flag all over the globe. By 1920, during the occupation of Haiti, a reporter for The Nation noted that American troops called the Haitians this term and treated them “with every variety of contempt, insult, and brutality.” He described how American officers spoke of trips to the island’s interior to, in the marines’ words, “bump off gooks” with comparisons made to duck hunting. The racist term reappeared in the Korean War and, most infamously, the Vietnam War.7 White supremacy at home shaped foreign policy abroad. Though remembered in many American history textbooks as an idealist, Woodrow Wilson took the United States into the Great War, now generally referred to as World War I, with a mission of empire building grounded in his own conception of white supremacy. A Southerner by birth, Wilson famously praised the deeply racist film The Birth of a Nation (1915) and remained a defender of Jim Crow segregation throughout his life. Wilson’s attitude toward African Americans extended not only to Haitians but to the Mexican people as well. The Wilson administration staged several “interventions” and “expeditions” into the nation aflame with revolutionary fervor, allegedly as a “punitive” response to the raids of Pancho Villa along the New Mexico–Texas border. John J. Pershing, who pursued Geronimo in 1886 and savaged the Filipino insurgents, attempted and failed to capture Villa. Two years later, Wilson appointed Pershing to lead American forces in the Great War. Pershing’s careless use of American lives led to catastrophic losses given the United States actively participated in the global war for only a few months. The effects of early American forays into imperial conquest remain with us. Haiti never recovered from its years of occupation and would face future American invasions and occupations. White anger simmered at Mexico and Mexican Americans, a hatred of the conquered by the conqueror. The anger became explosive violence. Lynch mobs terrorized the Tejano community from 1916 into the 1920s. The Texas state government effectively disenfranchised all Latinos through poll taxes, the same method used to take ballots away from African Americans in much of the South. One Texas rancher called for “detention camps along the border” and the building of infrastructure to allow the American military ingress into Mexico. Historian Stephen Hahn estimates that several thousand Tejanos died at the hands of white mobs, the police, and the military in the years after the Pershing invasion.8 Today, the United States maintains a military presence, and allows paramilitary vigilantes to operate, along the border with Mexico, protecting the territory seized from the country in the nineteenth century. In 2019, in Texas alone, the United States held 14,500 people in precisely the kind of concentration camps called for in the 1910s. Despite this legacy, Wilson’s rhetoric about “self-determination” in his “Fourteen Points” (Georges Clemenceau quipped that “The good Lord had only ten!”) burnished his image as an early globalist. Behind the scenes, the American government made clear its real intent. Wilson’s secretary of state, Robert Lansing, insisted that the language of self-determination did not apply to “races, peoples or communities whose state of barbarism or ignorance deprive them of the capacity to choose intelligently their political affiliations.” The lands with “devilish ceremonies” would remain subject to the American world order. White Zombie suggested a horrifying paradox, one that American military and economic power would never allow. The phrase banana republic still makes the rounds, even used since the eighties as the theme for a clothing store catering to youthful, middlebrow tastes. It’s meant to evoke a tropical dictatorship, absurdly corrupt and laughably underdeveloped. While used by most Americans to express disdain for foreign institutions, the phrase first appeared as an epithet for American maleficence in Central America. O. Henry in his 1904 short story “The Admiral” first used the term in relation to Honduras. In that country, the New York/Boston–based United Fruit Company acquired vast lands and ownership of most of the railways and ports. In 1911, the company used its own funds to pay for a coup that installed a dictator more amenable to United Fruit’s neocolonial policy. Zombie republics might be a better descriptor for many of the countries where American corporate and military power exercised control. Stripped of economic resources and moving at the direction of United States–supported puppet dictators, they represented decayed versions of hopes for autonomy and independence, the rotting corpses of colonial states subject to American necromancy. 3.Bombs and Movies GERMAN THINKERS forced to emigrate to the United States from Nazi Germany in the thirties, particularly philosophers and social critics like Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, worried that an American equivalent of European fascism could easily emerge in their new homeland. They feared that, as in Weimar Germany, the crass nature of American pop culture softened up the brain for fascism. “Automobiles, bombs, and movies,” they wrote, all did their part in assuring mainstream America that the concept of an American way of life was not a belief but just common sense. Adorno and his colleagues are usually loosely grouped together as the Frankfurt School, named after the original site of their research institute in Frankfurt, Germany. In a bleak irony, the institute for Marxist studies established by primarily Jewish thinkers there became the home of Germany’s major Zyklon B manufacturing plants. The reputation of the Frankfurt School has been fusty and fraught. They not only seemed like a squad for the fun police in their distaste for popular culture, but sometimes as the reactionaries they certainly were not. Adorno, for example, critiqued the use of rock music in anti-war protests during the 1960s in such a way that he appeared to criticize the idea of protest itself. Now and again, they just seemed absurd, as when Adorno wondered aloud about the fascist proclivities of escalators—one had to surrender one’s autonomy to ride one, after all. It did not help their reputation with the sixties generation, or later generations, that Adorno and his colleagues often chose to be abstruse and abstract when they could have easily explained. More recently, scholars and a wider literary culture have decided the fussy Frankfurt School might have been on to something after all. Alex Ross, a contemporary writer for the New Yorker fascinated with this band of émigré culture critics, wrote that Adorno would have looked grimly at how the twenty-first century proved him right. In a prescient warning in 2014, Ross wrote that much of our social media landscape looks very much like an Adornoesque nightmare. “Technology conspires with populism,” he suggested, “to create an ideologically vacant dictatorship of likes.” In 2016, Stuart Jeffries, author of a collective biography of the Frankfurt School critics, told Vox that Trump speaks in a “stream-of-consciousness gibberish” free of “thought” and “historical memory.” Jeffries sees him as a product of exactly what Adorno feared. He folded “pop entertainment into politics” and created a “spectacle” that requires nothing but attention to thrive.9 Long before the “dictatorship of likes,” small genre films did shape how white America looked at the rest of the world. While empire dared not speak its name since the early years of the twentieth century, horror films often relentlessly hammered home its racist logic. In everyday conversation, we use the term ideology to mean something like “a political position held to with some conviction.” Since the nineteenth century, its denotative meaning has been a set of ideas that everything from media to market values asks us to accept as “common sense” or “the way things are.” The most ideological documents are precisely those we don’t perceive as ideological . . . maybe even those it seems laughable to perceive as such. What works better than an advertisement that makes fun of advertising, or a film that manages us with the camera’s privileged point of view? Horror in American culture has been more than a catharsis, more than a reflection of anxieties, more than the need to test the limits of our fears. It has played an integral role in what Adorno called “the culture industry.” The manufacture of dark images of the allegedly primitive corners of the earth has been a thrumming cog in the machine of empire. If we take the best of the Frankfurt School at its word, the horror film proved a necessary element in the American public’s acceptance of, and even entertainment through, America’s imperial ambitions. Warning in 1933 about the popularity of King Kong, a film that became something of an archetype for films that combined horror with the alleged primitivism of most of the world, Adorno described it as a tale of Americans who, without realizing it, agreed to be cast as “walk-on parts in a monster documentary.” 4.Welcome (Back) to the Jungle IN 1941, just as the United States entered the Second World War, King of the Zombies attempted to tell a story of rough-and-ready agents of the OSS (forerunner to the CIA) combating an unnamed foreign government on a Caribbean island “somewhere between Puerto Rico and Cuba.” This seems an absurdly obtuse reference to Haiti. But in truth it’s scripted as a nonspecific anywhere, the savage jungle of imperial imagination. Crash-landing on the island, the two white agents and their African American valet, Jefferson Jackson, find a plantation house where Dr. Sangre (“Dr. Blood”) pretends to be a refugee from Nazi-controlled Vienna. In fact, Sangre blends science and an alliance with a “voodoo priestess” in a nefarious scheme that involves kidnapping a rear admiral of a foreign nation and seizing the Panama Canal, one of the early twentieth-century outposts of American imperial power. Sangre’s dastardly plot is to use a “voodoo ceremony” and his army of zombies to force the captive admiral to reveal the “canal zone defenses” for “his government.” Most of the American audience likely assumed the alleged Austrian refugee worked for Hitler but, depending on where they fell on the political spectrum, might have placed him in the employ of Stalin. King of the Zombies makes full use of racist imagery that delighted and frightened white audiences all at once. Dr. Sangre’s zombies are “big black ones,” as an OSS agent affirms. Later in the film, an agent calls them Sangre’s “ape men.” Meanwhile the accomplished Black humorist Mantan Moreland embodied the American stereotype of African American men with Jefferson Jackson, complete with malapropisms and a perpetually pop-eyed expression. Moreland remains one of the great forgotten talents of midcentury Hollywood, his reputation obscured by the racist cartoons he was forced to pantomime if he wanted to work at all.10 King of the Zombies shows an important side of horror science fiction too often ignored in the forties and fifties. It’s easy to see the metaphor for communist invasion and infiltration in the flying saucers flitting about the screens of the era. But there’s another side to the horror culture of World War II and the decades that followed. Americans obsessed over invasion, but it was not only communist powers coming to American shores. Filmmakers found the public hungry for various kinds of colonial horror, films in which representatives of white civilization are the invaders in imagined Latin Americas and Africas, meeting with the “superstition” of “primitives” that turns out to be all too real. Americans did not even have to turn to film to get an entrée of primitivism matched with horror. At the 1939 New York World’s Fair in Flushing, the “South Seas” exhibit offered a “zombie-themed restaurant,” showing once again the way the geographies of monster and empire could collapse into one another. The theme of racism and American power appeared at the fair in the form of African Americans portraying natives in the fair’s “Jungleland” and minstrel singers like Bill “Bojangles” Robinson performing. These representations of the atavistic subjects of the American empire becomes all the more striking when considering the 1939 fair’s celebration of “The World of Tomorrow.”11 These are entertainments aimed at the perpetually aggrieved empire. White America imagined itself becoming the victim of an invasion from beyond, but it also listened to stories of how it could become the victim of people of color abroad. Jungle horror legitimized racism at home and offered a rationale for an aggressive foreign policy, the creation of zombie republics. Bride of the Gorilla (1951) takes place in what appears to be Dutch Guiana (now Surinam) in Latin America. But the contradictory messages the audience had to read in the geography of the B-movie tell us much about Cold War America’s understanding of the world and its place in it. The mix of characters the film presented as foreign, even though they are in their homeland, are represented as Asian, other times African, and only vaguely Latin American. The only real geography is a nondescript “jungle” that narrator Lon Chaney Jr. describes as “lush, green . . . as old as time” and willing to “[take] the law into its own hands.” It’s a new frontier, pilgrim. Curt Siodmak, émigré (and escapee) from Hitler’s Germany, wrote the screenplay. A successful novelist by the fifties, Siodmak is also known for his better-than-it had-to-be script for The Wolf Man. Contending with much lower production values and a sillier plot, Bride of the Gorilla managed to be somewhat literate even with its racist assumption that the non-white peoples of the globe represented a malignant threat to American power. The Van Gelder estate becomes the “old dark plantation” in Bride of the Gorilla. We’re never told the cash crop or where the story takes place. The audience only knows it’s somewhere all white people agree is not in the civilized world. The jungle itself becomes a monstrous, mysterious entity working its will through a witch doctor who witnesses the white overseer murder the plantation owner. Adultery and subsequent marriage to the plantation mistress are the crimes that the jungle unleashes its wrath against, not the colonial economy or the overseer’s sexual exploitation of Indigenous people shown early in the film. A white man has taken a wealthier white man’s woman and the punishment will be . . . becoming black and then turning into a primate. The jungle takes away his whiteness and then makes him something inhuman. It’s the threat implied in the phrase white zombie in another form. Konga (1961) followed a similar heavily racialized theme. The audience receives a more exact geography this time: the dangerous monster comes from Africa, specifically Uganda. When Konga appeared, the British protectorate smoldered with rising nationalist sentiment that some in the United States, nearly inevitably, connected with socialism. British rule had been somewhat benign in Uganda. However, benign in an imperial context meant that indentured servanthood rather than genocide became the fate of many of the Indigenous peoples. Discontent roiled the country, which won its independence in 1962. In Konga, the colonies came home. A mad scientist has spent a year “with friendly natives” where he met the omnipresent “witch doctor,” who taught him how to use “seeds to control his subjects.” Konga the chimp comes home to London and transforms into Konga the monster, rampaging through the city like his obvious giant ape ancestor King Kong. Colonial independence meant monsters at home. The United States would, a few years after Uganda’s independence, endorse British and Israeli intelligence efforts to install Idi Amin. In the 1970s, the CIA helped supply him with arms. A bit like Konga, the brutal regime in Uganda would be a joint British and American production.12 But did anyone really take away these kinds of political messages from low-budget horror films? They were only movies, right? Horror films told audiences that if they left the United States for anywhere but Europe, they’d find it really was a jungle out there. Sitting, maybe giggling, through King of the Zombies and Bride of the Gorilla, shoes sticky on the popcorn-butter-splattered floor, white audiences could sit back and learn why theirs was just the best nation ever. The rest of the world seemed filled with superstition and sorcerers, mad scientists and their monsters. The non-white world probably needed an invasion, a first strike. Corporate and political interests helped produce the real “monster documentary.” In Guatemala, next door to the earlier zombie republic of Honduras, United Fruit even seized control of the postal service to ensure fast delivery of their product. The company would eventually own three and a half million acres in Central America and the Caribbean. Most of this land underwent a process best described as agricultural fracking, a transformation of small holdings into banana and sugarcane plantations and vast tracts of land for railroads and ports to ensure Americans received a steady supply of fresh bananas. In the second half of the twentieth century, United Fruit, today rebranded as Chiquita Brands International, could count on American foreign policy to conform to its designs. In the 1950s, Eisenhower’s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, best known for his streetfighter style of anti-communism, performed legal work for United Fruit. So did his brother, CIA Director Allen Dulles. In 1954, the CIA orchestrated a coup against the government of Jacobo Árbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala, when he nationalized almost half of United Fruit’s holdings as part of his plans for agrarian reform. The Dulles brothers saw Árbenz as a crypto-communist with ties to Moscow even though their own intelligence reports concluded no such thing. The CIA trained a small army of mercenaries and funneled arms through Honduras and Nicaragua, right-wing dictatorships dependent on the United States. Bombing runs by CIA pilots convinced Guatemalans and their president they would face a full-scale invasion by the United States. America’s clandestine service further created chaos in the country by suggesting the occurrence of an alien invasion. Planting false tales of all kinds and then taking over a shortwave radio station, CIA operatives warned of flying saucer sightings and plans by the government to close churches and force everyone to worship Stalin. Bombing and assassinations proved even more convincing, of course, though clearly some CIA field agents had been listening to Walter Bedell Smith when he suggested the use of space invaders for psychological warfare. CIA black ops specialist E. Howard Hunt said frankly that the United States wanted “a terror campaign” and compared the work done in Guatemala positively to the fear inspired by Nazi Stuka bombers over Poland.13 The terror campaign worked. Árbenz chose to step down and go into exile and a military junta headed by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas seized control of the country, and thus did the United States. The United Fruit Company benefitted enormously from the coup, again showing the degree to which capitalism drove the American empire. In fact, the New Orleans–based corporation helped finance the effort. A CIA cable two years before the government’s overthrow assured the Pentagon that “[redacted] officials of the United Fruit Company have promised financial aid. [Redacted] and Castillo met in Baton Rouge, LA in December . . . [Redacted] will get money in Honduras and deliver it to Castillo in that country.”14 If the seizure of the country by the right-wing dictatorship proved a boon for United Fruit and its stockholders, a curse fell on the people of Guatemala. Outlawing labor unions and indeed any effort by campesinos to organize politically represented the least of the regime’s crimes. Castillo imprisoned tens of thousands of people for “communist sympathies,” all at the advice of Allen Dulles. The resulting Guatemalan Civil War resulted in the deaths of two hundred thousand civilians over several decades, years in which the U.S. government provided the regime with hundreds of millions of dollars.15 The United States sought to perfect the small-footprint empire. Why occupy a country and annex territory when covert ops, corporate interest, off-the-books murders, and proxy armies could install American assets as dictators? The year before the intervention in Guatemala, an American-led coup in Iran overthrew the elected prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq because he favored the nationalization of foreign oil interests. Placing the unpopular Reza Shah Pahlavi on the throne, the CIA and U.S. special forces turned the republic into a monarchical police state.16 Films shaped American conceptions about Latin America, the nature of the Cold War, white supremacy, and the prerogatives of the United States around the world. It is hard not to see the kind of soft power even B-movies could exercise on public opinion and its underlying attitudes. In fact, outside of a few slapstick comedies that made light of mustachioed generals ruling “banana republics,” Americans saw no real representations of Latin America and the Caribbean other than horror. Moviegoers had their choice of bizarrely lighthearted romps concerned with corruption and military dictatorship in the tropics (with, of course, no hint that the United States funded and armed these regimes) or frightening portrayals of exotic jungles of temptation and terror where the king of the zombies, ancient curses, and threats to white women and white manhood waited. Send in the marines, somebody. America’s vast colonial undertaking in the twentieth century bundled together packet injections of geopolitical ambition, folklore, rumor legends, and films to shape the acceptance of the empire. Films and bombs, as the Frankfurt School argued, kept the United States on its imperial course while the American people played their walk-on parts in a monster doc. 5.Night(s) of the Living Dead ERIC BLAIR, known to the world as George Orwell, sat in his cabin on the isolated Scottish isle of Jura. The chill of the Hebrides wind competed with the smoky warmth of burning peat in the fireplace. Orwell scrawled out his final and most famous work, Ninety Eighty-Four: A Novel, usually published today as 1984. Right-wing libertarians have sometimes seized on the book as a critique of activist government, or in their rhetoric “the nanny state.” In fact, Orwell himself held to what we would label democratic socialism and admired communist thinker Leon Trotsky. Killed by a Stalinist assassin in Mexico in 1940, Trotsky appeared as a revolutionary betrayed by authoritarians in both Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell joined a Trotskyite brigade during the Spanish Civil War as part of the effort to defeat Francisco Franco’s fascist legions. Orwell died in 1950, tubercular and beset with pneumonia and strep he apparently contracted on an ill-considered boat trip in the frigid waters of the Inner Hebrides. His predications of a despotic future served as a critique of Stalinism in his own time even as they effectively predicted the power of surveillance and lack of privacy of our contemporary moment. He also accurately predicted every superpower’s need for an enemy. Certainly between 1941 and 1975, the idea first presented in 1984 that we “had always been at war with Eastasia” seemed a quantum expression of American foreign policy and public opinion. The names and geographic locations of the cultures their government obliged them to hate proved confusing to many Americans. But that was more than acceptable to foreign policy elites. In part, as horror films revealed when they showed Americans a peculiar mash-up of places decidedly NOT-AMERICA, confusion was the point. Fear and hatred of the Japanese during World War II became hatred and fear of China. The baffling nature of the Korean War for most Americans, the reality that American soldiers and other U.N. forces actively engaged both North Korean and Chinese forces, helped shape a sense that we “had always been at war with Eastasia,” although, just like the slogan in 1984, this represented a revision of history, a willful forgetting, and a racist set of assumptions that allowed white America to see Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam as some version of Fu Manchu’s “Asiatic hordes.” The Soviet Union could be bundled into the eastern monstrosity, with serious foreign policy analysts, writers, and artists describing Russia as attracted by Bolshevism because of its history of “oriental despotism.”17 At home, as the story of Chan Loo’s “Horrors of the Orient” showed, hatred of Japan could easily be replaced by hatred of China. The opposite had been effected during the Second World War when an outbreak of assaults on Asian people after Pearl Harbor had become indiscriminate. Just before Christmas in 1941, Life magazine ran a piece entitled “How to Tell Japs from Chinese.” The piece in America’s most popular magazine essentially told readers that if they wished to assault someone, make sure to look for the alleged telltale signs of the Japanese “massively boned head” as opposed to the “delicately boned” features of the Chinese. The Chinese, meanwhile, wore “the rational calm of tolerant realists” while the Japanese face is “humorless” and “ruthless.”18 The roving imperial eye saw a jungle everywhere, from West Africa to the Middle East, from the Pacific and Asian countries to all of South America. By the 1960s, Americans focused these attitudes on the ancient society of Vietnam. Readers should know that Vietnam (explored later in this book because of its immense importance) became a horror landscape of American nightmares about its ability to assert its global hegemony. Left-leaning guerillas, many of them fighting for their national independence since the Japanese seized the country, drove out their former colonial masters, the French, after the decisive 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu. The Truman administration footed the bill for the French struggle, paying up to two-thirds of their costs in Southeast Asia between 1950 and 1952.19 Following Eisenhower’s inauguration in 1953, his administration continued support for the French and, under the banner of anti-communism, eventually took over for France as colonial overlord. The 1954 Geneva Accords allowed for a French withdrawal, a supposedly temporary division of Vietnam into North and South, and an election in two years that would unite the country. The United States prevented the election from happening, certain that the socialist hero of the wars against Japan and France, Ho Chi Minh, would emerge victorious. Political rhetoric at home sought to hide these facts. Most Americans believed by the early 1960s that North Vietnam, a “foreign communist power,” invaded South Vietnam, and the United States, wisely or not, intervened against an aggressor nation. In fact, Americans, who largely supported some level of intervention, had really no idea that they had become embroiled in a civil war. Even fewer knew their leaders sided with a corrupt, inept, and brutal regime, a zombie republic ensorcelled from nothing by the United States, which never managed to convince the South Vietnamese of its legitimacy. Ngo Dinh Diem ruled South Vietnam with the support of important American business and military leaders. Diem’s regime, however, helped the communist cause in the South thrive through the draconian actions of his secret police and attempts to uproot native Vietnamese Buddhism. It’s a sign of the clueless authoritarianism of Diem and his numerous replacements that, as much as some South Vietnamese feared the communists, they could never see their own government as a real alternative. John F. Kennedy, still for many Americans the iconic president, received a pass on the escalation of the conflict in popular memory. The facts are not on the side of his admirers. Most any textbook will tell you that the first Marine combat brigades appeared in Vietnam in 1965. Technically, this is true. But by the time of his assassination in 1963, Kennedy deployed close to seventeen thousand troops in Vietnam officially classified as “advisors.” Indeed, one of the few times the highly conservative comedian Bob Hope, by the sixties out of fashion with the young, managed a chuckle out of American GIs when he acknowledged this reality. When Hope performed his first Vietnamese Christmas Show in 1964, he started his set for the thousands assembled by gleefully hailing them with “Hello, advisors!”20 The Geneva Accords limited “advisors and observers” to under seven hundred. The United States ignored this limit just as it ignored the provision for a national election to settle the conflict. Kennedy insisted that Americans did not engage in combat even as it became clear that American pilots oversaw and took part in napalm raids. Dow Chemical developed an improved version of the vicious, inflammable jelly since the “terror bombings” of World War II, hotter and longer burning. Life magazine ran a story in January of 1963 about an American aircraft allegedly piloted by Vietnamese airmen trained by American observers. Historian of the Vietnam War Christian G. Appy writes, “the caption was written by editors still willing to parrot the official fiction.”21 The use of deadly bioweapons and the secret war being waged against North Vietnam continued the trajectory of American foreign policy that began with the seizure of the Philippines. The kind of conflict the Vietnam War became, the willingness of a small group of political elites to sacrifice human life in the hundreds of thousands, clearly appears in the earliest days of American involvement. By 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson had deployed over five hundred thousand U.S. troops to Vietnam. Moreover, the belief that the United States could win the war through pure attrition, slaughtering so many Vietnamese that the conflict would simply end when the country became a desolation, took the military command structure down the darkest of paths. The military hierarchy, from lieutenants all the way up to commanding general William Westmoreland, demanded the production of “body count” to such a degree that platoons sometimes competed in their accumulation of corpses.22 The death toll among the Vietnamese people, of all political shades, went exponential. After 1968’s Tet Offensive rocked the United States back on its heels, the American military responded with devastating violence. As the war dragged on, artillery strikes, B-52 bombing runs, shells hurled from battleships offshore, and incessant machine-gun fire on the ground and from Huey and Chinook helicopters above expended more firepower than used by all sides in the Second World War. By 1970, U.S. forces used 128,400 tons of munitions a month. The sheer amount of firepower, including chemical weapons and the poisonous defoliant Agent Orange, vaporized entire villages. A conservative New York Times estimate of Vietnamese causalities, dependent on U.S. military and South Vietnamese army sources alone, concluded that North Vietnam and “Viet Cong” suffered close to one million deaths with no tally for the wounded or any real separation between “civilians” and “Viet Cong.” A reported 20,587 South Vietnamese believed to have been sympathizers died at the hands of their own government, aided by the CIA. Indeed, these numbers are vastly underinflated given that official CIA totals for their Operation Phoenix program claimed to have killed more than 20,000 “VC.”23 Significant attention has been paid to the atrocity of the 1968 My Lai massacre, the work of that legion of Charlies, Charlie Company of the Eleventh Brigade. Such incidents, often excused by the military brass as the acts of “a few bad apples,” are representative of the decimation of the country systematically ordered by the Pentagon and carried out with weaponry that went far beyond what a single platoon could accomplish. Journalist and historian Nick Turse closely examined the record of American atrocities in Vietnam using primarily veteran accounts and archived war crimes investigations by the U.S. Army. He found that, for example, the 1968 Operation Speedy Express campaign in the Mekong Delta unleashed F-4 Phantoms dropping a massive tonnage of napalm on civilian hamlets, swift boats machine-gunning anyone who ran from U.S. forces among the rice paddies, B-52s raining down unimaginable carnage, and SEAL teams joining regular infantry in what had become a 350-kilometer-wide free-fire zone.24 As charred corpses covered South Asia, the year 1968 introduced the world to a new kind of fictional terror, a kind of horror that belonged very much to the times. George A. Romero turned twenty-eight that year. Since his graduation from college in 1960, his dreams of becoming a filmmaker were limited to work on commercials and filming a segment of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood that assured children that having their tonsils taken out really wasn’t so bad. As the war escalated, Romero made an independent film that rattled the nation in ways it didn’t quite understand. Americans just knew it scared them in ways vampires, flying saucers, and giant bugs couldn’t manage. What if America became a zombie republic? Romero’s Night of the Living Dead became a surprise hit at small theaters and drive-ins all over the country. Although in no sense a political allegory, nerves already raw sizzled with the film’s allusions to a country facing an Armageddon, violent dissension, and a world in which the Black hero died in the end at the hands of a white police force providing tactical support for a white lynch mob. Romero’s zombies are rotting embodiments of the war at home. Unlike the overwhelming majority of gothic horror films since the 1930s, the monsters are not in a far-off land, an imagined Europe, or a collage of the non-white world. Romero doesn’t separate the horror of the undead from a group of survivors who hate one another as much as the monsters who want to make them into a meal. “They’re all kinda insane,” Romero said of the group. Their isolation from one another in the midst of the apocalypse is, he said, “the most frightening thing” about the horror masterpiece.25 Romero’s creatures are masterless ronin of death. They don’t embody, as in White Zombie and its imitators, white America’s fear and anxiety over its colonial projects abroad. No sorcerer wielding the power of voodoo has called them forth. They are not a monstrous metaphor for colonization and the unfree labor that accompanies it. But they are still very much monsters of empire. In Romero’s world, the American government created them. A space probe brought back “radiation” from Venus that caused the dead to rise. Moreover, in one brilliant scene, Romero rewrites the script of most of the science fiction horror of the 1950s and ’60s. Rather than banding together against the threat, scientists and generals argue with one another in front of the media about what Americans should know and what they should be lied to about. We get the sneaking suspicion that the military-academic-industrial complex made it possible for our fellow Americans to eat us for dinner. Like the survivors in the farmhouse, “they’re all kinda insane.” Romero chose Duane Jones, a young African American actor, to portray the lead role of Ben. Although the director always insisted he did not select Jones based on his race, this in no way suggests Romero failed to understand the implication of his selection. He worked on his small-budget masterpiece on location in western Pennsylvania during a year in which the freedom struggle entered a critical new phase in the fight against white supremacy. Night was released a few months after an assassin with a highly suspicious background took the life of Martin Luther King Jr. Romero likely refused to comment on Jones’s race because he never wanted to suggest he’d selected the extraordinary actor simply because of his skin color. It’s the no-nonsense, won’t-take-any-shit, fire-raging-in-the-belly attitude that Jones brought to the role that matters. He represents the embodiment of the angry Black man, a construct worried over by white editorialists, the monstrous archetype that white politicians later invented terms for like superpredator and thug to inspire fear and new voting patterns among suburban whites.26 Romero surrounds Ben with white America under siege. An aging 1950s couple trades vicious barbs with one another as the husband tries to play patriarch to the household. But his time has passed. Barbra, a young white woman, is comatose. A rural Ken and Barbie doll couple are directionless. A decayed and cannibalized body lies at the top of the stairs before Ben removes it, a fleshless skull with empty voids for eyes urgently invoking the photographs and film footage of the corpses of Vietnam. They sit in the abandoned farmhouse. It’s the dead West, the Spahn ranch, the Texas cannibals’ homestead, the last house on the left. It’s the haunted castle of American frontier expansion gone to seed. The besieged microcosm of America hears conflicting reports from scientists and military leaders. Unlike in many of the sci-fi horror films of the time, the military will not come to save us. The scientists working for the Pentagon and a proliferation of national security agencies cannot be trusted and may have even been the cause of the outbreak. The bleak ending leaves us with a corpse, part of the mound of corpses produced by American racism, police power ensuring white interests had the protection of a well-armed lynch mob, the violence of the state outsourced to a backwoods paramilitary. This mistrust of the Pentagon, deeply intertwined with the protest culture of the anti-war movement, reversed the somnolent message of so much of fifties and early sixties horror culture. Kyle William Bishop, author of American Zombie Gothic, writes that Romero viewed films like Invisible Invaders (1959) and The Earth Dies Screaming (1964) in which aliens bent on conquest reanimate the dead. He also loved more literate sci-fi epics like Howard Hawks’s 1951 The Thing from Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still. In these films, Bishop writes, “the soldier’s first reaction upon encountering life from another planet is to shoot first and ask questions later.” In this new zombie tale for a new generation, Romero ruthlessly critiqued this blinkered use of violence, a theme he returned to throughout his film career.27 In 1968, Romero saw the beginning of the reign of the dead. In the years ahead, his new kind of zombie would become America’s most popular monster and one that he, along with others, would consistently use to critique American values. The United States continued to busily create zombie republics abroad. But in the American collective imagination, the dead began to return to the homestead, indomitable and hungry. 6.The Null Zone IN THE June 1968 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, two competing ads appeared side by side. They revealed two alternative ideas about American imperial power among the most influential science fiction writers of the second half of the twentieth century. One read, “We the undersigned believe the United States must remain in Vietnam to fulfill its responsibilities to the people of that country.” On the facing page, readers saw a slightly longer list of names under the words “We oppose the participation of the United States in the war in Vietnam.” The same issue included the announcement of a contest entitled “What would you do about the Vietnam War?” The best five answers would receive a one-hundred-dollar cash prize. Throughout the 1960s, Galaxy was known for publishing a wide array of science fiction tales, including Ray Bradbury’s short story “The Fireman,” which became the basis for Fahrenheit 451. In contrast to earlier science fiction magazines, editors H. L. Gold and Frederik Pohl sought to propel their work beyond its reputation as the space-adventure-for-boys genre. Galaxy hoped publishing tales with social commentary or that made use of parody and satire would help solidify SF as a serious literary phenomenon. Kate Wilhelm and Judith Merril circulated the first call for a petition against the escalating war. Wilhelm became a multiple Nebula winner, one of the highest honors for speculative fiction, for her stories of postapocalyptic American landscapes. Merril, one of the most politically sophisticated of the somewhat directionless Futurians, joined the Trotskyite movement after realizing the brutal, and in many respects anti-socialist, direction Stalin took the Soviet Union in the thirties. By the 1960s, she actively engaged in anti-war activities while churning out a host of tales centered on nuclear nightmare scenarios. Both women expected a near-universal condemnation of the American war in Asia from their fellow writers. Perhaps they should not have been surprised by Robert A. Heinlein’s response. Heinlein’s position regarding race, the utter supremacy of the U.S. military, and even enthusiasm for atomic weapons almost guaranteed his adamant refusal to sign. In fact, Heinlein wrote a novel, Glory Road, in 1963 that presaged the later popularity of military techno-thrillers like those of Tom Clancy. In it, an embittered Korean War veteran goes to Vietnam to fight communists, lamenting that in Korea “we weren’t allowed to win” and excoriating American society for its “weakness” in not using nuclear weapons. In an obvious allusion to his Starship Troopers fantasy of space marines waging a fascist war against monstrous bugs, Glory Road compares the “natives” of Vietnam with “insects.” Another signer of the pro-war proclamation, Joe Poyer, authored a nonfiction piece for archconservative John W. Campbell’s Analog Science Fiction and Fact suggesting that capitalism and democracy would triumph over insurgent wars of liberation in the developing world by using futuristic weaponry. In one of Poyer’s short stories, a Green Beret tricked out with war tech like some combination of the Predator and Iron Man hunts and kills his human targets mercilessly, a new incarnation of Heinlein’s Starship Troopers brutally extirpating the enemy in South Asia instead of outer space. In the same tale, the U.S. military deploys droplets of “deadly radioactive waste” to create what Poyer called “the null zone.” Commenting on the signers behind the pro-war ad, historian H. Bruce Franklin notes that it “reads like a roll call of champions of super science and supermen, of manly and military virtue . . .” Jerry Pournelle offers the best example of a writer soon to play a walk-on roll in the monster doc of the American empire. A protégé of Heinlein’s, he built an entire career around the notion of American supremacy using sci-fi-inspired weaponry to destroy monsters, particularly those he saw embodied in nations and peoples resistant to American power.28 Pournelle served in the Korean War where he, paradoxically, joined the Communist Party. He later called this “misplaced idealism” and made a whiplash-inducing swing to the other end of the political spectrum. He became an advocate of an America First position while pushing Heinlein’s monster-slaying fantasies and racist nightmares to their logical conclusion. Pournelle worked for a few years in the aerospace industry, where his interest in the killing power of science flourished. In the late 1950s, as an employee of Boeing, he imagined the design of a new high-tech killing machine he called “Project Thor,” which could rain tungsten steel rods from space platforms with the destructive force of nuclear weapons, minus the radioactive fallout. While producing more and more science fiction, he continued to work with high-tech weaponry, specifically new designs for the next-gen ballistic missiles of the 1970s. Like Wernher von Braun and Heinlein himself, Pournelle became a key component in the American right’s fascination with space exploration and its possibilities for raining destruction from orbit on America’s enemies.29 Later in life, Pournelle found it charming to describe his politics as “somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan.” His extremist worldview and interest in space exploration, high-tech weapons, and science fiction frequently gelled. His tales bristled with space marines and futuristic versions of America’s “technowar.” The line between slaughtering monstrous humanoids in space and the American imperial adventure dissolved in his coauthorship of the textbook The Strategy of Technology. Used in courses at West Point, the volume declared that “3 megatons of small nuclear bombs” would be enough to win the Vietnam War.30 Pournelle and Heinlein continued to believe the Vietnam War could be won by turning soldiers and marines into starship troopers and using futuristic weapons of annihilation. The development of the neutron bomb became important to both writers, a weapon often described in the popular press, using tones of fear or wonder, as “a death ray.” The low-yield weapon explodes radiation into the air, killing people while doing minimal damage to physical structures or vehicles. Deployed as tactical weapons on the battlefield, they would have a devastating effect, neutrons eating human tissue like vermin swarming in a dumpster. Pournelle, in a later incarnation as a military strategist and advisor in the Reagan administration, played a role in the effort to deploy such weapons in Europe in the 1980s. Americans should have been appalled that genre writers of sci-fi fiction horror fantasies helped create the Pershing II missile crisis, an extraordinarily dangerous Cold War moment when the placement of these medium-range nuclear devices and aggressive U.S. “war games” in Europe convinced the Soviets that Reagan planned a preemptive strike. But, given the secrecy long surrounding American foreign policy, the public had no clue how close they came to the “null zone.” Pournelle remerged in the twenty-first century as an advocate for the Ballistic Missile Defense System fantasies of the second Bush administration. As late as 2010, he praised the neutron bomb for its ability to keep the “Red hordes” at bay.31 The willingness to see the war in Southeast Asia as a testing ground for the most hideous weapons of empire explains the massive number of civilian casualties in that long war. The counterculture became inexplicably enraptured with Heinlein’s solipsistic fantasy Stranger in a Strange Land, while he and his protégés wondered why the United States didn’t simply eliminate “the bugs” that resisted the American invasion. Perhaps Charles Manson had really understood Heinlein’s message of “disincorporating” one’s enemies. Kill the bugs, kill the piggies, do something witchy. Several generations of sci-fi warriors who lived their fantasies of killing monsters in print must have been pleased that so many of America’s leaders shared their views, into and beyond the Vietnam War. In fact, one administration after another indulged in the right wing of science fiction’s militarist fantasies when encountering threats to the extension of American power. If we had atomic weapons, why not use them again? Truman pondered their lethal application in Korea. Then, in 1954, Eisenhower considered their use against North Vietnam. Even before Vietnam became unwinnable, the Pentagon Papers revealed the National Security Council placed nuclear weapons on the table. In 1968, William Westmoreland, head of all military operations in Southeast Asia, recommended nuking much of East Asia as the fighting, and public opinion at home, began to turn against the war effort. In fact, even after the war ended, Westmoreland lamented that politicians refused to employ “small tactical nuclear weapons” in order to “tell Hanoi something.”32 The Vietnam War, an issue in American life for nearly a decade, threw its murderous shadow over the history of American horror. Many of the phantasmagoric forms that have haunted the country for the last fifty years came to unnatural life in the jungles of Vietnam. Generals and politicians, the real ones and the Archie Bunkers in their armchairs at home, engaged in an orgy of mythic thinking about the war empire lost. For some, these legends took the form of very literal monsters. 7.Empire’s Missing Links IN THE summer of 1966, marines of First Force Recon Company set out to build a helicopter landing pad in South Vietnam’s Quang Tri Province, one of the most contested regions of the war. Part of a larger effort dubbed Operation Prairie, First Recon began a “reconnaissance in force” to patrol for NLF soldiers (National Liberation Front, better known in American parlance as the Viet Cong or VC). While working on the landing zone near a hill they called “the Rock Pile,” the official report notes that the platoon encountered “some playful rock apes” that “engaged in some rock tossing contests with the Marines.” Supposedly this high-spirited encounter continued until a surprise attack by the NLF halted work on the helipad and resulted in a deadly firefight.33 “Rock apes” could be so casually mentioned in an after-action report because the existence of such creatures had become part of the everyday chatter among troops in Vietnam. Most soldiers in Vietnam probably knew they were part of the native fauna, either gibbons or a red-shanked monkey called the douc (some reports of rock apes insist they had red hair). Gibbons in particular chilled numerous American marines and soldiers with their unearthly screams, banshees in the jungle night. In remembering strange experiences of the war, sometimes a decade or two later, some veterans found that the rock apes took on a much more monstrous form. Marine Anthony Goodrich recalled “it was so damn dark in the jungle” that “rock apes” had an easy time moving around and terrifying patrols. Goodrich even awoke one night thinking a fellow marine had shaken him out of sleep to take his watch, to find a rock ape “about three feet high” sitting on his chest. His screaming woke his entire platoon, who later ribbed him about the incident. Goodrich told an interviewer he had heard about these creatures since his arrival in Vietnam but at first believed they were, in his words, “old wives’ tales.” He then claims he learned that they were “brought south” by the North Vietnamese, essentially becoming weaponized monsters for the communist cause.34 The supernatural “jungle people” appeared suddenly, using tactics not dissimilar from the ambuscades of NLF fighters. The commonalities seemed so obvious to American troops that many rock ape anecdotes told during the war concerned soldiers certain they had been set upon by VC only to express relief upon finding a terrifying cryptid. These stories often took on an even more sinister turn with the tales of ma, or phantoms, that inhabited the dense jungle, precisely the regions that the NLF found most effective for launching surprise attacks on American platoon patrols and makeshift bases. Nearly a half century since the end of the Vietnam War, such stories have proliferated. Many of the stories are connected to the beliefs of the Hmong, a discreet ethnic group in Laos and along the Cambodian border with no loyalty to either the South Vietnamese government or the promises of communism. The CIA saw them as the perfect instrument for counterinsurgency operations. Supposedly, the Hmong passed the tale of jungle phantoms or jungle people on to American CIA agents, special forces, and mercenaries. In more recent retellings, “locals” told marines about the “reanimated corpses” who lived in the jungles. Military.com, a site dedicated to news of interest to veterans and a clearinghouse for information on VA benefits, ran a spring 2019 story about Vietnam’s “ghouls of the jungle,” which insists that American troops “began reporting ghostly figures moving supernaturally through the trees.” Meanwhile, it claims, “others reported fanged creatures with black eyes.” Bizarrely, the article ends by claiming the walking dead could move about in the day because “the triple canopy jungle” kept the sun out and is “the real reason the military developed Agent Orange and napalm.”35 Stories of phantoms in the jungle, like the encounters with cryptid rock apes, may have been a function of memory and amnesia, the delicate process of forgetfulness that plays an integral role in the trauma of war. An adult male gibbon moving through the high trees at night would certainly seem a monstrous phantom to nervous, watchful soldiers. Getting spooked by a monkey would be cause for laughter and relief if the other option involved a grenade tossed out of the steaming darkness or the explosive rattle of an AK-47. Platoon jokes quickly became legend in the retelling. Certainly, there’s no evidence of the existence of rock apes. The memory of them as communist-controlled monsters owes more to the mad scientist/malignant magician films of the Vietnam veteran’s childhood than reality. The real missing link here may be how modern memory of the rock ape connects to the catastrophic use of chemical warfare. By the end of the Vietnam War the United States had dropped more than four hundred thousand pounds of napalm on the Vietnamese people. This represented four times the amount used against Japan in the “terror bombings” that Curtis LeMay admitted had been so egregious that “if we’d lost the war, we’d all have been prosecuted as war criminals.” This fact helps explain why a respected veterans’ site might venture the claim that the use of chemical defoliants, defoliants of plants and humans, may have cleared the jungle of monsters.36 These fanciful creatures provided a way to talk, perhaps half-seriously at times, about the mad science practiced in Vietnam. Telling a story about fanged ghouls with black eyes doesn’t unsettle as much as a viciously burning jelly dropped on civilians and combatants, leaving them forever scarred. A mythic creature hiding in the dark seems charming in comparison to the dumping of tons of a defoliant that had long-range consequences for American soldiers as well as the people and ecosystem of Vietnam. But monsters contain multitudes and seldom have a univocal meaning. Stories of a creature intertwined with America’s guilt and shame over Vietnam, and the near impossibility of negotiating the meaning of the conflict, helped make a monster. These cryptid legends from the battlefield prepared the way for the belief, still making the rounds among cryptid enthusiasts in the 2020s, that the monsters of Vietnam, as in Konga, made their way back to the homeland of the empire. Ken Gerhard, a self-described cryptozoologist who has had an enormously successful career talking about everything from Bigfoot to werewolves on numerous basic cable networks, believes that at least one of the rock apes of Vietnam came home to America. He was, Gerhard claims, shipped home by a former air force pilot in 1965 “using a body bag.” Gerhard appeared in the 2019 Travel Channel series In Search of Monsters, which asked, “Is it possible that one of the monsters of Vietnam made it to North America?” Gerhard makes his claim based on the bizarre tale of the Minnesota Iceman, a complicated fable of an air force veteran, a sideshow act, the CIA’s connection to the heroin trade, and even the Smithsonian Institution. It’s a tale that reveals much about the interrelationship of horror and empire, how a monster story acts as a cover story for some of the stranger covert ops of the Cold War. 8.The Creature in a Grave of Ice!! THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN (1957) featured Peter Cushing as a cryptid hunter at the roof of the world. Cushing soon earned much more fame for his roles as Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein in Hammer studio’s now classic reboots. But this film, released in the United States as The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, transmogrified over the years into a cult classic, portions of it even influencing the cult indie film The Blair Witch Project (1999). The film drew on contemporary fascination with both Bigfoot and the Yeti. It also drilled into a vein of geopolitical weirdness that intertwined monster tales, espionage, and American imperial adventurism. Retired air force veteran Frank D. Hansen unwittingly helped foment this strange corner of the historical meaning of Vietnam. In 1967 he began exhibiting an ape-like creature encased in ice at carnivals, shopping centers, and supermarket parking lots. Hansen previously made extra cash on the county fair circuit showing off antique tractors, including “the world’s oldest John Deere,” which proved especially popular among Midwestern farm equipment enthusiasts. But nothing he ever exhibited became as popular as the thing soon christened the Minnesota Iceman. Hansen’s scam might have remained just a popular regional sideshow attraction. Unfortunately for him, he attracted the attention of two fringe zoologists, Bernard Heuvelmans and Ivan T. Sanderson. Heuvelmans, known for a combination of encyclopedic research and jaw-dropping leaps in logic, may have coined the term cryptozoology. His lifelong love of Jules Verne and the 1925 classic film The Lost World made him playfully open to all manner of wondrous, and highly dubious, claims. In 1948, he encountered a decidedly unscientific article by Sanderson in the Saturday Evening Post entitled “There Could Be Dinosaurs.” He soon wrote On the Track of Unknown Animals, which, in a stroke of luck, appeared about two years before the first supposed sightings of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. Sanderson himself had been a popular nature writer who found a much larger audience for “unexplained phenomenon” in the wake of the ’47 summer of the flying saucers. His alliance with Heuvelmans emerged when their mutual admiration society found funding from the exquisitely named Texas oilman Tom Slick. Slick, who had already footed the bill for several expeditions searching for the Abominable Snowman in the Himalayas, freely dispensed cash to the Sanderson-Heuvelmans research team until his death in 1962.37 The pair, no longer having the financing of the Texas oil industry to go Yeti-hunting in Nepal, looked for mystery closer to home. Hansen seems to have believed, at first, that the cryptid hunters’ interest in his iceman could increase the popularity of his creature already touring much of the Midwest and occasionally as far south as Louisiana. He did insist that Sanderson and Heuvelmans neither open the glass case nor shatter the ice that held his creature. Obviously, this failed to offer anything like the conditions required for empirical research. Nevertheless, both men wrote extensive papers on their limited observations that provided pages of information on the “morphology” of the form they could barely see beneath Hansen’s sideshow trappings. Sanderson and Heuvelmans bought into the idea that the specimen represented a lost human ancestor that continued to live in the remote regions of the world. Sanderson’s writing on the subject would appear, not in scientific journals, but rather in science fiction and “men’s magazines” such as Argosy, for which Sanderson served as “science editor.” Heuvelmans published a book that claimed Hansen had an example of a Neanderthal man, living contemporaneously with humans. And that it had come to America from Vietnam. The origins of the Minnesota Iceman provoked so much speculation because Hansen himself told three different and utterly conflicting stories about how he came into possession of the specimen. In the most elaborate narrative, a Japanese whaling ship discovered the creature blocked in ice and floating in the frigid waters off Kamchatka. Somehow “Red China” ended up with the specimen and, just as mysteriously, the creature found its way to Hansen through “a Chinese gentleman of British nationality” in Hong Kong. In this iteration of the tale, Hansen had pulled off some Cold War cryptid espionage and managed to wrest the monsters from “the reds.” This seems to have been the story he told of the creature’s origins at the 1967 Minnesota State Fair. Hansen presented the alleged creature to patrons in its “grave of ice” according to the August 10 Ironwood Daily Globe. Other attractions on offer included “Big Willie, the world’s largest alligator” and an invitation to “Take the Trip the Hippies Take,” a drug-free psychedelic light show that offered anodyne thrills to the squares. Sometimes Hansen suggested he had possession of the creature after its purchase by a “Hollywood millionaire.” This second version of the story simply suggested that an unnamed benefactor who collected oddities owned the icebound monster but, for reasons never explained, allowed Hansen to tour the county fairs with a missing link in human evolution. The unlikely tale spread that this mysterious Hollywood patron was none other than James Stewart, a rumor that Hansen encouraged. Stewart had been a combat pilot, like Hanson, though during World War II. But there may have been a much better reason why the star of It’s a Wonderful Life and some of Hitchcock’s most chilling thrillers found his way into the tale of the Minnesota Iceman. A decade earlier, Stewart played a decidedly weird role in the story of the Pangboche hand. A cryptid hunter named Peter Byrne, financed by Tom Slick, had discovered an alleged “hand of the Yeti” at a Buddhist monastery in Pangboche, Nepal, in 1957. Formerly isolated, the monastery attracted paying tourists for its supposed Yeti relics in the fifties, particularly after Edmund Hillary’s successful ascent of nearby Mount Everest in 1953. Finding the monks unwilling to part with the attraction, Byrne returned in 1959 and, after getting the monk standing watch thoroughly plastered, stole one finger from the object. He then replaced it with a human finger that he handily (sorry) brought along. There’s obvious speculation about where he found a detached human digit. In all likelihood, he snapped it off one of the hundred or so frozen corpses of dead climbers that have proliferated on the Himalayas since the early twentieth century, bodies fellow climbers have been unable to bury or remove because of weather conditions and logistics. Given that customs agents tend to frown on the export of human remains in a carry-on bag, Slick contacted Stewart, vacationing with his wife, Gloria, in Calcutta. Stewart long held a fascination with natural history and readily agreed to help. Gloria stuffed the finger in her lingerie bag and, as Slick expected, no one rummaged through the celebrity’s luggage. Told and retold, the true story of Stewart’s adventure in extractive tourism only helped the prospects of Hansen’s sideshow.38 As the Minnesota Iceman gained more attention, Hansen came to prefer a story that he perhaps saw as unfalsifiable. He attempted to make canonical the tale that he himself shot the creature while hunting in Minnesota and encased it in a block of ice and a glass canister to preserve it. Heuvelmans wanted a more interesting and perhaps timelier story, and so he looked to Southeast Asia. 9.Drugs, Cryptids, and Covert Ops THE MINNESOTA Iceman becoming entangled in the story of the CIA’s secret war in Laos may seem a bizarre coincidence. But, in fact, cryptid hunting and covert ops often had an intertwined history. Author Colin Dickey discovered that a surprising number of Yeti hunters in the fifties and sixties had some link to various intelligence agencies, so much so that he writes, “the hunt for the Yeti was inescapably tied to Cold War politics.” The Soviet Union thought the same. The state-run newspaper Izvestia claimed that the hunt for the snowmen masked an effort at “the subversion of Communist China.” The New York Times reporter who wrote about this could barely contain their sarcasm about the Kremlin’s apparent nervousness over Tom Slick’s interest in the “abominable snowman.”39 But the Soviets had been right. In 1965, mountaineers connected to U.S. intelligence attempted to set up a sensor on a Himalayan peak, without the knowledge of the Nepalese government, that allowed surveillance of Chinese atomic capabilities. The Kremlin likely suspected a less paranormal reason for the expeditions since the CIA used a hunt for Noah’s Ark along the Turkish-Soviet border to gather photographic intelligence as early as 1949.40 Heuvelmans needed a story better than Yeti fingers hidden in Gloria Stewart’s underwear. His book Neanderthal: The Strange Saga of the Minnesota Iceman, first published in 1974, provided the background for Ken Gerhard’s claim that “body bags” had been used to bring a monster from Vietnam. While admitting that his narrative was in part “based on conjecture,” this rather enormous caveat did not prevent Heuvelmans from strongly affirming that Hansen located the “bizarre hairy man” in Southeast Asia. In this telling, Hansen probably had no idea of the scientific discovery he made but saw financial profit in the specimen. So he arranged for the thing encased in ice to return to the States in a body bag. “What better place to hide a corpse,” Heuvelmans has Hansen reason, “than in a container normally used to carry corpses?”41 In hopes of buttressing this claim, Heuvelmans told a story that readers might find as bizarre as that of the iceman. He insisted that nearly anything could make its way from the major airport of Da Nang to California. How? He explained a large drug-trafficking operation the CIA and the U.S. military carried out to fund pro-American insurgencies in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This of course sounds a bit like a theory in need of a tinfoil hat for its parturition. Unfortunately, the story of the drug trafficking by the United States during the Vietnam war is true.42 In 1971, The Washington Post reported that the CIA had long denied any knowledge of drug trafficking in Vietnam and neighboring regions. However, the article showed the CIA armed and trained tribal groups like the Hmong who grew opium, necessary to produce heroin. The agency also made convenient deals with leaders of the Hmong. One of these warlords, General Vang Pao, convinced the CIA to build an airstrip that allowed the transport of refined heroin. By 1972, 70 percent of the world’s opium came from the region on the Thai, Myanmar, and Laotian border where the Hmong and the CIA worked together against the red menace.43 There’s little evidence that Air America, the name for the CIA’s airlift projects in South Asia, directly facilitated large-scale shipments of heroin to the United States. Nor did CIA agents directly engage in the distribution and sale of the drug, or at least no reliable evidence has appeared to prove such a thing. But the fact that the CIA facilitated the trade remains indisputable. Although often considered a false conspiracy theory of the left, even the CIA’s official examination of the issue admitted that while there was an “unequivocal” restriction on large packages of opium, it remained possible that smaller amounts had been shipped by CIA contractors. The agency preferred to allow assets like General Pao to move drugs in complicated schemes for the funding of counterinsurgency groups, a pattern that would become increasingly common, and insidious, in the coming decades, showing up in the Rube Goldberg machine Oliver North built to fund the Contras in the 1980s. Heuvelmans discusses the close involvement of the CIA and the heroin trade only because of his interest in how an alleged monster made its way to America. He makes it clear that he could not care less about how the American empire used heroin as a leveraging tool with local clients in its expansive South Asian war. What he calls the “scientific Watergate” that led to a lack of interest in his Neanderthal man represented for him the real scandal. After the kerfuffle raised by Sanderson and Heuvelmans over the iceman, Hansen became very nervous. Heuvelmans made the claim, even before the publication of his book, that Hansen illegally obtained a new link in human evolution that still survived in isolated parts of the globe. The claim interested a skeptical John R. Napier, a primatologist with the Smithsonian Institution, who sought to examine the specimen for himself. Hansen tired of the attention and probably knew his iceman would soon be revealed as a fraud. He allowed Napier to examine what he called “a latex model” of the iceman and said that he would no longer display the original for fear it would become damaged. The public lost interest and the Smithsonian concluded that the only version they had been allowed to see of the monster from Vietnam had been a work of special effects. The Minnesota Iceman dropped, for a time, out of public memory until a revival of interest in cryptids in the early twenty-first century.44 Hansen’s family sold the latex model on eBay in 2013. Hansen’s iceman, once connected to both the body bags of the war dead and shadowy covert operations throughout Southeast Asia, can be viewed today at the Museum of the Weird in Austin, Texas. However, a version of Heuvelmans’s strange saga of the connection between the rock apes of Vietnam and the Minnesota Iceman has appeared in every iteration of the story on basic cable’s popular cryptid-hunter shows into the 2020s. 10.They Own the Night A SIGNIFICANT part of the American memory of Vietnam concerns homecomings, or more precisely the homecoming gone sour. Numerous legends, which often became widely and deeply held beliefs, cluster around the warrior who fails to come home. It’s nearly impossible not to see such stories as grassroots metaphor manufacturing, stories that simplify or reimagine the complexities of a lost war. Monsters with their origin in Vietnam, predators in the Mekong delta’s rice fields, that made their way to America comported with how Americans saw the Vietnamese people. Increasingly, Americans told stories about the horror of Vietnam that ignored American culpability in the catastrophe and shifted the focus to unexplained creatures and ghost stories, a haunted ride on the midway of the country’s dark carnival. In 2018, a University of Notre Dame alumnus posted on the university’s class of 1969 blog about a strange night in 1967. Domer Costantini worked that summer for a construction company, “grueling” work that he describes as leaving him physically and mentally exhausted. On a hot July evening, he made his way from the work site to his parents’ home in the Bronx. Costantini regularly passed Gleason’s Funeral Home in the half-mile walk from the subway to his family’s apartment, and on this night, he saw an old high school friend he had not seen for two years, Gerald L. Fox, known to everyone in the neighborhood as Jerry. The “solitary figure” lingered in front of the mortuary and seemed to want to talk, but a weary Costantini begged off and offered a plan to meet up with his school chum another time. He arrived home to learn from his mother that Fox died in a firefight on July 12, 1967. The funeral would be held the following day at Gleason’s. Rational explanations for Costantini’s experience are probably obvious to the reader. He was tired, he saw a friend who reminded him of Jerry, and he probably did not learn of his death that night. But fifty years of misremembering corrupted the timeline, and his very real grief over Jerry’s death created a very genuine haunting. When Costantini attempted to recall the events half a century after they occurred, what came to his mind was his unwillingness to greet his friend, to welcome him home. He would write in 2018, “Who was I and what am I to have shunned an American hero?” Costantini became so invested in the tale that he and his wife traveled to Vietnam, and he wears a wristband that reads “PFC Gerald L. Fox / US 12 Jul 67.” Monster tales can become personal expressions of grief rooted in the many sorrows of empire.45 Point Pleasant, West Virginia, is a tiny Ohio Valley town near a major tributary of the Kanawha River with a population of less than five thousand people. Its Main Street stores shuttered early in the 1960s. At that time, its only claim to fame seems to have been an 1805 house-raising during which a falling log killed Mark Twain’s grandfather. No significant tourist industry seemed likely to germinate from this anecdote. Point Pleasant remained a sleepy hamlet even as residents worried over news of the escalating war in Vietnam, the growing strength of the anti-war movement, and the freedom struggle led by Black Americans demanding economic rights as well as the ballot. But these things appeared to many residents of the isolated town like news from another world. Soon enough, other worlds seemed to swirl around them. On November 16, 1966, the Pittsburgh Press reported that a couple driving near the town was chased “by a birdlike creature” with “red eyes.” On November 27, 1966, a teenager saw “a huge gray figure” that she estimated as being six to seven feet tall with “large, round, fiercely glowing red eyes that focused on her with hypnotic effect.” She watched in horror as “a pair of wings unfolded from its back.”46 UFO enthusiasts and cryptid hunters proved quick to see the Mothman sightings wrapped in our deadly embrace of the Vietnam War. At the time of the sightings, the Pentagon deployed more than two hundred thousand American troops in Vietnam, with former vice president and soon to become presidential candidate Richard Nixon calling for five hundred thousand. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara worried that although the enemy seemed to suffer casualties beyond counting, “there is no sign of a break in enemy morale . . . in the countryside the enemy almost completely controls the night.”47 Did something else control the night? John A. Keel certainly thought so, claiming in his enormously popular book The Mothman Prophecies that numerous UFO sightings had occurred in Southeast Asia in 1966 to 1967. He quoted PFC Earl Morrison, who claimed he and two buddies saw “what looked like wings, like a bat’s, only it was gigantic” near Da Nang. The figure gave off an unearthly greenish hue, though the soldiers claimed its nude body was obsidian. The creature then began flapping its wings and rose into the air. The whole experience, Morrison remembered, lasted “three or four minutes.” Private Morrison’s sighting may have been especially detailed but was frequently repeated in more general terms regarding UFOs, bright lights, and sometimes “enemy helicopters” that neither the North Vietnamese army or the NLF could have accessed. Pete Mazzola, a soldier who later founded a UFOlogy institute, claimed to see “bright objects” appear over rice fields when guerillas pinned down his patrol with heavy fire. Similar reports occurred until the end of the war. Why did soldiers need these stories? On one level, they are hazy incidents occurring in the fog of battle, interpreted according to the flying saucer films and creature features of the soldier’s childhood. A few cases may have been sightings of secretive missions by the CIA either into Laos and Cambodia or the agency’s shadowy Project Phoenix. The tortured memory and the political upheaval caused by defeat in the Vietnam War are more essential to the spread and interest in these stories than the easily explained sightings. The real conspiracies that the citizens of a democracy should speak out about, such as the CIA’s involvement in drug trafficking, become explanations for how a hairy beast could have been transported home from Vietnam. The black helicopters of conspiracy fantasy are reason to distrust the government but not the use of chemical weapons or the murder and maiming of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the most extensive bombing campaign in modern history. In the case of the Vietnam War, the language of monsters hides, rather than reveals, the real horrors of history. Horror films and racism continued as boon companions even as George A. Romero changed the politics of monsters. A new wave of Fu Manchu films became popular in Britain and the United States, helmed by Hammer horror star Christopher Lee as the dastardly mastermind. In precisely the years when the Vietnam War escalated, 1965 to 1969, Lee appeared in no less than five stories of the Asian crime lord in forgettable but popular flicks like The Vengeance of Fu Manchu and The Brides of Fu Manchu. The “Asiatic hordes” continued to batter down the doors of the Western world, if only in the fevered imagination of the American empire. 11.The Ghost of a Previous Nightmare THE UNITED States saw itself under siege even as it projected military and economic power around the globe. In February of 1962, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, formerly an executive with the Ford Motor Company, warned Americans not only that their government called on them to support an apocalyptic arms race, but also that they needed to support wars that are “often not wars at all.” This peculiar admonition, to support a thing that’s not really the thing you think it is, grew from the Kennedy administration’s concern about Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev’s verbal and often material support for “wars of liberation” in the former colonial, or in some cases newly colonized, world.48 When is a war not really a war? McNamara forcefully, if at the time mysteriously, stated his case by talking of a shadow realm in which “the force of world communism operates in the twilight zone between political subversion and quasi-military action.” Of course, the United States in its role as protector of world capitalism operated in this same murky dimension for much of the twentieth century, so murky that many Americans didn’t even know it. McNamara wanted to evoke his boss’s memorable inauguration speech of 1960 when he imagined the Cold War as a “long twilight struggle.” But the phrase the twilight zone had another meaning for many in 1962. Rod Serling had become a successful television writer by the time he invited Americans to ponder their fears, and their politics, in the twilight zone. But Serling was intensely frustrated. In an interview with the young, hard-charging reporter Mike Wallace, Serling complained about constantly having to “battle sponsors and agencies.” Thinking in part of the soporific the network had made of A Town Has Turned to Dust, he told Wallace he didn’t want “to compromise all the time, which in essence is what the television writer does if he wants to put on controversial themes.” Serling also once wrote a political drama for television titled Playhouse 90, but sponsors did not allow his senators to discuss politics, party affiliation, or any current issue. He later noted that “in retrospect, I probably would have had a much more adult play had I made it science fiction, put it in the year 2057, and peopled the Senate with robots.” In other words, if he’d “had a Martian say it.”49 Critics called Serling “television’s angry young man” even before his relentless pasquinades of American society. His daughter Jodi Serling remembers the anger but said it never came from “conceit,” calling her father “a gentle, kind man.” He had, she said, returned from the war “broken . . . He had to start a whole new life, and he used writing as a form of therapy.” His therapy became a conversation with American ideals revealing their true face, seen in his worry over America’s romance with the atom, the possibility that these weapons would not only destroy democracy but create an extinction event.50 Serling’s concerns went beyond the obvious issue of America’s world-ending weapons. Could democracy survive in a militarized state? What happened to freedom of speech and basic ideals of identity in a society that built its foreign policy around bases and bombs, client states and conquest? Could America be great or even good when it appeared the empire might swallow the nation? These anxieties run through every season of The Twilight Zone. The fascism Serling wanted to fight as a high school kid could happen here. Maybe it had already begun. In episodes like “The Obsolete Man,” Serling asked if any element of the First Amendment could survive in a militarized society. Although the episode is sometimes read as an indictment of Stalinism or totalitarianism more generally, Serling’s experiences with the soft censorship of capitalism made him particularly critical of any efforts to limit the spread of ideas in his country. The Twilight Zone did not completely escape the stealth campaign of American censorship. Ratings behemoths like Leave It to Beaver and Gunsmoke dominated the television landscape, while The Twilight Zone appeared Friday nights at 10:00 p.m., late-night TV in the early sixties. The odd hour and some of the themes prevented Serling’s masterpiece from even coming close to the top-rated shows in audience share. But, running for five seasons, Serling’s peculiar TV show created what we today call a cult following, and a very devoted cult at that. Fan clubs of the show, most of them made up of adolescents or college students, emerged around the country. Nevertheless, CBS executives consistently worried about the show’s content, its ratings, and its budget. Serling pressed on, sometimes creating alternate Americas that looked all too familiar. “The Obsolete Man” reads as so heavy-handed today that viewers, just like those in 1961, could easily identify the good guy versus the evil state. At times, Serling wrote or adapted tales for TV that showed the more subtle seductions of fascism. In “He’s Alive”—an homage to the horror tradition’s frequent use of Frankenstein’s moment of “It’s alive!”—Serling introduces us to what he calls “a bush-league Führer” played by Dennis Hopper. He cannot get his fellow Americans to listen to his bile until he’s visited by the the “ghost of a previous nightmare,” the shade of Hitler himself. In the closing monologue, Serling asks his audience to directly ponder the episode’s message. Remember . . . when he comes to your town. Remember it when you hear his voice speaking out through others. Remember it when you hear a name called, a minority attacked, any blind, unreasoning assault on a people or any human being. He’s alive because through these things we keep him alive. But could Serling’s viewers remember this wisdom in a country terrified of outside menace and willing to make a totem of their weapons of mass destruction? As Serling’s Twilight Zone completed its fifth and final season in 1964, the United States intervened and sometimes established a permanent occupation force in countries most Americans could not locate on a map. In January 1964, The Twilight Zone did not appear in CBS’s announcement of its fall schedule and Serling publicly expressed doubt that the show could survive. It did not. Efforts to re-create the show as Rod Serling’s Wax Museum came to nothing, largely because Serling would not do a show that failed to use science fiction and horror for the purpose of social criticism. He loudly complained that everyone from his agents to studio executives wanted him “stuck in a graveyard every week” to introduce a television version of “C-movies.” Serling didn’t need a television vehicle for social criticism. He found the Vietnam War deplorable and spoke out strongly against it in language that much of white, mainstream America found extreme. In December of 1968, Serling delivered a speech to students at Moorpark College in California. Even before he delivered his remarks, he stirred up controversy. The college’s conservative administration demanded that all official campus lecturers sign a loyalty oath to the United States. Serling took umbrage at this, saying that he had already taken an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic when he fought in the Second World War. His body still ached from the wounds he’d received for his country. He held to the conviction that repeated declarations of loyalty to the state cleared the way for fascism. Serling did not sign the oath but the students wanted to hear him anyway, so he gave an informal talk to hundreds of undergraduates without the college’s approval (and without a speaker’s fee). In it, he briefly excoriated the idea of loyalty oaths, comparing them to demands made on citizens in fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. While critiquing the new fascism, Serling took the opportunity to address police brutality, very much on the minds of the sixties generation after the 1968 Democratic National Convention the previous summer when Mayor Richard J. Daley unleashed the police in a wave of violence against anti-war protestors. Serling dismissed the idea that the protestors offered provocation since, he strenuously argued, no possible provocation existed for a “representative of law and order wading in with a billy club under the pretense of saving the sovereign city of Chicago.” Serling went further. Aware that police riots against white students received far more attention than the history of violence against Black people, he scorned the use of law and order in politics, saying it amounted to “a battle slogan.” Nixon and his creatures used the phrase in the ’68 presidential election as a code, assuring white Americans that civil rights legislation did not mean an end to systemic racism enforced with real and threatened violence. Serling noted that “law and order” seemed important only when used as a rhetorical tool. Where, he demanded to know, had the crusaders of law and order been when “four little Negro girls were bombed to pieces in a Birmingham church” or “when three young civil rights workers were slaughtered in Mississippi.” What about a call for law and order during “the bombing of over a hundred churches in the south in the past five years”? Given this, he bluntly asserted in terms that have contemporary application, “It’s hardly a revelation to me that the young people in this country take a dim view of our current uptightness when it comes to street rioting . . . on the scale of misbehavior, the black man who takes a torch to a building or breaks a window to loot, and does so out of passion, is less the criminal than the white man who puts his torch to human beings . . .” In the very same speech, Serling asserted that, even as public opinion began to turn against America’s invasion of Vietnam, few understood or accepted the real meaning of the war. Rather than protecting South Vietnam from the unprovoked aggression of the North, we had allowed “twenty-thousand dead American boys” while “half a million civilians [were put] to a torch” to interfere with a civil war in which the United States sided with a corrupt regime that did not have the support of the people. “So,” he wondered aloud, “what, indeed, are we defending there?”51 Serling died in June of 1975 following coronary bypass surgery. His family had a history of heart irregularities, in Serling’s case exacerbated by smoking as many as four packs of cigarettes a day since World War II. At the time of his death, he suffered with depression, despite some very significant and critically acclaimed writing done for an off-kilter western called The Loner and his newest TV series, Night Gallery. He felt that, as studio execs tried to make Night Gallery competitive with the hugely popular detective series Mannix, social content had given way to “the need for producing simple and unconvincing frights.” Meanwhile, he often commented that while The Twilight Zone had been a mixed bag of excellent, good, bad, and terrible episodes, he also thought it the most politically relevant work of his career. Yet, he doubted it would survive in American memory. He could not have been more wrong. The memory and increasing relevance of Serling’s work entwined with the hopes and anxieties of a new generation of filmmakers like George A. Romero. Like Rod Serling, they did not want to simply “hang out in a graveyard” and raise some ghouls for suspense. A new generation of filmmakers wanted to comment, to make statements, to make important films. A new breaker of horror washed over America, a bleak and chilled wave inundating late-twentieth-century America’s imperial dream. A backlash against this critique would also wash over the American landscape, at times seeming to carry all before it. 12.Bats Leaving, Virgins Bleeding BELA LUGOSI last played Dracula on the silver screen for giggles in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). The forties served Lugosi manifold frustrations, even for a film career hobbled since before World War II. In one of his final films with Boris Karloff, Black Friday (1940), Lugosi played an unconvincing crime boss. He had so little screen time that he could almost be considered an extra. In the following decade, his career cratered with the low-budget attempt at comedy Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla. A spoof on the mad scientist genre, the film tapped into a new science fiction fascination with gorillas gone wild. The few who saw the film perhaps remembered Lugosi’s Murders in the Rue Morgue. He certainly brought a little bit of the light of a dying star to the flop meant as a vehicle for comedians Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, forgotten celebrities whose act amounted to plagiarism of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis’s shtick. Bela Lugosi died on August 16, 1956. It’s a legend that the seventy-three-year-old asked to be buried in one of his several Dracula capes. But his family believed he would have wanted it so. They laid Lugosi to rest in the cloak of the vampire who stalked his career. The death of Lugosi came at a moment when American horror had undergone a complete transformation. A new sensibility emerged even while flying saucers hovered threateningly and giant mutations rose from their prehistoric sleep as humanity harnessed, and lost control of, the power of the atom. Audiences remained fascinated with such films and even flocked to revivals of the ideas about invasion and infiltration they represented. But American horror changed as the American empire changed. Lugosi’s White Zombie joined the Fu Manchu series in creating for Americans a Manichean world of supernatural villainy, a constant threat to American values. The Red Scare and the growing disaster of Vietnam convinced a significant portion of the American public that infiltrators and enemies lurked everywhere, even though the projection of American military and economic power—inciting coups, propping up dangerous regimes, arming proxy fighters, building a vast network of bases, airfields, and military prisons in client states and colonial possessions—encapsulated the real story of global politics. The sounds of the calliope continued to vibrate menacingly in the darkness as the 1970s began. Like the macabre traveling show of Bradbury’s imagination, things happened in the sightless black of America’s new night. Slasher films reanimated the murderous intent of empire for the big screen. A bizarre, seemingly premodern, obsession with demonic evil rode the backs of a generation. A razor-edged counterstroke by American militarism drowned the dreams of the sixties and seventies in bloody waters.",

      "content": "1.Unlucky Numbers THE CAMP counselor, stretched out on the bed in a postcoital fugue, chokes and gasps as an arrow explodes out of the front of his neck. Blood blossoms from the young actor’s body, a twenty-two-year-old named Kevin Bacon in his first film role. It’s 1980 and it’s Friday the 13th. Directed by Sean S. Cunningham, the film did not aim for social relevance. Made on the cheap for a little over half a million dollars, it earned 59 million at the box office, today about 250 million. The nasty little campfire story became a forty-year-old franchise with ten sequels, a reboot, and varied official and unofficial spin-offs across several media platforms, including PC and console games. In the 1980s, only the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise gave it much competition, leading inevitably to the cross-studio horror funfest of Freddy vs. Jason (2003). None of the sequels held the dark allure of the original. The 1980 premier treated anxious audiences to a believable beheading and a misshapen creature suddenly surfacing from a placid lake in a moment that squeezed several minutes of screams. In the days before CGI, pre–Jurassic Park entertainment, hundreds of thousands left the theater asking, “How did they do that?” Some had been so convinced by Bacon’s macabre death scene that rumors circulated the filmmakers “must have killed that person.”1 “I’m sitting here looking at pictures scattered all over my desk, looking at cut throats, and severed arms and people with bullet holes in them.” Tom Savini, the man who convinced some audiences that they’d witnessed an actual murder in Friday the 13th, described his workspace as looking like a crime scene. By the 1980s, with some apprehension, Savini wore the title “The King of Gore.” He preferred to think of himself as “a sorcerer who worked with illusions, sculptures, and mechanisms” to make horror come to life. He spent much of the 1970s earning this reputation before Friday the 13th took his effects mainstream.2 Eleven years before the surprise success of the low-budget film, Savini sat behind a bamboo barricade peering into the steaming Vietnamese night. In 1969, the man who would assault the senses of a generation was just a nervous kid. The heavy hot air and the smell of grease from his M60 machine gun mingled into an unpleasant aroma. The heat beaded his face with sweat. Savini had been assigned night watch for the camp perimeter against guerilla attacks from NLF insurgents.3 When, deep into the loud jungle night, a trip wire twanged a warning, he let loose with the thunderous roar of the M60, a weapon that spatters its heavy-caliber bullets at six hundred rounds a minute. All along the line, other crews with the heavy weapons opened up. Savini was required to contact headquarters before firing, but the tense anxiety of the night watch took over his reflexes. The powerful guns, and a grenade or two, devastated the dense tangle of tree and vine in front of their forward position. A duck had tripped the wire. And, in something of a metaphor for America’s invasion of Vietnam, the duck had somehow survived the punishing hail of gunfire and high explosives. “You didn’t even get the duck?” Savini’s commanding officer angrily wondered aloud. He did not get the duck and his lieutenant rotated him off guard duty. The next night, NLF soldiers overwhelmed the position, leaving Savini convinced that the lucky duck had saved his life. Savini wasn’t sure why he, or any other American, had been sent to Vietnam. He had enlisted because of the personal economic pressures of a new family and the likelihood he’d be drafted anyway. He primarily served as a combat photographer, taking pictures of ghastly images for after-action reports. He recalled that he viewed human bodies “blown nearly in half by a grenade blast,” unattached hands grasping the ground, and scattered body parts in the aftermath of a firefight. Savini writes that, “I felt a kind of safety behind my camera . . . Perhaps my mind was seeing it as special effects to protect me.” He spent much of the rest of his life behind the camera in one way or another. It may have given him a sense of safety, but the same cannot be said for his audience. Savini always displayed a thoughtfulness and sensitivity you would perhaps not expect from someone who began their career making convincing mock-ups of mutilated bodies. But almost half a century after the South Asian conflict, he remembered the impression the Vietnamese people made on him as heirs to a beautiful culture and country. He watched the wholesale destruction of the Vietnamese ecosystem and questioned the point of the war. Before leaving Vietnam, Savini saw American soda being sold in traditional villages to and by the American armed forces. Coca-Cola, that’s the reason his country sent him to South Asia, he later suggested. Savini’s anecdote may seem impressionistic to some. But he had witnessed a local phenomenon that symbolized a larger truth about America’s fight for capitalism in East Asia: they had brought it with them. So-called Ports a-Go-Go began arriving in South Vietnam in the early 1960s, prefabricated docks that, as early as late 1965, received nine million cans of soft drinks and beer.4 Savini would become the prince of special effects artists, rivaling Lon Chaney in his influence on the craft. Working with George A. Romero on Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Cunningham on Friday the 13th, he played an essential role in the new horror revolution of the eighties. In the years to come, as an actor and director as well as SFX maestro, Savini would bring his heavy splatter style to a series of movies very much out of step with the eerie optimism of the period. The uncertain, gory delights of late-twentieth-century horror offered the former combat photographer a way to not only deal with his demons but to bring them to life.5 Gradually, he became better known for the bizarre creatures he constructed. His monsters of hybridity affected audiences more deeply than the hyperreal productions of CGI, the creatures that look so unconvincing they appear encrusted on modern screens, like something you could scrape off if you had the right tool. Savini attributed his fascination with makeup effects to his experience in Vietnam, pointing out that his interest in SFX began during his working-class childhood in Pittsburgh. At the age of twelve, Savini went to his neighborhood theater, the Plaza, to see James Cagney portray Lon Chaney in Man of a Thousand Faces. He became obsessive about re-creating what he saw in 1950s horror comics, the photographs in Famous Monsters of Filmland, and any horror movie he could possibly watch. Then, like Ray Bradbury’s dark carnival rolling into town the year Halloween came early, “Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors” came to Pittsburgh in 1960. The once enormously popular show had been hobbled by changing tastes and time. But Savini loved it. He dressed as Dracula, and his convincing makeup led to his being invited on stage, adding to the magical monster show. He became a regular when Silkini came to town. A few years later, Savini fashioned his drill sergeant a realistic scar to frighten new recruits. He crafted fangs to entertain his buddies in Vietnam. While he makes it clear today that his interest in gore effects did not begin in Vietnam, he admits that his gruesome experiences there shaped the way he approached the making of a horror film. When creating an effect, his interest is always in terrifying realism. Beheaded corpses, skewered bodies, and cut throats must “give me that feeling I used to get when I’d see the real stuff.” When Savini watches a film, if the bloodletting and hideous creatures fail to evoke Vietnam, they simply don’t work. “It’s just not real enough for me,” he wrote. Too many scripts, he once off-handedly noted, feature the dead lying with closed eyes. Savini knew from the corpses he’d seen in Southeast Asia that the eyes of the dead are wide open, flash frozen in horror and surprise.6 The first Friday the 13th film appeared in an America far distant from the one Savini came home to in 1970. Many Americans lost interest in Vietnam as early as 1972, even as the Nixon administration continued to level North and South Vietnam with devastating bombing runs. This included the infamous Christmas Bombings of ’72, which incinerated large portions of Hanoi with twenty tons of explosives. But the American public tired of the war and its intractable issues. The crimes of the Nixon administration increasingly carved out space in print and televised media. The embattled president, obsessed with his alleged domestic enemies more than the obvious catastrophe of Vietnam, tried to spin the decades-long American failures in the region by insisting the United States finally achieved “peace with honor.” U.S. defeat in Vietnam became something of an unmentionable cultural secret. The idea of peace with honor clashed with what American TV audiences saw in April of 1975 as U.S. helicopters crashed, final CIA and army operatives fled unceremoniously from rooftops, and North Vietnamese troops and armored vehicles rolled into Saigon. Adding to the sense of a declining superpower, the 1970s became a decade of torpor, economic turmoil, free-floating anxiety, and even the possibility of apocalyptic catastrophe. By May 1, 1975, more Vietnam veterans committed suicide than died in the war itself. The images that haunted veterans became the images of what empire looks like on the ground, the horror it inflicts on its victims. Sergeant Lee Childress of the 206th Assault Helicopter Company remembered an elderly woman murdered by an American soldier because he believed she’d taken a stick of gum from him. “He shot her point-blank in the chest,” Childress recalled. “We got in more trouble for killing water buffalo than we did for killing people.” He told an interviewer he spent “every fucking day” asking “why? why?” He never found an answer, he admitted, and that left him with nothing but terror.7 Savini’s first special effects work after coming home became Deathdream (1974), also released under the titles Dead of Night and The Veteran. Director Bob Clark, who also made one of the ur-slashers, Black Christmas (1974), borrowed the primary conceit of the chilling W. W. Jacobs tale “The Monkey’s Paw” and presented an American soldier dying in Southeast Asia at the very moment his mother makes a portentous wish for his return. He does come back, but as a vampiric specter who can live only off blood. An especially macabre climax allowed Savini to put his talents, and his trauma, on full display. The tagline of the film? “Some boys never come home.” The darkness learned to follow even when the boys did come home. W. D. Ehrhart graduated high school in 1966 and immediately enlisted in the Marines. He did a tour of duty in Vietnam and fought in the bloody house-to-house fighting in the city of Hué in 1968. Following the war, he did with poetry what Savini had been able to do with make-up—cauterized his trauma while putting it on display before the American public. In the chilling poem “Making the Children Behave,” Ehrhart imagined how he and his comrades in arms left their shadowy memory in the villages of Vietnam, a tale of boogeymen now used to frighten bad children. “When they tell stories to their children / of the evil / that awaits misbehavior / is it me they conjure?” Some may have projected the horror on the experience of Vietnam itself, “a tragedy” often portrayed in popular media as a victimization of Americans. Veterans like Savini and Ehrhart imagined Americans themselves as the instigators of horror.8 Veterans returned to a country in turmoil. The center of a far-flung empire looked to have fallen into decay. The anti-war movement eventually brought together Americans of almost every background and staged the largest protests in the history of the country. In the United States, making money had always been the business of business. But by the end of the decade, a new kind of capitalism was born that continues to affect the work and paycheck of everyone reading this book. It became the foundation and the mechanics of the American empire, at home and abroad. Economic decline allowed business leaders to launch an assault on the American working class from which it never really recovered. Weary of providing benefits and livable wages to unionized workers, heads of large companies and their boards simply closed steel plants and automobile factories, and silenced the beating heart of American manufacturing from South Chicago to Youngstown.9 Gary, Indiana—once the home of U.S. Steel and a city where state and federal authorities deployed the military repeatedly throughout the twentieth century to successfully crush the labor movement—became an economic nightmare where unemployed steelworkers competed for jobs at fast food chains. Much of America in 1984 could be described as “medieval cities of rusting iron” with even the so-called Sun Belt losing textile mills at such a rapid rate that towns could be referred to “morgues” and sites of “rural malingering,” with oddly little comment that “malingering” might be the only option available to former workers. A 2010 study by MIT of 150 cities and towns described industrial powers houses like Buffalo, Cleveland, and Allentown as “dying cities.”10 If you found yourself in the Rust Belt or the Dirt Belt over the last several decades, the logic of the chain saw makes more sense than the promise of Amity Island. This perhaps explains why Tobe Hooper’s vision of the chain saw became one of the most remade, rebooted, and reimagined horror films of the last half century. These “rural malingerers” have been left behind, left out, and despised for their failure. The mad dance of Leatherface holds some appeal. As have the promises of a con artist who represents a parasitic class that destroyed entire social and cultural worlds with their mind-numbingly relentless financial monoculture. Yet, like a good horror film, he gives them an outlet to expend their rage and feel their fears. Millionaires became billionaires while cities died. Reaping massive profits from austerity measures that amounted to wage cuts and layoffs, corporate heads congratulated themselves on becoming “leaner” and showing “innovation and flexibility.” General Electric cut its total number of blue-collar employees by almost two hundred thousand in the early eighties. Rather than facing a backlash for what the newspeak called downsizing, CEO Jack Welch managed to become something of a folk hero who allegedly “saved the company” even though he enriched himself enormously without reinvesting in actual manufacturing. Auto exec Lee Iacocca wrote an enormous best-seller in which he became his own hagiographer. Iacocca also told a story of how he brought Chrysler from the precipice through hard work and allegedly rationalized free market principles. Some Republicans hoped he’d run for president. Few noticed that the salvation of a corporate entity created a crisis at the dinner table and the gas pump for workers whose wages stagnated while inflation exploded. Almost no one, certainly not Iacocca, noted that Chrysler’s salvation came from a government bailout.11 These changes in the economy opened the increasingly enormous economic gap in a country full of Gatsbys whose source of wealth remained mysterious and who did no labor in any meaningful sense. The maw between the nation’s richest and poorest had never grown wider than it did in the seventies and eighties, a trend that continues to worsen. Regions that built communities around manufacturing plants, support services for those factories, and neighborhoods where union membership had been at least as important as what house of worship you attended became haunted ruins. By 2020, Forbes magazine, not exactly an outlet of socialist propaganda, noted that 1 percent of the American population had fifteen times more wealth than the entire bottom 50 percent combined.12 So much of the country began to look like the set of a horror film. Perversely, many of these cities became the setting of horror films. East St. Louis provides an especially egregious example, a place of decline and social death that became part of America’s apocalyptic fears. Although the city struggled since the 1960s, white flight from the largely African American area drained the tax base. Freeways cut apart neighborhoods and community gathering spots. By the eighties and nineties, industries moved to the region only when offered massive subsidies and given allowance to operate as private jurisdictions, contributing nothing to the social safety net. The ravaged city became such a desolation that it earned the dubious honor of serving as the set for John Carpenter’s postapocalyptic film Escape from New York (1981). An associate producer recalled that, because the film was to be made cheaply, he and Carpenter had to go on a search for “the worst city in America.” East St. Louis, poisoned by decades of systemic racism, offered the “seedy run-down quality” of the bleak future of 1997 portrayed in the film.13 The uncertainties of the seventies, the sting of loss in Vietnam, and the cruelties inflicted on the American working class hid a very important fact. Wounded, the country healed like the mythic hydra, and not unlike that beast, its tentacles continued to encircle the globe. By 1975, the United States exhibited nearly full-spectrum dominance over much of the world’s capital, resources, and military supremacy. A vast network of American clients, military bases, and corporate power ensured that every human being on the planet, in one way or another, was forced to contend with the United States.14 This dominance in world affairs did nothing about the problems at home. In fact, the economic policy of empire benefited elites and not the nation-state as a whole. Steel workers and coal miners, not to mention fast food workers, do not benefit from the United States having a squeeze on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In fact, economic hegemony abroad whipsaws workers at home. In an especially reprehensible example, America’s global power allowed corporations to take the lash to some of the empire’s first victims. In 1965, Fairchild Semiconductor received government subsidies to open a plant on Navajo Nation land in New Mexico. Originally employing 1,200 Navajos, the plant laid them off after Bureau of Indian Affairs subsidies ended. The company replaced them with white workers. Protests in the early seventies by the American Indian Movement brought enough bad press to Fairchild that it simply closed the plant in 1975 and moved overseas.15 Americans who live in this ruined palace find themselves looking at the bloody face of American empire when they see their paychecks. The symptoms of a country that’s a behemoth abroad but an orphan at home are seen in a fifty-year trajectory of declining wages, growing rates of suicide, terrifying gun violence, and both white rural and Black urban communities torn apart by violence and drug abuse. Nightmares made flesh stalked our collective dream life. 2.Elm Street WES CRAVEN’S The Last House on the Left (1972) felt so real, and so contemporary, that audiences struggled to watch it. The Hills Have Eyes (1977) offered an excruciating journey of terror for a suburban family stranded in the desert and facing a family of violent cannibals, their misshapen forms created by American atomic testing. What monsters could the former professor of philosophy pull from the American psyche next? Walking to a meeting in downtown L.A. in 1982, Craven’s mind wandered as he ran through his agenda and pondered recent books he’d read about Indonesian “dream demons.” Kenin tindah, as it’s called in Indonesia, is the experience widely known as sleep paralysis that some attribute to supernatural forces. Dream demons on his mind, Craven also came across a bizarre story of dozens of cases of “arhythmic heart failure” among Hmong immigrants to the United States. The CIA recruited the Hmong leadership in Vietnam, who lent soldiers and regional support bases to the United States in exchange for help controlling the South Asian heroin trade. By the 1980s, many had come to the United States, fleeing persecution from Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge and the communist government of Laos. And, as Craven read in a 1987 story in the Los Angeles Times, many of their young people began to inexplicably die from heart failure, seemingly while trapped in a nightmare. The syndrome even received an acronym, SUNDS, or sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome.16 While he wondered how to transform this odd phenomenon into a new horror tale, a solid bump to Craven’s shoulder wrested him out of his dark reverie. He looked at the source of the collision and, as if in a close camera shot, discovered a terrifying face suddenly filling the frame. He seemed, in Craven’s memory, badly scarred, and the image of a burn victim came to mind. We don’t know the name or the background of the man who collided with Craven that day. The director remembered a filthy sweater and battered hat. But what he most recalled was a very quick glimpse of a disfigured face underneath the floppy fedora and the snarl on the man’s face at the suit in his way. The experience left Craven shaken, much more than it should have. In all likelihood, he only imagined the more lurid details of the chance encounter. Whatever the case, the incident became the final ingredient in the grisly cauldron that birthed Freddy Krueger. A Nightmare on Elm Street opened in 1984, less than a week after the nation elected Ronald Reagan to a second term. Fred Krueger, as he’s called through most of the first film, has returned from the grave after the parents of Elm Street lynched and burned him alive, believing him “a filthy child murderer.” In his grungy afterlife, Krueger can enter the dreams of the children of Elm Street. He tortures his prey in the bleakest regions of sleep before ripping them apart in flumes of blood and gore. In Nightmare, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) became one of the templates of the final girl, joining Laurie Strode from Halloween in the growing pantheon of young women who, unlike their friends or their parents, summoned the bravery and bearing to fight a monster. Teenagers being stalked by a murderer certainly offered nothing new. Even the idea of suburban America transforming into a slaughterhouse rather than the destination of whites in flight was previously explored by John Carpenter’s Halloween. But something even stranger happened on the Elm Street of the American mind. The sheer savagery of Krueger, combined with his supernatural origins, set him apart from the slasher films that came before. Tobe Hooper’s postindustrial serial killers deep in the heart of Texas are probably much more frightening. But a decade later, it was Fred Krueger’s origin story and its implications that raised a chill on America’s collective spine. The first film suggests the ambiguity we expect in a post-Watergate world. Are we supposed to trust the story of Nancy’s mother, one of the parents who burned the human Freddy alive? She’s a decidedly low-functioning alcoholic and the living avatar of an unreliable narrator. It’s from her we learn Krueger was a “filthy child murderer.” Nancy’s father (played by John Saxon) is a corrupt police officer who also wants to hide the truth of what happened. The other parents of Elm Street join the conspiracy. They keep the secret from their children, the secret of how they made a monster. The story of Krueger proved popular enough to make the character an icon. Six sequels followed Craven’s original film, the only one he directed, or had very much engagement with at all. Departing from the formula of the first film, Fred Krueger soon became “Freddy,” famous for the corny one-liners delivered as he dispatched his victims, most of them the epitome of excruciating dad jokes if dad guffawed while he ripped open your intestines with razor-sharp knives attached to his scarred fingers. Why did such an unpleasant creature become one of the eighties’ most recognizable images? There’s a sense in which the horror Craven spliced together from moral panic and poverty and a strange footnote to the Vietnam War didn’t fit the eighties. Perhaps the answer is in the inferior sequels. Their churlish use of violence and victims, turning them into little more than props for Freddy to slice and dice, fit into a decade remembered as much for its cruelty as for Thriller and John Hughes comedies. The callous attitude of the sequels pervaded America’s Elm Streets throughout the decade. Some middle-class Americans held on to and even improved their status from the Reagan to the Bush to the Clinton years. By the 1990s, ignoring restrictions and regulations placed on the stock market during the Great Depression, millions of small investors became miniature Michael Milkens, making tens of thousands while buyouts, the leveraging of credit, austerity measures, and the strip-mining of corporate assets by CEOs shoveled tens of billions into the coffers of a tiny class of Americans. Meanwhile, homelessness exploded. The drop in real wages and the physical destruction of low-income housing accounted for some of those who appeared on sidewalks and under bridges and in private shelters. A peculiar alliance between civil liberty advocates and conservative budget hawks closed institutions and tossed Americans suffering from drug addiction, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and even severe schizophrenia onto the streets. African American men, abandoned in their illness and completely indigent, made up a significant portion of this population. Vietnam veterans accounted for about 10 percent of the homeless population in the 1980s.17 Attitudes toward the homeless and the working poor (often the same population) made Freddy’s woeful appearance a portent and a cause for panic. Notably, many of the monsters who stalked the slasher films of the eighties are portrayed not as handsome well-dressed Ted Bundys, but as workers eager to see your insides. Michael Myers, an escaped mental patient, wore the one-piece overalls of a car mechanic as he wielded his butcher knife. Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th series, dresses in the sequels like a cross between a dirt farmer and bricklayer. This proletariat of monstrosity appears in the tendency of white America to project monstrosity onto its fellow citizens. Ronald Reagan spoke of “welfare queens” taking advantage of the system, parasites that fed off the blood of hard-working Americans. Other conservative writers went further in their use of monstrous imagery, finding language that portrayed the working class and people of color as unnatural terrors. James Q. Wilson called the young urban poor “feral” and “presocial beings.”18 In the same year Craven unleashed his nightmare on America’s Elm Street, the film C.H.U.D. made the subtext of Freddy Krueger the glaringly obvious point. The title, standing for cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers, imagined the homeless population of New York City turned into hideous Lovecraftian horrors that emerged from the sewers to feed on the flesh of luckier Americans. The tagline for the film resounded with Americans nervous about how the country’s class consensus might not survive the growing gap in wealth, even with the increased policing of the urban working class. “They’re not staying down there, anymore!” the film’s posters warned. Crime statistics frightened many Americans in the seventies as the tectonic shifts in the economy caused theft and the violence associated with underground drug economies to flourish. However, despite the general impression most middle-class Americans shared in the eighties and nineties, crime against property in America declined rapidly. It became increasingly unlikely that you’d die at the hands of a stranger made “feral” by “the inner city.” However, between 1980 and 2008, families, friends, and acquaintances murdered one another with prolific enthusiasm, accounting for far more death than “gang-related” murders. During this period, nearly 80 percent of murder victims knew their killer and almost 42 percent of female homicides came at the hands of a romantic partner.19 The Republican right didn’t birth these monsters of the American mind alone. “New Democrats” found an effective issue in portraying themselves as crimefighters who gave police unions anything they asked for, built prisons at an alarming rate to warehouse an enormous portion of the population, and passed federal laws that resulted in brutally lengthy internments for, primarily, African American men. Not unlike in the early twentieth century, white supremacy at home provided a foundation for empire abroad. In the 1980s, the nation continued its fascination with slasher films, fearful of the serial murderer who surely lived on their version of Elm Street. They’d moved to the suburbs hoping to escape the “Black youths” that academics and a racist legal system convinced them terrorized urban centers. The costs of empire on the home front are substantial. The CIA’s inveterate willingness to partner with drug lords made the “war on drugs” an assault on African American communities. Defense spending cannibalized the American GDP and threw the social safety net on the bonfire. While fearful of violence at home, middle-class Americans proved generally willing to acquiesce to the Reagan administration’s policy of strategic homicidal outbursts abroad. Elm Street’s nightmares engulfed the world. 3.Waiting for the Antichrist “‘FROM THE eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother till man exists no more.’ The book of Revelation predicted it all.” So goes a well-known quote from the film The Omen (1976). Many viewers then and now think it is a quote from the Bible. They’d been prepped for the horrors of a satanic apocalypse by an unlikely source. Hal Lindsey appeared to have been grown in the incubation pod that produced every young white male of the sixties and seventies. Foregoing coats and ties and speaking with an easy Southern California accent that rolled words around like they came in and out with the tide, he favored sunglasses, hair just below the collar, and a grandiose moustache. His lean, youthful face always seemed on the verge of telling you to take it easy. His work carried a rather different message. “Imagine, cities like London, Paris, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago—obliterated!” Making free with exclamation marks and proclaiming catastrophe in an “oh holy wow, geez!” style, Lindsey’s 1970 The Late Great Planet Earth told a bleak tale of the coming rise of the Antichrist, explained that the book of Revelation foretold a Soviet invasion of Israel, and predicted “Red China” mobilizing against much of the rest of the world. The Antichrist would arrive on the world scene after Satan staged a mockery of Christ’s resurrection. The ideas in The Late Great Planet Earth seemed new and exciting, a bit like new religious movements such as the Unification Church or “the Jesus People.” In this it resembled another mass paperback best-seller of the era, Erich von Däniken’s Chariots of the Gods? Däniken created an imagined deep past in which, with nothing resembling evidence, he claimed aliens once visited the earth and directed human beings on the path toward civilization, building pyramids and perhaps even giving us a bit of extraterrestrial DNA to ease along our evolutionary climb. Lindsey also created a fantasy, this one about a human future fading into the horizon of otherworldly events. Gods and demons would fight their wars over us rather than give us aid, and the result would be a mass extinction event rather than human progress. Readers who combined a general openness to unsubstantiated claims and felt helpless to understand the tumultuous twentieth century formed a large majority of both Lindsey’s and Däniken’s readership. The short, simply written paperbacks suited the boomers who came of age during the Vietnam years. The need to find your own path, even if that path led to doomsday, combined with a tincture of very real intellectual curiosity circulated ideas meant to, as the slang of the era put it, blow your mind. Unfortunately, critical thinking has not always been a partner in the business of blowing minds. Aliens bearing gifts to ancient civilizations and the Antichrist showing up to end the show became a single mishmash of contradictory conceptions of the world. We should remember the sixties generation as working with SNCC or joining the Black Panthers, Students for a Democratic Society, or the National Organization for Women. We’d do an injustice to them if we ignored the very real changes in law and society their protests and their struggles manifested. But it’s also true that much of this generation watched through Jimi Hendrix’s purple haze while the great American protest movements marched by. Tobe Hooper caught the mood of the boomers in Poltergeist (1982), in a scene in which the family patriarch lies across the bed to smoke a joint and, counterintuitively, picks up where he left off in Ronald Reagan’s campaign biography. The big chill, indeed. Nixon used the term silent majority to suggest a sleeping giant of American conservativism who watched anti-war protests and the Black freedom struggle with disdain. He may have been on to something when he noted that young people who wanted radical social transformation represented a minority, even within the so-called counterculture. Proponents of “do your own thing” often actually meant it. One’s own thing might include political activism but could also mean falling headfirst into LSD rabbit holes, free ranging as an Ayn Randian, or joining “the Jesus People” and becoming the constituency for the modern “casual worship” megachurches. As Kurt Anderson pointed out in his book Fantasyland, “if it feels good, do it” can be a liberatory cry from sexual and emotional repression while at the same time mean that paying yourself four hundred times what you pay your employees is just finding your own truth. Anderson concludes, looking from our contemporary vantage, that the ethos of believing and doing anything you wish “powered the political right more than the political left.”20 In their uncertainty and political immaturity, the baby boomers became seekers who didn’t know where to look, examples of how many of those who wander are actually just really lost. Growing up in the prosperous sixties afforded them the chance to dally with all manner of nonsense. Luckily for American institutions, many of them followed Stokely Carmichael, Fred Hampton, Susan Faludi, Bella Abzug, and Tom Hayden into revolutionary movements for meaningful change. But entering adulthood, the world became more confusing. Aliens built the pyramids and the great monoliths of Easter Island? Maybe. The Bible as a way to interpret the news? Why not. The notions Lindsey’s ideas of Biblical prophecy proffered didn’t originate with him; these underground ideas have been around since the nineteenth century. Renegade religious thinkers in England and the United States first imagined the Bible predicting a series of catastrophic events culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The tree they planted would grow tangled, its offshoots as disparate as American fundamentalism, the Pentecostals, and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. These groups held few beliefs in common—in fact, they tended to see one another as heretical—but they all believed fervently that the world would end, that it would end in a very specific way, and that you could read the signs of the end in your daily newspaper. American fundamentalism exerted significant influence in the South and Midwest for most of the twentieth century. Adherents tended to be rural and lack formal education, marginalized even in moments of American prosperity. Their low-wage labor made capitalism in America work as they fed the nation from their farms, toiled in twelve-hour shifts in Southern textile mills, and worked the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma to slake the petro-thirst of the white-collar class and the American war machine. Some of their leaders rose to prominence as ministers of large Sun Belt churches or seminary professors. But for the most part they lived under the nation’s cultural radar and played much the same role in politics. Why vote when the end was nigh? Major social and cultural changes brought this group to the suburbs in a story beyond the bounds of the one being told here. But Lindsey’s influence on American politics and popular culture gave the most exotic elements of the group’s belief system a fecund pile of theological compost where it could bud and flourish. He succeeded with several gambits that fit the times like a leisure suit. Lindsey had the notion, at once brilliant in execution and sophomoric in intent, of phrasing the rather complicated prophetic schema of fundamentalism in So Cal English. His seeming hatred for language benefitted from the commercially useful side effect of dumbing down complex eschatological notions for the sinners dancing through the decade’s disco inferno. He told them they could find biblical prophecy in the daily paper while searching for a soulmate who loved piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Lindsey casually took his audience by the hand with breezy anecdotes about how sitting out in the warm California evening while tiki torches cast a pleasant glow on the lemon trees and wondering when the dinner party would start was a lot like the desire “from the beginning of time . . . to know what is going to happen in the future.” He promised the return of Christ would be “the ultimate trip.” The use of supernatural power by the Antichrist would allow this incarnation of the devil to become “the Big Cheese” in world affairs.21 Horror films already prepped Americans for the Antichrist, even though they didn’t mean to do it. In 1968, Roman Polanski directed Rosemary’s Baby, a terrifying spoof of a horror film, a self-aware horror film long before Scream. The Satanists who offer a very young Mia Farrow as the devil’s bride are intentionally hilarious. There’s not a black robe in sight among the hokey, upper-middle-class elderly who keep Jokes for the John on a chain in their bathroom. But they are also eager to launch a satanic millennium. In the parody of drive-in Satanism Americans experienced in B-grade features over the last decade, Polanski followed a similar formula to the arty burlesque of The Fearless Vampire Killers of the year before. But the film disturbed many viewers with its mention of abortion and the claustrophobia of Rosemary’s confinement by her controlling husband and his half-baked devil-worshipping friends. Although known for his own poisonous attitudes toward women—a rage fully on display in his violent rape of a thirteen-year-old, which led him to flee the country—Polanski unwittingly made a bleak feminist parable. By 1968, Polanski already displayed an unhealthy interest in the isolation, really the imprisonment, of women by their own “hysteria” in Repulsion (1965). Turning to adapt a novel, he wrote a script that follows Ira Levin’s book very precisely and forced a different meaning to emerge from Rosemary’s Baby. The coven of Upper West Side devil worshippers exercises a paternalist supervision of Rosemary through her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes). The film ends in the brutal breaking of Rosemary, her acquiescence to the value of motherhood even if her offspring does happen to have hooves for feet. It’s a diabolical version of the “feminine mystique” described by Betty Friedan in her 1963 best-seller of the same name. Friedan described the way prosperous white culture in the years after World War II exalted pregnancy and motherhood until “there is no other way [a woman] can even dream about herself.”22 Inaccurately, Rosemary’s Baby would later be noted, or perhaps blamed, for a flood tide of interest in all things occult. The roots of such fascination are deeper and even more peculiar. The alleged “rise of Satanism” owed much to religious conservatives like Lindsey, who believed, as one of his book titles insisted, that Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth. As Lindsey continued to fascinate the world and build a highly profitable media empire that included more books, television, radio, and even comic book adaptations of his apocalyptic imaginings, he increasingly suggested that the end of the world looked a lot like the fears of white, middle-class Americans. “Biblical prophecy,” it turns out, held a special place in its millennialist heart for the American empire. Lindsey’s story of the signs of the end looked a great deal like America’s Cold War–era concerns, giving a vigorous handshake to the far right’s most paranoid fantasies. He writes of visiting an unnamed “large university” near his home and speaks with horror of seeing students distributing literature about the treatment of Palestinians under the Israeli occupation. Lindsey warned grimly that this showed “communist” influence on “‘wars of liberation’ in countries around the world.” What if, he suggested to readers, we see an alliance of “several black African nations” with “the Arabs”? What indeed. Lindsey doesn’t bother to explain, but we know from the rest of his best-selling tract that readers are meant to assume it has something to do with the Antichrist, Satan, and the end of the world.23 Millennial movements have flourished throughout much of Christianity’s history. In most cases, belief in the apocalypse pushed true believers to shed worldly concerns. Around the year 1000, the turn of the millennium convinced many of the devout in western Europe that the end had come. They sold their earthly goods and waited with hope and trepidation for the Kingdom of God. Radical sects during the upheavals of the Protestant Reformation held property together in common, foreswore allegiance to princes and kings, and dissolved marriage ties in anticipation of the end. Even in twentieth-century America, millennial groups sometimes followed the logic of their convictions. The Jehovah’s Witnesses saw World War I as the beginning of judgment on all the nations, including the United States. For this opinion, the group’s leadership cadre faced a prison term of twenty years under the 1917 Espionage Act. In the late twentieth century, the infectious idea of apocalypse created the opposite effect. Americans should, according to Lindsey, continue to worry about the future of capitalism. In the 1970s, Sino-Soviet relations may have been at a low ebb, but Lindsey warned his readers that the goal of both was “total world conquest” that would mean “the total destruction of the capitalist system.” Echoing what would become an American mantra about defeat in Vietnam, Lindsey spread the false claim that the United States fielded a powerful military that “politicians” did not allow it to use. Meanwhile, as if reading from the script of one of the Fu Manchu films, Lindsey told his readers that the battle of Armageddon would come when an “incredible Oriental army of 200 million” tried to destroy Israel.24 America’s geopolitical foes are the bad guys even in the apocalypse. America’s unqualified support for the state of Israel grew out of this period. The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 meant the fulfillment of biblical prophecy for evangelicals. Meanwhile, Israel provided a U.S. foothold in the world’s leading oil-producing region after the Six-Day War and a brief chilliness in its relationship to Saudi Arabia. The end of the world did not mean the end of the empire, and, in fact, Lindsey and his cohort again and again insisted on “America’s special place in biblical prophecy.” Rosemary’s Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen sent screaming demons into theaters all over the United States. The years the devil stalked moviegoers are the very years Lindsey, and soon boatloads of imitators, hawked a similarly terrifying and titillating tale. It told of apocalypse and the coming of the Antichrist, visions of dark prophecy first born in the deserts of the ancient Near East, repackaged to explain how the United States—hell, even its economic system and global military reach—sat at the center of God’s plan for the universe. The growing evangelical movement attached itself to this strange notion that the end was nigh. Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority emerged in the late seventies, a grassroots group of evangelical, and a few Catholic and Jewish, clergy and their congregants who became one of the more effective lobby groups in American politics. Falwell’s message that the 1960s represented a sinkhole of moral depravity grew in part out of his own repudiation of the civil rights movement. He had preached vehemently against the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, called Martin Luther King Jr. a communist, and founded Lynchburg Christian Academy as one of the South’s many “seg academies,” private schools launched in the midst of the integration of public schools in order to preserve “whites only” education.25 Nixon was wrong about a silent majority, but Falwell did tap into the fears of a silent and numerically impressive minority. For them, the rise of second-wave feminism, a stereotyped conception of hippies and young people smoking pot, the gains of the civil rights movement, American defeat in Vietnam, and the very real decline in wages and subsequent economic stagnation all became muddled in their minds as one phenomenon. Falwell gave them a simple explanation, an Appalachian version of Hal Lindsey, telling them the Bible had something to say about all the things that bothered them in the newspaper. Rural evangelicals may have believed the world was not their home and stayed away from the voting booths. Falwell’s Moral Majority brought them out to vote for Ronald Reagan in the hundreds of thousands, contributing to his unprecedented landslide over Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election. Falwell’s message to evangelicals brought together a pied-colored set of ideas that seemed to have little consistency. Christian morality, he believed, called for women to take a subordinate role in marriage and society and for taxes to remain low. The United States had, he claimed, drifted away from God, but this heathen nation also needed to increase its defense spending exponentially. Prayers should begin every day of public school, and America should flex its military might in the Middle East. Conflicting, contradictory, and counterintuitive ideas didn’t matter. The religious right’s worldview fit with Reagan’s message of traditional virtues and America the omnipotent. The backlash against the progressive gains of the 1960s has never really left American politics. The idea of America in decline remained part of the Moral Majority’s message, even as the colossal power of the country touched nearly every corner of the globe. While Americans watched truck commercials from Reagan ally Lee Iacocca that asserted “the pride is back,” evidence mounted that the new president would make sure America’s client states and rivals alike knew that the United States would put boots on the ground and bombers in the air. Reagan wondered aloud in a phone call with an Israeli lobbyist if the end of the world approached and if “the signs foretelling Armageddon” might be true. He certainly wanted to make sure the United States came out on top of any apocalyptic struggle.26 4.Serpents and Rainbows GEORGE H. W. BUSH had, before becoming vice president, called Reagan’s notion of free market adventurism “voodoo economics.” He found the term ready at hand with so much talk of voodoo in the air in the 1980s, so much that it rivaled the American thirties and forties. In American theaters of the eighties, fear of Caribbean dark magic made it seem like the midcentury zombie made an unfortunate comeback. Major films like The Believers, starring Martin Sheen, portrayed Cuban Santeria as a dangerous death cult flourishing in Florida, not unrelated to the American panic of “satanic covens” out to sacrifice everything from your house cat to your kid. An interest in the often frighteningly exploitative cannibal genre shared this imperial view of primitive peoples up to no good. Italian films like Cannibal Holocaust (1980) and Cannibal Ferox (1981) found an audience with the VHS generation. These unwatchable films not only showed buckets of fake gore and some very nasty, and very real, animal cruelty. They also assumed a vile racism that suggested to American viewers that Latin America was lousy with cannibals. Haiti remained a special American obsession. In Angel Heart (1987), Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet dance with the devil in the form of Robert De Niro, who uses New Orleans voodoo to entrap souls. Angel Heart pulled out all the stops in using stereotypes of Haitian voodoo, tying it to depraved sexuality, murder, and a general sensibility of “primitivism” not too dissimilar from what Americans once watched in White Zombie or King of the Zombies. The Wes Craven–directed The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) is a film set in Haiti and loosely, very loosely, based on a popular book by ethnobotanist Wade Davis. The story centers around Bill Pullman, portraying an extremely handsome anthropologist action hero, investigating the possibility of creating a “super anesthetic” from the concoction of powders he believes accounts for the phenomenon of Haitian zombies. Pullman’s character, Alan, arrives in Haiti in the waning days of the regime of “Baby Doc” Duvalier, the dictator of Haiti in the 1980s, long propped up by the United States, as was his father, known as Papa Doc. The Duvaliers ruled Haiti since 1957 and received significant American support. The U.S. Marines trained the Duvalier family’s terrifying Tonton Macoute in 1959. An organization somewhere between a secret police and paramilitary force, utterly loyal to the Duvalier family, they took their name from a frightening Haitian fairy-tale monster that carries off unruly children to cannibalize them in the night. Duvalier’s private army lived up to their name, disappearing political opponents and their supporters in the small hours. Under their vicious commander Luckner Cambronne, who earned the nickname “Vampire of the Caribbean” for his cruelty, they engaged in systemic violence against the Haitian people, murdering as many as sixty thousand Haitians during the Duvaliers’ twenty-nine-year reign. We do not have adequate statistics of the mass rapes or random assaults, mayhem, and murders that made the Macoute deeply feared.27 Papa Doc was followed by his son “Baby Doc” Duvalier, who ruled with the same mixture of fringe Vodun beliefs and political terror, along with an even closer relationship to the United States. Both father and son had, at different times, offered some symbolic statements of independence from the United States and even an attenuated Black nationalism. This posturing hid their role in the American plan to encircle Cuba both economically and geographically. Craven certainly had a great deal to work with in terms of real-world political suppression mixed with the hint of supernatural evil. Vodun had long been an important spiritual tradition in Haiti. But like most spiritual traditions, it can be used as a weapon. The Duvalier dictatorship did just that, encouraging the people to see themselves and the Macoute as Vodun masters (bokor) who would work wicked conjure on anyone who defied the regime. Davis suggested that Duvalier had managed to bring the regional heads of Vodun societies under his sway (bizango) and created what he called “a shadow government” that kept the people frightened and obedient.28 Critics noticed the film’s political subtext. The February 5, 1988, review in The New York Times described the film’s plot as dependent on the crimes of the Duvalier regime and the reputation of “the dreaded Tontons Macoute security force.” The review also offered the important insight that the politics of the film likely felt “confusing” to viewers. The Serpent and the Rainbow is a very different film from White Zombie or other B-grade fare from the earlier decades that offered simple messages of white supremacy. Haitian characters are given personal agency. A Haitian doctor, Marielle Duchamp, assists Pullman’s Harvard botanist in the struggle against the Tonton Macoute leader Peytraud, revealed to be a bokor (literally a wizard who will “work with both hands,” performing good and evil for money) who tortures his own people and, of course, turns them into zombies. Peytraud offered audiences a serious and convincing villain, unlike the many earlier European zombie masters. He’s balanced by Celine, a houngan priest of Vodun who represents the positive aspects of the religious tradition. Although Craven’s liberal impulses are certainly on display, The Serpent and the Rainbow ultimately acts to justify the American empire. Pullman’s Dr. Alan remains the hero throughout and he, not the Haitian houngan, defeats Peytraud at the end and rescues Dr. Duchamp as well. In another poorly considered plot point, Duchamp becomes Alan’s sidekick and lover. This is highly fraught in a context where colonization had always meant sexual exploitation by white men, from the days of enslaved people in the sugarcane fields through the country’s history of invasion and occupation by first French forces in the early nineteenth century and then multiple U.S. interventions in the twentieth. The final scene in The Serpent and the Rainbow shows us a celebration in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, as the people gleefully take their vengeance on the Tonton Macoute. This revolt against Duvalier’s regime did occur in 1986, much to the consternation of the Reagan administration, who had so valued Duvalier’s anti-Cuban, anti-communist stance that it used the American taxpayers’ money to fund his two-million-dollar wedding. The real cost of U.S. support for the Duvaliers had been paid by the Haitian people. Along with backing the Duvaliers’ use of terror, the U.S. agricultural department had called for the killing of the country’s entire pig population after an outbreak of swine flu. Duvalier acquiesced, and Haitian peasants, the majority of the country, saw their tiny incomes evaporate. By 1983, an organized challenge to Duvalier’s regime emerged and a full-fledged uprising occurred in January of 1986. The CIA provided Duvalier with a plan to escape to France with his family, where he went into an early retirement with a fortune of as much as eight hundred million dollars U.S.29 In the climactic celebration of The Serpent and Rainbow, Dr. Duchamp turns to Pullman’s white savior and in the last line of the film says, “the nightmare is over!” The man who had given us an ongoing nightmare on America’s Elm Street perhaps couldn’t be trusted as the most reliable forecaster for the shadowy climate of dream and nightmare. For Haiti, and much of the Caribbean, the American imperial nightmare continued. Lesser, and more explicitly racist, imitators followed. Voodoo Dolls (1991) could have been made in the 1950s, its Black male villain wearing bones around his neck and proving his perfidy by lusting after a white woman. The 1984 Zombie Island Massacre kills its zombie in the first fifteen minutes and largely exists to indulge the decade’s fascination with gratuitous female nudity. Yet, it still made it clear to audiences that the “exotic islands” (maybe the Caribbean, maybe the Pacific) are filled with dangerous native magic threatening to white people. Audiences may have devoured these films and their racist implications right along with their popcorn, not giving much thought to either. But reviewers took notice. The renowned critic Roger Ebert began his 1987 review of The Believers by saying “Here’s another one of those movies where a Caribbean voodoo cult wants to practice a blood sacrifice . . . Can’t they think of anything new to make a movie about?” Ebert went on to confess his own ignorance of the Caribbean religion, and notably he does use the generic American slang voodoo to talk about Cuban Santeria. But he reminded his readers that usually when Hollywood dealt with religion it told a story of “peace and love and friendship.” But this new raft of films “are always about guys with blank eyes who stare at you for 10 seconds and you’re volunteering to wring the chickens’ necks yourself.”30 The return of this subgenre of horror, the Caribbean zombi suddenly as popular as George A. Romero’s apocalyptic hordes, didn’t reflect on American politics. It represented a new funhouse mirror of the dark carnival that legitimized and justified racism at home while weaponizing American power abroad. It distracted from the zombie republics the United States continued to create abroad with the necromancy of corporate and military power. Moreover, the films constructed an ugly fantasy about dangers to the empire’s heartland. The United States, often celebrating itself as a “nation of immigrants,” has also been the nation of anti-immigrant sentiment. Along with the bleak irony of racism toward the forced immigrants of West Africa, distaste for the Chinese people (and Asians more generally) became a feature of nineteenth- and twentieth-century life. Racism directed at Mexican and other Latinx peoples oozed into public life even in parts of the West where Mexicans became “immigrants” only after the United States seized half their nation in the late 1840s and thousands found themselves on the wrong side of their own border. A new round of nativism emerged, particularly focused on Haitians and other Caribbean immigrants. During the 1970s, tens of thousands of Haitians, fleeing the Duvalier regime, arrived in all manner of rickety vessels in an effort to enter the United States. The Coast Guard returned many. Others allowed to enter spent months in detention centers with barbed wire fences, a practice ruled illegal by a federal court in 1982. The year 1980 became the high-water mark of attempted Haitian immigration with about fifteen thousand Haitians entering the country. Detained and not told of their right to request political asylum, they faced racial prejudice and the false belief that the new immigrants bore responsibility for the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The Reagan administration further undercut efforts by immigrants fleeing a catastrophe the United States helped to create by refusing to admit that political repression occurred in Haiti. Indeed, records of discussions in the Reagan White House reveal administration officials taking a hard line against Haitian immigrants, and Caribbean immigrants in general, referring to them in a 1981 memo as “undesirables.”31 American prejudices against immigrants found another focus in the Mariel boatlift (April to October 1980). Slightly improved relations between Cuba and the United States had led Fidel Castro to decree that any Cuban who had a U.S. contact could leave from Mariel Harbor. More than fifteen thousand did so in a few weeks, overwhelming U.S. immigration services. The Cuban government certainly benefitted from this, getting rid of political dissidents, and simultaneously handing the U.S. government an influx of tens of thousands of new immigrants in a short period. Carter used the Coast Guard to blockade the island, but Castro’s goals had been achieved. There’s no doubt that he decided on a “love it or leave it” attitude toward the migrants and found it an effective way to poke at the United States, whose intelligence operatives attempted to assassinate him at least sixteen times between 1962 and 2014.32 The Mariel boatlift, and the ongoing story of the “Haitian boat people,” seemed a new danger to many white Americans. Latin America remained nightmare country in the white supremacist imagination, only palatable when firmly under American imperial control. Puerto Rico continued to be a colony of the United States, and successive Democratic and Republican administrations denied it representation of any kind, including electoral votes. Unlike Hawaii and Alaska, it did not have a white majority. Hollywood responded with all manner of racist caricatures of everything south of Texas and Florida. Angel Heart featured tough-talking detectives referring to Haitians as being “into voodoo and all that shit.” Films like the enormously popular Scarface (1983) may have glamorized Al Pacino’s Tony Montana as the ultimate OG for some. Mainstream audiences read it as a manic coming-to-America story that portrayed Cuban immigrants as vicious, violent criminals. The far right continues to make use of the myth of Castro emptying out prisons and mental institutions, and even sending spies, into the United States. As he began to eye a political career in 2011, Donald Trump repeated the baseless claim and compared it to immigration from Mexico. In the Trump administration, it became a talking point for Stephen Miller, Trump’s speechwriter and advisor who has ties to various white supremacist organizations and leaders.33 5.Ain’t Got Time to Bleed WHITE AMERICANS, agitated by the movies, now worried their island neighbors were zombie-raising witch doctors with a penchant for communism. So they tended to support their government as it flexed its muscles in the Caribbean and Latin America. The 1983 invasion of Grenada received condemnation from around the world even as it elicited cheers at home. Although seven thousand American troops landed on the island, they faced more of a struggle than expected from the tiny number of Cuban soldiers and construction workers. Nineteen American service members died and more than one hundred were wounded in a protracted firefight, some from friendly fire and operational accidents. Cuban resistance brought down nine U.S. helicopters. Despite this deadly misadventure, the military handed out no less than 8,612 medals for the operation.34 “Our days of weakness are over,” Reagan announced in the debacle’s aftermath, “our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall.” This assertion aside, Reagan’s renowned rhetorical powers failed him. At first, he insisted the assault had been “a rescue” rather than “an invasion,” an attempt to get out American medical students who, it turned out, did not want to leave. Reagan tried to shift the story by claiming the island had been on the brink of becoming “a Soviet-Cuban base” that would “export terrorism.” In this version, Reagan could assure Americans they arrived “just in time.”35 Horror films at this time played out such fantasies in a fashion not dissimilar from the horror science fiction of the fifties, featuring Americans tangling with evil forces amid steaming jungles in exotic, nameless lands. The best, or perhaps the worst, example is the film Predator (1987). Arnold Schwarzenegger played a covert ops specialist everyone simply calls Dutch (Ronald Reagan’s nickname in the real world) while Carl Weathers portrayed CIA agent Dillon, who co-opts Dutch’s outfit for a rescue mission “across the border” in an unfriendly, unnamed Latin American nation. (The context and the year essentially tell us covert operations are based in Honduras and entering Nicaragua.) The first forty-five minutes of Predator offers a right-wing black ops fantasy about a dirty war. Dutch and Dillon lead their small band into the jungle and assault a camp of guerillas, slaughtering them with relative ease. Dillon discovers “secret documents” that explain that “Soviet advisors” are on the way. “We got here just in time,” he says, echoing Reagan’s claims after the invasion of Grenada. The film makes numerous visual and direct references to Vietnam. Both Dutch and Dillon are veterans, and Dillon tells the brawny character Blain (played by wrestler and later governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura) that the two had fought together in Vietnam, specifically the costly Battle of Hue. Not only is Blain unimpressed, he spits on Dillon’s boot. It’s an incredibly peculiar moment given the long-lived myth that Vietnam veterans returned to be “spit on by hippies.” In Predator, the black ops soldiers of America’s dirty wars are the ones who spit on Vietnam veterans. Making the scene even stranger, we learn that Ventura’s character had been in Cambodia and up to no good in the 1970s, fighting a secret war with the CIA while the draftees lost in Vietnam. Like most action films in the eighties, Predator burns testosterone like jet fuel with lots of cigar chomping, dramatic hundred-yard stares, and Ventura delivering lines like “I ain’t got time to bleed.” In fact, he finds plenty of time to bleed when the film’s titular monster appears and rips most of his internal organs out of his body. The Predator, which a short scene reveals to be an extraterrestrial, can camouflage himself with invisibility and packs an array of frightening weaponry. It’s the compendium of American fears in Vietnam and other imperial adventures that dates to the wars against First Nations peoples. There’s an enemy striking from the shadows with unrestrained ferocity, and who knows what weapons they might be able to use against us? The film’s setting in an indeterminate jungle places it alongside Bride of the Gorilla and King of the Zombies as films that imagined Americans fighting the good fight against overwhelming odds in frightening and geographically amorphous jungles. Predator received much bigger box office numbers than those films, however, becoming number one in June of ’87 and raking in many times its budget while spawning a franchise of sequels, comics, and video games, one of the latter appearing as recently as 2020. Film critic Dean Lamanna dismissed Predator in Cinefantastique as a “militarized monster movie.” But clearly the America public responded to this fantasy of American foreign policy. Sure, the nightly news might be trying to tell us about U.S.-funded death squads in Central America or the incompetent invasion of a tiny island for reasons even Reagan struggled to explain. But this popcorn flick showed Dutch standing toe to toe with the alien menace in the film’s silly climax and winning. The eighties and nineties represent a continuation of the country’s long belief, stretching back to the Monroe Doctrine (1823), that Latin America belonged in its sphere of influence. The Reagan years became an active convalescence period in which public opinion sought therapy for “the Vietnam syndrome,” a phrase Reagan used to describe an alleged weakness of nerve in American foreign policy after 1975. In a bleak irony, psychiatrists originally used the phrase to describe the snake’s nest of symptoms Vietnam veterans experienced, symptoms defined as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980. The dirty wars of Latin America offered a new jungle to refight Vietnam. Meanwhile, American culture would also find itself in a dirty war at home, its collateral damage igniting similar horrors in American allies and client states. 6.God Is Dead! Satan Lives! TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD ERICKA Ingram of Olympia, Washington, attended a spiritual retreat in the summer of 1988. Many young people in this period, from teenagers to twentysomethings, became attracted to what has usually been called Charismatic Christianity, a spiritual movement that emphasizes divine healing, the casting out of demons, and other miraculous spiritual gifts (charismatic coming from the New Testament Greek word for “gifts” rather than from our modern usage). Amid late-night sing-alongs and bull sessions that made the retreat like a Christian summer camp experience, the organizers invited a former stand-up comedian turned minister and alleged healer named Karla Franko to speak. One of the charisms that Franko claimed to exercise was a gift of discernment, a kind of divination allegedly guided by the Holy Spirit. During a worship service, Franko pointed to Ericka and told her she had been molested by her father. Ericka cried but reportedly did not respond to this bizarre assertion. Several weeks after this incident, Ericka and her younger sister Julie accused their father of not only molesting them, but also forcing them to take part in sickening satanic rituals, and even sacrificing victims to the devil and burying the bodies under a barn in the family’s backyard. Local police arrested their father based only on these accusations, but the oddity of the case didn’t end there. Ericka and Julie’s father, Paul Ingram, worked in the Thurston County Sherriff’s Office for nearly seventeen years, headed the local Republican Party, and served as a stalwart member of the family’s fundamentalist congregation, the Church of Living Water. Ingram himself slowly began to believe that he had, in fact, done precisely what his daughters accused him of and gave a meandering, contradictory confession. What happened in the apparently happy household? Did the head of a satanic cult viciously abuse his daughters then hide in plain sight as one of Olympia’s most respected citizens? Had Satanists, as Ingram’s daughters suggested, infiltrated a police department and the entire community?36 None of these sensational claims held even a trifling amount of truth. Forensic experts did not find bodies concealed under the old barn. Both daughters proved unreliable witnesses with increasingly erratic accusations about judges, police, and social workers who also belonged to their father’s satanic cult. Ericka claimed to be scarred over much of her body from years of abuse, but a medical exam revealed no evidence of physical trauma—a fact she explained away by suggesting Satan made the wounds invisible. Paul Ingram’s “confession” was in part suggested to him by the family’s pastor, who urged him to believe he’d been possessed by demons and could not recall the hideous acts committed through him. Ingram would remain in prison until 2003 and was forced to register as a sex offender at the time of his release.37 The Ingram daughters, though morally and perhaps legally culpable for a series of false accusations, became victims of a national fantasy. Like millions of Americans, they were utterly convinced that satanic covens operated freely in Reagan’s America. A satanic panic had seized up the country’s central nervous system. The origins of the satanic panic are complex. Rumors of Satanists mutilating cattle became common in the 1970s. Tales of mysterious cattle mutilation had long been a feature of ranch life in the American West. Cows are, of course, rather low on the world’s food chain, frequently victims of wolves, coyotes, or venomous snakes. Smaller predators then devour the softer bits of the corpse in a way that makes it appear “mutilated.” Such acts were often blamed on Native American people and later, after the forties and fifties, flying saucer mania, as evidence of extraterrestrial activity. Satan’s new role as box office star gave the legend a plot and a script. Rosemary’s Baby, meant as a parody of social conventions about pregnancy, left many convinced of the reality of satanic covens, believing that even your neighbors could be in on the plot. Horror films dealing with the devil have played a powerful and unconventional role in shaping what Americans are willing to believe. The Exorcist made parish phones ring off the hook all around the country after 1973. The Omen, despite borrowing only selectively from Hal Lindsey and his readers’ end-of-the-world fetish, confirmed that the devil and his offspring prepared for the final conflict, a phrase that became the subtitle of the third sequel. An obsession with murderous cults further shaped the Satanism scare. The Manson murders were ascribed to devil worship in all manner of public accounts of the crimes, even if Satan did not play a particularly important role in Charles Manson’s peculiar blend of mysticism and murder. However, both Ed Sanders and Maury Terry, with no evidence but the lack of evidence they were wrong, helped spread this notion. In fact, Terry’s career of misinformation recently received a popular, highly cynical, “true crime” documentary on Netflix called The Sons of Sam in which we hear his meandering conceptions of links between Manson, David Berkowitz, and murderous gangs of devil-worshippers presented in a slick fashion likely to confuse a new generation of Americans. These ideas may have remained in the hazy twilight world of pop theology, what contemporary people think they know about religion from what they see at the movies, nervousness about those damn hippies, and a very generalized fear of social change in the sixties. But the political climate of the 1980s, one in which religion mixed indiscriminately with governance and the president felt comfortable calling our nuclear rival “an evil empire,” allowed the ancient concept of Satan to seem very real. Anxiety about empire played a larger role in the Satanism scare than historians, modern folklorists, and sociologists have conceded in the past. Like ancient Rome panicking over the frenzied cult of the Bacchae, Americans whispered tales of evil cults, serial killers, and secret covens. Roman angst over the worship of the Greek god Dionysus came, like their fear of Christianity, from a sense that foreign, evil influences could introduce chaos into the machinery of empire. In eighties America, the idea of an omnicompetent Satanist conspiracy tied together a vast number of fears, anxieties, and hatreds related to the changing role of women, the sexual revolution, the Cold War, and the American empire walking with a noticeable limp in the post-Vietnam era. And so the United States experienced a mass delusion. Across the country, claims of a well-organized criminal network of Satanists seized the darkest parts of the religious imagination. Books appeared like Michelle Remembers, whose author claimed her psychiatrist (and later husband) Lawrence Pazder enabled her to recover memories of a childhood filled with the most bizarre forms of sexualized, ritualized abuse. Other influential books followed, many by evangelicals who suddenly became “occult experts.” Accusations that children fell victim to satanic covens exploded, especially at day care centers. The McMartin preschool case in Manhattan Beach, California, became the longest trial in American history. Law enforcement and a covey of evangelical ministers encouraged parents in the belief that their children had been victims of Satanists who used the preschool as a front. In hundreds of communities, rumors of Satanists holding Black Mass in the woods sometimes brought out armed posses of citizens on a hunt for the alleged coven.38 In 1988, police in Jamestown, New York, contended with a massive rumor panic that led to attacks on a warehouse used as a practice space for local bands, armed vigilantes showing up at a local park, and the rumor that a Satanic cult planned to sacrifice a blue-eyed, blonde virgin on Friday the thirteenth. In the local paper, law enforcement insisted they found no evidence of any kind of secretive, criminal activity, which further incited the panic. Locals saw police denials as an odd sort of proof that either they did not wish to panic the community about a real threat, or that the police were in fact part of the conspiracy. But, as often as not, American law enforcement fanned these flames. One exhaustive study of police involvement in the satanic panic called Occult Cops found many law enforcement officers setting themselves up as “occult experts.” Almost all fit a basic template: male, white, deeply conservative, born-again Protestants aggrieved at their inability to rise higher in the law enforcement hierarchy, careers often dead-ended by their own lack of interest in the nuts and bolts of basic police work. Many of these men played some role in the prosecution of anti-war protestors and Black freedom struggle organizations in the sixties and seventies.39 The “occult experts,” often collaborating with evangelical leaders who also pretended knowledge of a vast Satanist conspiracy, held enormous influence over public perception and even the training of police. In 1987, Greenville County, South Carolina, law enforcement took a training course in combatting Satanism. Along with a description of occult symbols clearly borrowed from films, officers received a course in fundamentalist theology. The manual accused Christian churches of having not taken the existence of the devil seriously. The course provided absolutely no information, except in the most general terms (“reports from around the country”), that human sacrifice, particularly of children, was taking place on a large scale.40 The support of local officials and police departments linked with a surprising number of therapists and social workers now attached to the notion of Satanic ritual abuse, or SRA, as a social and psychological phenomenon. Although today rejected by mental health professionals, the idea created a surprisingly large network of supporters and sometimes made for the oddest of political alliances. Gloria Steinem believed stories of “ritual abuse” and, as late as 1993, published an issue of Ms. magazine with the cover story demanding the reader “BELIEVE IT! Cult Ritual Abuse Exists.”41 We’ve barely touched on the hundreds of local outbreaks or the related moral panic over heavy metal music and Dungeons & Dragons. Luckily, the era of “the satanic panic” has received a significant amount of attention and for good reasons. Except for America’s cyclical “red scares,” a moral panic that at least found some basis in the rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union, no other falsehood in U.S. history became so widely believed. In some quarters, to raise doubts about the existence of a powerful satanic conspiracy became proof you were in on it. American imperial power assured that Satanism scares in the metropole slithered into the colonies and client states abroad. The reverberation of the satanic panic was seen around the world, nowhere more than in parts of Africa where the United States maintained a strong military and, for a century, missionary presence. American special forces and the CIA engaged in covert operations all over the continent of Africa in the seventies and eighties, just as they had in the earlier days of the Cold War. The United States supported a South African invasion of Angola to end a civil war there when the leftist National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) seemed on the verge of winning on the ground and in the hearts and minds of Angolans. A declassified National Security Council document, though heavily redacted, shows Henry Kissinger and President Ford discussing an arms package to Angola’s right-wing guerrillas and their South African supporters. The document raises the possibility of allowing the state of Angola to collapse rather than take a socialist turn. Ford later attempted to change the narrative of America’s involvement by explaining that the United States intervened only after Fidel Castro sent Cuban forces to aid FNLA, a claim that does not match the timeline of events. Other declassified documents reveal that Kissinger urged an air strike against Cuba for aiding African revolutionaries.42 As U.S. money, arms, and assets swarmed over the continent, evangelical missionaries brought an American brand of Christianity, and an American terror of Satan, to the continent. “Charismatic” churches in particular took their emphasis on deliverance from demons and combined them with an African worldview of a universe throbbing with various kinds of supernatural powers. These variants of American Christianity saw exponential growth in numerous African nations, with scholars even referring to a “Pentecostal explosion” on the continent.43 Apartheid South Africa had long been viewed as an important Cold War American ally. Desperate to defend the racist social structures that penned Black South Africans into “homelands,” the white supremacist government of South Africa also proved reliably anti-communist. Thanks to a series of arms deals with Israel, it also formed an alliance with the bulwark of U.S. policy in the Middle East.44 America also gave South Africa a bad case of the satanic panic. Not surprisingly, it appeared in a highly racialized form. As the system of apartheid increasingly came under attack and global support flowed to the imprisoned Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress, white South Africans (Afrikaners) became convinced that Satanic rituals, which they often conflated with traditional African religious practices, threatened their children with “rape, murder, cannibalism and all manner of atrocities.”45 The white-dominated government started an Occult Related Crimes Unit, headed by evangelical Christian Adriaan Vlok. The unit would later be broken up and replaced by essentially the same organization with a more rational-sounding name, the Harmful Religious Practices Unit. Since 2012, this police organization kept the satanic panic alive by claiming to investigate “vampirism,” cases of possession, and that perpetual obstacle to the rule of law . . . “astral coercion.” America’s satanic panic made its way to Africa as mass culture as well. A film produced with the help of Charismatic missionaries became popular in Nigeria in the early 1990s. Living in Bondage took African folklore and combined it with Western notions of Satan. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the book Snatched from Darkness became a best-seller. The evidence-free screed closely followed the template of American evangelicals in claiming a large satanic conspiracy, brewed dangerously with some traditional African beliefs about witchcraft and evil spirits. Over the decades, the cost to the people of Africa has been enormous, with tens of thousands executed for witchcraft, and Christian leaders in, for example, Uganda fighting for legislation that would make being an LGBTQ person a crime punishable by death.46 The imperial dimension of America’s Satan obsession also appeared, not surprisingly, on the troubled southern border. The United States had long seen Mexico as a source of anxiety, sending invading armies across the Rio Grande to make amphibious assaults at Veracruz, or alternatively trying to wall off their neighbor. “So far from God, so close to the United States,” runs the weary Mexican joke. In 1989, Americans latched on to a horrific story that coiled together their nervousness about the border and the satanic panic. An American college student, Mark Kilroy, went missing while spring breaking in Matamoros, a province just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Local authorities discovered his body, along with fourteen others, buried in a mass grave. All the corpses bore evidence of torture. American media reported the death of Kilroy as the work of “a drug cult” or a “satanic cult.” Even the restrained reporting of The New York Times quoted Brownsville officials claiming an “occult” group sought to create “a magical shield” around themselves with “a twisted blend of sacrificial and black magic practices from Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica.” The Mexicans had sacrificed a fresh-faced American youth to Satan.47 The facts of the case are no less grisly than fans of the satanic panic believed, though the truth does not fulfil their strange fantasies. Adolfo Constanzo, the head of the drug ring responsible for the murders, did present himself to natives of the region, and some of his own henchmen, as a practitioner of “black magic.” However, not unlike a miniature version of the Duvalier regime, he claimed supernatural power only to inspire fear and obedience. And his inspiration for this idea? A horror film fan, he particularly enjoyed The Believers (1987), which mixed its Hollywood schlock and shock with a smattering of ideas stolen from traditional African religions in Cuba. In the feedback loop of the satanic panic, America produced films about evil cults that provided fodder for drug lords, whose actions in turn fueled Satanism fever.48 7.Norman Rockwell Is Burning in Hell THE SATANIC panic offered the Reagan administration a perfect Greenbaum effect. Not unlike the illusory notions about flying saucers and invading aliens, the panic made Americans open to all manner of false conspiracy theories. Much like the 1950s, these public obsessions allowed actual conspiracies to flourish. Once again, Americans proved themselves willing to listen to baseless assertions, and express some belief in them, even as the national security state and the executive branch hatched more complex, but very real, intrigues to further the demands of the American empire. During this era, Corydon Hammond, at one time a leading figure at the University of Utah School of Medicine, made a career with his tales of the satanic Greenbaum, a wandering Jew with ties to Nazism. He often insisted to his rapt listeners that he feared assassination for the “secrets” he shared. Hammond managed to draw NASA and the Mafia into his League of Super Evil Evildoers.49 The deluded ideas of QAnon have the DNA of Hammond’s claims, particularly his insistence that satanic kill squads kidnapped, programmed, and sometimes sacrificed kids on American army bases. These same groups, Hammond told therapists, also made money from drugs and arms sales. Such notions offered a gift to America’s intelligence community. There may have been no Satanists involved in gunrunning, but the CIA and the Reagan administration certainly sold armaments for advantage and security interests, sans the black robes and pentagrams. In a century’s worth of criminal behavior on behalf of the American empire, the Iran-Contra affair (1985–1987) stands out. Its reality is dark enough. The fact that it did not become a new Watergate and instead set the stage for open, unpunished criminality at the highest levels of government makes the story feel all too contemporary. The Sandinista National Liberation Front seized power from the far-right and deeply repressive Somoza regime of Nicaragua in 1979. They named themselves after Augusto Sandino, who had led opposition to an American invasion of Nicaragua in the late twenties and again in the thirties. The Sandinista regime became largely popular in Nicaragua, instituting rural health care and a major literacy program. In 1984, the country held a free election that consolidated Sandinista power. Most Americans were not aware of the events in Nicaragua, and few probably cared. But the Reagan administration held the absolute conviction that, against a great deal of evidence, the Soviets turned Nicaragua into a satellite. The CIA trained anti-government forces across the border in the client state of Honduras. These forces, the Contras, started as a ragtag group of mercenaries and criminals. American handlers turned them into something much more lethal. The CIA urged the guerrillas to attack “soft targets”—rural schools and medical clinics—that would endanger Sandinista popularity. Duane “Dewey” Clarridge, American liaison on the ground, admitted to Congress that the Contras executed doctors, nurses, teachers, and judges. “After all,” he said of these illegal covert operations against civilians, “this is a war.”50 The Reagan administration funded these horrors in secret, hidden from the American people and Congressional oversight. Congress passed the Boland Amendment in 1982 forbidding the funding of anti-Sandinista forces. The Reagan administration circumvented Congress. A secret enclave within the administration and the intelligence community used hundreds of millions in loans from American ally Saudi Arabia and raised hundreds of millions more in illegal arms sales to Iran. In their view, the secret arms deal with Iran paid double dividends, raising money for the Contras and securing the release of American hostages held in Lebanon (though religious extremists in Iran quickly took more hostages for future collateral against the United States). Cash now flowed to the Contra leadership through the hands of drug traffickers (including CIA asset Manual Noriega) and various non-state actors. These covert operations allowed the United States to stage-manage a Nicaraguan “civil war” that otherwise would not have existed. Israel, which joined the United States as one of the world’s leading arms dealers, even participated in the effort, doing business on behalf of the United States with its sworn enemy Iran.51 Oliver North, a marine who suffered severe trauma in Vietnam and subsequently turned to fundamentalist Christianity for succor, directed much of the program, coordinating with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and the CIA. North gathered a remarkably unsavory group of drug dealers, including Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and Félix Rodriguez, an international terrorist and CIA asset who exploded a bomb on a civilian Cuban passenger jet in 1976 that killed seventy-three people. Rodriguez worked with the CIA since the Bay of Pigs invasion and aided Bolivian authorities in the murder of Che Guevara in 1967.52 In October of 1986, a young Nicaraguan soldier downed an American cargo plane with a ground-to-air missile launcher. Nicaraguan investigators discovered the plane packed with sophisticated weapons systems intended for the Contras. The survivor of the downed aircraft, former marine and CIA agent Eugene Hasenfus, sang like a bird at daybreak about the entire story of arms for hostages, illegal fund transfers, and the role of some of the worst international terrorists on the planet in the Unites States’ effort to stage a civil war.53 The Iranian government, as Reagan’s advisors should have realized, proved more than happy to tell the world their side of the story. A special counsel launched an investigation, as did Congress. Reagan’s advisors George Shultz and James Baker warned the president from the beginning that the plot constituted a textbook example of an impeachable offense.54 CIA director William J. Casey and George H. W. Bush reassured Reagan but the evidence of “high crimes and misdemeanors” grew exponentially. After learning that, without the knowledge of Congress and even other branches of the armed services, the CIA had mined Nicaragua’s harbors, right-wing stalwart Barry Goldwater angrily denounced the administration’s actions. The infamously fiery Goldwater declared himself “utterly pissed off” that the United States had broken international law and committed an act of war.55 The outcome of the scandal—it rivaled and perhaps surpassed Watergate in its breadth—reveals much about America in the 1980s. Fourteen administration officials received federal indictments and the courts convicted eleven for a range of crimes that sound like a laundry list of charges appropriate for a RICO case leveled against organized crime figures rather than a political scandal. Twelve indictments of major government figures followed, North himself facing sixteen counts of felony. Yet, Bush I survived the controversy to win the presidency in 1988, and by then, Iran-Contra ceased to be an issue. Bush as president pardoned everyone convicted in the conspiracy. North became a right-wing celebrity complete with book deals and eventually a profitable relationship with Fox News.56 Writer-director Mick Garris (Sleepwalkers, Nightmare Cinema) once summed up the horror films of the seventies and eighties as “Norman Rockwell goes to hell.” These films responded to an American empire whose citizens felt powerless and baffled as the luckiest enjoyed the fruits of citizenship in a country that ran the world. Tens of millions of people bought into the idea of a detailed conspiracy of satanic networks controlling the media, the UN, and law enforcement but could not be bothered to thoughtfully examine the details of a conspiracy of arms, drugs, and Bond-level villains responsible for the death and maiming of tens of thousands.57 But, in the Reagan years, keeping America’s large and ever-growing sphere of influence toeing the line was not enough. Full-spectrum dominance, much like the dreams of the aeronautics industry and sci-fi films from the fifties once imagined, needed to include outer space. 8.Space, the Wild Frontier ROBERT A. HEINLEIN drifted into a strange solipsism in the seventies and eighties. In the 1960s, his novel beloved by the Manson Family, Stranger in a Strange Land, became required reading for the counterculture. They found its themes of polyamory and individualism attractive without exactly realizing the far-right politics that attended the call to hedonism. Okay, boomer. After the success of this novel, Heinlein’s work became increasingly mystical. By the eighties, his books exhibited a stream-of-consciousness quality and a narrative voice that made them read less like novels than papal encyclicals on limited government, religion, and sexuality. Indeed, Heinlein fans listened to his pronouncements as if they came ex cathedra. Even his admirers found these works produced from about 1980 until his death in 1988 barely readable, as if the philosophical underpinnings of Heinlein’s worldview began to take over his authorial voice. His libertarianism became metaphysical. The stories ceased to be stories and became elaborations of the inner self known to the world as Robert A. Heinlein. The results proved not only awful, they are pitiable. The Number of the Beast (1980) solves its plot problems with the intervention of Glinda the Good Witch, a deus ex malefica as laughable as it is pompous. Even good ideas like Job: A Comedy of Justice (1984), which promised a rollicking parody of organized religion, inflicted on readers a ghastly plod in which the narrator himself, who is essentially Heinlein, seems to believe he’s God. To Sail Beyond the Sunset (1987) suggests that smoking a joint represents the height of moral depravity, while a father having sex with his daughter might be fine, depending on context. If his writing faltered in a morass of narcissism, Heinlein remained politically committed at a time when his dreams of a scrawny social contract but a muscular military seemed to have come true. In 1980, he served on the rather harmless-sounding Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy along with protégé Jerry Pournelle. The Department of Defense had given the working group significant influence to help outline space policy for the Reagan administration. This would have costly and frightening implications. Since the Kennedy administration, many Americans held an idealistic image of NASA, and the space program more generally, as dedicated to science and exploration. These ideals had certainly been part of NASA’s conception of itself. But the agency was also tied irrevocably to the nation’s burgeoning national security state. Beginning in 1957 with the Soviet launch of the first satellite, Sputnik 1, American efforts to rocket orbital vehicles and eventually humans into space entwined with the Cold War and American imperial hopes. It chilled CIA officials to the bone that Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first man in space, sent greetings to the national liberation movements in Africa as he passed over the continent. The United States had been up to its elbows in some earthbound dirty tricks of gunrunning and assassination to try to suppress these very movements now being hailed from orbit on the Vostok 1. The national security state organized NASA in 1958, creating it literally in the shadow of Sputnik. From the moment of its inception, the organization cooperated closely with the military. A series of documents appeared in 2015 that showed that, at its inception, NASA worked closely with the CIA. Acting CIA director and air force general Charles P. Cabell contacted administrators of the space program regarding intelligence sharing even before Congress officially brought NASA into existence. Satellites ostensibly collecting data on weather, geological activity, and oceanic patterns also harvested any data they could on the Soviets. The space agency even aided the CIA in analyzing that raw intelligence. NASA officials meanwhile helped float cover stories for CIA projects like the U-2 and the A-12 jets, both agencies insisting that the spy planes served only scientific purposes.58 The relationship among covert operations, NASA, and the American search for imperial invincibility came together in the desire to militarize space. Heinlein’s vision of space marines exterminating the enemy with extreme prejudice was not far off the mark. After Sputnik, the United States made threatening moves against the Soviets by placing missiles in Italy and Turkey. Meanwhile, NASA not only worked hand in glove with the CIA but earned a place at the budgetary table by joining the Pentagon’s effort to develop rocketry able to deliver a heavier payload of nuclear mayhem. Heinlein’s protégé Jerry Pournelle not only continued as a prolific author of sci-fi horror but also became part of the national security establishment with his West Point textbook on strategy in the nuclear age. Although some of his ideas for America’s aerospace/military industrial complex seem like plot summaries for his science fiction novels (such as his involvement in a group wanting to send paramilitary American colonists into space in hive-like colonies), he would have outsized influence on the new Republican administration that brought the country closer to the brink of nuclear holocaust than any time since the 1960s. Pournelle supported not only Reagan’s well-known social conservatism but also his desire to expand American military might—not only across the world but very literally into orbit. In the early eighties he joined his fellow sci-fi writer Dean Ing in publishing a book that revived the right-wing fantasy of the United States creating orbital superweapons. Entitled Mutually Assured Survival, it carried an endorsement from Reagan himself. The actual text, sci-fi author Thomas M. Disch wrote in The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World, reads like the specs for “the technological background” of one of Pournelle’s own “space operas.” The book called for, among other weaponry technologically impossible at the time, laser cannons that would use orbital mirrors to rain destruction down on the Soviets or the Chinese. In this dystopian vision, satellites would become little more than weapons stations that used “kinetic energy” to destroy America’s enemies.59 This might seem like the harmless rantings of sci-fi writers who managed to claw a blurb out of the president’s press secretary. That is, if the Reagan administration had not sought out Pournelle to help advertise precisely the kind of superweapons imagined in his fiction. Pournelle worked closely on the policy and the rhetoric of Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), dismissed as “Star Wars” by Senator Ted Kennedy. Reagan offered the perfect vessel for sci-fi militarists. J. Hoberman makes the case that, given his background in Hollywood, no president better understood how the movies nestle close to our worldviews, shaping politics and personal identity. In the summer of 1981, with Raiders of the Lost Ark owning the box office, American F-14 fighters brought down two Libyan jets in a show of force against a North African nation known for its support of attacks on Americans. After receiving the news, Reagan pantomimed a performance of Indiana Jones pulling his revolver and shooting dead an Arab swordsman that American audiences were currently applauding in theaters. “Reagan isn’t our movie,” Hoberman wrote at the time, “we are his: America the movie.”60 Right-wing writers of violent science fiction thus found the Reagan administration generally amenable to the cinematic possibilities of taking war into space. The president’s own understanding of the universe outside our atmospheric bubble largely seemed shaped by movies he’d seen. He once asked Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze if the Soviets would work with the United States against an alien threat. Even more bizarrely, he raised the issue with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1985 Geneva arms reduction talks. Colin Powell admitted that Reagan’s “little green men” interest was well known and thought it came from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).61 Pournelle and his confederates found their guy when it came to the imperial fantasy life. Thirty billion dollars would be thrown at SDI, part of the reason that the United States tripled its budget deficits by the end of the Reagan years. Ideas for an orbital ballistic missile system went so far as to imagine a system of lasers guiding advanced rockets to strike down Russian warheads while still in orbit. Pournelle worked as a part-time speechwriter for Reagan on the issue of SDI. He also provided a crucial link with the aerospace industry, which added to the billions they already made in government contracts for expensive, highly technical weapon systems.62 SDI always remained more of a political fantasy and a public relations stunt than an actual military initiative. But it proved an expensive, and enduring, fantasy. In order to sell the idea, NASA produced “computer models” that essentially used video game technology to create a scenario in which orbital war platforms took out Soviet ICBMs like a teenage arcade wizard. In fact, it’s hard not to see these presentations as heavily influenced by WarGames (1983), a film that imagines a similar scenario and that fascinated Reagan. But these were not representations of technology that actually existed. They were quite literally, as news reports often noted with either delight or cynicism, the “stuff of science fiction.” As Reagan himself lost interest in a program that no reputable scientist believed would ever work, the vision of full-spectrum American dominance slowly transmogrified into an idea for a limited anti-ballistic missile system that made the rounds during the George W. Bush administration. The right wing of science fiction, started by Heinlein but now really led by Pournelle, remained active. Under their influence, the most extreme conservatives became some of the space program’s strongest advocates. Newt Gingrich, the powerful Speaker of the House through most of the Clinton years, had a soft spot for using sci-fi weapons to destroy the monsters he saw threatening America. He coauthored a book with conservative science fiction writer David Drake, one of the practitioners of the “space marine” genre. Their Window of Opportunity: A Blueprint for the Future featured an introduction written by Pournelle and a call for colonizing space with American capitalism and militarism—what Pournelle called a practical application “of the principles that make this nation great” that “proves that we can all get rich” off of space. In 1994, the year the Republican-controlled Congress imposed severe austerity programs on America’s already macerated social programs, Gingrich told readers in his book To Renew America that “aerospace engineer and science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle” had assured him that “space tourism” would become a normal part of American life by 2020. How this would be possible in an America where Gingrich’s, and to a large degree his nemesis, moderate Democrat Bill Clinton’s, slash-and-burn approach to social welfare had caused tens of millions to hurtle below the poverty line is never explained. Their “tough on crime” rhetoric increased the incarceration of Americans, especially African Americans. For-profit prisons became the reality of the American future and not Gingrich’s claim that “honeymoons in space” would be “in vogue” in the year I write these words. Perhaps it’s pleasing to him that a few billionaires funding jumps into orbit, rather than letting their wealth “trickle down” or “create wealth,” has become a new pastime.63 Heinlein died in 1988 but his progeny sallied forth to spin violent survivalist fantasies, slaughtering aliens and humans alike who threatened libertarian values. William R. Forstchen, a ghostwriter for Newt Gingrich, published Star Voyager Academy in 1994. Directly plagiarizing ideas from Heinlein, particularly from Starship Troopers and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Forstchen imagined a new American revolution in which colonists on the moon revolt against Earth over high taxes. Pournelle wrote a popular series of space marine novels, the Falkenberg’s Legion series, that are thinly disguised tracts for some of his more savage political views. Gingrich himself attempted an alternative history called 1945 that imagines a world in which Hitler wins and the United States must race against time to develop the atomic bomb before the victorious Nazi state. Alternate histories of World War II (and most every major historical event) have created some sci-fi masterpieces, most notably Philip K. Dick’s 1962 The Man in the High Castle. Gingrich found a way to make the scenario boring. The Republican lawmaker’s book made the case for the mantra of nineties Republicans, and plenty of the era’s “new Democrats,” that “big government” had to come to an end. Gingrich’s 1945 turns into a fictionalized plea for the United States to give away billions to the aeronautics industry but offer no supervision or regulation for what the John Galt–ish entrepreneurs do with the money. The political hectoring may have been only part of the book’s problem. Like so much of the Heinlein fanfic published over the decades, 1945 may disdain big government but it loves big weapons in an exceptionally weird fashion. In one passage so purple it feels like a bad bruise, the superweapons of Gingrich’s fantasy world are “dark” and “compelling” but give the military tech enthusiast who created them the feeling of “being aroused by a woman one despised.” Gingrich has continued to trouble the world with sci-fi and historical fiction, including racist reimaginings of the Civil War and paranoid delusions about Pearl Harbor. Such ramblings would be beneath notice except that he, like so many other authors of murderous science fiction, kept exceedingly odd involvements with the American military that went beyond his role in the House. Gingrich has frequently taught at the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks and in fact has been the long-serving member of the Joint Warfighting Committee that’s supposed to sharpen the strategic thinking of officers preparing to serve at the Pentagon’s highest echelons. Other than his long-standing desire to strip-mine outer space and kill anything that resists, it’s unclear what kind of strategic thinking Gingrich brought to the table. 9.They Live THE 1980S can feel like a 1950s remake, if perhaps even more paranoid. A new red scare, and deep anxiety over the use of atomic weapons, followed Reagan’s hard-nosed approach to the Soviets. The movies often reflected such notions, in films like Predator but also in other genres. Heartbreak Ridge (1986) starring Clint Eastwood presented an utterly false picture of the Grenada invasion. Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) quite literally refought (and won) the Vietnam War. Mass culture seemed on the side of Reagan’s worldview. But horror’s taste for the subversive slithered around since its origin point in the 1920s. There are hundreds of examples of horror as escapism or horror managing to buttress Americans’ myopic view of the world and their place in it. This makes efforts in the rather conformist decade to ask fans to question the basic values of empire even more exceptional. Larry Cohen’s The Stuff has become an independent horror classic, with restored editions appearing more than thirty years after its 1985 release. The Jewish director, horrified by his family’s tales of the Holocaust and his own sense of alienation in America, already used horror to question America’s obsessions with its children and its willingness to destroy the environment with the murderous infants of his It’s Alive! series. Eclectic and inventive, he’d worked on Black cinema classics like Bone and Black Caesar while using horror to make an early “defund the police” statement in Maniac Cop (1988). The Stuff makes a nightmare of American militarism and its relation to corporate power. The actual stuff of the title turns out to be a self-aware parfait that everyone in America needs very badly. Cohen fills the strange film with commercials so real they transcend parody. The titular weird goop became the ultimate commodity fetish. Americans needed it. Americans needed to eat it. Consuming the stuff, as much as they could muscle into their gullets, became a kind of moral imperative, a duty of citizenship with ads assuring people that it will “give a new order to life.” At a time when Reagan urged Americans to believe in “the magic of the marketplace,” The Stuff suggested that there’s a dark gramarye at work and the consumer is being consumed. Cohen succeeded in questioning America’s effort to bring its nightmare of consumption to the rest of the world with the character Colonel Spears, who seems unaware the United States lost the Vietnam War. George A. Romero’s Day of the Dead (1985) came amid the second Reagan administration’s full-throated support for counterrevolution in Nicaragua and years of anti-Soviet rhetoric that continued the polyphonic themes of the Soviet Union as “an evil empire” and the United States as the primary force for good in the world. Day of the Dead, though it received less attention than the earlier Romero zombie films, became the most biting satire of the trilogy. In it, the American military are maniacal bullies, little more than aspirant warlords in a ruined America. At a moment when SDI suggested that science, industry, and the Pentagon could work together to produce a defensive shield for an invulnerable nation, Romero made the scientists either utterly insane or placed them at contretemps with the violent, undisciplined military. The film turned out to be the only commercial failure in Romero’s first zombie trilogy. A yuppie America didn’t care for this approach given the new fetish for the military even in the aftermath of Vietnam. “Horror is radical,” Romero told an interviewer, “[it can] rattle your cage and say, wait a minute—look at things differently.” Americans did not want to see such films in a decade when even geopolitical nightmares like the possibility of a foreign invasion, such as in Red Dawn (1984), are given a soporific ending.64 In 1988, John Carpenter directed They Live, now a cult classic that offers the most intriguing horror movie of the eighties in terms of creating a compelling plot while wearing its politics on its sleeve. In the film, a homeless construction worker named Nada (“nobody” or “nothing”) comes into possession of a pair of high-tech specs that allow him to see America for what it really is. The earth, we learn, has been secretly invaded by aliens who have lived among us for some time. The shades Nada wears reveal the actual messages received from billboards and magazines, all commands from our unseen masters. An advertisement for a vacation that shows a sultry woman in a bathing suit stretched languorously on the beach really says MARRY AND REPRODUCE. Looking at a magazine rack, the covers splashed with gadgets, cars, and supermodels, Nada’s glasses show him they order the reader to OBEY, STAY ASLEEP, and simply SHOP. Meanwhile the president, who Nada discovers is also an alien trying to keep people “asleep” with consumerism, not only looks but sounds like Reagan. “It’s a new morning in America. Fresh Vital,” he says, directly alluding to the 1984 Reagan commercial “Morning in America.” Carpenter described They Live as his response “to the Reagan years” and in particular to “the unrestrained capitalism of the era.” Popular culture acquiesced to Reaganomics and American foreign policy. At the time, Carpenter remembers, Michael Douglas could deliver his famous line “Greed is good” in the 1987 film Wall Street, which read to many as a motto instead of a parody. “I wanted to make some political statements,” Carpenter recalled, during a time when “everybody is proud to be an American if they can make money at it.”65 The coming of the 1990s did not bring a new social consciousness. The efforts of cultural critics working in numerous fields—the writing of Noam Chomsky, the activism of Cornel West, and the satirical horror of Carpenter and Romero—found little purchase. Romero, Cohen, and Carpenter used horror to ask questions and, especially in the case of Carpenter, demand a response. But few listened. Americans entered a new era in which the small footprint of the American empire became a heavy boot on the world’s face, even as the social contract at home continued to unravel. The explosive violence of America’s empire not only continued its lethal trajectory, its velocity accelerated. The end of the Cold War did not bring a “peace dividend.” Facing no conceivable rival on earth as the Red Army disappeared into history’s mists after 1991, the Pentagon and its enormously wealthy corporate partners did not stand down. The United States developed and sold new weapons technologies, built more military bases to control more points on the globe, and developed Space Command as a joint project of all the armed services, dedicated to creating killer satellites and cyber war capabilities. Few Americans even knew about Space Command, a forerunner of today’s Space Force, even though it receives mention in the 1996 film Independence Day. Horror awakened dormant nightmares in the nineties, an era that didn’t seem too bad if you were white and enjoyed relative economic prosperity. Amity Island felt okay, really just fine. But the chain saw brattled in the century’s twilight.",

      "content": "1.Unlucky Numbers THE CAMP counselor, stretched out on the bed in a postcoital fugue, chokes and gasps as an arrow explodes out of the front of his neck. Blood blossoms from the young actor’s body, a twenty-two-year-old named Kevin Bacon in his first film role. It’s 1980 and it’s Friday the 13th. Directed by Sean S. Cunningham, the film did not aim for social relevance. Made on the cheap for a little over half a million dollars, it earned 59 million at the box office, today about 250 million. The nasty little campfire story became a forty-year-old franchise with ten sequels, a reboot, and varied official and unofficial spin-offs across several media platforms, including PC and console games. In the 1980s, only the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise gave it much competition, leading inevitably to the cross-studio horror funfest of Freddy vs. Jason (2003). None of the sequels held the dark allure of the original. The 1980 premier treated anxious audiences to a believable beheading and a misshapen creature suddenly surfacing from a placid lake in a moment that squeezed several minutes of screams. In the days before CGI, pre–Jurassic Park entertainment, hundreds of thousands left the theater asking, “How did they do that?” Some had been so convinced by Bacon’s macabre death scene that rumors circulated the filmmakers “must have killed that person.”1 “I’m sitting here looking at pictures scattered all over my desk, looking at cut throats, and severed arms and people with bullet holes in them.” Tom Savini, the man who convinced some audiences that they’d witnessed an actual murder in Friday the 13th, described his workspace as looking like a crime scene. By the 1980s, with some apprehension, Savini wore the title “The King of Gore.” He preferred to think of himself as “a sorcerer who worked with illusions, sculptures, and mechanisms” to make horror come to life. He spent much of the 1970s earning this reputation before Friday the 13th took his effects mainstream.2 Eleven years before the surprise success of the low-budget film, Savini sat behind a bamboo barricade peering into the steaming Vietnamese night. In 1969, the man who would assault the senses of a generation was just a nervous kid. The heavy hot air and the smell of grease from his M60 machine gun mingled into an unpleasant aroma. The heat beaded his face with sweat. Savini had been assigned night watch for the camp perimeter against guerilla attacks from NLF insurgents.3 When, deep into the loud jungle night, a trip wire twanged a warning, he let loose with the thunderous roar of the M60, a weapon that spatters its heavy-caliber bullets at six hundred rounds a minute. All along the line, other crews with the heavy weapons opened up. Savini was required to contact headquarters before firing, but the tense anxiety of the night watch took over his reflexes. The powerful guns, and a grenade or two, devastated the dense tangle of tree and vine in front of their forward position. A duck had tripped the wire. And, in something of a metaphor for America’s invasion of Vietnam, the duck had somehow survived the punishing hail of gunfire and high explosives. “You didn’t even get the duck?” Savini’s commanding officer angrily wondered aloud. He did not get the duck and his lieutenant rotated him off guard duty. The next night, NLF soldiers overwhelmed the position, leaving Savini convinced that the lucky duck had saved his life. Savini wasn’t sure why he, or any other American, had been sent to Vietnam. He had enlisted because of the personal economic pressures of a new family and the likelihood he’d be drafted anyway. He primarily served as a combat photographer, taking pictures of ghastly images for after-action reports. He recalled that he viewed human bodies “blown nearly in half by a grenade blast,” unattached hands grasping the ground, and scattered body parts in the aftermath of a firefight. Savini writes that, “I felt a kind of safety behind my camera . . . Perhaps my mind was seeing it as special effects to protect me.” He spent much of the rest of his life behind the camera in one way or another. It may have given him a sense of safety, but the same cannot be said for his audience. Savini always displayed a thoughtfulness and sensitivity you would perhaps not expect from someone who began their career making convincing mock-ups of mutilated bodies. But almost half a century after the South Asian conflict, he remembered the impression the Vietnamese people made on him as heirs to a beautiful culture and country. He watched the wholesale destruction of the Vietnamese ecosystem and questioned the point of the war. Before leaving Vietnam, Savini saw American soda being sold in traditional villages to and by the American armed forces. Coca-Cola, that’s the reason his country sent him to South Asia, he later suggested. Savini’s anecdote may seem impressionistic to some. But he had witnessed a local phenomenon that symbolized a larger truth about America’s fight for capitalism in East Asia: they had brought it with them. So-called Ports a-Go-Go began arriving in South Vietnam in the early 1960s, prefabricated docks that, as early as late 1965, received nine million cans of soft drinks and beer.4 Savini would become the prince of special effects artists, rivaling Lon Chaney in his influence on the craft. Working with George A. Romero on Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Cunningham on Friday the 13th, he played an essential role in the new horror revolution of the eighties. In the years to come, as an actor and director as well as SFX maestro, Savini would bring his heavy splatter style to a series of movies very much out of step with the eerie optimism of the period. The uncertain, gory delights of late-twentieth-century horror offered the former combat photographer a way to not only deal with his demons but to bring them to life.5 Gradually, he became better known for the bizarre creatures he constructed. His monsters of hybridity affected audiences more deeply than the hyperreal productions of CGI, the creatures that look so unconvincing they appear encrusted on modern screens, like something you could scrape off if you had the right tool. Savini attributed his fascination with makeup effects to his experience in Vietnam, pointing out that his interest in SFX began during his working-class childhood in Pittsburgh. At the age of twelve, Savini went to his neighborhood theater, the Plaza, to see James Cagney portray Lon Chaney in Man of a Thousand Faces. He became obsessive about re-creating what he saw in 1950s horror comics, the photographs in Famous Monsters of Filmland, and any horror movie he could possibly watch. Then, like Ray Bradbury’s dark carnival rolling into town the year Halloween came early, “Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors” came to Pittsburgh in 1960. The once enormously popular show had been hobbled by changing tastes and time. But Savini loved it. He dressed as Dracula, and his convincing makeup led to his being invited on stage, adding to the magical monster show. He became a regular when Silkini came to town. A few years later, Savini fashioned his drill sergeant a realistic scar to frighten new recruits. He crafted fangs to entertain his buddies in Vietnam. While he makes it clear today that his interest in gore effects did not begin in Vietnam, he admits that his gruesome experiences there shaped the way he approached the making of a horror film. When creating an effect, his interest is always in terrifying realism. Beheaded corpses, skewered bodies, and cut throats must “give me that feeling I used to get when I’d see the real stuff.” When Savini watches a film, if the bloodletting and hideous creatures fail to evoke Vietnam, they simply don’t work. “It’s just not real enough for me,” he wrote. Too many scripts, he once off-handedly noted, feature the dead lying with closed eyes. Savini knew from the corpses he’d seen in Southeast Asia that the eyes of the dead are wide open, flash frozen in horror and surprise.6 The first Friday the 13th film appeared in an America far distant from the one Savini came home to in 1970. Many Americans lost interest in Vietnam as early as 1972, even as the Nixon administration continued to level North and South Vietnam with devastating bombing runs. This included the infamous Christmas Bombings of ’72, which incinerated large portions of Hanoi with twenty tons of explosives. But the American public tired of the war and its intractable issues. The crimes of the Nixon administration increasingly carved out space in print and televised media. The embattled president, obsessed with his alleged domestic enemies more than the obvious catastrophe of Vietnam, tried to spin the decades-long American failures in the region by insisting the United States finally achieved “peace with honor.” U.S. defeat in Vietnam became something of an unmentionable cultural secret. The idea of peace with honor clashed with what American TV audiences saw in April of 1975 as U.S. helicopters crashed, final CIA and army operatives fled unceremoniously from rooftops, and North Vietnamese troops and armored vehicles rolled into Saigon. Adding to the sense of a declining superpower, the 1970s became a decade of torpor, economic turmoil, free-floating anxiety, and even the possibility of apocalyptic catastrophe. By May 1, 1975, more Vietnam veterans committed suicide than died in the war itself. The images that haunted veterans became the images of what empire looks like on the ground, the horror it inflicts on its victims. Sergeant Lee Childress of the 206th Assault Helicopter Company remembered an elderly woman murdered by an American soldier because he believed she’d taken a stick of gum from him. “He shot her point-blank in the chest,” Childress recalled. “We got in more trouble for killing water buffalo than we did for killing people.” He told an interviewer he spent “every fucking day” asking “why? why?” He never found an answer, he admitted, and that left him with nothing but terror.7 Savini’s first special effects work after coming home became Deathdream (1974), also released under the titles Dead of Night and The Veteran. Director Bob Clark, who also made one of the ur-slashers, Black Christmas (1974), borrowed the primary conceit of the chilling W. W. Jacobs tale “The Monkey’s Paw” and presented an American soldier dying in Southeast Asia at the very moment his mother makes a portentous wish for his return. He does come back, but as a vampiric specter who can live only off blood. An especially macabre climax allowed Savini to put his talents, and his trauma, on full display. The tagline of the film? “Some boys never come home.” The darkness learned to follow even when the boys did come home. W. D. Ehrhart graduated high school in 1966 and immediately enlisted in the Marines. He did a tour of duty in Vietnam and fought in the bloody house-to-house fighting in the city of Hué in 1968. Following the war, he did with poetry what Savini had been able to do with make-up—cauterized his trauma while putting it on display before the American public. In the chilling poem “Making the Children Behave,” Ehrhart imagined how he and his comrades in arms left their shadowy memory in the villages of Vietnam, a tale of boogeymen now used to frighten bad children. “When they tell stories to their children / of the evil / that awaits misbehavior / is it me they conjure?” Some may have projected the horror on the experience of Vietnam itself, “a tragedy” often portrayed in popular media as a victimization of Americans. Veterans like Savini and Ehrhart imagined Americans themselves as the instigators of horror.8 Veterans returned to a country in turmoil. The center of a far-flung empire looked to have fallen into decay. The anti-war movement eventually brought together Americans of almost every background and staged the largest protests in the history of the country. In the United States, making money had always been the business of business. But by the end of the decade, a new kind of capitalism was born that continues to affect the work and paycheck of everyone reading this book. It became the foundation and the mechanics of the American empire, at home and abroad. Economic decline allowed business leaders to launch an assault on the American working class from which it never really recovered. Weary of providing benefits and livable wages to unionized workers, heads of large companies and their boards simply closed steel plants and automobile factories, and silenced the beating heart of American manufacturing from South Chicago to Youngstown.9 Gary, Indiana—once the home of U.S. Steel and a city where state and federal authorities deployed the military repeatedly throughout the twentieth century to successfully crush the labor movement—became an economic nightmare where unemployed steelworkers competed for jobs at fast food chains. Much of America in 1984 could be described as “medieval cities of rusting iron” with even the so-called Sun Belt losing textile mills at such a rapid rate that towns could be referred to “morgues” and sites of “rural malingering,” with oddly little comment that “malingering” might be the only option available to former workers. A 2010 study by MIT of 150 cities and towns described industrial powers houses like Buffalo, Cleveland, and Allentown as “dying cities.”10 If you found yourself in the Rust Belt or the Dirt Belt over the last several decades, the logic of the chain saw makes more sense than the promise of Amity Island. This perhaps explains why Tobe Hooper’s vision of the chain saw became one of the most remade, rebooted, and reimagined horror films of the last half century. These “rural malingerers” have been left behind, left out, and despised for their failure. The mad dance of Leatherface holds some appeal. As have the promises of a con artist who represents a parasitic class that destroyed entire social and cultural worlds with their mind-numbingly relentless financial monoculture. Yet, like a good horror film, he gives them an outlet to expend their rage and feel their fears. Millionaires became billionaires while cities died. Reaping massive profits from austerity measures that amounted to wage cuts and layoffs, corporate heads congratulated themselves on becoming “leaner” and showing “innovation and flexibility.” General Electric cut its total number of blue-collar employees by almost two hundred thousand in the early eighties. Rather than facing a backlash for what the newspeak called downsizing, CEO Jack Welch managed to become something of a folk hero who allegedly “saved the company” even though he enriched himself enormously without reinvesting in actual manufacturing. Auto exec Lee Iacocca wrote an enormous best-seller in which he became his own hagiographer. Iacocca also told a story of how he brought Chrysler from the precipice through hard work and allegedly rationalized free market principles. Some Republicans hoped he’d run for president. Few noticed that the salvation of a corporate entity created a crisis at the dinner table and the gas pump for workers whose wages stagnated while inflation exploded. Almost no one, certainly not Iacocca, noted that Chrysler’s salvation came from a government bailout.11 These changes in the economy opened the increasingly enormous economic gap in a country full of Gatsbys whose source of wealth remained mysterious and who did no labor in any meaningful sense. The maw between the nation’s richest and poorest had never grown wider than it did in the seventies and eighties, a trend that continues to worsen. Regions that built communities around manufacturing plants, support services for those factories, and neighborhoods where union membership had been at least as important as what house of worship you attended became haunted ruins. By 2020, Forbes magazine, not exactly an outlet of socialist propaganda, noted that 1 percent of the American population had fifteen times more wealth than the entire bottom 50 percent combined.12 So much of the country began to look like the set of a horror film. Perversely, many of these cities became the setting of horror films. East St. Louis provides an especially egregious example, a place of decline and social death that became part of America’s apocalyptic fears. Although the city struggled since the 1960s, white flight from the largely African American area drained the tax base. Freeways cut apart neighborhoods and community gathering spots. By the eighties and nineties, industries moved to the region only when offered massive subsidies and given allowance to operate as private jurisdictions, contributing nothing to the social safety net. The ravaged city became such a desolation that it earned the dubious honor of serving as the set for John Carpenter’s postapocalyptic film Escape from New York (1981). An associate producer recalled that, because the film was to be made cheaply, he and Carpenter had to go on a search for “the worst city in America.” East St. Louis, poisoned by decades of systemic racism, offered the “seedy run-down quality” of the bleak future of 1997 portrayed in the film.13 The uncertainties of the seventies, the sting of loss in Vietnam, and the cruelties inflicted on the American working class hid a very important fact. Wounded, the country healed like the mythic hydra, and not unlike that beast, its tentacles continued to encircle the globe. By 1975, the United States exhibited nearly full-spectrum dominance over much of the world’s capital, resources, and military supremacy. A vast network of American clients, military bases, and corporate power ensured that every human being on the planet, in one way or another, was forced to contend with the United States.14 This dominance in world affairs did nothing about the problems at home. In fact, the economic policy of empire benefited elites and not the nation-state as a whole. Steel workers and coal miners, not to mention fast food workers, do not benefit from the United States having a squeeze on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In fact, economic hegemony abroad whipsaws workers at home. In an especially reprehensible example, America’s global power allowed corporations to take the lash to some of the empire’s first victims. In 1965, Fairchild Semiconductor received government subsidies to open a plant on Navajo Nation land in New Mexico. Originally employing 1,200 Navajos, the plant laid them off after Bureau of Indian Affairs subsidies ended. The company replaced them with white workers. Protests in the early seventies by the American Indian Movement brought enough bad press to Fairchild that it simply closed the plant in 1975 and moved overseas.15 Americans who live in this ruined palace find themselves looking at the bloody face of American empire when they see their paychecks. The symptoms of a country that’s a behemoth abroad but an orphan at home are seen in a fifty-year trajectory of declining wages, growing rates of suicide, terrifying gun violence, and both white rural and Black urban communities torn apart by violence and drug abuse. Nightmares made flesh stalked our collective dream life. 2.Elm Street WES CRAVEN’S The Last House on the Left (1972) felt so real, and so contemporary, that audiences struggled to watch it. The Hills Have Eyes (1977) offered an excruciating journey of terror for a suburban family stranded in the desert and facing a family of violent cannibals, their misshapen forms created by American atomic testing. What monsters could the former professor of philosophy pull from the American psyche next? Walking to a meeting in downtown L.A. in 1982, Craven’s mind wandered as he ran through his agenda and pondered recent books he’d read about Indonesian “dream demons.” Kenin tindah, as it’s called in Indonesia, is the experience widely known as sleep paralysis that some attribute to supernatural forces. Dream demons on his mind, Craven also came across a bizarre story of dozens of cases of “arhythmic heart failure” among Hmong immigrants to the United States. The CIA recruited the Hmong leadership in Vietnam, who lent soldiers and regional support bases to the United States in exchange for help controlling the South Asian heroin trade. By the 1980s, many had come to the United States, fleeing persecution from Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge and the communist government of Laos. And, as Craven read in a 1987 story in the Los Angeles Times, many of their young people began to inexplicably die from heart failure, seemingly while trapped in a nightmare. The syndrome even received an acronym, SUNDS, or sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome.16 While he wondered how to transform this odd phenomenon into a new horror tale, a solid bump to Craven’s shoulder wrested him out of his dark reverie. He looked at the source of the collision and, as if in a close camera shot, discovered a terrifying face suddenly filling the frame. He seemed, in Craven’s memory, badly scarred, and the image of a burn victim came to mind. We don’t know the name or the background of the man who collided with Craven that day. The director remembered a filthy sweater and battered hat. But what he most recalled was a very quick glimpse of a disfigured face underneath the floppy fedora and the snarl on the man’s face at the suit in his way. The experience left Craven shaken, much more than it should have. In all likelihood, he only imagined the more lurid details of the chance encounter. Whatever the case, the incident became the final ingredient in the grisly cauldron that birthed Freddy Krueger. A Nightmare on Elm Street opened in 1984, less than a week after the nation elected Ronald Reagan to a second term. Fred Krueger, as he’s called through most of the first film, has returned from the grave after the parents of Elm Street lynched and burned him alive, believing him “a filthy child murderer.” In his grungy afterlife, Krueger can enter the dreams of the children of Elm Street. He tortures his prey in the bleakest regions of sleep before ripping them apart in flumes of blood and gore. In Nightmare, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) became one of the templates of the final girl, joining Laurie Strode from Halloween in the growing pantheon of young women who, unlike their friends or their parents, summoned the bravery and bearing to fight a monster. Teenagers being stalked by a murderer certainly offered nothing new. Even the idea of suburban America transforming into a slaughterhouse rather than the destination of whites in flight was previously explored by John Carpenter’s Halloween. But something even stranger happened on the Elm Street of the American mind. The sheer savagery of Krueger, combined with his supernatural origins, set him apart from the slasher films that came before. Tobe Hooper’s postindustrial serial killers deep in the heart of Texas are probably much more frightening. But a decade later, it was Fred Krueger’s origin story and its implications that raised a chill on America’s collective spine. The first film suggests the ambiguity we expect in a post-Watergate world. Are we supposed to trust the story of Nancy’s mother, one of the parents who burned the human Freddy alive? She’s a decidedly low-functioning alcoholic and the living avatar of an unreliable narrator. It’s from her we learn Krueger was a “filthy child murderer.” Nancy’s father (played by John Saxon) is a corrupt police officer who also wants to hide the truth of what happened. The other parents of Elm Street join the conspiracy. They keep the secret from their children, the secret of how they made a monster. The story of Krueger proved popular enough to make the character an icon. Six sequels followed Craven’s original film, the only one he directed, or had very much engagement with at all. Departing from the formula of the first film, Fred Krueger soon became “Freddy,” famous for the corny one-liners delivered as he dispatched his victims, most of them the epitome of excruciating dad jokes if dad guffawed while he ripped open your intestines with razor-sharp knives attached to his scarred fingers. Why did such an unpleasant creature become one of the eighties’ most recognizable images? There’s a sense in which the horror Craven spliced together from moral panic and poverty and a strange footnote to the Vietnam War didn’t fit the eighties. Perhaps the answer is in the inferior sequels. Their churlish use of violence and victims, turning them into little more than props for Freddy to slice and dice, fit into a decade remembered as much for its cruelty as for Thriller and John Hughes comedies. The callous attitude of the sequels pervaded America’s Elm Streets throughout the decade. Some middle-class Americans held on to and even improved their status from the Reagan to the Bush to the Clinton years. By the 1990s, ignoring restrictions and regulations placed on the stock market during the Great Depression, millions of small investors became miniature Michael Milkens, making tens of thousands while buyouts, the leveraging of credit, austerity measures, and the strip-mining of corporate assets by CEOs shoveled tens of billions into the coffers of a tiny class of Americans. Meanwhile, homelessness exploded. The drop in real wages and the physical destruction of low-income housing accounted for some of those who appeared on sidewalks and under bridges and in private shelters. A peculiar alliance between civil liberty advocates and conservative budget hawks closed institutions and tossed Americans suffering from drug addiction, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and even severe schizophrenia onto the streets. African American men, abandoned in their illness and completely indigent, made up a significant portion of this population. Vietnam veterans accounted for about 10 percent of the homeless population in the 1980s.17 Attitudes toward the homeless and the working poor (often the same population) made Freddy’s woeful appearance a portent and a cause for panic. Notably, many of the monsters who stalked the slasher films of the eighties are portrayed not as handsome well-dressed Ted Bundys, but as workers eager to see your insides. Michael Myers, an escaped mental patient, wore the one-piece overalls of a car mechanic as he wielded his butcher knife. Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th series, dresses in the sequels like a cross between a dirt farmer and bricklayer. This proletariat of monstrosity appears in the tendency of white America to project monstrosity onto its fellow citizens. Ronald Reagan spoke of “welfare queens” taking advantage of the system, parasites that fed off the blood of hard-working Americans. Other conservative writers went further in their use of monstrous imagery, finding language that portrayed the working class and people of color as unnatural terrors. James Q. Wilson called the young urban poor “feral” and “presocial beings.”18 In the same year Craven unleashed his nightmare on America’s Elm Street, the film C.H.U.D. made the subtext of Freddy Krueger the glaringly obvious point. The title, standing for cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers, imagined the homeless population of New York City turned into hideous Lovecraftian horrors that emerged from the sewers to feed on the flesh of luckier Americans. The tagline for the film resounded with Americans nervous about how the country’s class consensus might not survive the growing gap in wealth, even with the increased policing of the urban working class. “They’re not staying down there, anymore!” the film’s posters warned. Crime statistics frightened many Americans in the seventies as the tectonic shifts in the economy caused theft and the violence associated with underground drug economies to flourish. However, despite the general impression most middle-class Americans shared in the eighties and nineties, crime against property in America declined rapidly. It became increasingly unlikely that you’d die at the hands of a stranger made “feral” by “the inner city.” However, between 1980 and 2008, families, friends, and acquaintances murdered one another with prolific enthusiasm, accounting for far more death than “gang-related” murders. During this period, nearly 80 percent of murder victims knew their killer and almost 42 percent of female homicides came at the hands of a romantic partner.19 The Republican right didn’t birth these monsters of the American mind alone. “New Democrats” found an effective issue in portraying themselves as crimefighters who gave police unions anything they asked for, built prisons at an alarming rate to warehouse an enormous portion of the population, and passed federal laws that resulted in brutally lengthy internments for, primarily, African American men. Not unlike in the early twentieth century, white supremacy at home provided a foundation for empire abroad. In the 1980s, the nation continued its fascination with slasher films, fearful of the serial murderer who surely lived on their version of Elm Street. They’d moved to the suburbs hoping to escape the “Black youths” that academics and a racist legal system convinced them terrorized urban centers. The costs of empire on the home front are substantial. The CIA’s inveterate willingness to partner with drug lords made the “war on drugs” an assault on African American communities. Defense spending cannibalized the American GDP and threw the social safety net on the bonfire. While fearful of violence at home, middle-class Americans proved generally willing to acquiesce to the Reagan administration’s policy of strategic homicidal outbursts abroad. Elm Street’s nightmares engulfed the world. 3.Waiting for the Antichrist “‘FROM THE eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother till man exists no more.’ The book of Revelation predicted it all.” So goes a well-known quote from the film The Omen (1976). Many viewers then and now think it is a quote from the Bible. They’d been prepped for the horrors of a satanic apocalypse by an unlikely source. Hal Lindsey appeared to have been grown in the incubation pod that produced every young white male of the sixties and seventies. Foregoing coats and ties and speaking with an easy Southern California accent that rolled words around like they came in and out with the tide, he favored sunglasses, hair just below the collar, and a grandiose moustache. His lean, youthful face always seemed on the verge of telling you to take it easy. His work carried a rather different message. “Imagine, cities like London, Paris, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago—obliterated!” Making free with exclamation marks and proclaiming catastrophe in an “oh holy wow, geez!” style, Lindsey’s 1970 The Late Great Planet Earth told a bleak tale of the coming rise of the Antichrist, explained that the book of Revelation foretold a Soviet invasion of Israel, and predicted “Red China” mobilizing against much of the rest of the world. The Antichrist would arrive on the world scene after Satan staged a mockery of Christ’s resurrection. The ideas in The Late Great Planet Earth seemed new and exciting, a bit like new religious movements such as the Unification Church or “the Jesus People.” In this it resembled another mass paperback best-seller of the era, Erich von Däniken’s Chariots of the Gods? Däniken created an imagined deep past in which, with nothing resembling evidence, he claimed aliens once visited the earth and directed human beings on the path toward civilization, building pyramids and perhaps even giving us a bit of extraterrestrial DNA to ease along our evolutionary climb. Lindsey also created a fantasy, this one about a human future fading into the horizon of otherworldly events. Gods and demons would fight their wars over us rather than give us aid, and the result would be a mass extinction event rather than human progress. Readers who combined a general openness to unsubstantiated claims and felt helpless to understand the tumultuous twentieth century formed a large majority of both Lindsey’s and Däniken’s readership. The short, simply written paperbacks suited the boomers who came of age during the Vietnam years. The need to find your own path, even if that path led to doomsday, combined with a tincture of very real intellectual curiosity circulated ideas meant to, as the slang of the era put it, blow your mind. Unfortunately, critical thinking has not always been a partner in the business of blowing minds. Aliens bearing gifts to ancient civilizations and the Antichrist showing up to end the show became a single mishmash of contradictory conceptions of the world. We should remember the sixties generation as working with SNCC or joining the Black Panthers, Students for a Democratic Society, or the National Organization for Women. We’d do an injustice to them if we ignored the very real changes in law and society their protests and their struggles manifested. But it’s also true that much of this generation watched through Jimi Hendrix’s purple haze while the great American protest movements marched by. Tobe Hooper caught the mood of the boomers in Poltergeist (1982), in a scene in which the family patriarch lies across the bed to smoke a joint and, counterintuitively, picks up where he left off in Ronald Reagan’s campaign biography. The big chill, indeed. Nixon used the term silent majority to suggest a sleeping giant of American conservativism who watched anti-war protests and the Black freedom struggle with disdain. He may have been on to something when he noted that young people who wanted radical social transformation represented a minority, even within the so-called counterculture. Proponents of “do your own thing” often actually meant it. One’s own thing might include political activism but could also mean falling headfirst into LSD rabbit holes, free ranging as an Ayn Randian, or joining “the Jesus People” and becoming the constituency for the modern “casual worship” megachurches. As Kurt Anderson pointed out in his book Fantasyland, “if it feels good, do it” can be a liberatory cry from sexual and emotional repression while at the same time mean that paying yourself four hundred times what you pay your employees is just finding your own truth. Anderson concludes, looking from our contemporary vantage, that the ethos of believing and doing anything you wish “powered the political right more than the political left.”20 In their uncertainty and political immaturity, the baby boomers became seekers who didn’t know where to look, examples of how many of those who wander are actually just really lost. Growing up in the prosperous sixties afforded them the chance to dally with all manner of nonsense. Luckily for American institutions, many of them followed Stokely Carmichael, Fred Hampton, Susan Faludi, Bella Abzug, and Tom Hayden into revolutionary movements for meaningful change. But entering adulthood, the world became more confusing. Aliens built the pyramids and the great monoliths of Easter Island? Maybe. The Bible as a way to interpret the news? Why not. The notions Lindsey’s ideas of Biblical prophecy proffered didn’t originate with him; these underground ideas have been around since the nineteenth century. Renegade religious thinkers in England and the United States first imagined the Bible predicting a series of catastrophic events culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The tree they planted would grow tangled, its offshoots as disparate as American fundamentalism, the Pentecostals, and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. These groups held few beliefs in common—in fact, they tended to see one another as heretical—but they all believed fervently that the world would end, that it would end in a very specific way, and that you could read the signs of the end in your daily newspaper. American fundamentalism exerted significant influence in the South and Midwest for most of the twentieth century. Adherents tended to be rural and lack formal education, marginalized even in moments of American prosperity. Their low-wage labor made capitalism in America work as they fed the nation from their farms, toiled in twelve-hour shifts in Southern textile mills, and worked the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma to slake the petro-thirst of the white-collar class and the American war machine. Some of their leaders rose to prominence as ministers of large Sun Belt churches or seminary professors. But for the most part they lived under the nation’s cultural radar and played much the same role in politics. Why vote when the end was nigh? Major social and cultural changes brought this group to the suburbs in a story beyond the bounds of the one being told here. But Lindsey’s influence on American politics and popular culture gave the most exotic elements of the group’s belief system a fecund pile of theological compost where it could bud and flourish. He succeeded with several gambits that fit the times like a leisure suit. Lindsey had the notion, at once brilliant in execution and sophomoric in intent, of phrasing the rather complicated prophetic schema of fundamentalism in So Cal English. His seeming hatred for language benefitted from the commercially useful side effect of dumbing down complex eschatological notions for the sinners dancing through the decade’s disco inferno. He told them they could find biblical prophecy in the daily paper while searching for a soulmate who loved piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Lindsey casually took his audience by the hand with breezy anecdotes about how sitting out in the warm California evening while tiki torches cast a pleasant glow on the lemon trees and wondering when the dinner party would start was a lot like the desire “from the beginning of time . . . to know what is going to happen in the future.” He promised the return of Christ would be “the ultimate trip.” The use of supernatural power by the Antichrist would allow this incarnation of the devil to become “the Big Cheese” in world affairs.21 Horror films already prepped Americans for the Antichrist, even though they didn’t mean to do it. In 1968, Roman Polanski directed Rosemary’s Baby, a terrifying spoof of a horror film, a self-aware horror film long before Scream. The Satanists who offer a very young Mia Farrow as the devil’s bride are intentionally hilarious. There’s not a black robe in sight among the hokey, upper-middle-class elderly who keep Jokes for the John on a chain in their bathroom. But they are also eager to launch a satanic millennium. In the parody of drive-in Satanism Americans experienced in B-grade features over the last decade, Polanski followed a similar formula to the arty burlesque of The Fearless Vampire Killers of the year before. But the film disturbed many viewers with its mention of abortion and the claustrophobia of Rosemary’s confinement by her controlling husband and his half-baked devil-worshipping friends. Although known for his own poisonous attitudes toward women—a rage fully on display in his violent rape of a thirteen-year-old, which led him to flee the country—Polanski unwittingly made a bleak feminist parable. By 1968, Polanski already displayed an unhealthy interest in the isolation, really the imprisonment, of women by their own “hysteria” in Repulsion (1965). Turning to adapt a novel, he wrote a script that follows Ira Levin’s book very precisely and forced a different meaning to emerge from Rosemary’s Baby. The coven of Upper West Side devil worshippers exercises a paternalist supervision of Rosemary through her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes). The film ends in the brutal breaking of Rosemary, her acquiescence to the value of motherhood even if her offspring does happen to have hooves for feet. It’s a diabolical version of the “feminine mystique” described by Betty Friedan in her 1963 best-seller of the same name. Friedan described the way prosperous white culture in the years after World War II exalted pregnancy and motherhood until “there is no other way [a woman] can even dream about herself.”22 Inaccurately, Rosemary’s Baby would later be noted, or perhaps blamed, for a flood tide of interest in all things occult. The roots of such fascination are deeper and even more peculiar. The alleged “rise of Satanism” owed much to religious conservatives like Lindsey, who believed, as one of his book titles insisted, that Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth. As Lindsey continued to fascinate the world and build a highly profitable media empire that included more books, television, radio, and even comic book adaptations of his apocalyptic imaginings, he increasingly suggested that the end of the world looked a lot like the fears of white, middle-class Americans. “Biblical prophecy,” it turns out, held a special place in its millennialist heart for the American empire. Lindsey’s story of the signs of the end looked a great deal like America’s Cold War–era concerns, giving a vigorous handshake to the far right’s most paranoid fantasies. He writes of visiting an unnamed “large university” near his home and speaks with horror of seeing students distributing literature about the treatment of Palestinians under the Israeli occupation. Lindsey warned grimly that this showed “communist” influence on “‘wars of liberation’ in countries around the world.” What if, he suggested to readers, we see an alliance of “several black African nations” with “the Arabs”? What indeed. Lindsey doesn’t bother to explain, but we know from the rest of his best-selling tract that readers are meant to assume it has something to do with the Antichrist, Satan, and the end of the world.23 Millennial movements have flourished throughout much of Christianity’s history. In most cases, belief in the apocalypse pushed true believers to shed worldly concerns. Around the year 1000, the turn of the millennium convinced many of the devout in western Europe that the end had come. They sold their earthly goods and waited with hope and trepidation for the Kingdom of God. Radical sects during the upheavals of the Protestant Reformation held property together in common, foreswore allegiance to princes and kings, and dissolved marriage ties in anticipation of the end. Even in twentieth-century America, millennial groups sometimes followed the logic of their convictions. The Jehovah’s Witnesses saw World War I as the beginning of judgment on all the nations, including the United States. For this opinion, the group’s leadership cadre faced a prison term of twenty years under the 1917 Espionage Act. In the late twentieth century, the infectious idea of apocalypse created the opposite effect. Americans should, according to Lindsey, continue to worry about the future of capitalism. In the 1970s, Sino-Soviet relations may have been at a low ebb, but Lindsey warned his readers that the goal of both was “total world conquest” that would mean “the total destruction of the capitalist system.” Echoing what would become an American mantra about defeat in Vietnam, Lindsey spread the false claim that the United States fielded a powerful military that “politicians” did not allow it to use. Meanwhile, as if reading from the script of one of the Fu Manchu films, Lindsey told his readers that the battle of Armageddon would come when an “incredible Oriental army of 200 million” tried to destroy Israel.24 America’s geopolitical foes are the bad guys even in the apocalypse. America’s unqualified support for the state of Israel grew out of this period. The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 meant the fulfillment of biblical prophecy for evangelicals. Meanwhile, Israel provided a U.S. foothold in the world’s leading oil-producing region after the Six-Day War and a brief chilliness in its relationship to Saudi Arabia. The end of the world did not mean the end of the empire, and, in fact, Lindsey and his cohort again and again insisted on “America’s special place in biblical prophecy.” Rosemary’s Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen sent screaming demons into theaters all over the United States. The years the devil stalked moviegoers are the very years Lindsey, and soon boatloads of imitators, hawked a similarly terrifying and titillating tale. It told of apocalypse and the coming of the Antichrist, visions of dark prophecy first born in the deserts of the ancient Near East, repackaged to explain how the United States—hell, even its economic system and global military reach—sat at the center of God’s plan for the universe. The growing evangelical movement attached itself to this strange notion that the end was nigh. Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority emerged in the late seventies, a grassroots group of evangelical, and a few Catholic and Jewish, clergy and their congregants who became one of the more effective lobby groups in American politics. Falwell’s message that the 1960s represented a sinkhole of moral depravity grew in part out of his own repudiation of the civil rights movement. He had preached vehemently against the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, called Martin Luther King Jr. a communist, and founded Lynchburg Christian Academy as one of the South’s many “seg academies,” private schools launched in the midst of the integration of public schools in order to preserve “whites only” education.25 Nixon was wrong about a silent majority, but Falwell did tap into the fears of a silent and numerically impressive minority. For them, the rise of second-wave feminism, a stereotyped conception of hippies and young people smoking pot, the gains of the civil rights movement, American defeat in Vietnam, and the very real decline in wages and subsequent economic stagnation all became muddled in their minds as one phenomenon. Falwell gave them a simple explanation, an Appalachian version of Hal Lindsey, telling them the Bible had something to say about all the things that bothered them in the newspaper. Rural evangelicals may have believed the world was not their home and stayed away from the voting booths. Falwell’s Moral Majority brought them out to vote for Ronald Reagan in the hundreds of thousands, contributing to his unprecedented landslide over Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election. Falwell’s message to evangelicals brought together a pied-colored set of ideas that seemed to have little consistency. Christian morality, he believed, called for women to take a subordinate role in marriage and society and for taxes to remain low. The United States had, he claimed, drifted away from God, but this heathen nation also needed to increase its defense spending exponentially. Prayers should begin every day of public school, and America should flex its military might in the Middle East. Conflicting, contradictory, and counterintuitive ideas didn’t matter. The religious right’s worldview fit with Reagan’s message of traditional virtues and America the omnipotent. The backlash against the progressive gains of the 1960s has never really left American politics. The idea of America in decline remained part of the Moral Majority’s message, even as the colossal power of the country touched nearly every corner of the globe. While Americans watched truck commercials from Reagan ally Lee Iacocca that asserted “the pride is back,” evidence mounted that the new president would make sure America’s client states and rivals alike knew that the United States would put boots on the ground and bombers in the air. Reagan wondered aloud in a phone call with an Israeli lobbyist if the end of the world approached and if “the signs foretelling Armageddon” might be true. He certainly wanted to make sure the United States came out on top of any apocalyptic struggle.26 4.Serpents and Rainbows GEORGE H. W. BUSH had, before becoming vice president, called Reagan’s notion of free market adventurism “voodoo economics.” He found the term ready at hand with so much talk of voodoo in the air in the 1980s, so much that it rivaled the American thirties and forties. In American theaters of the eighties, fear of Caribbean dark magic made it seem like the midcentury zombie made an unfortunate comeback. Major films like The Believers, starring Martin Sheen, portrayed Cuban Santeria as a dangerous death cult flourishing in Florida, not unrelated to the American panic of “satanic covens” out to sacrifice everything from your house cat to your kid. An interest in the often frighteningly exploitative cannibal genre shared this imperial view of primitive peoples up to no good. Italian films like Cannibal Holocaust (1980) and Cannibal Ferox (1981) found an audience with the VHS generation. These unwatchable films not only showed buckets of fake gore and some very nasty, and very real, animal cruelty. They also assumed a vile racism that suggested to American viewers that Latin America was lousy with cannibals. Haiti remained a special American obsession. In Angel Heart (1987), Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet dance with the devil in the form of Robert De Niro, who uses New Orleans voodoo to entrap souls. Angel Heart pulled out all the stops in using stereotypes of Haitian voodoo, tying it to depraved sexuality, murder, and a general sensibility of “primitivism” not too dissimilar from what Americans once watched in White Zombie or King of the Zombies. The Wes Craven–directed The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) is a film set in Haiti and loosely, very loosely, based on a popular book by ethnobotanist Wade Davis. The story centers around Bill Pullman, portraying an extremely handsome anthropologist action hero, investigating the possibility of creating a “super anesthetic” from the concoction of powders he believes accounts for the phenomenon of Haitian zombies. Pullman’s character, Alan, arrives in Haiti in the waning days of the regime of “Baby Doc” Duvalier, the dictator of Haiti in the 1980s, long propped up by the United States, as was his father, known as Papa Doc. The Duvaliers ruled Haiti since 1957 and received significant American support. The U.S. Marines trained the Duvalier family’s terrifying Tonton Macoute in 1959. An organization somewhere between a secret police and paramilitary force, utterly loyal to the Duvalier family, they took their name from a frightening Haitian fairy-tale monster that carries off unruly children to cannibalize them in the night. Duvalier’s private army lived up to their name, disappearing political opponents and their supporters in the small hours. Under their vicious commander Luckner Cambronne, who earned the nickname “Vampire of the Caribbean” for his cruelty, they engaged in systemic violence against the Haitian people, murdering as many as sixty thousand Haitians during the Duvaliers’ twenty-nine-year reign. We do not have adequate statistics of the mass rapes or random assaults, mayhem, and murders that made the Macoute deeply feared.27 Papa Doc was followed by his son “Baby Doc” Duvalier, who ruled with the same mixture of fringe Vodun beliefs and political terror, along with an even closer relationship to the United States. Both father and son had, at different times, offered some symbolic statements of independence from the United States and even an attenuated Black nationalism. This posturing hid their role in the American plan to encircle Cuba both economically and geographically. Craven certainly had a great deal to work with in terms of real-world political suppression mixed with the hint of supernatural evil. Vodun had long been an important spiritual tradition in Haiti. But like most spiritual traditions, it can be used as a weapon. The Duvalier dictatorship did just that, encouraging the people to see themselves and the Macoute as Vodun masters (bokor) who would work wicked conjure on anyone who defied the regime. Davis suggested that Duvalier had managed to bring the regional heads of Vodun societies under his sway (bizango) and created what he called “a shadow government” that kept the people frightened and obedient.28 Critics noticed the film’s political subtext. The February 5, 1988, review in The New York Times described the film’s plot as dependent on the crimes of the Duvalier regime and the reputation of “the dreaded Tontons Macoute security force.” The review also offered the important insight that the politics of the film likely felt “confusing” to viewers. The Serpent and the Rainbow is a very different film from White Zombie or other B-grade fare from the earlier decades that offered simple messages of white supremacy. Haitian characters are given personal agency. A Haitian doctor, Marielle Duchamp, assists Pullman’s Harvard botanist in the struggle against the Tonton Macoute leader Peytraud, revealed to be a bokor (literally a wizard who will “work with both hands,” performing good and evil for money) who tortures his own people and, of course, turns them into zombies. Peytraud offered audiences a serious and convincing villain, unlike the many earlier European zombie masters. He’s balanced by Celine, a houngan priest of Vodun who represents the positive aspects of the religious tradition. Although Craven’s liberal impulses are certainly on display, The Serpent and the Rainbow ultimately acts to justify the American empire. Pullman’s Dr. Alan remains the hero throughout and he, not the Haitian houngan, defeats Peytraud at the end and rescues Dr. Duchamp as well. In another poorly considered plot point, Duchamp becomes Alan’s sidekick and lover. This is highly fraught in a context where colonization had always meant sexual exploitation by white men, from the days of enslaved people in the sugarcane fields through the country’s history of invasion and occupation by first French forces in the early nineteenth century and then multiple U.S. interventions in the twentieth. The final scene in The Serpent and the Rainbow shows us a celebration in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, as the people gleefully take their vengeance on the Tonton Macoute. This revolt against Duvalier’s regime did occur in 1986, much to the consternation of the Reagan administration, who had so valued Duvalier’s anti-Cuban, anti-communist stance that it used the American taxpayers’ money to fund his two-million-dollar wedding. The real cost of U.S. support for the Duvaliers had been paid by the Haitian people. Along with backing the Duvaliers’ use of terror, the U.S. agricultural department had called for the killing of the country’s entire pig population after an outbreak of swine flu. Duvalier acquiesced, and Haitian peasants, the majority of the country, saw their tiny incomes evaporate. By 1983, an organized challenge to Duvalier’s regime emerged and a full-fledged uprising occurred in January of 1986. The CIA provided Duvalier with a plan to escape to France with his family, where he went into an early retirement with a fortune of as much as eight hundred million dollars U.S.29 In the climactic celebration of The Serpent and Rainbow, Dr. Duchamp turns to Pullman’s white savior and in the last line of the film says, “the nightmare is over!” The man who had given us an ongoing nightmare on America’s Elm Street perhaps couldn’t be trusted as the most reliable forecaster for the shadowy climate of dream and nightmare. For Haiti, and much of the Caribbean, the American imperial nightmare continued. Lesser, and more explicitly racist, imitators followed. Voodoo Dolls (1991) could have been made in the 1950s, its Black male villain wearing bones around his neck and proving his perfidy by lusting after a white woman. The 1984 Zombie Island Massacre kills its zombie in the first fifteen minutes and largely exists to indulge the decade’s fascination with gratuitous female nudity. Yet, it still made it clear to audiences that the “exotic islands” (maybe the Caribbean, maybe the Pacific) are filled with dangerous native magic threatening to white people. Audiences may have devoured these films and their racist implications right along with their popcorn, not giving much thought to either. But reviewers took notice. The renowned critic Roger Ebert began his 1987 review of The Believers by saying “Here’s another one of those movies where a Caribbean voodoo cult wants to practice a blood sacrifice . . . Can’t they think of anything new to make a movie about?” Ebert went on to confess his own ignorance of the Caribbean religion, and notably he does use the generic American slang voodoo to talk about Cuban Santeria. But he reminded his readers that usually when Hollywood dealt with religion it told a story of “peace and love and friendship.” But this new raft of films “are always about guys with blank eyes who stare at you for 10 seconds and you’re volunteering to wring the chickens’ necks yourself.”30 The return of this subgenre of horror, the Caribbean zombi suddenly as popular as George A. Romero’s apocalyptic hordes, didn’t reflect on American politics. It represented a new funhouse mirror of the dark carnival that legitimized and justified racism at home while weaponizing American power abroad. It distracted from the zombie republics the United States continued to create abroad with the necromancy of corporate and military power. Moreover, the films constructed an ugly fantasy about dangers to the empire’s heartland. The United States, often celebrating itself as a “nation of immigrants,” has also been the nation of anti-immigrant sentiment. Along with the bleak irony of racism toward the forced immigrants of West Africa, distaste for the Chinese people (and Asians more generally) became a feature of nineteenth- and twentieth-century life. Racism directed at Mexican and other Latinx peoples oozed into public life even in parts of the West where Mexicans became “immigrants” only after the United States seized half their nation in the late 1840s and thousands found themselves on the wrong side of their own border. A new round of nativism emerged, particularly focused on Haitians and other Caribbean immigrants. During the 1970s, tens of thousands of Haitians, fleeing the Duvalier regime, arrived in all manner of rickety vessels in an effort to enter the United States. The Coast Guard returned many. Others allowed to enter spent months in detention centers with barbed wire fences, a practice ruled illegal by a federal court in 1982. The year 1980 became the high-water mark of attempted Haitian immigration with about fifteen thousand Haitians entering the country. Detained and not told of their right to request political asylum, they faced racial prejudice and the false belief that the new immigrants bore responsibility for the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The Reagan administration further undercut efforts by immigrants fleeing a catastrophe the United States helped to create by refusing to admit that political repression occurred in Haiti. Indeed, records of discussions in the Reagan White House reveal administration officials taking a hard line against Haitian immigrants, and Caribbean immigrants in general, referring to them in a 1981 memo as “undesirables.”31 American prejudices against immigrants found another focus in the Mariel boatlift (April to October 1980). Slightly improved relations between Cuba and the United States had led Fidel Castro to decree that any Cuban who had a U.S. contact could leave from Mariel Harbor. More than fifteen thousand did so in a few weeks, overwhelming U.S. immigration services. The Cuban government certainly benefitted from this, getting rid of political dissidents, and simultaneously handing the U.S. government an influx of tens of thousands of new immigrants in a short period. Carter used the Coast Guard to blockade the island, but Castro’s goals had been achieved. There’s no doubt that he decided on a “love it or leave it” attitude toward the migrants and found it an effective way to poke at the United States, whose intelligence operatives attempted to assassinate him at least sixteen times between 1962 and 2014.32 The Mariel boatlift, and the ongoing story of the “Haitian boat people,” seemed a new danger to many white Americans. Latin America remained nightmare country in the white supremacist imagination, only palatable when firmly under American imperial control. Puerto Rico continued to be a colony of the United States, and successive Democratic and Republican administrations denied it representation of any kind, including electoral votes. Unlike Hawaii and Alaska, it did not have a white majority. Hollywood responded with all manner of racist caricatures of everything south of Texas and Florida. Angel Heart featured tough-talking detectives referring to Haitians as being “into voodoo and all that shit.” Films like the enormously popular Scarface (1983) may have glamorized Al Pacino’s Tony Montana as the ultimate OG for some. Mainstream audiences read it as a manic coming-to-America story that portrayed Cuban immigrants as vicious, violent criminals. The far right continues to make use of the myth of Castro emptying out prisons and mental institutions, and even sending spies, into the United States. As he began to eye a political career in 2011, Donald Trump repeated the baseless claim and compared it to immigration from Mexico. In the Trump administration, it became a talking point for Stephen Miller, Trump’s speechwriter and advisor who has ties to various white supremacist organizations and leaders.33 5.Ain’t Got Time to Bleed WHITE AMERICANS, agitated by the movies, now worried their island neighbors were zombie-raising witch doctors with a penchant for communism. So they tended to support their government as it flexed its muscles in the Caribbean and Latin America. The 1983 invasion of Grenada received condemnation from around the world even as it elicited cheers at home. Although seven thousand American troops landed on the island, they faced more of a struggle than expected from the tiny number of Cuban soldiers and construction workers. Nineteen American service members died and more than one hundred were wounded in a protracted firefight, some from friendly fire and operational accidents. Cuban resistance brought down nine U.S. helicopters. Despite this deadly misadventure, the military handed out no less than 8,612 medals for the operation.34 “Our days of weakness are over,” Reagan announced in the debacle’s aftermath, “our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall.” This assertion aside, Reagan’s renowned rhetorical powers failed him. At first, he insisted the assault had been “a rescue” rather than “an invasion,” an attempt to get out American medical students who, it turned out, did not want to leave. Reagan tried to shift the story by claiming the island had been on the brink of becoming “a Soviet-Cuban base” that would “export terrorism.” In this version, Reagan could assure Americans they arrived “just in time.”35 Horror films at this time played out such fantasies in a fashion not dissimilar from the horror science fiction of the fifties, featuring Americans tangling with evil forces amid steaming jungles in exotic, nameless lands. The best, or perhaps the worst, example is the film Predator (1987). Arnold Schwarzenegger played a covert ops specialist everyone simply calls Dutch (Ronald Reagan’s nickname in the real world) while Carl Weathers portrayed CIA agent Dillon, who co-opts Dutch’s outfit for a rescue mission “across the border” in an unfriendly, unnamed Latin American nation. (The context and the year essentially tell us covert operations are based in Honduras and entering Nicaragua.) The first forty-five minutes of Predator offers a right-wing black ops fantasy about a dirty war. Dutch and Dillon lead their small band into the jungle and assault a camp of guerillas, slaughtering them with relative ease. Dillon discovers “secret documents” that explain that “Soviet advisors” are on the way. “We got here just in time,” he says, echoing Reagan’s claims after the invasion of Grenada. The film makes numerous visual and direct references to Vietnam. Both Dutch and Dillon are veterans, and Dillon tells the brawny character Blain (played by wrestler and later governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura) that the two had fought together in Vietnam, specifically the costly Battle of Hue. Not only is Blain unimpressed, he spits on Dillon’s boot. It’s an incredibly peculiar moment given the long-lived myth that Vietnam veterans returned to be “spit on by hippies.” In Predator, the black ops soldiers of America’s dirty wars are the ones who spit on Vietnam veterans. Making the scene even stranger, we learn that Ventura’s character had been in Cambodia and up to no good in the 1970s, fighting a secret war with the CIA while the draftees lost in Vietnam. Like most action films in the eighties, Predator burns testosterone like jet fuel with lots of cigar chomping, dramatic hundred-yard stares, and Ventura delivering lines like “I ain’t got time to bleed.” In fact, he finds plenty of time to bleed when the film’s titular monster appears and rips most of his internal organs out of his body. The Predator, which a short scene reveals to be an extraterrestrial, can camouflage himself with invisibility and packs an array of frightening weaponry. It’s the compendium of American fears in Vietnam and other imperial adventures that dates to the wars against First Nations peoples. There’s an enemy striking from the shadows with unrestrained ferocity, and who knows what weapons they might be able to use against us? The film’s setting in an indeterminate jungle places it alongside Bride of the Gorilla and King of the Zombies as films that imagined Americans fighting the good fight against overwhelming odds in frightening and geographically amorphous jungles. Predator received much bigger box office numbers than those films, however, becoming number one in June of ’87 and raking in many times its budget while spawning a franchise of sequels, comics, and video games, one of the latter appearing as recently as 2020. Film critic Dean Lamanna dismissed Predator in Cinefantastique as a “militarized monster movie.” But clearly the America public responded to this fantasy of American foreign policy. Sure, the nightly news might be trying to tell us about U.S.-funded death squads in Central America or the incompetent invasion of a tiny island for reasons even Reagan struggled to explain. But this popcorn flick showed Dutch standing toe to toe with the alien menace in the film’s silly climax and winning. The eighties and nineties represent a continuation of the country’s long belief, stretching back to the Monroe Doctrine (1823), that Latin America belonged in its sphere of influence. The Reagan years became an active convalescence period in which public opinion sought therapy for “the Vietnam syndrome,” a phrase Reagan used to describe an alleged weakness of nerve in American foreign policy after 1975. In a bleak irony, psychiatrists originally used the phrase to describe the snake’s nest of symptoms Vietnam veterans experienced, symptoms defined as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980. The dirty wars of Latin America offered a new jungle to refight Vietnam. Meanwhile, American culture would also find itself in a dirty war at home, its collateral damage igniting similar horrors in American allies and client states. 6.God Is Dead! Satan Lives! TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD ERICKA Ingram of Olympia, Washington, attended a spiritual retreat in the summer of 1988. Many young people in this period, from teenagers to twentysomethings, became attracted to what has usually been called Charismatic Christianity, a spiritual movement that emphasizes divine healing, the casting out of demons, and other miraculous spiritual gifts (charismatic coming from the New Testament Greek word for “gifts” rather than from our modern usage). Amid late-night sing-alongs and bull sessions that made the retreat like a Christian summer camp experience, the organizers invited a former stand-up comedian turned minister and alleged healer named Karla Franko to speak. One of the charisms that Franko claimed to exercise was a gift of discernment, a kind of divination allegedly guided by the Holy Spirit. During a worship service, Franko pointed to Ericka and told her she had been molested by her father. Ericka cried but reportedly did not respond to this bizarre assertion. Several weeks after this incident, Ericka and her younger sister Julie accused their father of not only molesting them, but also forcing them to take part in sickening satanic rituals, and even sacrificing victims to the devil and burying the bodies under a barn in the family’s backyard. Local police arrested their father based only on these accusations, but the oddity of the case didn’t end there. Ericka and Julie’s father, Paul Ingram, worked in the Thurston County Sherriff’s Office for nearly seventeen years, headed the local Republican Party, and served as a stalwart member of the family’s fundamentalist congregation, the Church of Living Water. Ingram himself slowly began to believe that he had, in fact, done precisely what his daughters accused him of and gave a meandering, contradictory confession. What happened in the apparently happy household? Did the head of a satanic cult viciously abuse his daughters then hide in plain sight as one of Olympia’s most respected citizens? Had Satanists, as Ingram’s daughters suggested, infiltrated a police department and the entire community?36 None of these sensational claims held even a trifling amount of truth. Forensic experts did not find bodies concealed under the old barn. Both daughters proved unreliable witnesses with increasingly erratic accusations about judges, police, and social workers who also belonged to their father’s satanic cult. Ericka claimed to be scarred over much of her body from years of abuse, but a medical exam revealed no evidence of physical trauma—a fact she explained away by suggesting Satan made the wounds invisible. Paul Ingram’s “confession” was in part suggested to him by the family’s pastor, who urged him to believe he’d been possessed by demons and could not recall the hideous acts committed through him. Ingram would remain in prison until 2003 and was forced to register as a sex offender at the time of his release.37 The Ingram daughters, though morally and perhaps legally culpable for a series of false accusations, became victims of a national fantasy. Like millions of Americans, they were utterly convinced that satanic covens operated freely in Reagan’s America. A satanic panic had seized up the country’s central nervous system. The origins of the satanic panic are complex. Rumors of Satanists mutilating cattle became common in the 1970s. Tales of mysterious cattle mutilation had long been a feature of ranch life in the American West. Cows are, of course, rather low on the world’s food chain, frequently victims of wolves, coyotes, or venomous snakes. Smaller predators then devour the softer bits of the corpse in a way that makes it appear “mutilated.” Such acts were often blamed on Native American people and later, after the forties and fifties, flying saucer mania, as evidence of extraterrestrial activity. Satan’s new role as box office star gave the legend a plot and a script. Rosemary’s Baby, meant as a parody of social conventions about pregnancy, left many convinced of the reality of satanic covens, believing that even your neighbors could be in on the plot. Horror films dealing with the devil have played a powerful and unconventional role in shaping what Americans are willing to believe. The Exorcist made parish phones ring off the hook all around the country after 1973. The Omen, despite borrowing only selectively from Hal Lindsey and his readers’ end-of-the-world fetish, confirmed that the devil and his offspring prepared for the final conflict, a phrase that became the subtitle of the third sequel. An obsession with murderous cults further shaped the Satanism scare. The Manson murders were ascribed to devil worship in all manner of public accounts of the crimes, even if Satan did not play a particularly important role in Charles Manson’s peculiar blend of mysticism and murder. However, both Ed Sanders and Maury Terry, with no evidence but the lack of evidence they were wrong, helped spread this notion. In fact, Terry’s career of misinformation recently received a popular, highly cynical, “true crime” documentary on Netflix called The Sons of Sam in which we hear his meandering conceptions of links between Manson, David Berkowitz, and murderous gangs of devil-worshippers presented in a slick fashion likely to confuse a new generation of Americans. These ideas may have remained in the hazy twilight world of pop theology, what contemporary people think they know about religion from what they see at the movies, nervousness about those damn hippies, and a very generalized fear of social change in the sixties. But the political climate of the 1980s, one in which religion mixed indiscriminately with governance and the president felt comfortable calling our nuclear rival “an evil empire,” allowed the ancient concept of Satan to seem very real. Anxiety about empire played a larger role in the Satanism scare than historians, modern folklorists, and sociologists have conceded in the past. Like ancient Rome panicking over the frenzied cult of the Bacchae, Americans whispered tales of evil cults, serial killers, and secret covens. Roman angst over the worship of the Greek god Dionysus came, like their fear of Christianity, from a sense that foreign, evil influences could introduce chaos into the machinery of empire. In eighties America, the idea of an omnicompetent Satanist conspiracy tied together a vast number of fears, anxieties, and hatreds related to the changing role of women, the sexual revolution, the Cold War, and the American empire walking with a noticeable limp in the post-Vietnam era. And so the United States experienced a mass delusion. Across the country, claims of a well-organized criminal network of Satanists seized the darkest parts of the religious imagination. Books appeared like Michelle Remembers, whose author claimed her psychiatrist (and later husband) Lawrence Pazder enabled her to recover memories of a childhood filled with the most bizarre forms of sexualized, ritualized abuse. Other influential books followed, many by evangelicals who suddenly became “occult experts.” Accusations that children fell victim to satanic covens exploded, especially at day care centers. The McMartin preschool case in Manhattan Beach, California, became the longest trial in American history. Law enforcement and a covey of evangelical ministers encouraged parents in the belief that their children had been victims of Satanists who used the preschool as a front. In hundreds of communities, rumors of Satanists holding Black Mass in the woods sometimes brought out armed posses of citizens on a hunt for the alleged coven.38 In 1988, police in Jamestown, New York, contended with a massive rumor panic that led to attacks on a warehouse used as a practice space for local bands, armed vigilantes showing up at a local park, and the rumor that a Satanic cult planned to sacrifice a blue-eyed, blonde virgin on Friday the thirteenth. In the local paper, law enforcement insisted they found no evidence of any kind of secretive, criminal activity, which further incited the panic. Locals saw police denials as an odd sort of proof that either they did not wish to panic the community about a real threat, or that the police were in fact part of the conspiracy. But, as often as not, American law enforcement fanned these flames. One exhaustive study of police involvement in the satanic panic called Occult Cops found many law enforcement officers setting themselves up as “occult experts.” Almost all fit a basic template: male, white, deeply conservative, born-again Protestants aggrieved at their inability to rise higher in the law enforcement hierarchy, careers often dead-ended by their own lack of interest in the nuts and bolts of basic police work. Many of these men played some role in the prosecution of anti-war protestors and Black freedom struggle organizations in the sixties and seventies.39 The “occult experts,” often collaborating with evangelical leaders who also pretended knowledge of a vast Satanist conspiracy, held enormous influence over public perception and even the training of police. In 1987, Greenville County, South Carolina, law enforcement took a training course in combatting Satanism. Along with a description of occult symbols clearly borrowed from films, officers received a course in fundamentalist theology. The manual accused Christian churches of having not taken the existence of the devil seriously. The course provided absolutely no information, except in the most general terms (“reports from around the country”), that human sacrifice, particularly of children, was taking place on a large scale.40 The support of local officials and police departments linked with a surprising number of therapists and social workers now attached to the notion of Satanic ritual abuse, or SRA, as a social and psychological phenomenon. Although today rejected by mental health professionals, the idea created a surprisingly large network of supporters and sometimes made for the oddest of political alliances. Gloria Steinem believed stories of “ritual abuse” and, as late as 1993, published an issue of Ms. magazine with the cover story demanding the reader “BELIEVE IT! Cult Ritual Abuse Exists.”41 We’ve barely touched on the hundreds of local outbreaks or the related moral panic over heavy metal music and Dungeons & Dragons. Luckily, the era of “the satanic panic” has received a significant amount of attention and for good reasons. Except for America’s cyclical “red scares,” a moral panic that at least found some basis in the rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union, no other falsehood in U.S. history became so widely believed. In some quarters, to raise doubts about the existence of a powerful satanic conspiracy became proof you were in on it. American imperial power assured that Satanism scares in the metropole slithered into the colonies and client states abroad. The reverberation of the satanic panic was seen around the world, nowhere more than in parts of Africa where the United States maintained a strong military and, for a century, missionary presence. American special forces and the CIA engaged in covert operations all over the continent of Africa in the seventies and eighties, just as they had in the earlier days of the Cold War. The United States supported a South African invasion of Angola to end a civil war there when the leftist National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) seemed on the verge of winning on the ground and in the hearts and minds of Angolans. A declassified National Security Council document, though heavily redacted, shows Henry Kissinger and President Ford discussing an arms package to Angola’s right-wing guerrillas and their South African supporters. The document raises the possibility of allowing the state of Angola to collapse rather than take a socialist turn. Ford later attempted to change the narrative of America’s involvement by explaining that the United States intervened only after Fidel Castro sent Cuban forces to aid FNLA, a claim that does not match the timeline of events. Other declassified documents reveal that Kissinger urged an air strike against Cuba for aiding African revolutionaries.42 As U.S. money, arms, and assets swarmed over the continent, evangelical missionaries brought an American brand of Christianity, and an American terror of Satan, to the continent. “Charismatic” churches in particular took their emphasis on deliverance from demons and combined them with an African worldview of a universe throbbing with various kinds of supernatural powers. These variants of American Christianity saw exponential growth in numerous African nations, with scholars even referring to a “Pentecostal explosion” on the continent.43 Apartheid South Africa had long been viewed as an important Cold War American ally. Desperate to defend the racist social structures that penned Black South Africans into “homelands,” the white supremacist government of South Africa also proved reliably anti-communist. Thanks to a series of arms deals with Israel, it also formed an alliance with the bulwark of U.S. policy in the Middle East.44 America also gave South Africa a bad case of the satanic panic. Not surprisingly, it appeared in a highly racialized form. As the system of apartheid increasingly came under attack and global support flowed to the imprisoned Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress, white South Africans (Afrikaners) became convinced that Satanic rituals, which they often conflated with traditional African religious practices, threatened their children with “rape, murder, cannibalism and all manner of atrocities.”45 The white-dominated government started an Occult Related Crimes Unit, headed by evangelical Christian Adriaan Vlok. The unit would later be broken up and replaced by essentially the same organization with a more rational-sounding name, the Harmful Religious Practices Unit. Since 2012, this police organization kept the satanic panic alive by claiming to investigate “vampirism,” cases of possession, and that perpetual obstacle to the rule of law . . . “astral coercion.” America’s satanic panic made its way to Africa as mass culture as well. A film produced with the help of Charismatic missionaries became popular in Nigeria in the early 1990s. Living in Bondage took African folklore and combined it with Western notions of Satan. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the book Snatched from Darkness became a best-seller. The evidence-free screed closely followed the template of American evangelicals in claiming a large satanic conspiracy, brewed dangerously with some traditional African beliefs about witchcraft and evil spirits. Over the decades, the cost to the people of Africa has been enormous, with tens of thousands executed for witchcraft, and Christian leaders in, for example, Uganda fighting for legislation that would make being an LGBTQ person a crime punishable by death.46 The imperial dimension of America’s Satan obsession also appeared, not surprisingly, on the troubled southern border. The United States had long seen Mexico as a source of anxiety, sending invading armies across the Rio Grande to make amphibious assaults at Veracruz, or alternatively trying to wall off their neighbor. “So far from God, so close to the United States,” runs the weary Mexican joke. In 1989, Americans latched on to a horrific story that coiled together their nervousness about the border and the satanic panic. An American college student, Mark Kilroy, went missing while spring breaking in Matamoros, a province just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Local authorities discovered his body, along with fourteen others, buried in a mass grave. All the corpses bore evidence of torture. American media reported the death of Kilroy as the work of “a drug cult” or a “satanic cult.” Even the restrained reporting of The New York Times quoted Brownsville officials claiming an “occult” group sought to create “a magical shield” around themselves with “a twisted blend of sacrificial and black magic practices from Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica.” The Mexicans had sacrificed a fresh-faced American youth to Satan.47 The facts of the case are no less grisly than fans of the satanic panic believed, though the truth does not fulfil their strange fantasies. Adolfo Constanzo, the head of the drug ring responsible for the murders, did present himself to natives of the region, and some of his own henchmen, as a practitioner of “black magic.” However, not unlike a miniature version of the Duvalier regime, he claimed supernatural power only to inspire fear and obedience. And his inspiration for this idea? A horror film fan, he particularly enjoyed The Believers (1987), which mixed its Hollywood schlock and shock with a smattering of ideas stolen from traditional African religions in Cuba. In the feedback loop of the satanic panic, America produced films about evil cults that provided fodder for drug lords, whose actions in turn fueled Satanism fever.48 7.Norman Rockwell Is Burning in Hell THE SATANIC panic offered the Reagan administration a perfect Greenbaum effect. Not unlike the illusory notions about flying saucers and invading aliens, the panic made Americans open to all manner of false conspiracy theories. Much like the 1950s, these public obsessions allowed actual conspiracies to flourish. Once again, Americans proved themselves willing to listen to baseless assertions, and express some belief in them, even as the national security state and the executive branch hatched more complex, but very real, intrigues to further the demands of the American empire. During this era, Corydon Hammond, at one time a leading figure at the University of Utah School of Medicine, made a career with his tales of the satanic Greenbaum, a wandering Jew with ties to Nazism. He often insisted to his rapt listeners that he feared assassination for the “secrets” he shared. Hammond managed to draw NASA and the Mafia into his League of Super Evil Evildoers.49 The deluded ideas of QAnon have the DNA of Hammond’s claims, particularly his insistence that satanic kill squads kidnapped, programmed, and sometimes sacrificed kids on American army bases. These same groups, Hammond told therapists, also made money from drugs and arms sales. Such notions offered a gift to America’s intelligence community. There may have been no Satanists involved in gunrunning, but the CIA and the Reagan administration certainly sold armaments for advantage and security interests, sans the black robes and pentagrams. In a century’s worth of criminal behavior on behalf of the American empire, the Iran-Contra affair (1985–1987) stands out. Its reality is dark enough. The fact that it did not become a new Watergate and instead set the stage for open, unpunished criminality at the highest levels of government makes the story feel all too contemporary. The Sandinista National Liberation Front seized power from the far-right and deeply repressive Somoza regime of Nicaragua in 1979. They named themselves after Augusto Sandino, who had led opposition to an American invasion of Nicaragua in the late twenties and again in the thirties. The Sandinista regime became largely popular in Nicaragua, instituting rural health care and a major literacy program. In 1984, the country held a free election that consolidated Sandinista power. Most Americans were not aware of the events in Nicaragua, and few probably cared. But the Reagan administration held the absolute conviction that, against a great deal of evidence, the Soviets turned Nicaragua into a satellite. The CIA trained anti-government forces across the border in the client state of Honduras. These forces, the Contras, started as a ragtag group of mercenaries and criminals. American handlers turned them into something much more lethal. The CIA urged the guerrillas to attack “soft targets”—rural schools and medical clinics—that would endanger Sandinista popularity. Duane “Dewey” Clarridge, American liaison on the ground, admitted to Congress that the Contras executed doctors, nurses, teachers, and judges. “After all,” he said of these illegal covert operations against civilians, “this is a war.”50 The Reagan administration funded these horrors in secret, hidden from the American people and Congressional oversight. Congress passed the Boland Amendment in 1982 forbidding the funding of anti-Sandinista forces. The Reagan administration circumvented Congress. A secret enclave within the administration and the intelligence community used hundreds of millions in loans from American ally Saudi Arabia and raised hundreds of millions more in illegal arms sales to Iran. In their view, the secret arms deal with Iran paid double dividends, raising money for the Contras and securing the release of American hostages held in Lebanon (though religious extremists in Iran quickly took more hostages for future collateral against the United States). Cash now flowed to the Contra leadership through the hands of drug traffickers (including CIA asset Manual Noriega) and various non-state actors. These covert operations allowed the United States to stage-manage a Nicaraguan “civil war” that otherwise would not have existed. Israel, which joined the United States as one of the world’s leading arms dealers, even participated in the effort, doing business on behalf of the United States with its sworn enemy Iran.51 Oliver North, a marine who suffered severe trauma in Vietnam and subsequently turned to fundamentalist Christianity for succor, directed much of the program, coordinating with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and the CIA. North gathered a remarkably unsavory group of drug dealers, including Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and Félix Rodriguez, an international terrorist and CIA asset who exploded a bomb on a civilian Cuban passenger jet in 1976 that killed seventy-three people. Rodriguez worked with the CIA since the Bay of Pigs invasion and aided Bolivian authorities in the murder of Che Guevara in 1967.52 In October of 1986, a young Nicaraguan soldier downed an American cargo plane with a ground-to-air missile launcher. Nicaraguan investigators discovered the plane packed with sophisticated weapons systems intended for the Contras. The survivor of the downed aircraft, former marine and CIA agent Eugene Hasenfus, sang like a bird at daybreak about the entire story of arms for hostages, illegal fund transfers, and the role of some of the worst international terrorists on the planet in the Unites States’ effort to stage a civil war.53 The Iranian government, as Reagan’s advisors should have realized, proved more than happy to tell the world their side of the story. A special counsel launched an investigation, as did Congress. Reagan’s advisors George Shultz and James Baker warned the president from the beginning that the plot constituted a textbook example of an impeachable offense.54 CIA director William J. Casey and George H. W. Bush reassured Reagan but the evidence of “high crimes and misdemeanors” grew exponentially. After learning that, without the knowledge of Congress and even other branches of the armed services, the CIA had mined Nicaragua’s harbors, right-wing stalwart Barry Goldwater angrily denounced the administration’s actions. The infamously fiery Goldwater declared himself “utterly pissed off” that the United States had broken international law and committed an act of war.55 The outcome of the scandal—it rivaled and perhaps surpassed Watergate in its breadth—reveals much about America in the 1980s. Fourteen administration officials received federal indictments and the courts convicted eleven for a range of crimes that sound like a laundry list of charges appropriate for a RICO case leveled against organized crime figures rather than a political scandal. Twelve indictments of major government figures followed, North himself facing sixteen counts of felony. Yet, Bush I survived the controversy to win the presidency in 1988, and by then, Iran-Contra ceased to be an issue. Bush as president pardoned everyone convicted in the conspiracy. North became a right-wing celebrity complete with book deals and eventually a profitable relationship with Fox News.56 Writer-director Mick Garris (Sleepwalkers, Nightmare Cinema) once summed up the horror films of the seventies and eighties as “Norman Rockwell goes to hell.” These films responded to an American empire whose citizens felt powerless and baffled as the luckiest enjoyed the fruits of citizenship in a country that ran the world. Tens of millions of people bought into the idea of a detailed conspiracy of satanic networks controlling the media, the UN, and law enforcement but could not be bothered to thoughtfully examine the details of a conspiracy of arms, drugs, and Bond-level villains responsible for the death and maiming of tens of thousands.57 But, in the Reagan years, keeping America’s large and ever-growing sphere of influence toeing the line was not enough. Full-spectrum dominance, much like the dreams of the aeronautics industry and sci-fi films from the fifties once imagined, needed to include outer space. 8.Space, the Wild Frontier ROBERT A. HEINLEIN drifted into a strange solipsism in the seventies and eighties. In the 1960s, his novel beloved by the Manson Family, Stranger in a Strange Land, became required reading for the counterculture. They found its themes of polyamory and individualism attractive without exactly realizing the far-right politics that attended the call to hedonism. Okay, boomer. After the success of this novel, Heinlein’s work became increasingly mystical. By the eighties, his books exhibited a stream-of-consciousness quality and a narrative voice that made them read less like novels than papal encyclicals on limited government, religion, and sexuality. Indeed, Heinlein fans listened to his pronouncements as if they came ex cathedra. Even his admirers found these works produced from about 1980 until his death in 1988 barely readable, as if the philosophical underpinnings of Heinlein’s worldview began to take over his authorial voice. His libertarianism became metaphysical. The stories ceased to be stories and became elaborations of the inner self known to the world as Robert A. Heinlein. The results proved not only awful, they are pitiable. The Number of the Beast (1980) solves its plot problems with the intervention of Glinda the Good Witch, a deus ex malefica as laughable as it is pompous. Even good ideas like Job: A Comedy of Justice (1984), which promised a rollicking parody of organized religion, inflicted on readers a ghastly plod in which the narrator himself, who is essentially Heinlein, seems to believe he’s God. To Sail Beyond the Sunset (1987) suggests that smoking a joint represents the height of moral depravity, while a father having sex with his daughter might be fine, depending on context. If his writing faltered in a morass of narcissism, Heinlein remained politically committed at a time when his dreams of a scrawny social contract but a muscular military seemed to have come true. In 1980, he served on the rather harmless-sounding Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy along with protégé Jerry Pournelle. The Department of Defense had given the working group significant influence to help outline space policy for the Reagan administration. This would have costly and frightening implications. Since the Kennedy administration, many Americans held an idealistic image of NASA, and the space program more generally, as dedicated to science and exploration. These ideals had certainly been part of NASA’s conception of itself. But the agency was also tied irrevocably to the nation’s burgeoning national security state. Beginning in 1957 with the Soviet launch of the first satellite, Sputnik 1, American efforts to rocket orbital vehicles and eventually humans into space entwined with the Cold War and American imperial hopes. It chilled CIA officials to the bone that Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first man in space, sent greetings to the national liberation movements in Africa as he passed over the continent. The United States had been up to its elbows in some earthbound dirty tricks of gunrunning and assassination to try to suppress these very movements now being hailed from orbit on the Vostok 1. The national security state organized NASA in 1958, creating it literally in the shadow of Sputnik. From the moment of its inception, the organization cooperated closely with the military. A series of documents appeared in 2015 that showed that, at its inception, NASA worked closely with the CIA. Acting CIA director and air force general Charles P. Cabell contacted administrators of the space program regarding intelligence sharing even before Congress officially brought NASA into existence. Satellites ostensibly collecting data on weather, geological activity, and oceanic patterns also harvested any data they could on the Soviets. The space agency even aided the CIA in analyzing that raw intelligence. NASA officials meanwhile helped float cover stories for CIA projects like the U-2 and the A-12 jets, both agencies insisting that the spy planes served only scientific purposes.58 The relationship among covert operations, NASA, and the American search for imperial invincibility came together in the desire to militarize space. Heinlein’s vision of space marines exterminating the enemy with extreme prejudice was not far off the mark. After Sputnik, the United States made threatening moves against the Soviets by placing missiles in Italy and Turkey. Meanwhile, NASA not only worked hand in glove with the CIA but earned a place at the budgetary table by joining the Pentagon’s effort to develop rocketry able to deliver a heavier payload of nuclear mayhem. Heinlein’s protégé Jerry Pournelle not only continued as a prolific author of sci-fi horror but also became part of the national security establishment with his West Point textbook on strategy in the nuclear age. Although some of his ideas for America’s aerospace/military industrial complex seem like plot summaries for his science fiction novels (such as his involvement in a group wanting to send paramilitary American colonists into space in hive-like colonies), he would have outsized influence on the new Republican administration that brought the country closer to the brink of nuclear holocaust than any time since the 1960s. Pournelle supported not only Reagan’s well-known social conservatism but also his desire to expand American military might—not only across the world but very literally into orbit. In the early eighties he joined his fellow sci-fi writer Dean Ing in publishing a book that revived the right-wing fantasy of the United States creating orbital superweapons. Entitled Mutually Assured Survival, it carried an endorsement from Reagan himself. The actual text, sci-fi author Thomas M. Disch wrote in The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World, reads like the specs for “the technological background” of one of Pournelle’s own “space operas.” The book called for, among other weaponry technologically impossible at the time, laser cannons that would use orbital mirrors to rain destruction down on the Soviets or the Chinese. In this dystopian vision, satellites would become little more than weapons stations that used “kinetic energy” to destroy America’s enemies.59 This might seem like the harmless rantings of sci-fi writers who managed to claw a blurb out of the president’s press secretary. That is, if the Reagan administration had not sought out Pournelle to help advertise precisely the kind of superweapons imagined in his fiction. Pournelle worked closely on the policy and the rhetoric of Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), dismissed as “Star Wars” by Senator Ted Kennedy. Reagan offered the perfect vessel for sci-fi militarists. J. Hoberman makes the case that, given his background in Hollywood, no president better understood how the movies nestle close to our worldviews, shaping politics and personal identity. In the summer of 1981, with Raiders of the Lost Ark owning the box office, American F-14 fighters brought down two Libyan jets in a show of force against a North African nation known for its support of attacks on Americans. After receiving the news, Reagan pantomimed a performance of Indiana Jones pulling his revolver and shooting dead an Arab swordsman that American audiences were currently applauding in theaters. “Reagan isn’t our movie,” Hoberman wrote at the time, “we are his: America the movie.”60 Right-wing writers of violent science fiction thus found the Reagan administration generally amenable to the cinematic possibilities of taking war into space. The president’s own understanding of the universe outside our atmospheric bubble largely seemed shaped by movies he’d seen. He once asked Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze if the Soviets would work with the United States against an alien threat. Even more bizarrely, he raised the issue with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1985 Geneva arms reduction talks. Colin Powell admitted that Reagan’s “little green men” interest was well known and thought it came from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).61 Pournelle and his confederates found their guy when it came to the imperial fantasy life. Thirty billion dollars would be thrown at SDI, part of the reason that the United States tripled its budget deficits by the end of the Reagan years. Ideas for an orbital ballistic missile system went so far as to imagine a system of lasers guiding advanced rockets to strike down Russian warheads while still in orbit. Pournelle worked as a part-time speechwriter for Reagan on the issue of SDI. He also provided a crucial link with the aerospace industry, which added to the billions they already made in government contracts for expensive, highly technical weapon systems.62 SDI always remained more of a political fantasy and a public relations stunt than an actual military initiative. But it proved an expensive, and enduring, fantasy. In order to sell the idea, NASA produced “computer models” that essentially used video game technology to create a scenario in which orbital war platforms took out Soviet ICBMs like a teenage arcade wizard. In fact, it’s hard not to see these presentations as heavily influenced by WarGames (1983), a film that imagines a similar scenario and that fascinated Reagan. But these were not representations of technology that actually existed. They were quite literally, as news reports often noted with either delight or cynicism, the “stuff of science fiction.” As Reagan himself lost interest in a program that no reputable scientist believed would ever work, the vision of full-spectrum American dominance slowly transmogrified into an idea for a limited anti-ballistic missile system that made the rounds during the George W. Bush administration. The right wing of science fiction, started by Heinlein but now really led by Pournelle, remained active. Under their influence, the most extreme conservatives became some of the space program’s strongest advocates. Newt Gingrich, the powerful Speaker of the House through most of the Clinton years, had a soft spot for using sci-fi weapons to destroy the monsters he saw threatening America. He coauthored a book with conservative science fiction writer David Drake, one of the practitioners of the “space marine” genre. Their Window of Opportunity: A Blueprint for the Future featured an introduction written by Pournelle and a call for colonizing space with American capitalism and militarism—what Pournelle called a practical application “of the principles that make this nation great” that “proves that we can all get rich” off of space. In 1994, the year the Republican-controlled Congress imposed severe austerity programs on America’s already macerated social programs, Gingrich told readers in his book To Renew America that “aerospace engineer and science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle” had assured him that “space tourism” would become a normal part of American life by 2020. How this would be possible in an America where Gingrich’s, and to a large degree his nemesis, moderate Democrat Bill Clinton’s, slash-and-burn approach to social welfare had caused tens of millions to hurtle below the poverty line is never explained. Their “tough on crime” rhetoric increased the incarceration of Americans, especially African Americans. For-profit prisons became the reality of the American future and not Gingrich’s claim that “honeymoons in space” would be “in vogue” in the year I write these words. Perhaps it’s pleasing to him that a few billionaires funding jumps into orbit, rather than letting their wealth “trickle down” or “create wealth,” has become a new pastime.63 Heinlein died in 1988 but his progeny sallied forth to spin violent survivalist fantasies, slaughtering aliens and humans alike who threatened libertarian values. William R. Forstchen, a ghostwriter for Newt Gingrich, published Star Voyager Academy in 1994. Directly plagiarizing ideas from Heinlein, particularly from Starship Troopers and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Forstchen imagined a new American revolution in which colonists on the moon revolt against Earth over high taxes. Pournelle wrote a popular series of space marine novels, the Falkenberg’s Legion series, that are thinly disguised tracts for some of his more savage political views. Gingrich himself attempted an alternative history called 1945 that imagines a world in which Hitler wins and the United States must race against time to develop the atomic bomb before the victorious Nazi state. Alternate histories of World War II (and most every major historical event) have created some sci-fi masterpieces, most notably Philip K. Dick’s 1962 The Man in the High Castle. Gingrich found a way to make the scenario boring. The Republican lawmaker’s book made the case for the mantra of nineties Republicans, and plenty of the era’s “new Democrats,” that “big government” had to come to an end. Gingrich’s 1945 turns into a fictionalized plea for the United States to give away billions to the aeronautics industry but offer no supervision or regulation for what the John Galt–ish entrepreneurs do with the money. The political hectoring may have been only part of the book’s problem. Like so much of the Heinlein fanfic published over the decades, 1945 may disdain big government but it loves big weapons in an exceptionally weird fashion. In one passage so purple it feels like a bad bruise, the superweapons of Gingrich’s fantasy world are “dark” and “compelling” but give the military tech enthusiast who created them the feeling of “being aroused by a woman one despised.” Gingrich has continued to trouble the world with sci-fi and historical fiction, including racist reimaginings of the Civil War and paranoid delusions about Pearl Harbor. Such ramblings would be beneath notice except that he, like so many other authors of murderous science fiction, kept exceedingly odd involvements with the American military that went beyond his role in the House. Gingrich has frequently taught at the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks and in fact has been the long-serving member of the Joint Warfighting Committee that’s supposed to sharpen the strategic thinking of officers preparing to serve at the Pentagon’s highest echelons. Other than his long-standing desire to strip-mine outer space and kill anything that resists, it’s unclear what kind of strategic thinking Gingrich brought to the table. 9.They Live THE 1980S can feel like a 1950s remake, if perhaps even more paranoid. A new red scare, and deep anxiety over the use of atomic weapons, followed Reagan’s hard-nosed approach to the Soviets. The movies often reflected such notions, in films like Predator but also in other genres. Heartbreak Ridge (1986) starring Clint Eastwood presented an utterly false picture of the Grenada invasion. Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) quite literally refought (and won) the Vietnam War. Mass culture seemed on the side of Reagan’s worldview. But horror’s taste for the subversive slithered around since its origin point in the 1920s. There are hundreds of examples of horror as escapism or horror managing to buttress Americans’ myopic view of the world and their place in it. This makes efforts in the rather conformist decade to ask fans to question the basic values of empire even more exceptional. Larry Cohen’s The Stuff has become an independent horror classic, with restored editions appearing more than thirty years after its 1985 release. The Jewish director, horrified by his family’s tales of the Holocaust and his own sense of alienation in America, already used horror to question America’s obsessions with its children and its willingness to destroy the environment with the murderous infants of his It’s Alive! series. Eclectic and inventive, he’d worked on Black cinema classics like Bone and Black Caesar while using horror to make an early “defund the police” statement in Maniac Cop (1988). The Stuff makes a nightmare of American militarism and its relation to corporate power. The actual stuff of the title turns out to be a self-aware parfait that everyone in America needs very badly. Cohen fills the strange film with commercials so real they transcend parody. The titular weird goop became the ultimate commodity fetish. Americans needed it. Americans needed to eat it. Consuming the stuff, as much as they could muscle into their gullets, became a kind of moral imperative, a duty of citizenship with ads assuring people that it will “give a new order to life.” At a time when Reagan urged Americans to believe in “the magic of the marketplace,” The Stuff suggested that there’s a dark gramarye at work and the consumer is being consumed. Cohen succeeded in questioning America’s effort to bring its nightmare of consumption to the rest of the world with the character Colonel Spears, who seems unaware the United States lost the Vietnam War. George A. Romero’s Day of the Dead (1985) came amid the second Reagan administration’s full-throated support for counterrevolution in Nicaragua and years of anti-Soviet rhetoric that continued the polyphonic themes of the Soviet Union as “an evil empire” and the United States as the primary force for good in the world. Day of the Dead, though it received less attention than the earlier Romero zombie films, became the most biting satire of the trilogy. In it, the American military are maniacal bullies, little more than aspirant warlords in a ruined America. At a moment when SDI suggested that science, industry, and the Pentagon could work together to produce a defensive shield for an invulnerable nation, Romero made the scientists either utterly insane or placed them at contretemps with the violent, undisciplined military. The film turned out to be the only commercial failure in Romero’s first zombie trilogy. A yuppie America didn’t care for this approach given the new fetish for the military even in the aftermath of Vietnam. “Horror is radical,” Romero told an interviewer, “[it can] rattle your cage and say, wait a minute—look at things differently.” Americans did not want to see such films in a decade when even geopolitical nightmares like the possibility of a foreign invasion, such as in Red Dawn (1984), are given a soporific ending.64 In 1988, John Carpenter directed They Live, now a cult classic that offers the most intriguing horror movie of the eighties in terms of creating a compelling plot while wearing its politics on its sleeve. In the film, a homeless construction worker named Nada (“nobody” or “nothing”) comes into possession of a pair of high-tech specs that allow him to see America for what it really is. The earth, we learn, has been secretly invaded by aliens who have lived among us for some time. The shades Nada wears reveal the actual messages received from billboards and magazines, all commands from our unseen masters. An advertisement for a vacation that shows a sultry woman in a bathing suit stretched languorously on the beach really says MARRY AND REPRODUCE. Looking at a magazine rack, the covers splashed with gadgets, cars, and supermodels, Nada’s glasses show him they order the reader to OBEY, STAY ASLEEP, and simply SHOP. Meanwhile the president, who Nada discovers is also an alien trying to keep people “asleep” with consumerism, not only looks but sounds like Reagan. “It’s a new morning in America. Fresh Vital,” he says, directly alluding to the 1984 Reagan commercial “Morning in America.” Carpenter described They Live as his response “to the Reagan years” and in particular to “the unrestrained capitalism of the era.” Popular culture acquiesced to Reaganomics and American foreign policy. At the time, Carpenter remembers, Michael Douglas could deliver his famous line “Greed is good” in the 1987 film Wall Street, which read to many as a motto instead of a parody. “I wanted to make some political statements,” Carpenter recalled, during a time when “everybody is proud to be an American if they can make money at it.”65 The coming of the 1990s did not bring a new social consciousness. The efforts of cultural critics working in numerous fields—the writing of Noam Chomsky, the activism of Cornel West, and the satirical horror of Carpenter and Romero—found little purchase. Romero, Cohen, and Carpenter used horror to ask questions and, especially in the case of Carpenter, demand a response. But few listened. Americans entered a new era in which the small footprint of the American empire became a heavy boot on the world’s face, even as the social contract at home continued to unravel. The explosive violence of America’s empire not only continued its lethal trajectory, its velocity accelerated. The end of the Cold War did not bring a “peace dividend.” Facing no conceivable rival on earth as the Red Army disappeared into history’s mists after 1991, the Pentagon and its enormously wealthy corporate partners did not stand down. The United States developed and sold new weapons technologies, built more military bases to control more points on the globe, and developed Space Command as a joint project of all the armed services, dedicated to creating killer satellites and cyber war capabilities. Few Americans even knew about Space Command, a forerunner of today’s Space Force, even though it receives mention in the 1996 film Independence Day. Horror awakened dormant nightmares in the nineties, an era that didn’t seem too bad if you were white and enjoyed relative economic prosperity. Amity Island felt okay, really just fine. But the chain saw brattled in the century’s twilight.",

Blood blossoms from the young actor’s body, a twenty-two-year-old named Kevin Bacon in his first film role. It’s 1980 and it’s Friday the 13th. Directed by Sean S. Cunningham, the film did not aim for social relevance. Made on the cheap for a little over half a million dollars, it earned 59 million at the box office, today about 250 million. The nasty little campfire story became a forty-year-old franchise with ten sequels, a reboot, and varied official and unofficial spin-offs across several media platforms, including PC and console games. In the 1980s, only the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise gave it much competition, leading inevitably to the cross-studio horror funfest of Freddy vs. Jason (2003). None of the sequels held the dark allure of the original. The 1980 premier treated anxious audiences to a believable beheading and a misshapen creature suddenly surfacing from a placid lake in a moment that squeezed several minutes of screams. In the days before CGI, pre–Jurassic Park entertainment, hundreds of thousands left the theater asking, “How did they do that?” Some had been so convinced by Bacon’s macabre death scene that rumors circulated the filmmakers “must have killed that person.”1 “I’m sitting here looking at pictures scattered all over my desk, looking at cut throats, and severed arms and people with bullet holes in them.” Tom Savini, the man who convinced some audiences that they’d witnessed an actual murder in Friday the 13th, described his workspace as looking like a crime scene. By the 1980s, with some apprehension, Savini wore the title “The King of Gore.” He preferred to think of himself as “a sorcerer who worked with illusions, sculptures, and mechanisms” to make horror come to life. He spent much of the 1970s earning this reputation before Friday the 13th took his effects mainstream.2 Eleven years before the surprise success of the low-budget film, Savini sat behind a bamboo barricade peering into the steaming Vietnamese night. In 1969, the man who would assault the senses of a generation was just a nervous kid. The heavy hot air and the smell of grease from his M60 machine gun mingled into an unpleasant aroma. The heat beaded his face with sweat. Savini had been assigned night watch for the camp perimeter against guerilla attacks from NLF insurgents.3 When, deep into the loud jungle night, a trip wire twanged a warning, he let loose with the thunderous roar of the M60, a weapon that spatters its heavy-caliber bullets at six hundred rounds a minute. All along the line, other crews with the heavy weapons opened up. Savini was required to contact headquarters before firing, but the tense anxiety of the night watch took over his reflexes. The powerful guns, and a grenade or two, devastated the dense tangle of tree and vine in front of their forward position. A duck had tripped the wire. And, in something of a metaphor for America’s invasion of Vietnam, the duck had somehow survived the punishing hail of gunfire and high explosives. “You didn’t even get the duck?” Savini’s commanding officer angrily wondered aloud. He did not get the duck and his lieutenant rotated him off guard duty. The next night, NLF soldiers overwhelmed the position, leaving Savini convinced that the lucky duck had saved his life. Savini wasn’t sure why he, or any other American, had been sent to Vietnam. He had enlisted because of the personal economic pressures of a new family and the likelihood he’d be drafted anyway. He primarily served as a combat photographer, taking pictures of ghastly images for after-action reports. He recalled that he viewed human bodies “blown nearly in half by a grenade blast,” unattached hands grasping the ground, and scattered body parts in the aftermath of a firefight. Savini writes that, “I felt a kind of safety behind my camera . . . Perhaps my mind was seeing it as special effects to protect me.” He spent much of the rest of his life behind the camera in one way or another. It may have given him a sense of safety, but the same cannot be said for his audience. Savini always displayed a thoughtfulness and sensitivity you would perhaps not expect from someone who began their career making convincing mock-ups of mutilated bodies. But almost half a century after the South Asian conflict, he remembered the impression the Vietnamese people made on him as heirs to a beautiful culture and country. He watched the wholesale destruction of the Vietnamese ecosystem and questioned the point of the war. Before leaving Vietnam, Savini saw American soda being sold in traditional villages to and by the American armed forces. Coca-Cola, that’s the reason his country sent him to South Asia, he later suggested. Savini’s anecdote may seem impressionistic to some. But he had witnessed a local phenomenon that symbolized a larger truth about America’s fight for capitalism in East Asia: they had brought it with them. So-called Ports a-Go-Go began arriving in South Vietnam in the early 1960s, prefabricated docks that, as early as late 1965, received nine million cans of soft drinks and beer.4 Savini would become the prince of special effects artists, rivaling Lon Chaney in his influence on the craft. Working with George A. Romero on Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Cunningham on Friday the 13th, he played an essential role in the new horror revolution of the eighties. In the years to come, as an actor and director as well as SFX maestro, Savini would bring his heavy splatter style to a series of movies very much out of step with the eerie optimism of the period. The uncertain, gory delights of late-twentieth-century horror offered the former combat photographer a way to not only deal with his demons but to bring them to life.5 Gradually, he became better known for the bizarre creatures he constructed. His monsters of hybridity affected audiences more deeply than the hyperreal productions of CGI, the creatures that look so unconvincing they appear encrusted on modern screens, like something you could scrape off if you had the right tool. Savini attributed his fascination with makeup effects to his experience in Vietnam, pointing out that his interest in SFX began during his working-class childhood in Pittsburgh. At the age of twelve, Savini went to his neighborhood theater, the Plaza, to see James Cagney portray Lon Chaney in Man of a Thousand Faces. He became obsessive about re-creating what he saw in 1950s horror comics, the photographs in Famous Monsters of Filmland, and any horror movie he could possibly watch. Then, like Ray Bradbury’s dark carnival rolling into town the year Halloween came early, “Dr. Silkini’s Asylum of Horrors” came to Pittsburgh in 1960. The once enormously popular show had been hobbled by changing tastes and time. But Savini loved it. He dressed as Dracula, and his convincing makeup led to his being invited on stage, adding to the magical monster show. He became a regular when Silkini came to town. A few years later, Savini fashioned his drill sergeant a realistic scar to frighten new recruits. He crafted fangs to entertain his buddies in Vietnam. While he makes it clear today that his interest in gore effects did not begin in Vietnam, he admits that his gruesome experiences there shaped the way he approached the making of a horror film. When creating an effect, his interest is always in terrifying realism. Beheaded corpses, skewered bodies, and cut throats must “give me that feeling I used to get when I’d see the real stuff.” When Savini watches a film, if the bloodletting and hideous creatures fail to evoke Vietnam, they simply don’t work. “It’s just not real enough for me,” he wrote. Too many scripts, he once off-handedly noted, feature the dead lying with closed eyes. Savini knew from the corpses he’d seen in Southeast Asia that the eyes of the dead are wide open, flash frozen in horror and surprise.6 The first Friday the 13th film appeared in an America far distant from the one Savini came home to in 1970. Many Americans lost interest in Vietnam as early as 1972, even as the Nixon administration continued to level North and South Vietnam with devastating bombing runs. This included the infamous Christmas Bombings of ’72, which incinerated large portions of Hanoi with twenty tons of explosives. But the American public tired of the war and its intractable issues. The crimes of the Nixon administration increasingly carved out space in print and televised media. The embattled president, obsessed with his alleged domestic enemies more than the obvious catastrophe of Vietnam, tried to spin the decades-long American failures in the region by insisting the United States finally achieved “peace with honor.” U.S. defeat in Vietnam became something of an unmentionable cultural secret. The idea of peace with honor clashed with what American TV audiences saw in April of 1975 as U.S. helicopters crashed, final CIA and army operatives fled unceremoniously from rooftops, and North Vietnamese troops and armored vehicles rolled into Saigon. Adding to the sense of a declining superpower, the 1970s became a decade of torpor, economic turmoil, free-floating anxiety, and even the possibility of apocalyptic catastrophe. By May 1, 1975, more Vietnam veterans committed suicide than died in the war itself. The images that haunted veterans became the images of what empire looks like on the ground, the horror it inflicts on its victims. Sergeant Lee Childress of the 206th Assault Helicopter Company remembered an elderly woman murdered by an American soldier because he believed she’d taken a stick of gum from him. “He shot her point-blank in the chest,” Childress recalled. “We got in more trouble for killing water buffalo than we did for killing people.” He told an interviewer he spent “every fucking day” asking “why? why?” He never found an answer, he admitted, and that left him with nothing but terror.7 Savini’s first special effects work after coming home became Deathdream (1974), also released under the titles Dead of Night and The Veteran. Director Bob Clark, who also made one of the ur-slashers, Black Christmas (1974), borrowed the primary conceit of the chilling W. W. Jacobs tale “The Monkey’s Paw” and presented an American soldier dying in Southeast Asia at the very moment his mother makes a portentous wish for his return. He does come back, but as a vampiric specter who can live only off blood. An especially macabre climax allowed Savini to put his talents, and his trauma, on full display. The tagline of the film? “Some boys never come home.” The darkness learned to follow even when the boys did come home. W. D. Ehrhart graduated high school in 1966 and immediately enlisted in the Marines. He did a tour of duty in Vietnam and fought in the bloody house-to-house fighting in the city of Hué in 1968. Following the war, he did with poetry what Savini had been able to do with make-up—cauterized his trauma while putting it on display before the American public. In the chilling poem “Making the Children Behave,” Ehrhart imagined how he and his comrades in arms left their shadowy memory in the villages of Vietnam, a tale of boogeymen now used to frighten bad children. “When they tell stories to their children / of the evil / that awaits misbehavior / is it me they conjure?” Some may have projected the horror on the experience of Vietnam itself, “a tragedy” often portrayed in popular media as a victimization of Americans. Veterans like Savini and Ehrhart imagined Americans themselves as the instigators of horror.8 Veterans returned to a country in turmoil. The center of a far-flung empire looked to have fallen into decay. The anti-war movement eventually brought together Americans of almost every background and staged the largest protests in the history of the country. In the United States, making money had always been the business of business. But by the end of the decade, a new kind of capitalism was born that continues to affect the work and paycheck of everyone reading this book. It became the foundation and the mechanics of the American empire, at home and abroad. Economic decline allowed business leaders to launch an assault on the American working class from which it never really recovered. Weary of providing benefits and livable wages to unionized workers, heads of large companies and their boards simply closed steel plants and automobile factories, and silenced the beating heart of American manufacturing from South Chicago to Youngstown.9 Gary, Indiana—once the home of U.S. Steel and a city where state and federal authorities deployed the military repeatedly throughout the twentieth century to successfully crush the labor movement—became an economic nightmare where unemployed steelworkers competed for jobs at fast food chains. Much of America in 1984 could be described as “medieval cities of rusting iron” with even the so-called Sun Belt losing textile mills at such a rapid rate that towns could be referred to “morgues” and sites of “rural malingering,” with oddly little comment that “malingering” might be the only option available to former workers. A 2010 study by MIT of 150 cities and towns described industrial powers houses like Buffalo, Cleveland, and Allentown as “dying cities.”10 If you found yourself in the Rust Belt or the Dirt Belt over the last several decades, the logic of the chain saw makes more sense than the promise of Amity Island. This perhaps explains why Tobe Hooper’s vision of the chain saw became one of the most remade, rebooted, and reimagined horror films of the last half century. These “rural malingerers” have been left behind, left out, and despised for their failure. The mad dance of Leatherface holds some appeal. As have the promises of a con artist who represents a parasitic class that destroyed entire social and cultural worlds with their mind-numbingly relentless financial monoculture. Yet, like a good horror film, he gives them an outlet to expend their rage and feel their fears. Millionaires became billionaires while cities died. Reaping massive profits from austerity measures that amounted to wage cuts and layoffs, corporate heads congratulated themselves on becoming “leaner” and showing “innovation and flexibility.” General Electric cut its total number of blue-collar employees by almost two hundred thousand in the early eighties. Rather than facing a backlash for what the newspeak called downsizing, CEO Jack Welch managed to become something of a folk hero who allegedly “saved the company” even though he enriched himself enormously without reinvesting in actual manufacturing. Auto exec Lee Iacocca wrote an enormous best-seller in which he became his own hagiographer. Iacocca also told a story of how he brought Chrysler from the precipice through hard work and allegedly rationalized free market principles. Some Republicans hoped he’d run for president. Few noticed that the salvation of a corporate entity created a crisis at the dinner table and the gas pump for workers whose wages stagnated while inflation exploded. Almost no one, certainly not Iacocca, noted that Chrysler’s salvation came from a government bailout.11 These changes in the economy opened the increasingly enormous economic gap in a country full of Gatsbys whose source of wealth remained mysterious and who did no labor in any meaningful sense. The maw between the nation’s richest and poorest had never grown wider than it did in the seventies and eighties, a trend that continues to worsen. Regions that built communities around manufacturing plants, support services for those factories, and neighborhoods where union membership had been at least as important as what house of worship you attended became haunted ruins. By 2020, Forbes magazine, not exactly an outlet of socialist propaganda, noted that 1 percent of the American population had fifteen times more wealth than the entire bottom 50 percent combined.12 So much of the country began to look like the set of a horror film. Perversely, many of these cities became the setting of horror films. East St. Louis provides an especially egregious example, a place of decline and social death that became part of America’s apocalyptic fears. Although the city struggled since the 1960s, white flight from the largely African American area drained the tax base. Freeways cut apart neighborhoods and community gathering spots. By the eighties and nineties, industries moved to the region only when offered massive subsidies and given allowance to operate as private jurisdictions, contributing nothing to the social safety net. The ravaged city became such a desolation that it earned the dubious honor of serving as the set for John Carpenter’s postapocalyptic film Escape from New York (1981). An associate producer recalled that, because the film was to be made cheaply, he and Carpenter had to go on a search for “the worst city in America.” East St. Louis, poisoned by decades of systemic racism, offered the “seedy run-down quality” of the bleak future of 1997 portrayed in the film.13 The uncertainties of the seventies, the sting of loss in Vietnam, and the cruelties inflicted on the American working class hid a very important fact. Wounded, the country healed like the mythic hydra, and not unlike that beast, its tentacles continued to encircle the globe. By 1975, the United States exhibited nearly full-spectrum dominance over much of the world’s capital, resources, and military supremacy. A vast network of American clients, military bases, and corporate power ensured that every human being on the planet, in one way or another, was forced to contend with the United States.14 This dominance in world affairs did nothing about the problems at home. In fact, the economic policy of empire benefited elites and not the nation-state as a whole. Steel workers and coal miners, not to mention fast food workers, do not benefit from the United States having a squeeze on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In fact, economic hegemony abroad whipsaws workers at home. In an especially reprehensible example, America’s global power allowed corporations to take the lash to some of the empire’s first victims. In 1965, Fairchild Semiconductor received government subsidies to open a plant on Navajo Nation land in New Mexico. Originally employing 1,200 Navajos, the plant laid them off after Bureau of Indian Affairs subsidies ended. The company replaced them with white workers. Protests in the early seventies by the American Indian Movement brought enough bad press to Fairchild that it simply closed the plant in 1975 and moved overseas.15 Americans who live in this ruined palace find themselves looking at the bloody face of American empire when they see their paychecks. The symptoms of a country that’s a behemoth abroad but an orphan at home are seen in a fifty-year trajectory of declining wages, growing rates of suicide, terrifying gun violence, and both white rural and Black urban communities torn apart by violence and drug abuse. Nightmares made flesh stalked our collective dream life. 2.Elm Street WES CRAVEN’S The Last House on the Left (1972) felt so real, and so contemporary, that audiences struggled to watch it. The Hills Have Eyes (1977) offered an excruciating journey of terror for a suburban family stranded in the desert and facing a family of violent cannibals, their misshapen forms created by American atomic testing. What monsters could the former professor of philosophy pull from the American psyche next? Walking to a meeting in downtown L.A. in 1982, Craven’s mind wandered as he ran through his agenda and pondered recent books he’d read about Indonesian “dream demons.” Kenin tindah, as it’s called in Indonesia, is the experience widely known as sleep paralysis that some attribute to supernatural forces. Dream demons on his mind, Craven also came across a bizarre story of dozens of cases of “arhythmic heart failure” among Hmong immigrants to the United States. The CIA recruited the Hmong leadership in Vietnam, who lent soldiers and regional support bases to the United States in exchange for help controlling the South Asian heroin trade. By the 1980s, many had come to the United States, fleeing persecution from Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge and the communist government of Laos. And, as Craven read in a 1987 story in the Los Angeles Times, many of their young people began to inexplicably die from heart failure, seemingly while trapped in a nightmare. The syndrome even received an acronym, SUNDS, or sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome.16 While he wondered how to transform this odd phenomenon into a new horror tale, a solid bump to Craven’s shoulder wrested him out of his dark reverie. He looked at the source of the collision and, as if in a close camera shot, discovered a terrifying face suddenly filling the frame. He seemed, in Craven’s memory, badly scarred, and the image of a burn victim came to mind. We don’t know the name or the background of the man who collided with Craven that day. The director remembered a filthy sweater and battered hat. But what he most recalled was a very quick glimpse of a disfigured face underneath the floppy fedora and the snarl on the man’s face at the suit in his way. The experience left Craven shaken, much more than it should have. In all likelihood, he only imagined the more lurid details of the chance encounter. Whatever the case, the incident became the final ingredient in the grisly cauldron that birthed Freddy Krueger. A Nightmare on Elm Street opened in 1984, less than a week after the nation elected Ronald Reagan to a second term. Fred Krueger, as he’s called through most of the first film, has returned from the grave after the parents of Elm Street lynched and burned him alive, believing him “a filthy child murderer.” In his grungy afterlife, Krueger can enter the dreams of the children of Elm Street. He tortures his prey in the bleakest regions of sleep before ripping them apart in flumes of blood and gore. In Nightmare, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) became one of the templates of the final girl, joining Laurie Strode from Halloween in the growing pantheon of young women who, unlike their friends or their parents, summoned the bravery and bearing to fight a monster. Teenagers being stalked by a murderer certainly offered nothing new. Even the idea of suburban America transforming into a slaughterhouse rather than the destination of whites in flight was previously explored by John Carpenter’s Halloween. But something even stranger happened on the Elm Street of the American mind. The sheer savagery of Krueger, combined with his supernatural origins, set him apart from the slasher films that came before. Tobe Hooper’s postindustrial serial killers deep in the heart of Texas are probably much more frightening. But a decade later, it was Fred Krueger’s origin story and its implications that raised a chill on America’s collective spine. The first film suggests the ambiguity we expect in a post-Watergate world. Are we supposed to trust the story of Nancy’s mother, one of the parents who burned the human Freddy alive? She’s a decidedly low-functioning alcoholic and the living avatar of an unreliable narrator. It’s from her we learn Krueger was a “filthy child murderer.” Nancy’s father (played by John Saxon) is a corrupt police officer who also wants to hide the truth of what happened. The other parents of Elm Street join the conspiracy. They keep the secret from their children, the secret of how they made a monster. The story of Krueger proved popular enough to make the character an icon. Six sequels followed Craven’s original film, the only one he directed, or had very much engagement with at all. Departing from the formula of the first film, Fred Krueger soon became “Freddy,” famous for the corny one-liners delivered as he dispatched his victims, most of them the epitome of excruciating dad jokes if dad guffawed while he ripped open your intestines with razor-sharp knives attached to his scarred fingers. Why did such an unpleasant creature become one of the eighties’ most recognizable images? There’s a sense in which the horror Craven spliced together from moral panic and poverty and a strange footnote to the Vietnam War didn’t fit the eighties. Perhaps the answer is in the inferior sequels. Their churlish use of violence and victims, turning them into little more than props for Freddy to slice and dice, fit into a decade remembered as much for its cruelty as for Thriller and John Hughes comedies. The callous attitude of the sequels pervaded America’s Elm Streets throughout the decade. Some middle-class Americans held on to and even improved their status from the Reagan to the Bush to the Clinton years. By the 1990s, ignoring restrictions and regulations placed on the stock market during the Great Depression, millions of small investors became miniature Michael Milkens, making tens of thousands while buyouts, the leveraging of credit, austerity measures, and the strip-mining of corporate assets by CEOs shoveled tens of billions into the coffers of a tiny class of Americans. Meanwhile, homelessness exploded. The drop in real wages and the physical destruction of low-income housing accounted for some of those who appeared on sidewalks and under bridges and in private shelters. A peculiar alliance between civil liberty advocates and conservative budget hawks closed institutions and tossed Americans suffering from drug addiction, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and even severe schizophrenia onto the streets. African American men, abandoned in their illness and completely indigent, made up a significant portion of this population. Vietnam veterans accounted for about 10 percent of the homeless population in the 1980s.17 Attitudes toward the homeless and the working poor (often the same population) made Freddy’s woeful appearance a portent and a cause for panic. Notably, many of the monsters who stalked the slasher films of the eighties are portrayed not as handsome well-dressed Ted Bundys, but as workers eager to see your insides. Michael Myers, an escaped mental patient, wore the one-piece overalls of a car mechanic as he wielded his butcher knife. Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th series, dresses in the sequels like a cross between a dirt farmer and bricklayer. This proletariat of monstrosity appears in the tendency of white America to project monstrosity onto its fellow citizens. Ronald Reagan spoke of “welfare queens” taking advantage of the system, parasites that fed off the blood of hard-working Americans. Other conservative writers went further in their use of monstrous imagery, finding language that portrayed the working class and people of color as unnatural terrors. James Q. Wilson called the young urban poor “feral” and “presocial beings.”18 In the same year Craven unleashed his nightmare on America’s Elm Street, the film C.H.U.D. made the subtext of Freddy Krueger the glaringly obvious point. The title, standing for cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers, imagined the homeless population of New York City turned into hideous Lovecraftian horrors that emerged from the sewers to feed on the flesh of luckier Americans. The tagline for the film resounded with Americans nervous about how the country’s class consensus might not survive the growing gap in wealth, even with the increased policing of the urban working class. “They’re not staying down there, anymore!” the film’s posters warned. Crime statistics frightened many Americans in the seventies as the tectonic shifts in the economy caused theft and the violence associated with underground drug economies to flourish. However, despite the general impression most middle-class Americans shared in the eighties and nineties, crime against property in America declined rapidly. It became increasingly unlikely that you’d die at the hands of a stranger made “feral” by “the inner city.” However, between 1980 and 2008, families, friends, and acquaintances murdered one another with prolific enthusiasm, accounting for far more death than “gang-related” murders. During this period, nearly 80 percent of murder victims knew their killer and almost 42 percent of female homicides came at the hands of a romantic partner.19 The Republican right didn’t birth these monsters of the American mind alone. “New Democrats” found an effective issue in portraying themselves as crimefighters who gave police unions anything they asked for, built prisons at an alarming rate to warehouse an enormous portion of the population, and passed federal laws that resulted in brutally lengthy internments for, primarily, African American men. Not unlike in the early twentieth century, white supremacy at home provided a foundation for empire abroad. In the 1980s, the nation continued its fascination with slasher films, fearful of the serial murderer who surely lived on their version of Elm Street. They’d moved to the suburbs hoping to escape the “Black youths” that academics and a racist legal system convinced them terrorized urban centers. The costs of empire on the home front are substantial. The CIA’s inveterate willingness to partner with drug lords made the “war on drugs” an assault on African American communities. Defense spending cannibalized the American GDP and threw the social safety net on the bonfire. While fearful of violence at home, middle-class Americans proved generally willing to acquiesce to the Reagan administration’s policy of strategic homicidal outbursts abroad. Elm Street’s nightmares engulfed the world. 3.Waiting for the Antichrist “‘FROM THE eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother till man exists no more.’ The book of Revelation predicted it all.” So goes a well-known quote from the film The Omen (1976). Many viewers then and now think it is a quote from the Bible. They’d been prepped for the horrors of a satanic apocalypse by an unlikely source. Hal Lindsey appeared to have been grown in the incubation pod that produced every young white male of the sixties and seventies. Foregoing coats and ties and speaking with an easy Southern California accent that rolled words around like they came in and out with the tide, he favored sunglasses, hair just below the collar, and a grandiose moustache. His lean, youthful face always seemed on the verge of telling you to take it easy. His work carried a rather different message. “Imagine, cities like London, Paris, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago—obliterated!” Making free with exclamation marks and proclaiming catastrophe in an “oh holy wow, geez!” style, Lindsey’s 1970 The Late Great Planet Earth told a bleak tale of the coming rise of the Antichrist, explained that the book of Revelation foretold a Soviet invasion of Israel, and predicted “Red China” mobilizing against much of the rest of the world. The Antichrist would arrive on the world scene after Satan staged a mockery of Christ’s resurrection. The ideas in The Late Great Planet Earth seemed new and exciting, a bit like new religious movements such as the Unification Church or “the Jesus People.” In this it resembled another mass paperback best-seller of the era, Erich von Däniken’s Chariots of the Gods? Däniken created an imagined deep past in which, with nothing resembling evidence, he claimed aliens once visited the earth and directed human beings on the path toward civilization, building pyramids and perhaps even giving us a bit of extraterrestrial DNA to ease along our evolutionary climb. Lindsey also created a fantasy, this one about a human future fading into the horizon of otherworldly events. Gods and demons would fight their wars over us rather than give us aid, and the result would be a mass extinction event rather than human progress. Readers who combined a general openness to unsubstantiated claims and felt helpless to understand the tumultuous twentieth century formed a large majority of both Lindsey’s and Däniken’s readership. The short, simply written paperbacks suited the boomers who came of age during the Vietnam years. The need to find your own path, even if that path led to doomsday, combined with a tincture of very real intellectual curiosity circulated ideas meant to, as the slang of the era put it, blow your mind. Unfortunately, critical thinking has not always been a partner in the business of blowing minds. Aliens bearing gifts to ancient civilizations and the Antichrist showing up to end the show became a single mishmash of contradictory conceptions of the world. We should remember the sixties generation as working with SNCC or joining the Black Panthers, Students for a Democratic Society, or the National Organization for Women. We’d do an injustice to them if we ignored the very real changes in law and society their protests and their struggles manifested. But it’s also true that much of this generation watched through Jimi Hendrix’s purple haze while the great American protest movements marched by. Tobe Hooper caught the mood of the boomers in Poltergeist (1982), in a scene in which the family patriarch lies across the bed to smoke a joint and, counterintuitively, picks up where he left off in Ronald Reagan’s campaign biography. The big chill, indeed. Nixon used the term silent majority to suggest a sleeping giant of American conservativism who watched anti-war protests and the Black freedom struggle with disdain. He may have been on to something when he noted that young people who wanted radical social transformation represented a minority, even within the so-called counterculture. Proponents of “do your own thing” often actually meant it. One’s own thing might include political activism but could also mean falling headfirst into LSD rabbit holes, free ranging as an Ayn Randian, or joining “the Jesus People” and becoming the constituency for the modern “casual worship” megachurches. As Kurt Anderson pointed out in his book Fantasyland, “if it feels good, do it” can be a liberatory cry from sexual and emotional repression while at the same time mean that paying yourself four hundred times what you pay your employees is just finding your own truth. Anderson concludes, looking from our contemporary vantage, that the ethos of believing and doing anything you wish “powered the political right more than the political left.”20 In their uncertainty and political immaturity, the baby boomers became seekers who didn’t know where to look, examples of how many of those who wander are actually just really lost. Growing up in the prosperous sixties afforded them the chance to dally with all manner of nonsense. Luckily for American institutions, many of them followed Stokely Carmichael, Fred Hampton, Susan Faludi, Bella Abzug, and Tom Hayden into revolutionary movements for meaningful change. But entering adulthood, the world became more confusing. Aliens built the pyramids and the great monoliths of Easter Island? Maybe. The Bible as a way to interpret the news? Why not. The notions Lindsey’s ideas of Biblical prophecy proffered didn’t originate with him; these underground ideas have been around since the nineteenth century. Renegade religious thinkers in England and the United States first imagined the Bible predicting a series of catastrophic events culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The tree they planted would grow tangled, its offshoots as disparate as American fundamentalism, the Pentecostals, and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. These groups held few beliefs in common—in fact, they tended to see one another as heretical—but they all believed fervently that the world would end, that it would end in a very specific way, and that you could read the signs of the end in your daily newspaper. American fundamentalism exerted significant influence in the South and Midwest for most of the twentieth century. Adherents tended to be rural and lack formal education, marginalized even in moments of American prosperity. Their low-wage labor made capitalism in America work as they fed the nation from their farms, toiled in twelve-hour shifts in Southern textile mills, and worked the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma to slake the petro-thirst of the white-collar class and the American war machine. Some of their leaders rose to prominence as ministers of large Sun Belt churches or seminary professors. But for the most part they lived under the nation’s cultural radar and played much the same role in politics. Why vote when the end was nigh? Major social and cultural changes brought this group to the suburbs in a story beyond the bounds of the one being told here. But Lindsey’s influence on American politics and popular culture gave the most exotic elements of the group’s belief system a fecund pile of theological compost where it could bud and flourish. He succeeded with several gambits that fit the times like a leisure suit. Lindsey had the notion, at once brilliant in execution and sophomoric in intent, of phrasing the rather complicated prophetic schema of fundamentalism in So Cal English. His seeming hatred for language benefitted from the commercially useful side effect of dumbing down complex eschatological notions for the sinners dancing through the decade’s disco inferno. He told them they could find biblical prophecy in the daily paper while searching for a soulmate who loved piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Lindsey casually took his audience by the hand with breezy anecdotes about how sitting out in the warm California evening while tiki torches cast a pleasant glow on the lemon trees and wondering when the dinner party would start was a lot like the desire “from the beginning of time . . . to know what is going to happen in the future.” He promised the return of Christ would be “the ultimate trip.” The use of supernatural power by the Antichrist would allow this incarnation of the devil to become “the Big Cheese” in world affairs.21 Horror films already prepped Americans for the Antichrist, even though they didn’t mean to do it. In 1968, Roman Polanski directed Rosemary’s Baby, a terrifying spoof of a horror film, a self-aware horror film long before Scream. The Satanists who offer a very young Mia Farrow as the devil’s bride are intentionally hilarious. There’s not a black robe in sight among the hokey, upper-middle-class elderly who keep Jokes for the John on a chain in their bathroom. But they are also eager to launch a satanic millennium. In the parody of drive-in Satanism Americans experienced in B-grade features over the last decade, Polanski followed a similar formula to the arty burlesque of The Fearless Vampire Killers of the year before. But the film disturbed many viewers with its mention of abortion and the claustrophobia of Rosemary’s confinement by her controlling husband and his half-baked devil-worshipping friends. Although known for his own poisonous attitudes toward women—a rage fully on display in his violent rape of a thirteen-year-old, which led him to flee the country—Polanski unwittingly made a bleak feminist parable. By 1968, Polanski already displayed an unhealthy interest in the isolation, really the imprisonment, of women by their own “hysteria” in Repulsion (1965). Turning to adapt a novel, he wrote a script that follows Ira Levin’s book very precisely and forced a different meaning to emerge from Rosemary’s Baby. The coven of Upper West Side devil worshippers exercises a paternalist supervision of Rosemary through her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes). The film ends in the brutal breaking of Rosemary, her acquiescence to the value of motherhood even if her offspring does happen to have hooves for feet. It’s a diabolical version of the “feminine mystique” described by Betty Friedan in her 1963 best-seller of the same name. Friedan described the way prosperous white culture in the years after World War II exalted pregnancy and motherhood until “there is no other way [a woman] can even dream about herself.”22 Inaccurately, Rosemary’s Baby would later be noted, or perhaps blamed, for a flood tide of interest in all things occult. The roots of such fascination are deeper and even more peculiar. The alleged “rise of Satanism” owed much to religious conservatives like Lindsey, who believed, as one of his book titles insisted, that Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth. As Lindsey continued to fascinate the world and build a highly profitable media empire that included more books, television, radio, and even comic book adaptations of his apocalyptic imaginings, he increasingly suggested that the end of the world looked a lot like the fears of white, middle-class Americans. “Biblical prophecy,” it turns out, held a special place in its millennialist heart for the American empire. Lindsey’s story of the signs of the end looked a great deal like America’s Cold War–era concerns, giving a vigorous handshake to the far right’s most paranoid fantasies. He writes of visiting an unnamed “large university” near his home and speaks with horror of seeing students distributing literature about the treatment of Palestinians under the Israeli occupation. Lindsey warned grimly that this showed “communist” influence on “‘wars of liberation’ in countries around the world.” What if, he suggested to readers, we see an alliance of “several black African nations” with “the Arabs”? What indeed. Lindsey doesn’t bother to explain, but we know from the rest of his best-selling tract that readers are meant to assume it has something to do with the Antichrist, Satan, and the end of the world.23 Millennial movements have flourished throughout much of Christianity’s history. In most cases, belief in the apocalypse pushed true believers to shed worldly concerns. Around the year 1000, the turn of the millennium convinced many of the devout in western Europe that the end had come. They sold their earthly goods and waited with hope and trepidation for the Kingdom of God. Radical sects during the upheavals of the Protestant Reformation held property together in common, foreswore allegiance to princes and kings, and dissolved marriage ties in anticipation of the end. Even in twentieth-century America, millennial groups sometimes followed the logic of their convictions. The Jehovah’s Witnesses saw World War I as the beginning of judgment on all the nations, including the United States. For this opinion, the group’s leadership cadre faced a prison term of twenty years under the 1917 Espionage Act. In the late twentieth century, the infectious idea of apocalypse created the opposite effect. Americans should, according to Lindsey, continue to worry about the future of capitalism. In the 1970s, Sino-Soviet relations may have been at a low ebb, but Lindsey warned his readers that the goal of both was “total world conquest” that would mean “the total destruction of the capitalist system.” Echoing what would become an American mantra about defeat in Vietnam, Lindsey spread the false claim that the United States fielded a powerful military that “politicians” did not allow it to use. Meanwhile, as if reading from the script of one of the Fu Manchu films, Lindsey told his readers that the battle of Armageddon would come when an “incredible Oriental army of 200 million” tried to destroy Israel.24 America’s geopolitical foes are the bad guys even in the apocalypse. America’s unqualified support for the state of Israel grew out of this period. The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 meant the fulfillment of biblical prophecy for evangelicals. Meanwhile, Israel provided a U.S. foothold in the world’s leading oil-producing region after the Six-Day War and a brief chilliness in its relationship to Saudi Arabia. The end of the world did not mean the end of the empire, and, in fact, Lindsey and his cohort again and again insisted on “America’s special place in biblical prophecy.” Rosemary’s Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen sent screaming demons into theaters all over the United States. The years the devil stalked moviegoers are the very years Lindsey, and soon boatloads of imitators, hawked a similarly terrifying and titillating tale. It told of apocalypse and the coming of the Antichrist, visions of dark prophecy first born in the deserts of the ancient Near East, repackaged to explain how the United States—hell, even its economic system and global military reach—sat at the center of God’s plan for the universe. The growing evangelical movement attached itself to this strange notion that the end was nigh. Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority emerged in the late seventies, a grassroots group of evangelical, and a few Catholic and Jewish, clergy and their congregants who became one of the more effective lobby groups in American politics. Falwell’s message that the 1960s represented a sinkhole of moral depravity grew in part out of his own repudiation of the civil rights movement. He had preached vehemently against the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, called Martin Luther King Jr. a communist, and founded Lynchburg Christian Academy as one of the South’s many “seg academies,” private schools launched in the midst of the integration of public schools in order to preserve “whites only” education.25 Nixon was wrong about a silent majority, but Falwell did tap into the fears of a silent and numerically impressive minority. For them, the rise of second-wave feminism, a stereotyped conception of hippies and young people smoking pot, the gains of the civil rights movement, American defeat in Vietnam, and the very real decline in wages and subsequent economic stagnation all became muddled in their minds as one phenomenon. Falwell gave them a simple explanation, an Appalachian version of Hal Lindsey, telling them the Bible had something to say about all the things that bothered them in the newspaper. Rural evangelicals may have believed the world was not their home and stayed away from the voting booths. Falwell’s Moral Majority brought them out to vote for Ronald Reagan in the hundreds of thousands, contributing to his unprecedented landslide over Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election. Falwell’s message to evangelicals brought together a pied-colored set of ideas that seemed to have little consistency. Christian morality, he believed, called for women to take a subordinate role in marriage and society and for taxes to remain low. The United States had, he claimed, drifted away from God, but this heathen nation also needed to increase its defense spending exponentially. Prayers should begin every day of public school, and America should flex its military might in the Middle East. Conflicting, contradictory, and counterintuitive ideas didn’t matter. The religious right’s worldview fit with Reagan’s message of traditional virtues and America the omnipotent. The backlash against the progressive gains of the 1960s has never really left American politics. The idea of America in decline remained part of the Moral Majority’s message, even as the colossal power of the country touched nearly every corner of the globe. While Americans watched truck commercials from Reagan ally Lee Iacocca that asserted “the pride is back,” evidence mounted that the new president would make sure America’s client states and rivals alike knew that the United States would put boots on the ground and bombers in the air. Reagan wondered aloud in a phone call with an Israeli lobbyist if the end of the world approached and if “the signs foretelling Armageddon” might be true. He certainly wanted to make sure the United States came out on top of any apocalyptic struggle.26 4.Serpents and Rainbows GEORGE H. W. BUSH had, before becoming vice president, called Reagan’s notion of free market adventurism “voodoo economics.” He found the term ready at hand with so much talk of voodoo in the air in the 1980s, so much that it rivaled the American thirties and forties. In American theaters of the eighties, fear of Caribbean dark magic made it seem like the midcentury zombie made an unfortunate comeback. Major films like The Believers, starring Martin Sheen, portrayed Cuban Santeria as a dangerous death cult flourishing in Florida, not unrelated to the American panic of “satanic covens” out to sacrifice everything from your house cat to your kid. An interest in the often frighteningly exploitative cannibal genre shared this imperial view of primitive peoples up to no good. Italian films like Cannibal Holocaust (1980) and Cannibal Ferox (1981) found an audience with the VHS generation. These unwatchable films not only showed buckets of fake gore and some very nasty, and very real, animal cruelty. They also assumed a vile racism that suggested to American viewers that Latin America was lousy with cannibals. Haiti remained a special American obsession. In Angel Heart (1987), Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet dance with the devil in the form of Robert De Niro, who uses New Orleans voodoo to entrap souls. Angel Heart pulled out all the stops in using stereotypes of Haitian voodoo, tying it to depraved sexuality, murder, and a general sensibility of “primitivism” not too dissimilar from what Americans once watched in White Zombie or King of the Zombies. The Wes Craven–directed The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) is a film set in Haiti and loosely, very loosely, based on a popular book by ethnobotanist Wade Davis. The story centers around Bill Pullman, portraying an extremely handsome anthropologist action hero, investigating the possibility of creating a “super anesthetic” from the concoction of powders he believes accounts for the phenomenon of Haitian zombies. Pullman’s character, Alan, arrives in Haiti in the waning days of the regime of “Baby Doc” Duvalier, the dictator of Haiti in the 1980s, long propped up by the United States, as was his father, known as Papa Doc. The Duvaliers ruled Haiti since 1957 and received significant American support. The U.S. Marines trained the Duvalier family’s terrifying Tonton Macoute in 1959. An organization somewhere between a secret police and paramilitary force, utterly loyal to the Duvalier family, they took their name from a frightening Haitian fairy-tale monster that carries off unruly children to cannibalize them in the night. Duvalier’s private army lived up to their name, disappearing political opponents and their supporters in the small hours. Under their vicious commander Luckner Cambronne, who earned the nickname “Vampire of the Caribbean” for his cruelty, they engaged in systemic violence against the Haitian people, murdering as many as sixty thousand Haitians during the Duvaliers’ twenty-nine-year reign. We do not have adequate statistics of the mass rapes or random assaults, mayhem, and murders that made the Macoute deeply feared.27 Papa Doc was followed by his son “Baby Doc” Duvalier, who ruled with the same mixture of fringe Vodun beliefs and political terror, along with an even closer relationship to the United States. Both father and son had, at different times, offered some symbolic statements of independence from the United States and even an attenuated Black nationalism. This posturing hid their role in the American plan to encircle Cuba both economically and geographically. Craven certainly had a great deal to work with in terms of real-world political suppression mixed with the hint of supernatural evil. Vodun had long been an important spiritual tradition in Haiti. But like most spiritual traditions, it can be used as a weapon. The Duvalier dictatorship did just that, encouraging the people to see themselves and the Macoute as Vodun masters (bokor) who would work wicked conjure on anyone who defied the regime. Davis suggested that Duvalier had managed to bring the regional heads of Vodun societies under his sway (bizango) and created what he called “a shadow government” that kept the people frightened and obedient.28 Critics noticed the film’s political subtext. The February 5, 1988, review in The New York Times described the film’s plot as dependent on the crimes of the Duvalier regime and the reputation of “the dreaded Tontons Macoute security force.” The review also offered the important insight that the politics of the film likely felt “confusing” to viewers. The Serpent and the Rainbow is a very different film from White Zombie or other B-grade fare from the earlier decades that offered simple messages of white supremacy. Haitian characters are given personal agency. A Haitian doctor, Marielle Duchamp, assists Pullman’s Harvard botanist in the struggle against the Tonton Macoute leader Peytraud, revealed to be a bokor (literally a wizard who will “work with both hands,” performing good and evil for money) who tortures his own people and, of course, turns them into zombies. Peytraud offered audiences a serious and convincing villain, unlike the many earlier European zombie masters. He’s balanced by Celine, a houngan priest of Vodun who represents the positive aspects of the religious tradition. Although Craven’s liberal impulses are certainly on display, The Serpent and the Rainbow ultimately acts to justify the American empire. Pullman’s Dr. Alan remains the hero throughout and he, not the Haitian houngan, defeats Peytraud at the end and rescues Dr. Duchamp as well. In another poorly considered plot point, Duchamp becomes Alan’s sidekick and lover. This is highly fraught in a context where colonization had always meant sexual exploitation by white men, from the days of enslaved people in the sugarcane fields through the country’s history of invasion and occupation by first French forces in the early nineteenth century and then multiple U.S. interventions in the twentieth. The final scene in The Serpent and the Rainbow shows us a celebration in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, as the people gleefully take their vengeance on the Tonton Macoute. This revolt against Duvalier’s regime did occur in 1986, much to the consternation of the Reagan administration, who had so valued Duvalier’s anti-Cuban, anti-communist stance that it used the American taxpayers’ money to fund his two-million-dollar wedding. The real cost of U.S. support for the Duvaliers had been paid by the Haitian people. Along with backing the Duvaliers’ use of terror, the U.S. agricultural department had called for the killing of the country’s entire pig population after an outbreak of swine flu. Duvalier acquiesced, and Haitian peasants, the majority of the country, saw their tiny incomes evaporate. By 1983, an organized challenge to Duvalier’s regime emerged and a full-fledged uprising occurred in January of 1986. The CIA provided Duvalier with a plan to escape to France with his family, where he went into an early retirement with a fortune of as much as eight hundred million dollars U.S.29 In the climactic celebration of The Serpent and Rainbow, Dr. Duchamp turns to Pullman’s white savior and in the last line of the film says, “the nightmare is over!” The man who had given us an ongoing nightmare on America’s Elm Street perhaps couldn’t be trusted as the most reliable forecaster for the shadowy climate of dream and nightmare. For Haiti, and much of the Caribbean, the American imperial nightmare continued. Lesser, and more explicitly racist, imitators followed. Voodoo Dolls (1991) could have been made in the 1950s, its Black male villain wearing bones around his neck and proving his perfidy by lusting after a white woman. The 1984 Zombie Island Massacre kills its zombie in the first fifteen minutes and largely exists to indulge the decade’s fascination with gratuitous female nudity. Yet, it still made it clear to audiences that the “exotic islands” (maybe the Caribbean, maybe the Pacific) are filled with dangerous native magic threatening to white people. Audiences may have devoured these films and their racist implications right along with their popcorn, not giving much thought to either. But reviewers took notice. The renowned critic Roger Ebert began his 1987 review of The Believers by saying “Here’s another one of those movies where a Caribbean voodoo cult wants to practice a blood sacrifice . . . Can’t they think of anything new to make a movie about?” Ebert went on to confess his own ignorance of the Caribbean religion, and notably he does use the generic American slang voodoo to talk about Cuban Santeria. But he reminded his readers that usually when Hollywood dealt with religion it told a story of “peace and love and friendship.” But this new raft of films “are always about guys with blank eyes who stare at you for 10 seconds and you’re volunteering to wring the chickens’ necks yourself.”30 The return of this subgenre of horror, the Caribbean zombi suddenly as popular as George A. Romero’s apocalyptic hordes, didn’t reflect on American politics. It represented a new funhouse mirror of the dark carnival that legitimized and justified racism at home while weaponizing American power abroad. It distracted from the zombie republics the United States continued to create abroad with the necromancy of corporate and military power. Moreover, the films constructed an ugly fantasy about dangers to the empire’s heartland. The United States, often celebrating itself as a “nation of immigrants,” has also been the nation of anti-immigrant sentiment. Along with the bleak irony of racism toward the forced immigrants of West Africa, distaste for the Chinese people (and Asians more generally) became a feature of nineteenth- and twentieth-century life. Racism directed at Mexican and other Latinx peoples oozed into public life even in parts of the West where Mexicans became “immigrants” only after the United States seized half their nation in the late 1840s and thousands found themselves on the wrong side of their own border. A new round of nativism emerged, particularly focused on Haitians and other Caribbean immigrants. During the 1970s, tens of thousands of Haitians, fleeing the Duvalier regime, arrived in all manner of rickety vessels in an effort to enter the United States. The Coast Guard returned many. Others allowed to enter spent months in detention centers with barbed wire fences, a practice ruled illegal by a federal court in 1982. The year 1980 became the high-water mark of attempted Haitian immigration with about fifteen thousand Haitians entering the country. Detained and not told of their right to request political asylum, they faced racial prejudice and the false belief that the new immigrants bore responsibility for the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The Reagan administration further undercut efforts by immigrants fleeing a catastrophe the United States helped to create by refusing to admit that political repression occurred in Haiti. Indeed, records of discussions in the Reagan White House reveal administration officials taking a hard line against Haitian immigrants, and Caribbean immigrants in general, referring to them in a 1981 memo as “undesirables.”31 American prejudices against immigrants found another focus in the Mariel boatlift (April to October 1980). Slightly improved relations between Cuba and the United States had led Fidel Castro to decree that any Cuban who had a U.S. contact could leave from Mariel Harbor. More than fifteen thousand did so in a few weeks, overwhelming U.S. immigration services. The Cuban government certainly benefitted from this, getting rid of political dissidents, and simultaneously handing the U.S. government an influx of tens of thousands of new immigrants in a short period. Carter used the Coast Guard to blockade the island, but Castro’s goals had been achieved. There’s no doubt that he decided on a “love it or leave it” attitude toward the migrants and found it an effective way to poke at the United States, whose intelligence operatives attempted to assassinate him at least sixteen times between 1962 and 2014.32 The Mariel boatlift, and the ongoing story of the “Haitian boat people,” seemed a new danger to many white Americans. Latin America remained nightmare country in the white supremacist imagination, only palatable when firmly under American imperial control. Puerto Rico continued to be a colony of the United States, and successive Democratic and Republican administrations denied it representation of any kind, including electoral votes. Unlike Hawaii and Alaska, it did not have a white majority. Hollywood responded with all manner of racist caricatures of everything south of Texas and Florida. Angel Heart featured tough-talking detectives referring to Haitians as being “into voodoo and all that shit.” Films like the enormously popular Scarface (1983) may have glamorized Al Pacino’s Tony Montana as the ultimate OG for some. Mainstream audiences read it as a manic coming-to-America story that portrayed Cuban immigrants as vicious, violent criminals. The far right continues to make use of the myth of Castro emptying out prisons and mental institutions, and even sending spies, into the United States. As he began to eye a political career in 2011, Donald Trump repeated the baseless claim and compared it to immigration from Mexico. In the Trump administration, it became a talking point for Stephen Miller, Trump’s speechwriter and advisor who has ties to various white supremacist organizations and leaders.33 5.Ain’t Got Time to Bleed WHITE AMERICANS, agitated by the movies, now worried their island neighbors were zombie-raising witch doctors with a penchant for communism. So they tended to support their government as it flexed its muscles in the Caribbean and Latin America. The 1983 invasion of Grenada received condemnation from around the world even as it elicited cheers at home. Although seven thousand American troops landed on the island, they faced more of a struggle than expected from the tiny number of Cuban soldiers and construction workers. Nineteen American service members died and more than one hundred were wounded in a protracted firefight, some from friendly fire and operational accidents. Cuban resistance brought down nine U.S. helicopters. Despite this deadly misadventure, the military handed out no less than 8,612 medals for the operation.34 “Our days of weakness are over,” Reagan announced in the debacle’s aftermath, “our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall.” This assertion aside, Reagan’s renowned rhetorical powers failed him. At first, he insisted the assault had been “a rescue” rather than “an invasion,” an attempt to get out American medical students who, it turned out, did not want to leave. Reagan tried to shift the story by claiming the island had been on the brink of becoming “a Soviet-Cuban base” that would “export terrorism.” In this version, Reagan could assure Americans they arrived “just in time.”35 Horror films at this time played out such fantasies in a fashion not dissimilar from the horror science fiction of the fifties, featuring Americans tangling with evil forces amid steaming jungles in exotic, nameless lands. The best, or perhaps the worst, example is the film Predator (1987). Arnold Schwarzenegger played a covert ops specialist everyone simply calls Dutch (Ronald Reagan’s nickname in the real world) while Carl Weathers portrayed CIA agent Dillon, who co-opts Dutch’s outfit for a rescue mission “across the border” in an unfriendly, unnamed Latin American nation. (The context and the year essentially tell us covert operations are based in Honduras and entering Nicaragua.) The first forty-five minutes of Predator offers a right-wing black ops fantasy about a dirty war. Dutch and Dillon lead their small band into the jungle and assault a camp of guerillas, slaughtering them with relative ease. Dillon discovers “secret documents” that explain that “Soviet advisors” are on the way. “We got here just in time,” he says, echoing Reagan’s claims after the invasion of Grenada. The film makes numerous visual and direct references to Vietnam. Both Dutch and Dillon are veterans, and Dillon tells the brawny character Blain (played by wrestler and later governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura) that the two had fought together in Vietnam, specifically the costly Battle of Hue. Not only is Blain unimpressed, he spits on Dillon’s boot. It’s an incredibly peculiar moment given the long-lived myth that Vietnam veterans returned to be “spit on by hippies.” In Predator, the black ops soldiers of America’s dirty wars are the ones who spit on Vietnam veterans. Making the scene even stranger, we learn that Ventura’s character had been in Cambodia and up to no good in the 1970s, fighting a secret war with the CIA while the draftees lost in Vietnam. Like most action films in the eighties, Predator burns testosterone like jet fuel with lots of cigar chomping, dramatic hundred-yard stares, and Ventura delivering lines like “I ain’t got time to bleed.” In fact, he finds plenty of time to bleed when the film’s titular monster appears and rips most of his internal organs out of his body. The Predator, which a short scene reveals to be an extraterrestrial, can camouflage himself with invisibility and packs an array of frightening weaponry. It’s the compendium of American fears in Vietnam and other imperial adventures that dates to the wars against First Nations peoples. There’s an enemy striking from the shadows with unrestrained ferocity, and who knows what weapons they might be able to use against us? The film’s setting in an indeterminate jungle places it alongside Bride of the Gorilla and King of the Zombies as films that imagined Americans fighting the good fight against overwhelming odds in frightening and geographically amorphous jungles. Predator received much bigger box office numbers than those films, however, becoming number one in June of ’87 and raking in many times its budget while spawning a franchise of sequels, comics, and video games, one of the latter appearing as recently as 2020. Film critic Dean Lamanna dismissed Predator in Cinefantastique as a “militarized monster movie.” But clearly the America public responded to this fantasy of American foreign policy. Sure, the nightly news might be trying to tell us about U.S.-funded death squads in Central America or the incompetent invasion of a tiny island for reasons even Reagan struggled to explain. But this popcorn flick showed Dutch standing toe to toe with the alien menace in the film’s silly climax and winning. The eighties and nineties represent a continuation of the country’s long belief, stretching back to the Monroe Doctrine (1823), that Latin America belonged in its sphere of influence. The Reagan years became an active convalescence period in which public opinion sought therapy for “the Vietnam syndrome,” a phrase Reagan used to describe an alleged weakness of nerve in American foreign policy after 1975. In a bleak irony, psychiatrists originally used the phrase to describe the snake’s nest of symptoms Vietnam veterans experienced, symptoms defined as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980. The dirty wars of Latin America offered a new jungle to refight Vietnam. Meanwhile, American culture would also find itself in a dirty war at home, its collateral damage igniting similar horrors in American allies and client states. 6.God Is Dead! Satan Lives! TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD ERICKA Ingram of Olympia, Washington, attended a spiritual retreat in the summer of 1988. Many young people in this period, from teenagers to twentysomethings, became attracted to what has usually been called Charismatic Christianity, a spiritual movement that emphasizes divine healing, the casting out of demons, and other miraculous spiritual gifts (charismatic coming from the New Testament Greek word for “gifts” rather than from our modern usage). Amid late-night sing-alongs and bull sessions that made the retreat like a Christian summer camp experience, the organizers invited a former stand-up comedian turned minister and alleged healer named Karla Franko to speak. One of the charisms that Franko claimed to exercise was a gift of discernment, a kind of divination allegedly guided by the Holy Spirit. During a worship service, Franko pointed to Ericka and told her she had been molested by her father. Ericka cried but reportedly did not respond to this bizarre assertion. Several weeks after this incident, Ericka and her younger sister Julie accused their father of not only molesting them, but also forcing them to take part in sickening satanic rituals, and even sacrificing victims to the devil and burying the bodies under a barn in the family’s backyard. Local police arrested their father based only on these accusations, but the oddity of the case didn’t end there. Ericka and Julie’s father, Paul Ingram, worked in the Thurston County Sherriff’s Office for nearly seventeen years, headed the local Republican Party, and served as a stalwart member of the family’s fundamentalist congregation, the Church of Living Water. Ingram himself slowly began to believe that he had, in fact, done precisely what his daughters accused him of and gave a meandering, contradictory confession. What happened in the apparently happy household? Did the head of a satanic cult viciously abuse his daughters then hide in plain sight as one of Olympia’s most respected citizens? Had Satanists, as Ingram’s daughters suggested, infiltrated a police department and the entire community?36 None of these sensational claims held even a trifling amount of truth. Forensic experts did not find bodies concealed under the old barn. Both daughters proved unreliable witnesses with increasingly erratic accusations about judges, police, and social workers who also belonged to their father’s satanic cult. Ericka claimed to be scarred over much of her body from years of abuse, but a medical exam revealed no evidence of physical trauma—a fact she explained away by suggesting Satan made the wounds invisible. Paul Ingram’s “confession” was in part suggested to him by the family’s pastor, who urged him to believe he’d been possessed by demons and could not recall the hideous acts committed through him. Ingram would remain in prison until 2003 and was forced to register as a sex offender at the time of his release.37 The Ingram daughters, though morally and perhaps legally culpable for a series of false accusations, became victims of a national fantasy. Like millions of Americans, they were utterly convinced that satanic covens operated freely in Reagan’s America. A satanic panic had seized up the country’s central nervous system. The origins of the satanic panic are complex. Rumors of Satanists mutilating cattle became common in the 1970s. Tales of mysterious cattle mutilation had long been a feature of ranch life in the American West. Cows are, of course, rather low on the world’s food chain, frequently victims of wolves, coyotes, or venomous snakes. Smaller predators then devour the softer bits of the corpse in a way that makes it appear “mutilated.” Such acts were often blamed on Native American people and later, after the forties and fifties, flying saucer mania, as evidence of extraterrestrial activity. Satan’s new role as box office star gave the legend a plot and a script. Rosemary’s Baby, meant as a parody of social conventions about pregnancy, left many convinced of the reality of satanic covens, believing that even your neighbors could be in on the plot. Horror films dealing with the devil have played a powerful and unconventional role in shaping what Americans are willing to believe. The Exorcist made parish phones ring off the hook all around the country after 1973. The Omen, despite borrowing only selectively from Hal Lindsey and his readers’ end-of-the-world fetish, confirmed that the devil and his offspring prepared for the final conflict, a phrase that became the subtitle of the third sequel. An obsession with murderous cults further shaped the Satanism scare. The Manson murders were ascribed to devil worship in all manner of public accounts of the crimes, even if Satan did not play a particularly important role in Charles Manson’s peculiar blend of mysticism and murder. However, both Ed Sanders and Maury Terry, with no evidence but the lack of evidence they were wrong, helped spread this notion. In fact, Terry’s career of misinformation recently received a popular, highly cynical, “true crime” documentary on Netflix called The Sons of Sam in which we hear his meandering conceptions of links between Manson, David Berkowitz, and murderous gangs of devil-worshippers presented in a slick fashion likely to confuse a new generation of Americans. These ideas may have remained in the hazy twilight world of pop theology, what contemporary people think they know about religion from what they see at the movies, nervousness about those damn hippies, and a very generalized fear of social change in the sixties. But the political climate of the 1980s, one in which religion mixed indiscriminately with governance and the president felt comfortable calling our nuclear rival “an evil empire,” allowed the ancient concept of Satan to seem very real. Anxiety about empire played a larger role in the Satanism scare than historians, modern folklorists, and sociologists have conceded in the past. Like ancient Rome panicking over the frenzied cult of the Bacchae, Americans whispered tales of evil cults, serial killers, and secret covens. Roman angst over the worship of the Greek god Dionysus came, like their fear of Christianity, from a sense that foreign, evil influences could introduce chaos into the machinery of empire. In eighties America, the idea of an omnicompetent Satanist conspiracy tied together a vast number of fears, anxieties, and hatreds related to the changing role of women, the sexual revolution, the Cold War, and the American empire walking with a noticeable limp in the post-Vietnam era. And so the United States experienced a mass delusion. Across the country, claims of a well-organized criminal network of Satanists seized the darkest parts of the religious imagination. Books appeared like Michelle Remembers, whose author claimed her psychiatrist (and later husband) Lawrence Pazder enabled her to recover memories of a childhood filled with the most bizarre forms of sexualized, ritualized abuse. Other influential books followed, many by evangelicals who suddenly became “occult experts.” Accusations that children fell victim to satanic covens exploded, especially at day care centers. The McMartin preschool case in Manhattan Beach, California, became the longest trial in American history. Law enforcement and a covey of evangelical ministers encouraged parents in the belief that their children had been victims of Satanists who used the preschool as a front. In hundreds of communities, rumors of Satanists holding Black Mass in the woods sometimes brought out armed posses of citizens on a hunt for the alleged coven.38 In 1988, police in Jamestown, New York, contended with a massive rumor panic that led to attacks on a warehouse used as a practice space for local bands, armed vigilantes showing up at a local park, and the rumor that a Satanic cult planned to sacrifice a blue-eyed, blonde virgin on Friday the thirteenth. In the local paper, law enforcement insisted they found no evidence of any kind of secretive, criminal activity, which further incited the panic. Locals saw police denials as an odd sort of proof that either they did not wish to panic the community about a real threat, or that the police were in fact part of the conspiracy. But, as often as not, American law enforcement fanned these flames. One exhaustive study of police involvement in the satanic panic called Occult Cops found many law enforcement officers setting themselves up as “occult experts.” Almost all fit a basic template: male, white, deeply conservative, born-again Protestants aggrieved at their inability to rise higher in the law enforcement hierarchy, careers often dead-ended by their own lack of interest in the nuts and bolts of basic police work. Many of these men played some role in the prosecution of anti-war protestors and Black freedom struggle organizations in the sixties and seventies.39 The “occult experts,” often collaborating with evangelical leaders who also pretended knowledge of a vast Satanist conspiracy, held enormous influence over public perception and even the training of police. In 1987, Greenville County, South Carolina, law enforcement took a training course in combatting Satanism. Along with a description of occult symbols clearly borrowed from films, officers received a course in fundamentalist theology. The manual accused Christian churches of having not taken the existence of the devil seriously. The course provided absolutely no information, except in the most general terms (“reports from around the country”), that human sacrifice, particularly of children, was taking place on a large scale.40 The support of local officials and police departments linked with a surprising number of therapists and social workers now attached to the notion of Satanic ritual abuse, or SRA, as a social and psychological phenomenon. Although today rejected by mental health professionals, the idea created a surprisingly large network of supporters and sometimes made for the oddest of political alliances. Gloria Steinem believed stories of “ritual abuse” and, as late as 1993, published an issue of Ms. magazine with the cover story demanding the reader “BELIEVE IT! Cult Ritual Abuse Exists.”41 We’ve barely touched on the hundreds of local outbreaks or the related moral panic over heavy metal music and Dungeons & Dragons. Luckily, the era of “the satanic panic” has received a significant amount of attention and for good reasons. Except for America’s cyclical “red scares,” a moral panic that at least found some basis in the rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union, no other falsehood in U.S. history became so widely believed. In some quarters, to raise doubts about the existence of a powerful satanic conspiracy became proof you were in on it. American imperial power assured that Satanism scares in the metropole slithered into the colonies and client states abroad. The reverberation of the satanic panic was seen around the world, nowhere more than in parts of Africa where the United States maintained a strong military and, for a century, missionary presence. American special forces and the CIA engaged in covert operations all over the continent of Africa in the seventies and eighties, just as they had in the earlier days of the Cold War. The United States supported a South African invasion of Angola to end a civil war there when the leftist National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) seemed on the verge of winning on the ground and in the hearts and minds of Angolans. A declassified National Security Council document, though heavily redacted, shows Henry Kissinger and President Ford discussing an arms package to Angola’s right-wing guerrillas and their South African supporters. The document raises the possibility of allowing the state of Angola to collapse rather than take a socialist turn. Ford later attempted to change the narrative of America’s involvement by explaining that the United States intervened only after Fidel Castro sent Cuban forces to aid FNLA, a claim that does not match the timeline of events. Other declassified documents reveal that Kissinger urged an air strike against Cuba for aiding African revolutionaries.42 As U.S. money, arms, and assets swarmed over the continent, evangelical missionaries brought an American brand of Christianity, and an American terror of Satan, to the continent. “Charismatic” churches in particular took their emphasis on deliverance from demons and combined them with an African worldview of a universe throbbing with various kinds of supernatural powers. These variants of American Christianity saw exponential growth in numerous African nations, with scholars even referring to a “Pentecostal explosion” on the continent.43 Apartheid South Africa had long been viewed as an important Cold War American ally. Desperate to defend the racist social structures that penned Black South Africans into “homelands,” the white supremacist government of South Africa also proved reliably anti-communist. Thanks to a series of arms deals with Israel, it also formed an alliance with the bulwark of U.S. policy in the Middle East.44 America also gave South Africa a bad case of the satanic panic. Not surprisingly, it appeared in a highly racialized form. As the system of apartheid increasingly came under attack and global support flowed to the imprisoned Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress, white South Africans (Afrikaners) became convinced that Satanic rituals, which they often conflated with traditional African religious practices, threatened their children with “rape, murder, cannibalism and all manner of atrocities.”45 The white-dominated government started an Occult Related Crimes Unit, headed by evangelical Christian Adriaan Vlok. The unit would later be broken up and replaced by essentially the same organization with a more rational-sounding name, the Harmful Religious Practices Unit. Since 2012, this police organization kept the satanic panic alive by claiming to investigate “vampirism,” cases of possession, and that perpetual obstacle to the rule of law . . . “astral coercion.” America’s satanic panic made its way to Africa as mass culture as well. A film produced with the help of Charismatic missionaries became popular in Nigeria in the early 1990s. Living in Bondage took African folklore and combined it with Western notions of Satan. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the book Snatched from Darkness became a best-seller. The evidence-free screed closely followed the template of American evangelicals in claiming a large satanic conspiracy, brewed dangerously with some traditional African beliefs about witchcraft and evil spirits. Over the decades, the cost to the people of Africa has been enormous, with tens of thousands executed for witchcraft, and Christian leaders in, for example, Uganda fighting for legislation that would make being an LGBTQ person a crime punishable by death.46 The imperial dimension of America’s Satan obsession also appeared, not surprisingly, on the troubled southern border. The United States had long seen Mexico as a source of anxiety, sending invading armies across the Rio Grande to make amphibious assaults at Veracruz, or alternatively trying to wall off their neighbor. “So far from God, so close to the United States,” runs the weary Mexican joke. In 1989, Americans latched on to a horrific story that coiled together their nervousness about the border and the satanic panic. An American college student, Mark Kilroy, went missing while spring breaking in Matamoros, a province just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Local authorities discovered his body, along with fourteen others, buried in a mass grave. All the corpses bore evidence of torture. American media reported the death of Kilroy as the work of “a drug cult” or a “satanic cult.” Even the restrained reporting of The New York Times quoted Brownsville officials claiming an “occult” group sought to create “a magical shield” around themselves with “a twisted blend of sacrificial and black magic practices from Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica.” The Mexicans had sacrificed a fresh-faced American youth to Satan.47 The facts of the case are no less grisly than fans of the satanic panic believed, though the truth does not fulfil their strange fantasies. Adolfo Constanzo, the head of the drug ring responsible for the murders, did present himself to natives of the region, and some of his own henchmen, as a practitioner of “black magic.” However, not unlike a miniature version of the Duvalier regime, he claimed supernatural power only to inspire fear and obedience. And his inspiration for this idea? A horror film fan, he particularly enjoyed The Believers (1987), which mixed its Hollywood schlock and shock with a smattering of ideas stolen from traditional African religions in Cuba. In the feedback loop of the satanic panic, America produced films about evil cults that provided fodder for drug lords, whose actions in turn fueled Satanism fever.48 7.Norman Rockwell Is Burning in Hell THE SATANIC panic offered the Reagan administration a perfect Greenbaum effect. Not unlike the illusory notions about flying saucers and invading aliens, the panic made Americans open to all manner of false conspiracy theories. Much like the 1950s, these public obsessions allowed actual conspiracies to flourish. Once again, Americans proved themselves willing to listen to baseless assertions, and express some belief in them, even as the national security state and the executive branch hatched more complex, but very real, intrigues to further the demands of the American empire. During this era, Corydon Hammond, at one time a leading figure at the University of Utah School of Medicine, made a career with his tales of the satanic Greenbaum, a wandering Jew with ties to Nazism. He often insisted to his rapt listeners that he feared assassination for the “secrets” he shared. Hammond managed to draw NASA and the Mafia into his League of Super Evil Evildoers.49 The deluded ideas of QAnon have the DNA of Hammond’s claims, particularly his insistence that satanic kill squads kidnapped, programmed, and sometimes sacrificed kids on American army bases. These same groups, Hammond told therapists, also made money from drugs and arms sales. Such notions offered a gift to America’s intelligence community. There may have been no Satanists involved in gunrunning, but the CIA and the Reagan administration certainly sold armaments for advantage and security interests, sans the black robes and pentagrams. In a century’s worth of criminal behavior on behalf of the American empire, the Iran-Contra affair (1985–1987) stands out. Its reality is dark enough. The fact that it did not become a new Watergate and instead set the stage for open, unpunished criminality at the highest levels of government makes the story feel all too contemporary. The Sandinista National Liberation Front seized power from the far-right and deeply repressive Somoza regime of Nicaragua in 1979. They named themselves after Augusto Sandino, who had led opposition to an American invasion of Nicaragua in the late twenties and again in the thirties. The Sandinista regime became largely popular in Nicaragua, instituting rural health care and a major literacy program. In 1984, the country held a free election that consolidated Sandinista power. Most Americans were not aware of the events in Nicaragua, and few probably cared. But the Reagan administration held the absolute conviction that, against a great deal of evidence, the Soviets turned Nicaragua into a satellite. The CIA trained anti-government forces across the border in the client state of Honduras. These forces, the Contras, started as a ragtag group of mercenaries and criminals. American handlers turned them into something much more lethal. The CIA urged the guerrillas to attack “soft targets”—rural schools and medical clinics—that would endanger Sandinista popularity. Duane “Dewey” Clarridge, American liaison on the ground, admitted to Congress that the Contras executed doctors, nurses, teachers, and judges. “After all,” he said of these illegal covert operations against civilians, “this is a war.”50 The Reagan administration funded these horrors in secret, hidden from the American people and Congressional oversight. Congress passed the Boland Amendment in 1982 forbidding the funding of anti-Sandinista forces. The Reagan administration circumvented Congress. A secret enclave within the administration and the intelligence community used hundreds of millions in loans from American ally Saudi Arabia and raised hundreds of millions more in illegal arms sales to Iran. In their view, the secret arms deal with Iran paid double dividends, raising money for the Contras and securing the release of American hostages held in Lebanon (though religious extremists in Iran quickly took more hostages for future collateral against the United States). Cash now flowed to the Contra leadership through the hands of drug traffickers (including CIA asset Manual Noriega) and various non-state actors. These covert operations allowed the United States to stage-manage a Nicaraguan “civil war” that otherwise would not have existed. Israel, which joined the United States as one of the world’s leading arms dealers, even participated in the effort, doing business on behalf of the United States with its sworn enemy Iran.51 Oliver North, a marine who suffered severe trauma in Vietnam and subsequently turned to fundamentalist Christianity for succor, directed much of the program, coordinating with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and the CIA. North gathered a remarkably unsavory group of drug dealers, including Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and Félix Rodriguez, an international terrorist and CIA asset who exploded a bomb on a civilian Cuban passenger jet in 1976 that killed seventy-three people. Rodriguez worked with the CIA since the Bay of Pigs invasion and aided Bolivian authorities in the murder of Che Guevara in 1967.52 In October of 1986, a young Nicaraguan soldier downed an American cargo plane with a ground-to-air missile launcher. Nicaraguan investigators discovered the plane packed with sophisticated weapons systems intended for the Contras. The survivor of the downed aircraft, former marine and CIA agent Eugene Hasenfus, sang like a bird at daybreak about the entire story of arms for hostages, illegal fund transfers, and the role of some of the worst international terrorists on the planet in the Unites States’ effort to stage a civil war.53 The Iranian government, as Reagan’s advisors should have realized, proved more than happy to tell the world their side of the story. A special counsel launched an investigation, as did Congress. Reagan’s advisors George Shultz and James Baker warned the president from the beginning that the plot constituted a textbook example of an impeachable offense.54 CIA director William J. Casey and George H. W. Bush reassured Reagan but the evidence of “high crimes and misdemeanors” grew exponentially. After learning that, without the knowledge of Congress and even other branches of the armed services, the CIA had mined Nicaragua’s harbors, right-wing stalwart Barry Goldwater angrily denounced the administration’s actions. The infamously fiery Goldwater declared himself “utterly pissed off” that the United States had broken international law and committed an act of war.55 The outcome of the scandal—it rivaled and perhaps surpassed Watergate in its breadth—reveals much about America in the 1980s. Fourteen administration officials received federal indictments and the courts convicted eleven for a range of crimes that sound like a laundry list of charges appropriate for a RICO case leveled against organized crime figures rather than a political scandal. Twelve indictments of major government figures followed, North himself facing sixteen counts of felony. Yet, Bush I survived the controversy to win the presidency in 1988, and by then, Iran-Contra ceased to be an issue. Bush as president pardoned everyone convicted in the conspiracy. North became a right-wing celebrity complete with book deals and eventually a profitable relationship with Fox News.56 Writer-director Mick Garris (Sleepwalkers, Nightmare Cinema) once summed up the horror films of the seventies and eighties as “Norman Rockwell goes to hell.” These films responded to an American empire whose citizens felt powerless and baffled as the luckiest enjoyed the fruits of citizenship in a country that ran the world. Tens of millions of people bought into the idea of a detailed conspiracy of satanic networks controlling the media, the UN, and law enforcement but could not be bothered to thoughtfully examine the details of a conspiracy of arms, drugs, and Bond-level villains responsible for the death and maiming of tens of thousands.57 But, in the Reagan years, keeping America’s large and ever-growing sphere of influence toeing the line was not enough. Full-spectrum dominance, much like the dreams of the aeronautics industry and sci-fi films from the fifties once imagined, needed to include outer space. 8.Space, the Wild Frontier ROBERT A. HEINLEIN drifted into a strange solipsism in the seventies and eighties. In the 1960s, his novel beloved by the Manson Family, Stranger in a Strange Land, became required reading for the counterculture. They found its themes of polyamory and individualism attractive without exactly realizing the far-right politics that attended the call to hedonism. Okay, boomer. After the success of this novel, Heinlein’s work became increasingly mystical. By the eighties, his books exhibited a stream-of-consciousness quality and a narrative voice that made them read less like novels than papal encyclicals on limited government, religion, and sexuality. Indeed, Heinlein fans listened to his pronouncements as if they came ex cathedra. Even his admirers found these works produced from about 1980 until his death in 1988 barely readable, as if the philosophical underpinnings of Heinlein’s worldview began to take over his authorial voice. His libertarianism became metaphysical. The stories ceased to be stories and became elaborations of the inner self known to the world as Robert A. Heinlein. The results proved not only awful, they are pitiable. The Number of the Beast (1980) solves its plot problems with the intervention of Glinda the Good Witch, a deus ex malefica as laughable as it is pompous. Even good ideas like Job: A Comedy of Justice (1984), which promised a rollicking parody of organized religion, inflicted on readers a ghastly plod in which the narrator himself, who is essentially Heinlein, seems to believe he’s God. To Sail Beyond the Sunset (1987) suggests that smoking a joint represents the height of moral depravity, while a father having sex with his daughter might be fine, depending on context. If his writing faltered in a morass of narcissism, Heinlein remained politically committed at a time when his dreams of a scrawny social contract but a muscular military seemed to have come true. In 1980, he served on the rather harmless-sounding Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy along with protégé Jerry Pournelle. The Department of Defense had given the working group significant influence to help outline space policy for the Reagan administration. This would have costly and frightening implications. Since the Kennedy administration, many Americans held an idealistic image of NASA, and the space program more generally, as dedicated to science and exploration. These ideals had certainly been part of NASA’s conception of itself. But the agency was also tied irrevocably to the nation’s burgeoning national security state. Beginning in 1957 with the Soviet launch of the first satellite, Sputnik 1, American efforts to rocket orbital vehicles and eventually humans into space entwined with the Cold War and American imperial hopes. It chilled CIA officials to the bone that Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first man in space, sent greetings to the national liberation movements in Africa as he passed over the continent. The United States had been up to its elbows in some earthbound dirty tricks of gunrunning and assassination to try to suppress these very movements now being hailed from orbit on the Vostok 1. The national security state organized NASA in 1958, creating it literally in the shadow of Sputnik. From the moment of its inception, the organization cooperated closely with the military. A series of documents appeared in 2015 that showed that, at its inception, NASA worked closely with the CIA. Acting CIA director and air force general Charles P. Cabell contacted administrators of the space program regarding intelligence sharing even before Congress officially brought NASA into existence. Satellites ostensibly collecting data on weather, geological activity, and oceanic patterns also harvested any data they could on the Soviets. The space agency even aided the CIA in analyzing that raw intelligence. NASA officials meanwhile helped float cover stories for CIA projects like the U-2 and the A-12 jets, both agencies insisting that the spy planes served only scientific purposes.58 The relationship among covert operations, NASA, and the American search for imperial invincibility came together in the desire to militarize space. Heinlein’s vision of space marines exterminating the enemy with extreme prejudice was not far off the mark. After Sputnik, the United States made threatening moves against the Soviets by placing missiles in Italy and Turkey. Meanwhile, NASA not only worked hand in glove with the CIA but earned a place at the budgetary table by joining the Pentagon’s effort to develop rocketry able to deliver a heavier payload of nuclear mayhem. Heinlein’s protégé Jerry Pournelle not only continued as a prolific author of sci-fi horror but also became part of the national security establishment with his West Point textbook on strategy in the nuclear age. Although some of his ideas for America’s aerospace/military industrial complex seem like plot summaries for his science fiction novels (such as his involvement in a group wanting to send paramilitary American colonists into space in hive-like colonies), he would have outsized influence on the new Republican administration that brought the country closer to the brink of nuclear holocaust than any time since the 1960s. Pournelle supported not only Reagan’s well-known social conservatism but also his desire to expand American military might—not only across the world but very literally into orbit. In the early eighties he joined his fellow sci-fi writer Dean Ing in publishing a book that revived the right-wing fantasy of the United States creating orbital superweapons. Entitled Mutually Assured Survival, it carried an endorsement from Reagan himself. The actual text, sci-fi author Thomas M. Disch wrote in The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World, reads like the specs for “the technological background” of one of Pournelle’s own “space operas.” The book called for, among other weaponry technologically impossible at the time, laser cannons that would use orbital mirrors to rain destruction down on the Soviets or the Chinese. In this dystopian vision, satellites would become little more than weapons stations that used “kinetic energy” to destroy America’s enemies.59 This might seem like the harmless rantings of sci-fi writers who managed to claw a blurb out of the president’s press secretary. That is, if the Reagan administration had not sought out Pournelle to help advertise precisely the kind of superweapons imagined in his fiction. Pournelle worked closely on the policy and the rhetoric of Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), dismissed as “Star Wars” by Senator Ted Kennedy. Reagan offered the perfect vessel for sci-fi militarists. J. Hoberman makes the case that, given his background in Hollywood, no president better understood how the movies nestle close to our worldviews, shaping politics and personal identity. In the summer of 1981, with Raiders of the Lost Ark owning the box office, American F-14 fighters brought down two Libyan jets in a show of force against a North African nation known for its support of attacks on Americans. After receiving the news, Reagan pantomimed a performance of Indiana Jones pulling his revolver and shooting dead an Arab swordsman that American audiences were currently applauding in theaters. “Reagan isn’t our movie,” Hoberman wrote at the time, “we are his: America the movie.”60 Right-wing writers of violent science fiction thus found the Reagan administration generally amenable to the cinematic possibilities of taking war into space. The president’s own understanding of the universe outside our atmospheric bubble largely seemed shaped by movies he’d seen. He once asked Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze if the Soviets would work with the United States against an alien threat. Even more bizarrely, he raised the issue with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1985 Geneva arms reduction talks. Colin Powell admitted that Reagan’s “little green men” interest was well known and thought it came from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).61 Pournelle and his confederates found their guy when it came to the imperial fantasy life. Thirty billion dollars would be thrown at SDI, part of the reason that the United States tripled its budget deficits by the end of the Reagan years. Ideas for an orbital ballistic missile system went so far as to imagine a system of lasers guiding advanced rockets to strike down Russian warheads while still in orbit. Pournelle worked as a part-time speechwriter for Reagan on the issue of SDI. He also provided a crucial link with the aerospace industry, which added to the billions they already made in government contracts for expensive, highly technical weapon systems.62 SDI always remained more of a political fantasy and a public relations stunt than an actual military initiative. But it proved an expensive, and enduring, fantasy. In order to sell the idea, NASA produced “computer models” that essentially used video game technology to create a scenario in which orbital war platforms took out Soviet ICBMs like a teenage arcade wizard. In fact, it’s hard not to see these presentations as heavily influenced by WarGames (1983), a film that imagines a similar scenario and that fascinated Reagan. But these were not representations of technology that actually existed. They were quite literally, as news reports often noted with either delight or cynicism, the “stuff of science fiction.” As Reagan himself lost interest in a program that no reputable scientist believed would ever work, the vision of full-spectrum American dominance slowly transmogrified into an idea for a limited anti-ballistic missile system that made the rounds during the George W. Bush administration. The right wing of science fiction, started by Heinlein but now really led by Pournelle, remained active. Under their influence, the most extreme conservatives became some of the space program’s strongest advocates. Newt Gingrich, the powerful Speaker of the House through most of the Clinton years, had a soft spot for using sci-fi weapons to destroy the monsters he saw threatening America. He coauthored a book with conservative science fiction writer David Drake, one of the practitioners of the “space marine” genre. Their Window of Opportunity: A Blueprint for the Future featured an introduction written by Pournelle and a call for colonizing space with American capitalism and militarism—what Pournelle called a practical application “of the principles that make this nation great” that “proves that we can all get rich” off of space. In 1994, the year the Republican-controlled Congress imposed severe austerity programs on America’s already macerated social programs, Gingrich told readers in his book To Renew America that “aerospace engineer and science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle” had assured him that “space tourism” would become a normal part of American life by 2020. How this would be possible in an America where Gingrich’s, and to a large degree his nemesis, moderate Democrat Bill Clinton’s, slash-and-burn approach to social welfare had caused tens of millions to hurtle below the poverty line is never explained. Their “tough on crime” rhetoric increased the incarceration of Americans, especially African Americans. For-profit prisons became the reality of the American future and not Gingrich’s claim that “honeymoons in space” would be “in vogue” in the year I write these words. Perhaps it’s pleasing to him that a few billionaires funding jumps into orbit, rather than letting their wealth “trickle down” or “create wealth,” has become a new pastime.63 Heinlein died in 1988 but his progeny sallied forth to spin violent survivalist fantasies, slaughtering aliens and humans alike who threatened libertarian values. William R. Forstchen, a ghostwriter for Newt Gingrich, published Star Voyager Academy in 1994. Directly plagiarizing ideas from Heinlein, particularly from Starship Troopers and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Forstchen imagined a new American revolution in which colonists on the moon revolt against Earth over high taxes. Pournelle wrote a popular series of space marine novels, the Falkenberg’s Legion series, that are thinly disguised tracts for some of his more savage political views. Gingrich himself attempted an alternative history called 1945 that imagines a world in which Hitler wins and the United States must race against time to develop the atomic bomb before the victorious Nazi state. Alternate histories of World War II (and most every major historical event) have created some sci-fi masterpieces, most notably Philip K. Dick’s 1962 The Man in the High Castle. Gingrich found a way to make the scenario boring. The Republican lawmaker’s book made the case for the mantra of nineties Republicans, and plenty of the era’s “new Democrats,” that “big government” had to come to an end. Gingrich’s 1945 turns into a fictionalized plea for the United States to give away billions to the aeronautics industry but offer no supervision or regulation for what the John Galt–ish entrepreneurs do with the money. The political hectoring may have been only part of the book’s problem. Like so much of the Heinlein fanfic published over the decades, 1945 may disdain big government but it loves big weapons in an exceptionally weird fashion. In one passage so purple it feels like a bad bruise, the superweapons of Gingrich’s fantasy world are “dark” and “compelling” but give the military tech enthusiast who created them the feeling of “being aroused by a woman one despised.” Gingrich has continued to trouble the world with sci-fi and historical fiction, including racist reimaginings of the Civil War and paranoid delusions about Pearl Harbor. Such ramblings would be beneath notice except that he, like so many other authors of murderous science fiction, kept exceedingly odd involvements with the American military that went beyond his role in the House. Gingrich has frequently taught at the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks and in fact has been the long-serving member of the Joint Warfighting Committee that’s supposed to sharpen the strategic thinking of officers preparing to serve at the Pentagon’s highest echelons. Other than his long-standing desire to strip-mine outer space and kill anything that resists, it’s unclear what kind of strategic thinking Gingrich brought to the table. 9.They Live THE 1980S can feel like a 1950s remake, if perhaps even more paranoid. A new red scare, and deep anxiety over the use of atomic weapons, followed Reagan’s hard-nosed approach to the Soviets. The movies often reflected such notions, in films like Predator but also in other genres. Heartbreak Ridge (1986) starring Clint Eastwood presented an utterly false picture of the Grenada invasion. Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) quite literally refought (and won) the Vietnam War. Mass culture seemed on the side of Reagan’s worldview. But horror’s taste for the subversive slithered around since its origin point in the 1920s. There are hundreds of examples of horror as escapism or horror managing to buttress Americans’ myopic view of the world and their place in it. This makes efforts in the rather conformist decade to ask fans to question the basic values of empire even more exceptional. Larry Cohen’s The Stuff has become an independent horror classic, with restored editions appearing more than thirty years after its 1985 release. The Jewish director, horrified by his family’s tales of the Holocaust and his own sense of alienation in America, already used horror to question America’s obsessions with its children and its willingness to destroy the environment with the murderous infants of his It’s Alive! series. Eclectic and inventive, he’d worked on Black cinema classics like Bone and Black Caesar while using horror to make an early “defund the police” statement in Maniac Cop (1988). The Stuff makes a nightmare of American militarism and its relation to corporate power. The actual stuff of the title turns out to be a self-aware parfait that everyone in America needs very badly. Cohen fills the strange film with commercials so real they transcend parody. The titular weird goop became the ultimate commodity fetish. Americans needed it. Americans needed to eat it. Consuming the stuff, as much as they could muscle into their gullets, became a kind of moral imperative, a duty of citizenship with ads assuring people that it will “give a new order to life.” At a time when Reagan urged Americans to believe in “the magic of the marketplace,” The Stuff suggested that there’s a dark gramarye at work and the consumer is being consumed. Cohen succeeded in questioning America’s effort to bring its nightmare of consumption to the rest of the world with the character Colonel Spears, who seems unaware the United States lost the Vietnam War. George A. Romero’s Day of the Dead (1985) came amid the second Reagan administration’s full-throated support for counterrevolution in Nicaragua and years of anti-Soviet rhetoric that continued the polyphonic themes of the Soviet Union as “an evil empire” and the United States as the primary force for good in the world. Day of the Dead, though it received less attention than the earlier Romero zombie films, became the most biting satire of the trilogy. In it, the American military are maniacal bullies, little more than aspirant warlords in a ruined America. At a moment when SDI suggested that science, industry, and the Pentagon could work together to produce a defensive shield for an invulnerable nation, Romero made the scientists either utterly insane or placed them at contretemps with the violent, undisciplined military. The film turned out to be the only commercial failure in Romero’s first zombie trilogy. A yuppie America didn’t care for this approach given the new fetish for the military even in the aftermath of Vietnam. “Horror is radical,” Romero told an interviewer, “[it can] rattle your cage and say, wait a minute—look at things differently.” Americans did not want to see such films in a decade when even geopolitical nightmares like the possibility of a foreign invasion, such as in Red Dawn (1984), are given a soporific ending.64 In 1988, John Carpenter directed They Live, now a cult classic that offers the most intriguing horror movie of the eighties in terms of creating a compelling plot while wearing its politics on its sleeve. In the film, a homeless construction worker named Nada (“nobody” or “nothing”) comes into possession of a pair of high-tech specs that allow him to see America for what it really is. The earth, we learn, has been secretly invaded by aliens who have lived among us for some time. The shades Nada wears reveal the actual messages received from billboards and magazines, all commands from our unseen masters. An advertisement for a vacation that shows a sultry woman in a bathing suit stretched languorously on the beach really says MARRY AND REPRODUCE. Looking at a magazine rack, the covers splashed with gadgets, cars, and supermodels, Nada’s glasses show him they order the reader to OBEY, STAY ASLEEP, and simply SHOP. Meanwhile the president, who Nada discovers is also an alien trying to keep people “asleep” with consumerism, not only looks but sounds like Reagan. “It’s a new morning in America. Fresh Vital,” he says, directly alluding to the 1984 Reagan commercial “Morning in America.” Carpenter described They Live as his response “to the Reagan years” and in particular to “the unrestrained capitalism of the era.” Popular culture acquiesced to Reaganomics and American foreign policy. At the time, Carpenter remembers, Michael Douglas could deliver his famous line “Greed is good” in the 1987 film Wall Street, which read to many as a motto instead of a parody. “I wanted to make some political statements,” Carpenter recalled, during a time when “everybody is proud to be an American if they can make money at it.”65 The coming of the 1990s did not bring a new social consciousness. The efforts of cultural critics working in numerous fields—the writing of Noam Chomsky, the activism of Cornel West, and the satirical horror of Carpenter and Romero—found little purchase. Romero, Cohen, and Carpenter used horror to ask questions and, especially in the case of Carpenter, demand a response. But few listened. Americans entered a new era in which the small footprint of the American empire became a heavy boot on the world’s face, even as the social contract at home continued to unravel. The explosive violence of America’s empire not only continued its lethal trajectory, its velocity accelerated. The end of the Cold War did not bring a “peace dividend.” Facing no conceivable rival on earth as the Red Army disappeared into history’s mists after 1991, the Pentagon and its enormously wealthy corporate partners did not stand down. The United States developed and sold new weapons technologies, built more military bases to control more points on the globe, and developed Space Command as a joint project of all the armed services, dedicated to creating killer satellites and cyber war capabilities. Few Americans even knew about Space Command, a forerunner of today’s Space Force, even though it receives mention in the 1996 film Independence Day. Horror awakened dormant nightmares in the nineties, an era that didn’t seem too bad if you were white and enjoyed relative economic prosperity. Amity Island felt okay, really just fine. But the chain saw brattled in the century’s twilight.",

      "content": "1.Do You Like Scary Movies? HORROR TOOK a holiday in the 1990s. Maybe. There’s a consensus that horror’s golden age of the seventies and eighties withered in the more optimistic decade of tech start-ups and stock market ebullience. George A. Romero’s zombies shambled off the stage after 1985’s Day of the Dead, not rising again until the twenty-first century. Critics prematurely declared the slasher film dead, forgetting that the monster always returns. Stephen King remained a best-selling author, though fantasy, science fiction, and realism became the genres most attractive to many of the same fans who had once voraciously read Salem’s Lot, The Stand, Pet Sematary, and Christine. The Green Mile (1999), a wistful story of supernatural healing and redemption, became King’s big hit at the box office. Devoted fans will remind you of some of the new directions taken by classic directors and a new conception of paranormal and gothic horror that suited the fascination with unquiet spirits, demons, and indeed angels that haunted, infested, and flitted around the echoing portal of a new millennium. Apocalyptic films gained some popularity, often mixing genres as in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle End of Days (1999), in which the action hero goes after the Antichrist, guns ablazin’, a crossover event between Die Hard and The Book of Revelation. But Forrest Gump, not Freddy Krueger, won the hearts of Americans in the 1990s. Sentimental and nostalgic, the film reimagined American history and blended it with magical realism to spin a sugared confection of innocence, goodness, and the easily falsifiable notion that there is a God who looks out for fools and little children. The story of a mentally challenged white Southerner with naivete matched only by his gift to align the universe with his wishes, the film takes us on a highly redacted tour of almost fifty years of American history. Audiences left the film charmed as Tom Hanks became an avatar for tens of millions who remained as befuddled as the protagonist about American life. Gump becomes an unsophisticated witness to desegregation, the Vietnam War, and numerous political assassinations. He maintains his innocence through it all and emerges from the bloodbath of history unscathed. Meanwhile, his friends drop like flies. Following the stereotype of so many of the era’s horror films, the Black guy dies first. Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson), a fellow Alabamian who bears the curse of becoming close to Gump in Vietnam, dies with his hands full of his own viscera. The graphic scene in this PG film would have been excised from the era’s slasher films that the Motion Picture Association often threatened with the new NC-17 rating. Shrimp-loving Bubba Blue is far from the film’s only sacrificial offering. The love of Gump’s life, Jenny, also dies in the 1980s. She has been “promiscuous” and done some drugs during the sexual revolution and so dies of an unnamed “disease.” This apparently references the decade’s AIDS epidemic that killed nearly ninety thousand Americans before the Reagan administration even acknowledged its existence in 1988. Again, as with the popular reading of slasher movies, dare to enjoy sex outside of marriage and it’s one, two, Freddy’s coming for you. Gump, meanwhile, becomes wealthy by being an early investor in what he refers to as a “fruit company” called Apple. This gives him the time to sit on park benches and explain to people trying to catch a bus to their low-wage, labor-intensive jobs that “life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.” “It takes a heart of stone to love Forrest Gump,” wrote Mark Edmundson in his book from the nineties and about the nineties called Nightmare on Main Street. This may seem far harsher than even my own judgment of a film still much-beloved after almost thirty years. But, as Edmundson points out, there’s something truly hateful about the sentimental film. What we see in that film is white America blissful in its own ignorance, a kind of blind cruelty in grasping at a vision of the world only possible to citizens of an invincible empire. Edmundson insists that the narrative is not about the adorable Gump. It’s a story about how the United States “despite a few wayward incidents, is still a grand place to live.” At a moment in American history when the gap between wealth and poverty yawned wider than at any time since the 1890s, Edmundson rightly says that the film represented the dangerous idea “that dull virtue in tandem with humble, unresenting poverty is well rewarded.” A decade in which the United States carried out violent interventions that killed thousands of civilians, and corporations joined in the mass incarceration of young Black men in the creation of for-profit prisons, does not suggest a world that’s a box of candy.1 The success of the saccharine film perfectly twinned a politically drowsy decade. Americans, white Americans at least, proved willing to forgive and forget the “wayward incidents” of their country’s past. Despite the 1980s’ reputation for conservatism, well-earned in many respects, the decade also featured the powerful grassroots Nuclear Freeze movement, the Sanctuary movement that sheltered Latin America refugees, and protests against U.S. intervention in Nicaragua and El Salvador by groups such as Witness for Peace. Many of these movements withered after Iran-Contra and the end of the Reagan administration. More important, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a sense of optimism among the white middle class that rose throughout the decade, charging ahead alongside the super-heated stock market driven by Clinton’s international trade deals. This somnolence among the body politic belied the strenuous military adventurism of the decade. The pattern first appeared in the Bush years as a new incarnation of Reagan’s efforts to end the alleged Vietnam Syndrome. In 1989, Bush’s Operation Just Cause removed the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Little reporting appeared in the mainstream press to explain the necessity of this sudden military intervention that amounted to the kidnapping of a foreign leader. Neither did major news outlets give much space to the even more mysterious fact that Noriega had long been an asset of the CIA, receiving up to two hundred thousand dollars in personal funds. He was kicked off the agency’s payroll under the Carter administration (1977–1981) but immediately began receiving funding again in 1981 with the influence of former CIA director George H. W. Bush.2 Operation Desert Storm (1991) often now simply called the “first invasion of Iraq,” set the tone for the decade, one that had its roots in the first stirrings of America’s empire after World War I and would have consequences deep into our future. A truly ludicrous affair, the rise of twenty-four-hour news, particularly CNN, made the conflict in the Gulf into one of the most popular wars in American history. Public opinion, unhindered by facts and context, discovered another “good war,” a simple struggle between good and evil. If the invasion of Grenada had been a slightly off-kilter Broadway show with decidedly mixed reviews, the Gulf War became a multi-billion-dollar special effects–laden blockbuster, rivaling Jaws and Star Wars in the cineplex of the American mind. Iraq and Saddam Hussein’s journey to becoming a new monster to replace the Soviet Union had more than a few dramatic twists and turns. Hussein had ruled Iraq as a despot since 1979. He kept no particular ideology, other than what he crazy-quilted together from a vague socialism and a strident nationalism peppered with an occasional reference to the Qur’an. His utter malice toward any opposition became the dominant characteristic of his regime, his dictatorship leading Iraq into a devasting war with Iran that lasted most of the eighties. He cultivated an increasingly absurd cult of personality, creating statues and images of himself that rivalled Stalin’s mania for similar official accolades. A joke among Iraqis, told quietly in a country where the ruler’s security services killed a quarter of a million people between 1979 and 2003, ran that the population of the country recently burgeoned to thirty-four million people . . . seventeen million Iraqis and seventeen million portraits of Hussein.3 Hussein may have been a son of a bitch, but from the standpoint of America’s national security establishment, he was our son of a bitch. Donald Rumsfeld, then serving the Reagan administration as special envoy to the Middle East, made two personal visits to Hussein at a time when the United States provided Iraq with billions in agricultural credits, making Iraq the fourth largest recipient of U.S. aid in the world.4 Support for Hussein in his war against Iran went beyond foodstuffs. The Department of Defense, working hand in glove with the CIA, provided Iraq with satellite photography surveillance of Iranian military movements. Even more damning, the DOD sold Iraq chemical precursors to produce mustard gas and sarin gas. Retired senior intelligence official Colonel Walter P. Lang asserted that the United States would not countenance the use of chemical weapons against civilians but that, in the Iran-Iraq war, “[their] use against military objectives was seen as inevitable.” In 1988, Hussein did use deadly chemicals against the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq. Neither the CIA nor American armed forces played a direct role in this attack and the Reagan administration officially condemned it. Then Vice President Bush argued against continuing chemical weapon precursors to Iraq. But a full investigative report in The New York Times revealed real dissension in the administration over continued support for Hussein even after he made it clear he was a genocidal monster.5 Hussein could claim limited success in his war with Iran, despite enormous casualties and crippling debt to the small oil emirate of Kuwait, which aided him in buying arms and rebuilding infrastructure. Rather than paying the debt, Hussein threatened Kuwait, insisting that the tiny enclave of wealth was long a natural part of Iraq and existed only because of British imperialism. Even murderous megalomaniacs sometimes get their facts straight. Britain had drawn the lines separating the two new states they carved out of the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after the Great War. The process had been so thoroughly dominated by the British Empire that the puppet rulers of both states in 1920 had been confused, and indeed had to constantly badger British foreign secretaries for the precise boundaries of their jury-rigged states. In 1990, Hussein flexed his muscles against Kuwait while also criticizing U.S. support for Israel, the dominant military power in the region. His decision to mount an invasion of Kuwait may have come from mixed signals from American diplomats, who carried a warning about the deployment of troops on his southern border while also assuring that the United States understood his economic problems and that America had “no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts.” Certainly, a sociopath would see this muddled message as two big thumbs up. And he did.6 The successful prosecution of the war against Iraq, with few American casualties, set off a curious wave of celebration, curious in both its symbolism and scale. The National Victory Celebration, the largest military parade since the Second World War, featured not only the march of eight thousand troops but also what the Associated Press called a “swarm” of Apache helicopters landing on the National Mall. CBS News noted that a “patriot missile” received “the loudest applause of the day.” No fewer than eighty-two aircraft filled the airspace over D.C., including the deadly F-117 stealth bomber. Bush crowed, “By God, we’ve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all,” and the raw militarism of the National Victory Celebration, replicated in cities and small towns across the country, suggested just that.7 But something was wrong. The Gulf War quickly passed out of popular consciousness. Two years later, the American public yawned when the United States bombed Iraq again. America experienced a pretty good war all in all, prepared for them by an administration and a military/public relations complex that, as commanding general of U.S. forces Norman Schwarzkopf said, “knew how to package an historic event.” Schwarzkopf played an important role in winning media hearts and minds, finding himself christened Stormin’ Norman and generally lionized even as he restricted press coverage of both American and Iraqi deaths.8 Had Americans become bored of their “walk-on parts in a monster documentary”? Had the dark carnival left town forever? 2.Ignoring the Tales from the Hood WHILE BUSH busily kicked the Vietnam Syndrome, millions of Americans did not share in America’s nineties fantasies. White supremacy ensured that, at home and abroad, the horror would continue to take shape. But the Black community did not accept their victimization. Ernest R. Dickerson made his first grad school film with Spike Lee. Joe’s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads told a story of community and violence at a local barbershop. Joe’s shop offered a gathering spot for Black men to talk plainly and profanely about the mysteries of their lives. It also became a contemplation of both violence from within economically walled-off Black communities and brutalities inflicted by the state. A renaissance of Black film occurred in the 1990s. Author and activist Michael Eric Dyson goes so far as to suggest that Black films emerged from a “cultural nationalism” that sought to oppose the era’s “escalation of racist hostility.” Notably, this included a rediscovery of the possibilities of Black horror films to explore the horror of Black history. John Singleton, Matty Rich, the Hughes brothers, Lee, and Dickerson forced audiences to look at their bleak visions of the American past and present.9 Many of these filmmakers worked traditional elements of horror into their films, sometimes directly using tropes of demon possession and zombiism. Lee’s Jungle Fever features a skin-crawling scene of a drug-addicted son confronting his father over money with a gloomy dread that remained with many viewers, myself included, ever since we witnessed it in theaters in 1991. Dickerson would make the cult favorites Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight and Bones, stories of demonic powers and ferocious spirits that intermingled with the realities of mass incarceration and the fate of abandoned urban centers. Unlike white filmmakers, who could still engage with the imperial fantasies of voodoo and cults from abroad, Black filmmakers of the era focused almost entirely on the frayed social structures of urban life, the terror inherent in Black history, and the death of the dreams of Black Pride and Power. By the early seventies, many Black workers, while still segregated from white suburbs, began to join the middle class into which the G.I. Bill and friendly mortgage-lending practices launched whites during the 1950s. A generation after the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South into Northern and Southern cities, men of color in particular found good union jobs in manufacturing with secure employment and a living wage. The new economic options collapsed as soon as they appeared. The deindustrialization of America left the emerging Black middle class an empty shell in many parts of the country, especially in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles where disappearing jobs created wastelands out of formerly vibrant communities. By the 1990s, the outsourcing of American jobs hammered the coffin’s final nail for the traditional American working class. This particularly affected the Black community, and fatalistic discussions of “a permanent underclass” became common despite the irony of American economic hegemony abroad.10 The empire wielded its weapons at home. A spigot of cash to local police departments meant, as a New York University Law Review article noted, rising “costs of coercion” as local police invested in electronic surveillance equipment (once controversial even for the FBI) and purchased military-grade tactical equipment. Under a 1997 program, police departments did not even have to purchase the war material. Instead, they received gratis military surplus that included grenade launchers and armored vehicles called MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush protected) later used in Iraq and Afghanistan. After 2001, police access to battlefield weaponry grew when the new Department of Homeland Security provided block grants for police, even in tiny rural communities, to create “counterterrorism units.”11 The plan for a war on America’s internal troubles needed the legitimacy required of its many wars abroad. John Dilulio, a conservative Princeton professor, provided it when he coined the term superpredator in 1995 to describe an alleged wave of juvenile crime on the rise (in fact, crime of all kinds continued to decline in the 1990s). The term immediately had a racial coding, and Dilulio used phrases like “black inner-city neighborhoods” to heighten an alleged connection. Hillary Clinton made the term infamous when, in a 1996 campaign speech for her husband, she claimed that “superpredators” who had “no conscience, no empathy” emerged in “gangs” across the country. “We need to take these people on,” she said, in contrast to less influential voices that called for direct economic aid, practical job training, and various therapies to aid people whose class location might, in a very direct way, force them into criminal activity.12 Like a fighter all but spent in the early rounds, the Black working class continued to be caught cold by the rain of blows from above. The now infamous Clinton Crime Bill of 1994 lengthened sentencing for nonviolent crimes, providing incentives for dying rural communities to build more prisons to indefinitely detain Americans often convicted for simple possession, and allowing the Department of Justice to send billions of dollars to states who distributed the money to local police departments with no oversight. The 1992 film Candyman captured a host of the Black community’s real-world terrors. Based on a short story by white horror author Clive Barker and made by white director Bernard Rose, the film entered Black consciousness in its brutal portrayal of the daily horrors of systemic racism. American police violence and substandard public housing, gentrification and highways that cut apart communities, and white people who care too much and then turn murderous are all present. The monster, the Candyman, comes out of the violent past, the victim of a lynching on the frontier of empire. The supernatural threat of a powerful Black man, his body ribboned to carrion by white violence, became a powerful totem in the scrying power of hip-hop’s language. Jordan Peele, who produced Nia DaCosta’s elegantly terrifying remake in 2021, said he “[loves] the original Candyman” because “it broke us out of the box. A Black monster was pretty revolutionary. If there was no Candyman, I don’t know that there would be a Get Out.” The Candyman as an image of both power and horror goes hand in glove with Michael Eric Dyson’s discussion of the new culture of Black power that emerged in the 1990s and continued to assert itself in the twenty-first century. From Travis Scott sampling Philip Glass’s soundtrack of the film to Kendrick Lamar’s intentionally threatening “Just say his name,” the Candyman remained a specter of the past that lives out the horrors of the Black present. Billie Jasmine Powell, in her research on horror, hip-hop, and Black life in 1990s America, discovered no fewer than twenty-two references to Candyman in the work of artists ranging from Tupac to Wu-Tang Clan to Pusha T.13 Candyman premiered, in an eerie accident, the same year as what’s sometimes called the Los Angeles riots. South Central LA offers a compellingly cruel example of the systemic destruction of a Black community, slashed apart like the Candyman himself. South Central had become a term of conjurer’s art, words that “tough on crime” pols could repeat to summon the horrors of the superpredator. Although South Central geographically refers to a section of the once middle- and upper-class Central Avenue dotted with prosperous Black-owned businesses, the term came to include imaginary boundaries that went as far as Compton and Watts in the south and stretched westward into Crenshaw and Inglewood. Born in Watts, writer and activist Wanda Coleman described growing up in “the fabulous fifties” of what had become known as Historic South Central. The invidious “neighborhood covenants” had become less common and Coleman lived in an integrated neighborhood. But the city of Los Angeles seemed determined to destroy this vibrant community. During an economic downturn in the 1960s, LAPD police chief William Parker systematically raided Black businesses on Central Avenue. The city’s insistence on building the I-10, the Santa Monica Freeway, split traditional neighborhoods in two or three segments, leaving wastelands of rubble behind and even wrecking part of the Sugar Hill neighborhood, perhaps the most historic and architecturally important Black neighborhood outside of Atlanta and Harlem. Inner city, a term that the Urban Institute designates as a rhetorical device rather than a geographical description, appeared in discussions on both the right and left. In the 1980s, the idea of the “plight of the inner city” took on an increasingly unhelpful moral shading. Rather than thinking systemically about the ways in which specific policies caused urban poverty to accelerate, social commentary frequently framed the issue as a moral problem. The emerging power of Black horror films seldom made direct connections to the imperial role the United States played in the world. Rusty Cundieff, who later contributed his expertise to the edgiest sketches of Chappelle’s Show, made Tales from the Hood (1995). The film doesn’t even glance outside urban centers and instead profiles an understandable obsession with police brutality, politicians with inherently racist agendas, and intracommunity violence. The full-scale assault on the Black community since the 1970s meant that Black horror, much like Black social movements, placed the emphasis on the white supremacy at home rather than abroad. Black critiques of the American empire did exist as an important part of the freedom struggle before the 1980s. Underreported at the time and subsequently ignored in too many textbook accounts of the Black freedom struggle, the assassination of Congo leader Patrice Lumumba ignited a 1961 protest beginning in Harlem that breached the United Nations itself. The Congolese leader’s death had been a joint American-Belgian covert op that, like so many American-led secret operations, absolutely everyone knew about. The United States replaced Lumumba with an acquiescent dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, who became one of the wealthiest men in the world from his burn-and-plunder approach to his own country’s rich raw materials.14 The protest set off an international wave of public demonstrations in Paris, London, parts of the Soviet Union, and Tokyo. James Baldwin wrote a searing op-ed in The New York Times that referenced the killing of Lumumba and the subsequent protests. He warned whites that what was becoming an “Afro-American” struggle meant that Black people wanted much more than to sit down with white people for “the consumption of overcooked burgers and tasteless coffee at various sleazy lunch counters.”15 In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. tied the Vietnam War to segregation at home. The Black Panther Party had suggested that racism and economic power depended on, and simultaneously supported, the American empire abroad. In the well-researched and intensely important book Black Against Empire by Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, we learn that the FBI, in cooperation with local and state law enforcement, systematically destroyed the Panthers, at least in part because of this international agenda. Black history remained Black horror and empire shaped the conditions that Dickerson, Cundieff, and Lee exposed in their films. In the nineteenth century, westward expansion created a “cotton kingdom” as far west as Texas. Four million African Americans worked as chattel property. Segregation and economic immiseration shaped American attitudes toward people of color around the world. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, as mass incarceration became “the new Jim Crow,” racism at home continued to shape American imperial policy. American intervention abroad continued to exhibit the dire inclinations that Black Power advocates had seen for decades. The United States could not, for example, leave Haiti alone, continuing the obsession begun in the early twentieth century. U.S. troops landed in September of 1994 to return Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. This action in the Caribbean was, unlike in Grenada, sanctioned by the UN. However, the decision to invade the country for the second time came about because of the Clinton administration’s concerns over a new wave of Haitian immigrants fleeing a military junta the United States placed in power in 1991. Giants sometimes reel drunkenly with the weight of their own power. This had been the case with the murky meddling of the United States in Haitian affairs. Although it was arguably a defense of democracy to return Aristide to power (and thus the UN sanction), the CIA had trained operatives in the Haitian security services to invalidate Aristide’s election in the first place. To bury the man, that a (once) top-secret report dismissed as “the leftist priest,” the agency created the false story that Aristide received “psychiatric treatment” in Canada. After the Clinton administration decided to deal with Aristide instead of the immigrants, CIA director R. James Woolsey had to explain away his agency’s campaign against the Haitian president-in-exile’s claims on live TV, all the while insisting that the CIA had done nothing wrong.16 The American empire’s continuing creation of zombie republics abroad seeded lethal repercussions at home. CIA assets engaged in trafficking cocaine did, as a matter of public record, help flood South Central and other American communities with drugs. CIA operatives received protection in Columbia, Honduras, and Panama in return for their help with the covert war in Nicaragua. When this fact is remembered at all, it’s disparaged as “urban folklore” about the CIA trying to destroy the Black community. CIA assets did not peddle crack on the corners, nor did they directly supply those who did. But any false conspiracy beliefs hide what the Los Angeles Times called “a different, but equally scandalous truth.” That is, the CIA couldn’t care less about how their actions on behalf of empire affected marginalized Americans while they struck deals with predators across Latin America.17 Martin Luther King Jr. said, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” Tensions in South Central LA exploded in the LA uprising of 1992, a response to the acquittal of police officers responsible for the vicious beating of Rodney King, a troubled guy with a drug problem who found himself alone on one of the shadowy battlefields of America’s war on crime. King’s beating received the most press attention as the trip wire for the sudden eruption of rage. What happened within weeks of the King incident has been too frequently ignored. A store owner in Koreatown shot the Black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins in the back of the head for allegedly attempting to shoplift a $1.79 bottle of juice. Harlins died almost immediately. The woman responsible received a suspended sentence and community service from a white judge. A week later, a Black male resident of Glendale received a tougher sentence from the same judge for kicking a dog. The eruption of anti-police riots left the ruins of South Central in flames and too many whites wondering, while being uninterested in learning, what the people who’d lived in South Central for generations were so damn angry about. Horror, like hip-hop, offered a language of anger. Yet mainstream critics often received efforts to tell the African American story through horror with contempt. Though now lauded as a classic that presaged work by Jordan Peele, Gerard McMurray, Lena Waithe, Nia DaCosta, and Little Marvin, Tales from the Hood (1995) was described by The New York Times as “crudely written and acted.” The reviewer dismissed its critique of American white supremacy as a “political cartoon.” Meanwhile, the Times described the silly white savior fantasy Bulworth, starring Warren Beatty learning to be comfortable saying a racial slur because the film gives him a Black love interest in Halle Berry, as “jubilant political satire” with “chutzpah.” White audiences ignored the tales from the hood, what their country continued to do to Haiti, and systemic efforts to control African American communities through militarist policing. However, it turned out many Americans did care about reliving 1950s alien invasion fantasies and the self-referential gaze of a horror film about horror films. 3.The Rules TWO HORROR films, radically different in their premises and approach and yet both shaped by the military interventions of the 1990s, suggested that Americans wanted to consume violence that catered to their worldview. In 1996, a new Wes Craven venture breathed a peculiar afterlife into the slasher film with Scream. The same year marked the arrival of the summer blockbuster Independence Day, an overstuffed explosion fest that constituted a remake of nearly every alien invasion horror of the 1950s and featured many of Hollywood’s major male stars of the nineties. Both films elicited the nostalgia that would soon become a defining feature of America’s culture industry. Scream became part of a flood tide of movies, and forms of entertainment more generally, that are both aware of their own origins and talk about them incessantly. Craven’s story of murders in a world where everyone knows about slasher films and endlessly references Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street earned the sobriquet meta. Now part of the slang of knowingness, it appeared first in classrooms and the academic cult of the postmodern. More thoughtful analysis attributed this style to postindustrial capitalism’s information economy tendency to script “metanarratives,” a critical mass of logorrhea that finally resulted in talking about the idea of talking about something. The popularity of the Seinfeld approach (“a show about nothing”) and the rise of young hipsters wearing nostalgic clothing or enjoying anachronistic hobbies “ironically” represent the less offensive results of these impulses. In this way of imagining pop culture, the relentless search for profit forged a style of production, advertising, distribution, and consumption that’s the cultural equivalent of a snake swallowing its own tail. The idea appears in simple forms like making sneakers that are self-aware of their status as cool sneakers or films that are conscious of the tropes they march toward audiences in orderly rows. The fascination with the remake and the reboot, though long an element in the history of film, reached market saturation in the early twentieth century. It’s an outlet in the arcades of modern life just adjacent to the nostalgia industry. You can purchase remakes of your memories and reboots of your dreams. Some in academia still take pride in postmodern theory that does little more than put simple, or sometimes demonstrably false, ideas in abstruse terms. But, while the emperor may appear without clothes in the classroom, it’s certainly true that movies about movies, movies that knew they were movies, held a special appeal to audiences as the century closed. In a decade of rising paranoia, it felt good to watch a horror film that let you in on the alleged “rules” of the genre. It gave the same frisson as what Kurt Andersen, in his 2017 book Fantasyland, calls “the X-Filing of America.” Moreover, for a generation that made Kurt Cobain’s discordant hymns of rage their soundtrack, the inescapable maze of violence and commentary on that violence suited their sense of helplessness, anger, and angst. Craven sensed this about the nineties just as he’d understood Freddy Krueger as the nightmare companion to the eighties American dream. The audacity of Craven’s approach remains startling. Scream spills enough blood that producer Bob Weinstein called in all his favors to prevent the box office poison of an NC-17 rating. Yet, unlike the grainy film stock most slasher fans had become inured to, Craven’s masterpiece has the high-gloss look that’s reminiscent of the decade’s self-consciously trashy thrillers (Basic Instinct, Wild Things) and high-concept action films (Total Recall, Starship Troopers). Courteney Cox, beloved by the tens of millions of fans of the sitcom Friends, played a major role along with David Arquette, Rose McGowan, and Neve Campbell. Recognizable names and faces, a cast of absurdly pretty people in which even extras appear to have walked out of an Abercrombie catalog, made the film’s nihilism and sheer bloodlust obsessively interesting to look at. Horror culture received an indelible mark from Scream. Directors could continue the work Alfred Hitchcock began with Psycho. They could force audiences to accept they were watching a film, that they would have to deal with unreliable narrators and see the seams in editing so that entire backstories stayed out of focus until the climax. Over the next decade the inability to know the full story helped create a whole genre of “whodunit horror,” and in some cases “what the hell just happened” horror, in films like The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, Hide and Seek, The Others, and the entire oeuvre of M. Night Shyamalan. Often seen as films that delivered surprise endings, they primarily offered surprise editing. David Fincher’s Fight Club (1999) and Mary Harron’s American Psycho (2000) probably represent the apotheosis of this effort, but Craven opened the final Hitchcockian door, letting audiences in on the secret that the camera had the power to edit the reality they experienced. Did Scream feature much political meaning? In some respects, the film’s only real interest is in itself. In this way, it’s a sheer expression of angst. The bundled anxiety at work in the film even appears in the costume designed for the murderous Ghostface. The totem eschews the blankness of the masks of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers and the open wound that passes for Freddy Krueger’s face and instead evokes the bleak wail of Edvard Munch’s 1893 masterpiece. My apolitical generation may have worried over its own anxiety and shown a tendency to go AWOL from reality, just as social commentary and films like Richard Linklater’s Slacker and Kevin Smith’s Clerks said they did. But the forces of the culture industry helped shape a tendency, easily mated with a love for false conspiracies, toward the gnostic belief that Gen X knew “the rules” of genre, that Craven’s genius in using an overused formula as an actual plot device could also mean that the formulaic could be enjoyed for its own sake. This attitude made MTV’s shamelessly entitled The Real World immensely popular and encouraged the post-Vietnam generation to believe, as had the youth of the roaring twenties, that they invented irony. Scream may have purposefully gazed at its own cinematic navel. But the cultural imperatives that made Craven’s work a hit have an unexamined relationship to Operation Desert Storm. A generation raised by parents who fought in Vietnam or watched it unfold over a decade’s worth of TV dinners and nightly newscasts watched the defeat of Iraq over forty-two days of pizza and beer. Their dawning awareness of current events and their hours playing PC games and Nintendo collided in a conflict often referred to as “the video game war.” A generation’s acquiescence may have appalled aging activists of the anti-war movement of the late 1960s. But Vietnam did not have Desert Storm’s public relations team or high production values. Throughout the twentieth century the U.S. government frequently sought to avoid showing Americans the ruined face of war. But there’s never been such obvious effort to show a false reality of combat as the first invasion of Iraq. The Pentagon carefully crafted palatable and triumphal images the new, content-hungry twenty-four-hour news cycle could release to the American public. Rather than young Americans uncertain of their fate, the public saw images of Patriot missiles striking targets reminiscent of a screenshot of the popular arcade game Missile Command. Only on one or two occasions did actual images seep through, often to suddenly disappear from both public memory and discussion. On February 13, 1991, two guided missiles struck a camouflaged civilian shelter and killed about five hundred people. Dick Cheney, then secretary of defense, declared that it was no mistake and that the shelter had been “plugged into Saddam’s communications network,” whatever that might mean. Even fewer Americans learned about the so-called Highway of Death, a convoy of thousands of retreating Iraqi vehicles bombed and strafed by A-6 Intruders, Apache helicopters, and all manner of American artillery. Perhaps as many as five hundred Iraqi soldiers died in what became more massacre than military operation. These images failed to compete with the satisfying competency of Patriot missiles knocking the dread Scud missiles out of the sky and CNN graphics, complete with sound effects, that entitled the round-the-clock coverage “Showdown in the Gulf.”18 Reality had been thoroughly redacted. Soon after the conflict, documentary film maker Ken Burns asked, rather plaintively, how an event can be remembered with so few photographs. Burns wrote with exasperation that the war seemed a series of “distracting theatrics,” staged in a way that we could see them as if “the war itself might be a wholly owned subsidiary of television.”19 In fact, not remembering the details became the point. The conflict could join the invasion of Grenada and the strike against Panama as a simple story of the last empire standing in the ruins of the twentieth century able to deliver a killing blow against any adversary. If the console game generation’s memory became dazed and confused, they could simply play Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf or the mentally disturbed 8-bit Storm Over the Desert, where tiny American tanks turn a gigantic Saddam Hussein into mush. Nintendo seemed to believe that this was, in fact, a video game war. A Gulf War veteran’s Game Boy (a handheld gaming device), melted into slag, appeared on display in Nintendo’s New York store in 2014. Scream assayed to give us a controllable formula for the slasher film. Americans also considered themselves well-versed in the rules of global slaughter. The extent to which this became true explains why America could become fascinated with a horror movie about horror movies. But even more Americans crowded into theaters to watch a star-spangled, big-budget adaptation of every alien invasion movie ever made. During a moment in the nineties when few Americans could tell you where their country currently intervened in the world, Independence Day opened to a one hundred-million-dollar week. 4.Let’s Nuke the Bastards “EVERY STATION’S making like it’s the 1950s,” exclaims a character in Roland Emmerich’s Independence Day. The line refers to TV screens around the world empty but for a snowstorm of stray signals, interference caused by alien invaders dickering with satellites. It’s also a nod to the film’s fifties roots, as are visual references like the one working television playing The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).20 Emmerich took some big risks. The seemingly invincible alien ships destroy all the major landmarks in Washington, D.C., from the Capitol Building to, in a shot that became iconic, the White House itself. In a dreadful presaging of events already in motion the year the film released, the shadow of the mothership stretches menacingly across the Twin Towers. Emmerich borrows these moments from the exceptionally well-done effects of Ray Harryhausen in Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), but the sensibilities of the 1990s and the post–Jurassic Park power of computer-generated imagery (CGI) made the effect startling.21 Audiences knew that the United States would strike back. American moviegoers brought to the film an attitude shaped by the triumphalism that came with the end of the Cold War and the utter humiliation of the Iraqi army, touted by the Pentagon in a weird reverse propaganda campaign as “the world’s third largest military.” The first act of the film reassures audiences of American prestige with establishing shots of patriotic images that we won’t see destroyed in the film, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Marine Corps War Memorial, and shots of crisp, rather outsized America flags snapping angrily in the wind. Most films that want to make the kind of box office numbers Independence Day did must offer a consensus narrative. That is, they can’t offer political diatribes for either the left or right. The heroic president played by Bill Pullman is presented to us as neither a Republican or Democrat, his youthful optimism and experience as a pilot in the Gulf War making him a mash-up of what people liked about Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush while transcending the many failings of both. Will Smith’s role as a Marine pilot seemed a quick salute to growing conversations about diversity even if there’s no allusion to racism in the film. Smith, extremely popular with white audiences for his accessible hip-hop and his sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, acts the role of the top gun who helps save the day. The film’s producers never even considered Chuck D, Ice Cube, or anyone that signified real political meaning in Black culture. In fact, white actor Ethan Hawke was the only other star in the running. Even UFO conspiracy buffs found something in the film for them, as we inevitably go back to Roswell (the latest round of books on the topic had just appeared) to learn that the government cover-up was real and that the alien ship captured in the fifties will help America carry out the president’s wish to “nuke the bastards.” Cover-ups are important and maybe keeping the American public out of the loop wasn’t right but, hey, at least it saved America (and, of course, prevented a mass extinction event). Two aspects of Independence Day made it especially appealing in the aftermath of the Gulf War. In a reiteration of audience expectations shaped by the video game war of 1991, the film celebrated the American military but, visually and in dialogue, put more focus on America’s hardware, much as the Patriot missiles became the heroes in the war with Iraq. There are some American heroes on screen but, as with the Gulf War, they are never detached from their weapons of mass destruction. F-18 fighters, tactical nuclear weapons, stealth bombers, helicopter gunships, and even an early allusion to cyber warfare . . . almost all weapons Americans had met and applauded in the “crisis in the Gulf” are rolled out in Independence Day. Mimicking CNN, the film shows attacks on the aliens on the same green-hued night-vision screens that created what looked like, but wasn’t, a bloodless fireworks show over Baghdad. Second, the film’s use of the terminology and American mentality of the Gulf War goes far beyond these cues. Independence Day helped shape the summer blockbuster’s penchant for catastrophic yet bloodless violence. Emmerich’s catastroflick includes an unhinged moment in which the president’s chief military advisor assures him that a plan to explode nuclear missiles all over the United States to take out the invaders is basically sound. The cities have all been deserted, he tells the president, and confidently announces that “civilian casualties should be down to a minimum.” There’s nothing in the film that breaks the spell by questioning this bullshit. Finally, George H. W. Bush’s feeling that the Vietnam Syndrome had been “kicked” gets a troubling reiteration in Independence Day. Randy Quaid plays Casse, an alcoholic and generally clownish veteran of Vietnam. Volunteering to fly against the alien ships in one final effort to “nuke the bastards,” Casse announces, in a sepulchral-sounding echo of his generation’s disastrous war, “Hello, boys, I’m back.” He sacrifices himself to save Gen X and their children, a deeply cruel suggestion that perhaps he should have made such a noble sacrifice in Southeast Asia thirty years before. Independence Day represented slack-jawed awe at American military power, at times evoking some of the worst angels of our nature, and joined an established cinematic tradition of portraying Vietnam veterans as troubled, dangerous, and disposable (The Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Rambo: First Blood). Independence Day outdid Forrest Gump in both ticket sales and its indifference to the wounds it reopened and the ideas it celebrated. Horror science fiction in American culture soon took new and more interesting turns, asking some of the philosophical questions Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke offered in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Soviet science fiction pondered for decades (Solaris, 1972). American sci-fi horror turned toward political satire that held a frightening mirror to America’s role in the real world (Annihilation, Arrival, District 9, Sunshine, Moon). These films avoided simplistic tales of aliens as marauding invaders or peaceful “space brothers.” This change owed a lot, more than has been credited, to a director known for over-the-top films that made exploitation mainstream and a satirical reading of a Robert A. Heinlein classic the late grand master had meant with deadly seriousness. 5.Very Pretty Space Fascists DUTCH DIRECTOR Paul Verhoeven believes strongly in using violence in film. In his view, a refusal to show violence did more to inure the public to real-world violence than hiding what the mangled and dead human form looked like. He once told James Cameron that whenever a filmmaker suggested his work “too violent,” he told them their movies probably “weren’t violent enough.” Verhoeven had blended graphic sex with over-the-top mayhem and served it with slapdash social commentary since the 1970s. The nineties seem the decade American cinema was ready for him . . . sort of. Basic Instinct (1992) did become a (kind of) cultural touchstone, setting off a craze for neo-noir psychosexual thrillers—Alfred Hitchcock meets the grind house. The director’s Showgirls (1995) became a touchstone of a different kind, a schlocky farrago of a movie that won seven of the satirical Golden Raspberry Awards given for “the worst films of the year.” Subsequently, the film won some grudging respect for its willful banality, its intentionally superficial obsession with Vegas glitz, bad music, and sentimental outbursts. What film critic Naveen Kumar calls the “deliberate mess” of the film echoed the vacuity of nineties white American culture. Verhoeven’s post-Showgirls decision to adapt Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers may seem highly peculiar. Actually, it made perfect sense. Graphic violence must play a role in any nod to Heinlein’s orgiastic celebration of patriotic genocide, fulfilling the 1950s cinematic traditional assumption that the alien must be destroyed and that a scientific and military elite could band together to do it. These are the “rules” that Verhoeven followed but, perhaps more diligently than Wes Craven in Scream, he subverted these prescriptions. What if, he wondered, I made a sci-fi movie about “fascists who aren’t aware of their fascism”?22 Starship Troopers did for shoot-’em-up science fiction what Scream did for slasher films. Verhoeven saw in Heinlein’s work exactly what Heinlein wanted his readers to see in 1959, a message about discipline, violence, and the glories of a militarized state. Verhoeven, too bored by Heinlein’s novel to finish it, combined that message with his own experience as a youth in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and his belief that militarism seeped into the groundwater of American entertainment, opinion, and corporate power. The result is a film in which the characters feel empty because they are. The monsters are silly because the real monsters are the young, lovely, unthinking death dealers who never question orders or even question why they are not questioning orders. The enemies that Earth has long been at war with for reasons that remain unclear are the Bugs. This designation recalls American racist tropes directed at Japanese soldiers that, combined with the Japanese sense of their own cultural superiority, created the utter savagery of the Pacific War. The exposition we receive that frames the film, videos posted on some future version of the internet, are Big Brother fireside chats presented in a soothing male AI voice. Indeed, the point seems to be that fascism will come in such a pleasantly instructive fashion that you’ll barely feel the boot in your face forever. Roger Ebert complained that Verhoeven created “the most violent kiddie movie ever made.” He does admit the film contains some “sly satire” but found it off-putting that the main characters seem unable to reflect on why they are at war with the Bugs and appear “soulless.” He then makes what could only be described as an invidious comparison to George Lucas’s universe, certainly a poor juxtaposition not only because they are very different films but because the bad guys in the Star Wars universe are barely disguised fascists themselves.23 One of America’s most respected critics missed that Verhoeven wanted to play it straight in hopes of making audiences appalled at the film’s attractive heroes who unthinkingly accept the violent logic of fascism. The actors are carved out of the shiny polymer of youthful sexuality and include the nineties platonic ideal of male heteronormative fantasy, Denise Richards. These pretty space Nazis remain secure in their rancid xenophobia, utter devotion to the state, and passion for violence to the very end. Perhaps the film’s time simply had not come. David Roth wrote about the cult classic for The New Yorker in 2020 and noted that the theme of endless and indecisive war describes the last two decades of American life. Critic Phil Coldiron called it “one of the greatest of all anti-imperialist films.” Calum Marsh described the film in the November 2013 issue of The Atlantic as undermining Heinlein’s “saber-rattling” with “archetypes on loan from teen soaps and young-adult fiction.” Verhoeven’s satire remains controversial with science fiction and horror fans. The director used a machete to dig into the divided mind of sci-fi, a violent corpus callosotomy that left synapses dangling but still vibrating painfully. Heinlein defenders saw the film as a betrayal. They failed to recognize that Verhoeven’s parody worked because he took the book literally. Another arguably much larger group of fans knew exactly what the film did and grew up with a sense that sci-fi could wield the chain saw too. 6.Unadorned Butchery THE HORROR of a war without meaning against monsters of our own making had been examined by Joe Haldeman in The Forever War. Like so many Vietnam veterans, Haldeman felt no desire to go to war. A pacifist, he had been studying at the University of Maryland pursuing his twin interests in physics and astronomy, disciplines to which he’d later add an MFA. His interest in creative writing baffled his professors, who urged him to take more courses in advanced differential equations. Telling them he had an interest only in “garden variety differential equations,” he did some of his first writing and published a story later adapted by the eighties Twilight Zone reboot. After graduating in 1967, he was drafted to serve as a combat engineer. His family was in Montreal when his Selective Service notice arrived. He and his wife discussed staying in Canada, moving to Sweden, or possibly even accepting a prison sentence. He decided against these options because of a lifelong dream of working for NASA that resisting the draft would destroy. He said he always wanted “to be a spaceman.”24 Haldeman would never achieve this in a literal sense, and he probably knew that as he dropped into a so-called hot LZ (a landing zone under fire). The author remembers forgetting everything he thought he’d learned from war movies and simply running in the direction he heard English being spoken. But he mostly recalled the smell of the dead. Like veterans of every industrialized mass murder of the last century, his memory became a cubist painting that ignored linear space and insisted that the eye read its surroundings as one simultaneous explosion of visual excess. Haldeman’s own synesthesia of violence included the smell of nearby bodies that he would forever associate with roadkill and noticing the way that one of the corpse’s feet twisted at uncomfortable-looking angles. It would not be Haldeman’s last experience with the dead stacked after combat. The pacifist left Vietnam with a Purple Heart and an even stronger distaste, if deeper understanding, of military adventurism. The Forever War became the science fiction classic Haldeman ensorcelled from the chaos of his experience. First published in 1974, it won essentially every single award for achievement in science fiction. It told a story recognizable to readers of Robert A. Heinlein but one that drew very different conclusions. Private William Mandella shares the same fictional DNA as Heinlein’s space marines but fights with an awareness that he knows little about Earth’s Tauran enemies other than the fact that they must be destroyed. He calls the first encounter he takes part in “murder, unadorned butchery . . . We had just herded them up and slaughtered them.” By the end of the novel, we learn that Earth’s military industrial complex fought what becomes a thousand-year conflict because a militarized society promised big defense contracts. At some point over the centuries, not unlike the illogic of the American empire, the economy simply became a war economy. Life without the war became unimaginable.25 Haldeman has called his work “social satire” but disavowed the idea of being a sci-fi prophet. In the late 1990s, he wrote a follow-up to The Forever War, a much more optimistic and even spiritual work called Forever Peace. It never received the recognition of his earlier work, perhaps because he had, in fact, been too much of a prophet. Discussions of a war without end waged for confusing reasons opened the American empire’s new century. 7.Apocalypse, Right Now HOPEFUL PROPHETS of the 1990s promised “the end of history.” This chilling phrase actually expressed some of the more optimistic assertions about the post–Cold War world, particularly the belief that free markets and democracy would work in tandem to end ethnic conflict and political authoritarianism. R.E.M.’s anthem “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” seemed like the cue music for the whole decade. But not everyone was so sure or felt especially fine. Horror certainly took an apocalyptic turn. Independence Day played with the idea, but so did films of mass destruction like Deep Impact (1998) and the straightforwardly named Armageddon (1998). Both films imagined destruction on a global scale. Deep Impact, about a meteor creating an extinction-level event that wipes out the East Coast of the United States, showed viewers images of the leveling of cities that horror films, traditional disaster movies, and even superhero franchises soon made a commonplace of cineplex entertainment. Such images battered us so incessantly after 9/11 that Village Voice film critic Bilge Ebiri could say of the unending flood tide of CGI catastrophe, “It’s the end of the world as we know it—and I feel tired.”26 Roland Emmerich, meanwhile, parlayed the success of Independence Day to direct what he hoped would become the ultimate monster disaster film, a nineties iteration of Godzilla for American audiences. The 1954 classic imagined a creature of primeval history roused from the seabed by American nuclear tests. Japan, the target of the only atomic weapon attacks in history, must suffer again at the hands of a monster created by Americans. That version of the story disappears in Emmerich’s hot take. It’s an illegal test by the French government that awakens the creature, making the United States, with its world-destroying nuclear arsenal, a victim of European maleficence when the creature finally makes its way to American shores. Cue massive explosions and catastrophic destruction, violence both impossible to comprehend in scale yet bloodless in representation. After all’s said and done, the United States wins big. While apoco-disasters in the form of dread cosmic events or monsters rising out of the sea increasingly invested in more and more entertainment real estate, religious fears reminiscent of the satanic panic continued to thrive in the decade. Omen IV appeared and a reboot of the original Omen, slightly updated, went into the works. Demonic children proliferated at an alarming rate, some of them born to become the Antichrist. End of Days, The Devil’s Advocate, and Bless the Child appeared, or went into production, in the late nineties and all shared the basic theme of the devil’s interest in destroying the world. These films reflected the enormous popularity of the Left Behind series, a set of novels that attempted to dramatize the evangelical conception of the end of time using the techno-thriller tricks and tropes of a Tom Clancy tale. Like Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth in the seventies, the books had a reach and a popularity that went far outside the fold of the faithful. The series became a franchise worth hundreds of millions of dollars with films, PC games, and spin-off series in its train. This all seems a bleak side to the promises of nineties cultural functionaries that the world would be shinier and happier. But the fascination with the world’s end, often more stridently asserted and deeply feared than the very real apocalyptic possibilities of the passé Cold War, emerged from roots in the growing divide in American culture. Political, economic, and even cultural power ballooned to such proportions since 1945, and in some respects since 1918, that individuals felt little sense of autonomy and agency. Political apathy abounded while, by the beginning of the twenty-first century, consumption driven by massive debt and inflated real estate equity reached levels unprecedented in human history. The nineties, more than any other decade, encapsulates the disempowerment of Americans, their role as walk-on extras in Theodor Adorno’s “monster documentary.” End-times fiction shared the assumption that most people are either unaware or incapable of dealing with the real horror of the time. Social movements and the organizations that hardwired them went into decline. Voting rates continued a decade-long slide. By 1994, only about a third of eligible voters went to the polls for the midterm elections. In 1996, less than half of registered voters bothered with the presidential contest. Things would probably be fine.27 Five years later, when explosions shook the ground and bodies floated down from the sky as dust and ash, some Americans felt like they were in a movie, or at least watching one. Minutes after the second aircraft slammed into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, devastated eyewitnesses could only say, “It looks like a movie!” The scriptwriter of Armageddon found that the footage of the attack, so similar to the film, gave him “the creeps,” and the director of Die Hard reflected with horror that it looked like one of his movie posters.28 The America that woke up on September 12, 2001, wanted to see itself as a profoundly different epoch, see the change in date as more than simple chronology, chronos, but an emergence of the Greek concept of kairos, ripe time, deep time, time bursting open with meaning, a crack in the geological strata of history that demanded decisive action. Commentators went so far as to suggest that human communication would have to do without irony after the experience. Others suggested that good and evil as categories had come back (as if they’d ever gone away). American culture would be “Rockwellian” again, a reference to the maudlin paintings of Norman Rockwell that featured happy and humorous scenes of a bygone, very white America of soda fountains and sentimental references to family, church, childhood, and dogs. Horror would rip the stitches off this attempt at cultural revanchism. Films that dealt directly with 9/11 failed at the box office. Meanwhile, some of the goriest, most disturbing, and intentionally subversive horror films ever made began to, as Victoria McCollum wrote, engage politics to such a degree that they “vigorously [pummeled] at the audience’s skull with the viciousness of each new atrocity.”29 Eli Roth’s Hostel (2005) generally gets slated into the category of “torture porn,” a phrase so gruesome it seems to have a bad odor wafting out of it. Hostel is much more than this though, a film that, like James Wan’s Saw franchise, sponged up the era’s paranoia and fed it back to audiences as a hellbroth. At a moment when American culture could actually conduct a public debate about the legality of torturing suspected terrorists, suspected accomplices of terrorists, and people suspected to know something about terrorists and their accomplices, the film stripped audiences of their sympathy for young, pretty Americans abroad who themselves became targets of torture. Whatever you think of the ethics of such a gory display, it’s impossible to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of the boundary-busting film. Dominick Suzanne-Mayer wrote in 2016 that Hostel became a hit with millennials like himself, as it seemed to fit the bizarre tone of the times when “Lee Greenwood’s ‘Proud to Be an American’ could be piped in over crackling junior high school PA systems for months on end, daily, and nobody ever really stopped to interrogate how surreal the whole thing was.”30 Audiences walked away from Roth’s disturbing masterpiece with complex feelings about what they had seen. Foreign places are dangerous, un-American, and to be disdained. Yet the film also conveyed the sense that the Americans who walked around like they owned these places got everything they deserved. Suzanne-Mayer says this may have been little more than the feeling that “the rest of the world is scary, huh?,” but this at least left more space for rumination than the president of the United States saying things like, “I’m amazed that . . . people would hate us. I, like most Americans, I just can’t believe it, because I know how good we are.”31 Horror increasingly made the point that we had little to brag about. Films such as Rob Zombie’s The Devil’s Rejects (2005) not only questioned American exceptionalism, they suggested the worst of us maybe understood the world we’d made much better than the millions who bought a Toby Keith CD to hear him serenade the globe with lyrics like, “we’ll put a boot in your ass / It’s the American way.” The Devil’s Rejects follows up Zombie’s macabre blood carnival of a tribute to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre called House of 1000 Corpses. But Rejects stands on its own in many respects, part outlaw western and part thrill-kill horror. The Firefly family are the Manson commune if “the Family” actually cared about one another. Indeed, the character Otis makes use of Tex Watson’s LSD-induced proclamation “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business” during one nearly unwatchable sequence. It’s so truly violent that it’s a difficult film to endure with some especially egregious scenes that the actors and Zombie himself struggled to film. The whole thing seemed to make critics feel dirty. Reviewers rattled away at their keyboards in a blood-vessel-popping rage about the film’s nihilism in a nation that, only a year before, looked at images of physical and sexual torture from Abu Ghraib prison, where American soldiers had done something witchy with detainees. It’s more of a commentary on America than the film itself that critics could suggest that The Devil’s Rejects had no social and cultural meaning because of its “sickening, socially irresponsible glorification of depraved and sadistic behavior.” Had they been keeping up with the news? Did they know that the image of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi standing hooded on a box, electric wires inserted all over his body, arms extended as if in preparation for crucifixion, went from confrontation with human evil to an offensive meme on American social media platforms within days? Zombie could have replied to critics with the words of his idol Tobe Hooper, “it’s really about America.”32 “Sickening” films like The Devil’s Rejects offered a way to speak about what had become of America’s imperial endeavors at a time when the public square demanded consensus and obedient acceptance to the oddly named “war on terror.” Roth and Zombie offered relief from relentless images of America as victim and vengeful crusader. This construction of the world allowed for the unspoken assumptions of American power since 1945 to become fully public. Hours after the September 11 attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent a memo to aides that proclaimed it time to “go massive—sweep it all up, things related and not.” The attempt to twist the world completely to American wishes defined the next two decades of American life.33 8.Al-Qaedzilla THE TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY American empire made no excuses. Bush said it out loud, telling a graduating class at West Point that the United States must always remain “ready for preemptive action” against “unbalanced dictators.” This enthusiasm for unilateral invasion became the so-called Bush Doctrine, the assurance that the United States would take military action against any power in the world that might threaten the American order of things. War became, as Mark Danner describes it in his important book Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War, “unbounded in space and time.”34 The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have proven disastrous. Perhaps as many as two hundred thousand civilians have been killed in Iraq alone. “Regime change” created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of ISIS and the intervention of Russia on behalf of Syria’s brutal Assad regime. The dead zone of Iraq has strengthened the hand of Saudi Arabia, arguably the world’s most repressive regime, an autocratic monarchy with economic and territorial ambitions that has successfully linked itself to the United States. The withdrawal from Afghanistan fulfilled an agreement with the Taliban made by President Trump in February 2020. Most Americans are unaware that U.S. troops continue to dominate much of the Middle East with no fewer than twenty-three air and naval bases and an unknown number of “black sites” maintained by the CIA in the former Soviet republics. Some of these bases are like small, heavily armed American cities. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar hosts eleven thousand U.S. troops, ensures near total dominance of airspace across most of the region, and features amenities that include two movie theaters, a huge swimming pool, most major American fast-food chains, and lounges with names like the Kasbah, the Zink, and the Fox Sports Skybox. Like Fort Laramie in the nineteenth century and Guantanamo Bay in the twentieth, Al Udeid announces that America is here to stay.35 America would kill all the monsters that threatened “the homeland.” Horror films sometimes attended to the need to assure the public this was so. As a filmmaker, Steven Spielberg was always eager to comfort the zeitgeist. Since Jaws he has been frightening Americans to make them feel better, producing films that even massaged dire historical realities into buddy movies and family dramas. Alien invasions became friends visiting from the stars. Schindler’s List allowed the Holocaust, as critic Akiva Gottlieb put it, to be told in a story about a “Nazi who has a change of heart.”36 War of the Worlds (2005) continued this pattern amid a ruined landscape that magnified the destruction of 9/11 beyond all imagining. And yet, Spielberg ends the film with a virus ex machina that kills the aliens. J. J. Abrams’s Cloverfield (2008) also told a tale of mass destruction by an enormous but shadowy horror. The Village Voice noted that the film’s avalanche of ruin could have come “from the CNN archive,” an attack from what the reviewer snarkily called “al-Qaedzilla.” America the allegedly indomitable had come under the attack of nameless, faceless, and vague entities. No one who watches the carnage of Spielberg’s aliens or Abrams’s kaiju worries about “blowback.” There’s no cause, we are the victims, they must hate our freedoms, and nothing but apathy and hoping for the best can be done. 9.Ghosting in Spook Country THE CONTOURS of empire may not have changed that much in the twenty-first century. But the ways in which the United States defended its global system did. As journalist and historian Nick Turse writes, the State Department, presidential administrations, and even political candidates have bragged for years about the cyber warfare capabilities of the United States. Turse describes “the military’s secret military,” the enormous, and growing, phenomenon of cyber warfare units, drone bases, and special forces.37 William Gibson’s Spook Country (2007) may be the only kind of spy novel that matters in the age of imperial cyberspace. Dead drops and the occasional GRU assassination might still make news, but the world of espionage could no longer exist without a humming digital homunculus, a hive of hundreds of millions occupying almost every single gigabyte of technology’s white zones. A simple phone conversation by Gibson’s protagonist summons possibilities more chilling than “the call is coming from inside the house” analog terror of When a Stranger Calls. Sitting in a Starbucks, she is “afraid to trust her own phone and the net stretching out from it, strung through those creepy fake trees . . . the net of telephony, all digitized, and all, she had to suppose, listened to.” Cloaks and daggers had been replaced by bots and malware. The attacks of 9/11 transmogrified the heady predictions of life online from dreams of an interconnected world to a nightmare of illusion, surveillance, and loss of self. Independence Day gave us the new notion of computer viruses imagined as the key to defeating an alien invasion. When the film launched in 1996, only a little over 30 percent of American households featured a personal computer. A decade later, the danger of viruses to everything from bank accounts to political stability became a common problem, so common it did not always receive the public discussion it deserved. Unless you bricked your computer in 2007 by opening a file that claimed to be a breaking news story, you may not remember Storm Worm. Originating in Russia, Storm Worm compromised ten million personal computers in six months. The email subject lines that duped computer users are themes from the darkest fantasies of the internet, including “British Muslims Genocide” or “Radical Muslim drinking enemies’ blood!” Even the more mundane subject lines the virus used, like “Re: Your text” proved impossible to ignore. The subject line appeared utterly chilling in an age when relationships and careers could end with ill-considered words typed into the ether. Ghost has become a common verb in America’s online vocabulary. Drawn from the idea of a spirit world where restless souls appear and then wink out into the black, to be ghosted means that another person has disappeared from your life—messages unread, texts unreturned, and the seeming community of social media a false front behind which lies a vast ruin. Family, friends, and romantic partners can all ghost, can become hidden from sight in the disconnections of digital interfaces. You can be “unfriended” in an almost ritualistic manner, a combination of public shaming and sacral excommunication. The psychological costs are impossible to tabulate in such an online world where relationships of all kinds can acquire a surprising intensity only to vanish and become weightless, shadows with no mass or circumference. We use the language of horror to describe the connections we hope never to make in the interconnected world. There are those who become ghosts, leaving behind nothing but strange half memories in a deleted files folder. Or we might also face a troll lying in wait beneath the virtual infrastructure of the web. These encounters can range in viciousness from nasty snark aimed at strangers to bullying, stalking, and attempting to destroy another person’s finances or reputation. Although tales from old salts on the cyber sea are rare, and unconfirmed, the idea of “mermaiding” suggests wily women out to use their siren song, by which I mean the offer of nude pics, to monetize their social media accounts. The fear of this possibility draws on the horror of the sea creature cuteified beyond recognition but taken back to its frightening roots in films like Night Tide (1963) and Robert Eggers’s The Lighthouse (2019). You can even meet a zombie online, or at least someone can zombie you. In a peculiar reenactment of the Freudian horror of “the return of the repressed,” romantic attachments gone missing in the digital ossuary suddenly reappear. Perhaps having ghosted you before, they suddenly return to frightful life, wanting to recreate some virtual version of a past connection, a dead thing living inside the synthezoid brain of your hard drive. People have always abandoned one another. Ghosting could, at one time, simply mean refusing to pick up the phone. But there are very real differences, largely shaped by the ease of online contact. A feeling of freedom, of anonymity, of the sense that it’s your gothic double that acts for you in online interactions, allows for a sense of weightlessness to relationships, that they are ephemeral and ethereal. This offers a heady brew for people hungry for, and afraid of, intimacy. It’s the absolute desiderata for sociopaths. But are the intricacies of human relationships really damaged on a large scale by such behavior? After many discussions of online life “eroding empathy” or the dangers of “screen time,” are we more likely to objectify people now rather than earlier periods when economic elites grew fat off of World War I or the Industrial Revolution? Genocide had become a method of state-building long before the personal computer, much less social media. There’s not a clear answer, yet, to whether personal devices have rewired our brains in a “post-human,” or maybe sub-human, experience of the world. But we do know the digital world of ghosts and zombies have affected social institutions and political consciousness. Meeting up with a troll or a mermaid online could have terrifying personal consequences. But cyber life’s uncanny mixture of solitude and intimacy, connections with people that appear to have depth but can be brutally voided in a text or DM, and its ability to make fantasy into a hyperreality have very real implications for the United States as both a nation-state and an empire. The titans who have made vast fortunes and exert extraordinary power over much of the world’s resources implicitly understand that the digital world has become empire’s new frontier. Even the games we play carry this lethal message. 10.Zombie Black Ops UNRELENTING HORDES march from all directions. They are an unstoppable threat to American power. In fact, you will die trying to kill them. There’s not a way to win and you know the endless army of the dead will take you. This does not describe a particular scenario in the revival of the zombie apocalypse film after 9/11, a renaissance that included an aging George A. Romero doing some of his best work since the seventies. Instead, it’s the most popular gaming mode of the Call of Duty series, a cultural phenomenon since 2003. Beginning with a popular first-person shooter (FPS) approach to World War II, Activision updated the game almost every single year since its inception. The zombie mode has appeared in almost every new version of the game, players sometimes staging minor online revolts against the developers when they don’t receive it. The insistence on supernatural zombies and horror film scenarios in what has over the years aimed at being in other respects a stomach-churningly realistic military simulation seems to require some explanation. We could chalk it up to the sheer popularity of zombie films, novels, TV shows, and comics in the twenty-first century. Does putting a military shooter together with zombies simply represent peanut butter and chocolate logic, the simple math that two things we like are better than one? Maybe. But only if Call of Duty had not become the most egregious example of what at least one scholar has called “games of empire.” It’s a series designed to reenact, and ruthlessly celebrate, the extension of American power all over the globe. The killing of monsters, by the hundreds and even by the thousands, has become the game’s trademark. So has a devotion to give an outlet for one set of political views, redacting history to explain away imperial maleficence. The use of horror, especially in the unstoppable waves of the undead, assumes a frightening role in the real world of empire.38 Gaming might appear very far removed from the realities of political and ethical life. You will find a troll or two in online gaming, a stranger who deems you a “noob” and expresses some profane opinions about your mother’s morality and their supposed overfamiliarity with her. But there’s more happening than the occasional ill-natured gamer, including the serious matter of cyberbullying. Beyond these interpersonal cruelties, gaming online has often acted as manservant to the aims of empire, an infomercial for some of the worst ideological assumptions in American life. Resident Evil became, in the late twentieth century and continuing to today, the most popular survival horror franchise and one of the most popular console and PC games period. Spawning nine films and sixteen games (depending on how you count the various remakes, reboots, and episodic content), it gave players a way to live out their apocalyptic zombie fantasies while introducing some real-world ideas including biological weapons, corporate maleficence, and the American government’s addiction to weapons of mass destruction. In the original title, produced in Japan in 1996, the evil Umbrella Corporation produced the bioweapon known as the T-virus for its major client, the U.S. government. The T-virus outbreak in the ludicrously named town of Raccoon City leads to a missile strike that annihilates the zombified town in an homage to Romero’s critique of corporate and government villainy in his film The Crazies (1973). Subsequently, the series frequently celebrates American military power. Heroic special forces units are dispatched later in the series to deal with outbreaks. In the 2009 game Resident Evil 5, a heavily stylized “Africa” becomes another foreign geography in which square-jawed white Americans (in this case a government agent named Chris who mingles frat boy Aryanism with a linebacker physique) fight off hordes of enmonstered African bodies hurled against them, an update of some nineteenth-century colonial stand-off in Sudan or South Africa. The imperial assumptions of the game take us back to the racism of the Hollywood “jungle adventure.” Like the zombie republics imagined by Hollywood throughout the last hundred years, the gamer visits an ill-defined and homogenized Africa, an unnamed state that geographically appears sub-Saharan and politically recently gained independence from its colonial rulers. The latter point seems important in the game only because it can inject into the narrative the idea of African nations being unable to care for themselves and in need of a living action figure like Chris, whose military skill set serves a bizarre trinity of global powers. Chris is a well-armed agent of, I kid you not, the U.S. government, the UN, and the American pharmaceutical industry. Resident Evil 5 appeared at a time when the United States took an increased interest in numerous African nations. Since the end of the Cold War, and the end of widespread Soviet and Cuban influence in much of the continent, America sought to flex its muscles. Under Clinton, the United States offered economic incentives to countries with “a market-based economy that protects private property rights.” Neoliberal think tanks developed an economic and political Geiger counter that used seventeen different indicators that would allow an African nation a favorable trade relationship with the United States. Some of these indicators sound benign and even idealistic, like “political pluralism” and “equal protection under the law.” Other mandates the United States sought to impose are far less disinterested, including “the elimination of barriers to United States trade and investment” as well as a much more generalized demand that no participating nation “engage in activities that undermine United States national security or foreign policy interests.”39 In the early years of the Obama administration, American operations in Africa sent thousands of highly trained Chrises all over the continent through the auspices of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The interservice effort, born in the 1980s, has become integral to uniting all the country’s covert war-fighting capabilities. Operating with no regard to international boundaries and cooperating with agencies that include the CIA, the NSA, and even the FBI, members of SEAL Team Six and Delta Force have killed or kidnapped alleged terrorists with impunity. Journalist Jeremy Scahill in his book Dirty Wars insists that the Obama administration “let JSOC off the leash” in a way that the Bush administration never did. The lack of oversight built into the interagency effort made removing the harness from the dogs of war no more complicated than the stroke of a pen.40 In the dirty wars of the twenty-first century, Call of Duty has a popularity even beyond Resident Evil. Its zombie component makes it something of a survival horror game that also assures players of the power and virtue of the American empire. Once the early games moved beyond the era of World War II, they increasingly focused on the geopolitical present in the “Modern Warfare” series. The premise of Call of Duty, particularly in its “Black Ops” iteration, has been that the protection of ill-defined American interests requires extralegal action and what we might call a broad sense of morality. In other words, a legitimation for how the American empire already behaves. In 2020, Call of Duty made more explicit claims for its real-world relevance in Black Ops Cold War. Using the tag line “Know your history,” the game received criticism for its triumphalist take on America in the Cold War. In its single-player story line, the narrative bundles the Reagan administration’s support for Latin American death squads and the highly illegal Iran-Contra arms pipeline into a realpolitik of “saving the free world.”41 If you don’t get the message, Ronald Reagan appears in the game to reassure you, the late president eerily rendered so that his recognizable voice seems to echo to you, a lonely cowboy dirge carried by the winds across the uncanny valley. Reagan not only grants immense levels of moral latitude to the players, the dead president’s avatar explains to the devoted player that he has been the one to set his imprimatur on the many past adventures of the Black Ops team. “You have been given a great task,” Reagan’s avuncular tone explains, “protecting our very way of life from a great evil.” This sounds like a Reagan remix, his language about empires of evil and the threat of the Soviet Union laid across the repetitive bass beat of a utopian conception of free markets. But Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War pumps up the volume. It offers a platform to an eighties conspiracy theorist who has played such an important role in forming the idea of alt-right that extremist YouTubers have celebrated his appearance in the game.42 Yuri Bezmenov defected from the Soviet Union in the early seventies. Working for a time for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he became best known for publications in the 1980s of various books supposedly outlining the KGB’s interest in so-called active measures that destabilize the culture and the economy. Obviously, most espionage services engage in such actions. But Bezmenov used this truism to make an argument about American domestic politics. He suggested that the Soviets favored the support of feminism and the civil rights struggle to damage their enemy from within. In a 1984 interview, Bezmenov insisted that “hippies” represented rot from within that would prepare the way for a real-world Red Dawn. He railed against the strides for what he called “civil rights for homosexuals,” a movement that gathered power in the eighties but that Bezmenov insisted the KGB crafted to distract the American public. He classed both feminism and the civil rights movements as American failings that the KGB could use to “soften up” the country.43 A redacted version of this interview appears in the teaser for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Also featured are scenes of social unrest that are given no political context. It’s a bizarre commercial for the game to include given the source, especially when there’s really no lack of strident anti-communist speeches from the likes of Churchill, JFK, and Reagan himself. So why choose a right-wing star to narrate the alleged “unrest” of the eighties? Call of Duty developers have a history of building bridges with the far right. In 2014, they enlisted Oliver North as a consultant for the game Black Ops II and featured him as a voice actor playing himself in a segment of the game. North also appeared in an infomercial for the game that adopts the tone of a documentary, in which the disgraced Marine lieutenant colonel worries about a future in which “America’s enemies” use its own high-tech weapons against it. This seems shameless given North’s role in, and conviction for, selling American weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to guerillas in Nicaragua. Shameless and yet also entirely inductive given the peculiar role that Call of Duty has played in relation to the internal life of the American military. Since the beginning of the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, the army has worked actively with military FPS games to use them as tools for recruitment. In 2014, Dave Anthony, a writer for the Call of Duty series, left his job in the video game industry to become a consultant at the Pentagon in order to encourage, in his own words, “outside-the-box thinking.” One example of such thinking is his suggestion that covert ops groups go in deep cover at American high schools in order to prevent terrorist attacks. The Pentagon returned the favor and built a beneficial relationship with game developers. The Pentagon allowed members of SEAL Team Six to provide consultation and even write dialogue for Call of Duty.44 And the zombies keep coming. In the context of what Roger Stahl has called “militainment,” the zombies might feel like an afterthought. In fact, they replicate Call of Duty’s basic premise: the American nation-state must employ overwhelming force of all kinds, legitimize any violence, and generally stride the world as a colossus because America’s enemies surge in overwhelming hordes. There’s no way to finally “win” the enormously popular zombie maps. The player must face wave after wave of the undead, finally succumbing. The point, as with the whole franchise, is to rack up body count. Call of Duty’s most popular mode of play easily slides into the real-world aspects of the game. It’s all zombie mode in a way, indiscriminate slaughter in which “saving the free world” and “keeping America safe” are the only rules of engagement. The game instructs its players that the monsters will keep shambling toward you and you have to keep killing them. It’s Bill Clinton’s Operation Infinite Reach, George W. Bush’s Operation Infinite Justice, or more simply Joe Haldeman’s idea of “a forever war.” There’s no conceivable endgame. How could the American empire eliminate evil, particularly with evil understood as destroying every possible challenge to American power? The zombies that stumble toward us forever in Call of Duty are there to shoot, their mindlessness reflecting the equally thought-free logic of FPS games. The games not only give legitimacy to empire’s crimes, they encourage players to see the world the way an empire sees it. The U.S. military fought for the United Fruit Company, to enforce free market principles on global trade, and to control the flow of petroleum from Latin America, the Middle East, and the Caspian Sea. But, at a certain point, all these individual goals transformed into a single unending struggle for American dominance. Defense contractors, politicians, and average Americans came to believe they are fighting enemies in infinite mode and that, as in Haldeman’s The Forever War, they are propelled by nothing more than the purblind logic of terminal velocity. We sit in front of our screens, absorbing it all, tacitly saying yes to the power of national security states that ask not just for obedience, but for our enthusiasm. 11.Digital Demons THIS IS not the world we were supposed to live in. If you listened to the evangelical heralds of tech globalization, the boundless optimism of the eighties and nineties taught you to believe Silicon Valley created, in the parlance of the era, “an information superhighway.” Marshall McLuhan may be best known for his claim in the 1960s that a convergence of technologies insured that “the medium is the message.” However, he also gave us that well-worn term global village in his 1962 book The Gutenberg Galaxy to describe the interconnection made viable by technology. But it’s a phrase very much out of step with the internet’s rhetoric about itself. For McLuhan, the global village meant a loss of privacy, of sophistication, of separating fact from reality through careful reading and contemplation, a digital return to what Marx called “the idiocy of rural life.” But now the provincial hamlet is your favorite social media platform or the bubble of commentary and commerce that you hermit into. The dark carnival rolled into the global village in the small hours, and few knew what lay behind the sideshows and blowoffs, the games and the gags. The barkers made as if the world could be bought for a dime, and they seduced us with partial truths. John Sculley, Apple’s CEO, perhaps came the closest to understanding the meaning of the wireless connected world. It will be, he said in mythic language, “the mother of all markets.” Sculley made his comments at a gathering of personal computer entrepreneurs in New York City in the summer of 1992, a moment when the corporate entities soon to become world powers on the digital landscape decided to invest their energy into “a handheld box operated by pen, or even voice commands.” Such a revolutionary device might be called, these soon-to-be billionaires suggested, “wireless widgets,” “wallet computers,” or “digital information appliances.”45 We are aware that such devices have taken over our lives. There are 290 million smart phones in the Unites States. When we subtract users of burner phones and young children using parental devices from the remaining number of outliers, we are clearly a country thoroughly wired. We’ve all been, in the threatening-sounding dialect of the nineties, “jacked in.” Much-needed attention has been paid to the emotional and existential costs of this kind of lifestyle. Horror stories of the real dangers posed by cyber life have been documented, cautionary tales and “what if?” scenarios that can make logging on to an app feel like agreeing to meet a stranger in a dark, secluded place. We’ve also become aware of the dangers online life offers to an increasingly fragile democracy in the American nation-state. It’s incorrect to talk of the possible “destruction of democracy” in the nation, as democracy has always been tentative. Its promises have been limited to the fifty fully annexed and highly gerrymandered states. Black ballots have not counted for most of American history; the votes of women did not count until 1920. Some of the most lethal “active measures,” to use Bezmenov’s phrase, being pursued against American democracy right now are efforts to restrict voting by state legislatures. But even the sorry state of democracy in a country that disenfranchises nearly seven hundred thousand people in the District of Columbia can be exacerbated. There’s no evidence that Russia “hacked” the election in 2016 or tried the same in 2020. The work of foreign operatives on social media proved much more serious and effective than risking digital fingerprints on a full-scale voting fraud effort, one that might make cybersecurity experts aware of vulnerabilities that could be used at a later time. Evidence shows that two military units of the GRU, the Russian espionage service, hacked into personal servers of the Democratic National Committee, its volunteers, and even high-ranking Democratic leaders such as John Podesta. Malware harvested over seventy gigabytes of data from a single server in April 2016. In the summer of 2016, Russian security contracted out espionage to a hacker working under the handle Guccifer 2.0 (also known as Fancy Bear). He scored perhaps the most significant data breach of the DNC and began publishing the materials through Facebook, Twitter, and a WordPress blog. In fact, right-leaning Americans met redacted and decontextualized information gleaned from Instagram posts, YouTube channels, Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts. Although they claimed to be sites seeking to defend “Second Amendment rights” or to have an affiliation with state Republican parties, they frequently were simply trolls contracted by the Russian secret service. An investigation by Vietnam Veterans of America produced evidence that troll farms in Macedonia created “Vets for Trump” sites of various platforms while targeting veterans more generally on social media with “Islamophobic” and “xenophobic” sentiments. The organization even found evidence that foreign, and some domestic, actors used their names and logos to support the Trump campaign.46 Shadowy Russian affiliates such as the Internet Research Agency (IRA) even created shell sites that labeled themselves as advocacy platforms for LGBTQ+ rights and the Black Lives Matter movement, and then flooded the page with pro-Trump information or general discouragements to vote. The IRA purchased about four thousand Facebook ads for these and similar sites, amounting to about one hundred thousand dollars. By 2017, Facebook had identified 470 accounts run by the company. The GRU and its partners achieved the equivalent of opening a digital sewage valve that flooded American online life with half-truths and absurdities. Perhaps online horror culture unwittingly helped prepare the country for what American intelligence called “the troll farm” that played a highly significant role in 2016. We certainly became accustomed to real-life horror portrayed online, to horror cultures that expressed anxiety about digital life, and to imagining false horrors that help us ignore the very real terrors of a cyber empire. Both mainstream and independent horror films have maintained a persistent interest in the haunted house becoming the haunted computer, or more likely the haunted source code. At least since 1981’s Evilspeak, our screens as portals to hell have been an obvious metaphor. Unfriended, #Horror, Searching, The Den, The Host, Countdown, Followed, Cam, and Friend Request imagine either supernatural evil or serial murderers coming at you through your phone or your desktop. Unfriended may be one of the more interesting examples of this trend as a film, basing itself on the premise that the audience has basic social media literacy and will watch ninety minutes of footage that allows us to see only what the characters see on their digital devices. It’s horror where we are trapped in McLuhan’s global village where none of us asked to live. These films are a conversation about everything we fear from life online: the possibility of an end to privacy, the sense that every stranger who seems aggressive on social media might be something even worse, and the dread of our own digital personas acquiring a life of their own. Since 2016 and the revelation of a massive cybersecurity threat to American elections, the demonic stalkers of Dark Web and Friend Request have taken on an additional viscous layer of dread, oozing out of our screens. Unfortunately, such films have often shared the American solipsism that hides behind its own borders, the tendency to try and sever the natural relationship between the personal and the political. The narcissism of the world of likes and loves and retweets has made these stories even more apolitical, or at least they pretend to be. Friend Request (2016) offers an example of this strenuous self-involvement, illustrated by the film’s insouciance about its own ghastly assumptions. The first few minutes introduce us to the prettiest, most popular, and wealthiest students at an unnamed college, their friendship, romantic life, and adventures performed for the watching world on social media. The single character with some trace of human feeling makes the mistake of offering a modicum of kindness to a black-clad, unattractive outcast with eccentric ideas about personal hygiene. What may have wanted to be a ham-handed parable about cyberbullying fails even at that. Indeed, it seems to encourage the mistreatment of people on the margin of the American class war when they dare seek to connect on social media. The film goes so far as to make the odd-looking goth girl an actual and fairly terrifying witch whose demonic powers can turn computer code into eldritch glyphs, possess Facebook pages, and even turn you into an abandoned social outcast if you dare befriend her. Friend Request even seeks to raise the tension with jump-scare shots of the protagonist’s friends and followers count dropping precipitously. There’s a very real politics of class at work even in an ephemeral film like this one. It wanted to “say something” about social media and, paradoxically, said more than it knew. The wounds of class are often highly visible on American social media. The assumption of economic and cultural capital is behind the power of social influencers and monetized platforms that encourage you to learn “lifestyle hacks,” some not available to tens of millions of American whose low-wage employment denies them the tech and the time. The believability of theatrical posts that render the happiness of home, family, personal success, or travel depends very much on class and status. That such material exists alongside utter howls of tweeted and posted rage offers a clue to the seething sense of grievance that one often finds in online life. Tens of millions of Americans in economic and personal distress are staring through their phone screens and consuming performative happiness enjoyed by those who can afford to stage garish social functions, vacations to exotic locales, images of dinners unaffordable to minimum-wage workers, and romantic relationships perfected, perhaps made possible, by disposable income. McLuhan told IBM in the sixties, when they produced computers mainly to help businesses run payroll, they had entered “the information business” and that the “dossier” maintained in bytes would create for humanity “one big gossip column.” In the world still living outside the screens, Big Brother would depend less on easily recognizable propaganda and more on the democratic impulse dying the death of a thousand distractions. The “one big gossip column” might have led Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to change their famous formulation to “social media and bombs” as the alliance that kept Americans desensitized. When we do look away from a social influencer paid to sell us face soap or the schadenfreude that comes with the digital downfall of a celebrity, we find that the world of cyber warfare tells its tales as simple parables that are easily graspable. In the age when empire has gone online, the defense establishment has encouraged the idea of the United States as victim, unprepared yet fully expecting an online Pearl Harbor. This possibility caused much public handwringing in the national security establishment after 2016. Lieutenant General Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said at a 2019 conference on cybersecurity held in Aspen, Colorado, that such a full-scale cyber assault on the United States had become “kind of the thing that keeps me up at night.”47 There are definitive holes in America’s cybersecurity plans, and a massive and disruptive hack by U.S. adversaries is likely. But much of the public discussion hides the fact that American imperial ambition has made our own cyber offensives the most poorly kept secret in national intelligence. In fact, the United States planned to use computers as war machines even before the internet became a reality. As early as the 1950s, CIA’s Operation Minerva gave the United States the codes for encryption machines sold by the Swiss-based company that produced the clunky coding apparatus that looked like the mating of a fifties cash register and a typewriter. This allowed for spying on a number of Latin American nations and U.S. allies. In 1993, the agency became the major shareholder in the company.48 Obviously, analog coding proved of little use after the PC revolution and the widespread civilian use of the internet. In 2021, it became general knowledge, at least among cybersecurity experts, that Chinese servers had long been targeted by “Trojan” viruses, as well as direct hacks to websites, apps, and online information related to state and military matters. Many of these acts came to light after a major if little-known cyber offensive against Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran in 2018. These actions, even if the public decided not to know about them, are described in some detail in a U.S. Department of Defense official release simply called “Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.” U.S. intelligence services have a similar long history of cyber attacks against Iran, including sallies against civilian and military infrastructure close to the time of writing. Before 2019, a phantasm-like malware called Stuxnet disabled elements of Iran’s nuclear program. Begun under George W. Bush and fully developed in the first year of the Obama administration, the insidious digital package replicated itself beyond its original intention in such a way that thousands of hackers could code it anew and unleash it to proliferate.49 Horror wears a technological mask because the online American empire operates in William Gibson’s “spook country.” But that doesn’t mean the macabre has been reduced to a meme. Our dark carnival allows for plenty of terror IRL. In fact, horror films increasingly melt the walls between fact and fiction. 12.Purging “My God, how did it get to this?” —The Purge: Election Year THE AMERICAN empire’s cyber-ops campaigns do not change the reality or the danger of foreign powers dealing another blow to an already wobbly democracy at home. It does place such disinformation in a broader context. Moreover, as Richard A. Clarke warned in his 2010 book Cyber War, the United States, since the 1990s, put all its efforts into offensive tactics and strategy. In a 2012 interview with Smithsonian magazine, he insisted that the United States had made no real preparations to defend its digital infrastructure. It was as if the United States launched the equivalent of several D-Day landings while enemy paratroopers floated into American backyards. This, of course, should have been received as a sobering assessment from the man who warned two uninterested administrations of the danger posed by Al-Qaeda.50 But there’s been far more changes brought to the American metropole by online life than an extension of imperial ambition into cyberspace. Amid the ghosting and trolling and the occasional troublesome zombie, a terribly dark thing has found it can attach itself to the nervous system of the internet and become a truly viral infection. You might have dodged forgettable films about satanic witches sending you friend requests or even the bots that emerge from the internet’s noosphere offering sex and companionship. You didn’t join a popular Facebook page called Heart of Texas in 2015, a false front for Russian intelligence that began an experiment with social media that ballooned into the fire hose of misinformation that drove the upcoming election cycle. But what happened on 4chan, or Reddit, didn’t stay there. The violence of rhetoric online transformed internet forums into strategy meetings for an online coup. Horror, as has so often been the case in American history, refused to stay on the screens. Horror franchises that aimed for satire sometimes took on a documentary quality rather than a prediction of dystopia to come. The popular The Purge series occupies a very peculiar place in the culture of horror. It’s not a paranormal possession trip or a slasher flick. It’s not a creature feature or a ghost story. The Purge sometimes employs the terror of home invasion that Michael Haneke made infamous in Funny Games (1997; 2007). But the horror is just as likely to find you in the streets. Its “near future” setting even keeps it from nestling easily into our current fascination with social apocalypse. The Purge films and the adjunct television series are their own genre.51 The terrorists have won in 2013’s The Purge. They are the ruling party of the United States and call themselves the New Founding Fathers (NFF), right wing and white supremist. An economic crash, not unlike the real-world death spiral of 2008, has splintered America. But the NFF has brought economic prosperity and the crime rate down to near zero. Popular opinion gives the credit to the annual “purge,” a twelve-hour period in which robbery, rape, and murder are allowed, civilization unleashes all its discontents, and the Freudian id goes a-wilding. In this first iteration, Ethan Hawke and his family are part of the one-percenters who can afford to live behind massive security gates. But he and his privileged brood find themselves targeted when they help a Black man screaming in the street and find their fortress invaded by a mob who wants the man—whom they call “a dirty homeless pig” who “exists only to fulfill our need to purge”—turned over to them. The politics of The Purge turned more explicit as the series advanced. The Purge: Anarchy features the emergence of a resistance, who look and dress a lot like the Black Panther Party of the sixties and seventies, taking over state broadcasts to launch jeremiads at a country that “[worships] at the altar of Smith and Wesson” and uses violence to “[redistribute] wealth upward.” The gloves are really off with 2016’s The Purge: Election Year, which bore the tagline “Keep America Great.” Director James DeMonaco, known for his anti-gun politics, created a scenario in which the regime’s armed death squads, who look like real-world tactical police units executing no-knock warrants, actively work with neo-Nazis. Appearing the year before torch-bearing mobs marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, under a new administration unwilling to condemn them, DeMonaco’s film seemed like prophecy rather than simple prescience. DeMonaco’s effort at creating a 2018 prequel, The First Purge, imagined the NFF beta testing the carnival of murder on Staten Island, assuming an armed and violent hoi polloi would purge the hell out of themselves. The director solved the plot hole that most people would simply leave the island for the night in a most American way: monetize violence. The state offers residents who will stay checks for five thousand dollars with more compensation if they “purge.” This is life-changing money for many Americans outside the frame. Although accused of “fashionable wokeness,” DeMonaco had been urging horror film audiences to think about wealth inequality since the Obama administration when neither Republicans nor Democrats wanted to talk much about it. The First Purge’s use of Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright,” an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement and Fight for $15, suggests a willingness to engage directly with the American empire’s need to wage war against internal dissent. Perhaps what’s truly become “fashionable” is the cynicism that assumes political awareness always represents a “pose.” Indeed, it seems a confirmation of John Carpenter’s message in They Live that there are so many messages everywhere to “Stay Asleep” that the decision to “Stay Woke” can be dismissed by film critics.52 13.Like Something Out of a Zombie Movie VIOLENCE HAS been celebrated in American life for centuries. The nation’s fascination with the West meant that the empire always hungered for new frontiers, across the Pacific world, in the Middle East, in Vietnam, and even by weaponizing the Earth’s orbit. We’ve remembered the Alamo, Wounded Knee, My Lai, and Spahn Ranch while not learning any of their lessons. We’ve forgotten, or never been told about, the mass murder at Sand Creek, the slaughter of Filipino freedom fighters and civilians in Luzon, the tens of thousands killed by the CIA in Operation Phoenix, the Highway of Death in Desert Storm, or the drone massacre in North Waziristan, Pakistan. We doomscroll through our newsfeeds and shake our heads with bewilderment at the latest atrocity in Yemen or Afghanistan. But then we are surprised when, as Malcom X controversially described the Kennedy assassination, “chickens [come] home to roost.” On January 6, 2021, an aggrieved collection of right-wing groups, incited by a lame-duck president and his enablers, attempted an insurrection. It could have been worse. The hundreds who stormed the Capitol could have killed more police. The mob that chanted “Hang Mike Pence!” could have found the vice president and his family and hauled them to the gallows built outside. The sadist fantasies that ooze out of the internet could have emerged from the shadows, online doxing becoming rape, torture, murder. Not the first purge, and not the last either. All of this could still happen because the structures of American life allow for it. You can’t build an empire on violence and then wonder about the causes of violence. Our fictions have been broadcasting this truth for years. The lives of millions of Americans have reflected it for centuries. Its ugliest face floats out of the idea that the assertion of raw power reshapes reality, controls the fact as well as opinion. Republican congressmen since January 6, 2021, have sounded a bit like my theoretically inclined profs in grad school, with their talk of “constructing narratives.” Some House Republicans speak as if they took a Derrida seminar and accepted the notion that “there is nothing outside the text.” Given the nature of political gangsterism since The Prince, they understand the brutal corollary well-meaning academics often dismiss: all that matters is who controls the texts. It looked like a horror film to many who watched in shock as the mob breached the Capitol. One of the most famous moments in George A. Romero’s Dawn of the Dead features female lead Fran asking her partner, Stephen, “What are they doing? Why do they come here?” Surveying the ruined mall where zombies putter about, some comically stumbling on escalators or flailing about in fountains, Stephen says that perhaps it was “instinct.” Driven only by a vicious hunger, they go to “an important place in their lives.” The insurrectionists weren’t zombies. The oncoming horde that trampled some of its own did have leaders, little Murder Legendres who mastered them with tales of stolen elections and Satanists in high places. Perhaps that’s why some of the more striking images of the day fall into two categories: murderous frenzy, or aimless wandering through the halls and offices of the Capitol, somnolent crowds moving as one only to halt their shamble to take selfies or place MAGA hats on statues in the rotunda. The involvement of leaders from QAnon, the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Boogaloo Boys, and a variety of MAGA stalwarts meant that the mob would do more than fumble about and break some windows. At least one photographer with a close view of what he called “hordes” of rioters jamming into windows while overrunning police and overturning barricades described it as “like something out of a zombie movie.”53 One of the most popular memes of the COVID era became a picture of an angry mob, an image captured by Joshua A. Bickel at the Ohio Statehouse. Anti-mask, anti-quarantine, and mostly pro-MAGA, they attempted to force their way into the statehouse, pressing against the glass doors in such a way that it looked painfully like every zombie fiction’s portrayal of the undead seeking to get at the flesh of the living. The memes created from the image featured predictable titles like “Return of the Brain Dead,” “Dawn of the Dumb,” and the clever, if weary, “Wow, this season of The Walking Dead sucks.” Bickel had mixed feelings about the uses to which his photograph has been put. In an interview not long after the meme went viral, he worried over the portrayal of people as zombies. This makes a great deal of moral sense, especially when some of the memes made the cruel joke that the protestors would likely become the actual “infected” of their own personal horror films. Though seeing their behavior as irresponsible, Bickel told his interviewer that we had no idea what dreadful paths brought fearful, broken, and possibly mentally ill people to such a pass. “These people aren’t zombies,” he said.54 Giving monstrous qualities to human beings does have a terrible stench in America’s history; the photographer has a point. Moreover, in the game of enmonstering, everyone gets to play. During the January 6 insurrection, among the MAGA hats, “Don’t Tread on Me” flags, and signs emblazoned with “Q,” there also appeared caps that read “U.S. Zombie Outbreak Response Team” (USZORT being their preferred acronym). USZORT is an actual organization. It does not foreground politics, though it does go beyond harmless memes into encouraging “doomsday prepping” with the idea that adding zombies puts the fun into preparing for “anything from a person infected by a pandemic outbreak to a crazy nut job . . .” A visit to the USZORT website suggests the group is mostly harmless, despite loose talk of how “a zombie” could be a “gangster” (obvious racial coding) or a “terrorist” (also obvious racial coding). As of January 18, 2021, the forums have been mostly quiet, and posts are either seemingly lonely inquirers looking for “Zombie Preparedness Training” in their state or spam from male performance enhancement products. But the dangers of such a mindset, fear of a natural disaster or mild civil unrest lurching into stockpiling weapons, are pretty plain. Kelly J. Baker, a scholar who studies both horror and white supremacy, describes the unusual links between right-wing violence, doomsday prepping, and zombie obsessions in her excellent book The Zombies Are Coming. These connections include a fascination with military-grade weaponry and viewing people of color as a “horde” shambling toward them to take life and property. In the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, the desire to purge seems to have grown stronger among some segments of American society. Indeed, rather than bothering to see their enemies as monsters, some rightist ideologues have suggested they will become monsters themselves. In the online journal American Greatness, supposedly launched to provide intellectual heft to Trumpism’s meandering grievances, Jack Kerwick urged readers to “become the stuff of nightmares.” In a chilling call to arms, he wrote that “the good man must spare not a moment to train, in both body and mind, to become the monster that he may need to become . . .”55 Is this how the empire collapses into the troubled nation-state? The Soviet Union, seemingly a juggernaut with imperial outposts and interests around the globe, died between 1989 and 1991. Crony capitalism attended the rise of Russia while the Soviet Union collapsed not only into a failed state but a collection of failed states. Putin’s Russia emerged as a threatening regional power, though one able to create chaos in cyber warfare like even smaller, more isolated nations like Iran and North Korea. Has the same process set in here? Does political polarization mean eventual balkanization? Will the extreme right get the civil war it wants? The second decade of the century taught Americans about the unruliness of history. The obvious failures of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us that of the many things empires can do, one thing they’ve always done is decline and fall. The insurrection certainly harmed America’s reputation for invincibility abroad. After a drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, more American military personnel occupied the Capitol in the next week than served in all the Middle East. The forever war had come home. The world watched the monster documentary. Did the wars without end exhaust American military and economic power while a meandering and inhumane foreign policy sputtered and failed? Has the death of manufacturing not only destroyed the working class but left America’s economic grip over much of the world in tatters? One hundred years after the beginning of its ascent to global power, has American hubris ended the American century? Some of the biggest promoters of empire think so. Historian and foreign policy analyst Max Boot, who once made a famous “Case for American Empire,” rather bravely left the Republican Party in 2016 to protest the internal rot of Trumpism. To his credit, Boot worried that his compatriots enabled a drift into authoritarianism. But his primary concern over Trumpism was its know-nothing approach to what he called “the world order created by the greatest generation in the 1940s.”56 Boot understands American global power and its limits well enough to know that a landing by U.S. Marines and/or a regime change supported by the CIA isn’t possible in the way it had been in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s. Adventurism has been more likely to result in the indictments of Iran-Contra, the debacle of Black Hawk down, the confusion of “humanitarian” bombings in the Balkans, ill-considered meddling in the politics of Libya, or the catastrophe of Iraq and Afghanistan. And these are the best-case scenario. The first twenty years of the new century have been a lesson in America’s limited ability to impose its will. Of course, maybe what’s bad for the empire is good for democracy at home. In the American past, imperial overreach did inspire social change. The violence visited on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the sixties inaugurated the anti-war movement that then forged links with the Black freedom struggle, second-wave feminism, and the first efforts toward gay liberation. The same could happen again and the transformations wrought could change our fate. A generation who does not recall a time their country did not wage wars on other peoples could use the streets and the ballot box to effect structural change. The people could demand Congress reclaim its constitutional powers to make war from imperial presidential administrations, now largely made up of unelected proconsuls of empire. They could demand laws that regulate corporate power and campaign finance laws in ways that cripple the national security state forever. History is not an oracle. We don’t actually learn from the past and save ourselves from the doom of repeating it. History is just what happens. It’s a place where, because of atavism, apathy, and greed, the worst possible thing is true. “Empires do not last,” Chalmers Johnson warned, “and their ends are usually unpleasant.”57",

      "content": "1.Do You Like Scary Movies? HORROR TOOK a holiday in the 1990s. Maybe. There’s a consensus that horror’s golden age of the seventies and eighties withered in the more optimistic decade of tech start-ups and stock market ebullience. George A. Romero’s zombies shambled off the stage after 1985’s Day of the Dead, not rising again until the twenty-first century. Critics prematurely declared the slasher film dead, forgetting that the monster always returns. Stephen King remained a best-selling author, though fantasy, science fiction, and realism became the genres most attractive to many of the same fans who had once voraciously read Salem’s Lot, The Stand, Pet Sematary, and Christine. The Green Mile (1999), a wistful story of supernatural healing and redemption, became King’s big hit at the box office. Devoted fans will remind you of some of the new directions taken by classic directors and a new conception of paranormal and gothic horror that suited the fascination with unquiet spirits, demons, and indeed angels that haunted, infested, and flitted around the echoing portal of a new millennium. Apocalyptic films gained some popularity, often mixing genres as in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle End of Days (1999), in which the action hero goes after the Antichrist, guns ablazin’, a crossover event between Die Hard and The Book of Revelation. But Forrest Gump, not Freddy Krueger, won the hearts of Americans in the 1990s. Sentimental and nostalgic, the film reimagined American history and blended it with magical realism to spin a sugared confection of innocence, goodness, and the easily falsifiable notion that there is a God who looks out for fools and little children. The story of a mentally challenged white Southerner with naivete matched only by his gift to align the universe with his wishes, the film takes us on a highly redacted tour of almost fifty years of American history. Audiences left the film charmed as Tom Hanks became an avatar for tens of millions who remained as befuddled as the protagonist about American life. Gump becomes an unsophisticated witness to desegregation, the Vietnam War, and numerous political assassinations. He maintains his innocence through it all and emerges from the bloodbath of history unscathed. Meanwhile, his friends drop like flies. Following the stereotype of so many of the era’s horror films, the Black guy dies first. Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson), a fellow Alabamian who bears the curse of becoming close to Gump in Vietnam, dies with his hands full of his own viscera. The graphic scene in this PG film would have been excised from the era’s slasher films that the Motion Picture Association often threatened with the new NC-17 rating. Shrimp-loving Bubba Blue is far from the film’s only sacrificial offering. The love of Gump’s life, Jenny, also dies in the 1980s. She has been “promiscuous” and done some drugs during the sexual revolution and so dies of an unnamed “disease.” This apparently references the decade’s AIDS epidemic that killed nearly ninety thousand Americans before the Reagan administration even acknowledged its existence in 1988. Again, as with the popular reading of slasher movies, dare to enjoy sex outside of marriage and it’s one, two, Freddy’s coming for you. Gump, meanwhile, becomes wealthy by being an early investor in what he refers to as a “fruit company” called Apple. This gives him the time to sit on park benches and explain to people trying to catch a bus to their low-wage, labor-intensive jobs that “life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.” “It takes a heart of stone to love Forrest Gump,” wrote Mark Edmundson in his book from the nineties and about the nineties called Nightmare on Main Street. This may seem far harsher than even my own judgment of a film still much-beloved after almost thirty years. But, as Edmundson points out, there’s something truly hateful about the sentimental film. What we see in that film is white America blissful in its own ignorance, a kind of blind cruelty in grasping at a vision of the world only possible to citizens of an invincible empire. Edmundson insists that the narrative is not about the adorable Gump. It’s a story about how the United States “despite a few wayward incidents, is still a grand place to live.” At a moment in American history when the gap between wealth and poverty yawned wider than at any time since the 1890s, Edmundson rightly says that the film represented the dangerous idea “that dull virtue in tandem with humble, unresenting poverty is well rewarded.” A decade in which the United States carried out violent interventions that killed thousands of civilians, and corporations joined in the mass incarceration of young Black men in the creation of for-profit prisons, does not suggest a world that’s a box of candy.1 The success of the saccharine film perfectly twinned a politically drowsy decade. Americans, white Americans at least, proved willing to forgive and forget the “wayward incidents” of their country’s past. Despite the 1980s’ reputation for conservatism, well-earned in many respects, the decade also featured the powerful grassroots Nuclear Freeze movement, the Sanctuary movement that sheltered Latin America refugees, and protests against U.S. intervention in Nicaragua and El Salvador by groups such as Witness for Peace. Many of these movements withered after Iran-Contra and the end of the Reagan administration. More important, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a sense of optimism among the white middle class that rose throughout the decade, charging ahead alongside the super-heated stock market driven by Clinton’s international trade deals. This somnolence among the body politic belied the strenuous military adventurism of the decade. The pattern first appeared in the Bush years as a new incarnation of Reagan’s efforts to end the alleged Vietnam Syndrome. In 1989, Bush’s Operation Just Cause removed the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Little reporting appeared in the mainstream press to explain the necessity of this sudden military intervention that amounted to the kidnapping of a foreign leader. Neither did major news outlets give much space to the even more mysterious fact that Noriega had long been an asset of the CIA, receiving up to two hundred thousand dollars in personal funds. He was kicked off the agency’s payroll under the Carter administration (1977–1981) but immediately began receiving funding again in 1981 with the influence of former CIA director George H. W. Bush.2 Operation Desert Storm (1991) often now simply called the “first invasion of Iraq,” set the tone for the decade, one that had its roots in the first stirrings of America’s empire after World War I and would have consequences deep into our future. A truly ludicrous affair, the rise of twenty-four-hour news, particularly CNN, made the conflict in the Gulf into one of the most popular wars in American history. Public opinion, unhindered by facts and context, discovered another “good war,” a simple struggle between good and evil. If the invasion of Grenada had been a slightly off-kilter Broadway show with decidedly mixed reviews, the Gulf War became a multi-billion-dollar special effects–laden blockbuster, rivaling Jaws and Star Wars in the cineplex of the American mind. Iraq and Saddam Hussein’s journey to becoming a new monster to replace the Soviet Union had more than a few dramatic twists and turns. Hussein had ruled Iraq as a despot since 1979. He kept no particular ideology, other than what he crazy-quilted together from a vague socialism and a strident nationalism peppered with an occasional reference to the Qur’an. His utter malice toward any opposition became the dominant characteristic of his regime, his dictatorship leading Iraq into a devasting war with Iran that lasted most of the eighties. He cultivated an increasingly absurd cult of personality, creating statues and images of himself that rivalled Stalin’s mania for similar official accolades. A joke among Iraqis, told quietly in a country where the ruler’s security services killed a quarter of a million people between 1979 and 2003, ran that the population of the country recently burgeoned to thirty-four million people . . . seventeen million Iraqis and seventeen million portraits of Hussein.3 Hussein may have been a son of a bitch, but from the standpoint of America’s national security establishment, he was our son of a bitch. Donald Rumsfeld, then serving the Reagan administration as special envoy to the Middle East, made two personal visits to Hussein at a time when the United States provided Iraq with billions in agricultural credits, making Iraq the fourth largest recipient of U.S. aid in the world.4 Support for Hussein in his war against Iran went beyond foodstuffs. The Department of Defense, working hand in glove with the CIA, provided Iraq with satellite photography surveillance of Iranian military movements. Even more damning, the DOD sold Iraq chemical precursors to produce mustard gas and sarin gas. Retired senior intelligence official Colonel Walter P. Lang asserted that the United States would not countenance the use of chemical weapons against civilians but that, in the Iran-Iraq war, “[their] use against military objectives was seen as inevitable.” In 1988, Hussein did use deadly chemicals against the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq. Neither the CIA nor American armed forces played a direct role in this attack and the Reagan administration officially condemned it. Then Vice President Bush argued against continuing chemical weapon precursors to Iraq. But a full investigative report in The New York Times revealed real dissension in the administration over continued support for Hussein even after he made it clear he was a genocidal monster.5 Hussein could claim limited success in his war with Iran, despite enormous casualties and crippling debt to the small oil emirate of Kuwait, which aided him in buying arms and rebuilding infrastructure. Rather than paying the debt, Hussein threatened Kuwait, insisting that the tiny enclave of wealth was long a natural part of Iraq and existed only because of British imperialism. Even murderous megalomaniacs sometimes get their facts straight. Britain had drawn the lines separating the two new states they carved out of the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after the Great War. The process had been so thoroughly dominated by the British Empire that the puppet rulers of both states in 1920 had been confused, and indeed had to constantly badger British foreign secretaries for the precise boundaries of their jury-rigged states. In 1990, Hussein flexed his muscles against Kuwait while also criticizing U.S. support for Israel, the dominant military power in the region. His decision to mount an invasion of Kuwait may have come from mixed signals from American diplomats, who carried a warning about the deployment of troops on his southern border while also assuring that the United States understood his economic problems and that America had “no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts.” Certainly, a sociopath would see this muddled message as two big thumbs up. And he did.6 The successful prosecution of the war against Iraq, with few American casualties, set off a curious wave of celebration, curious in both its symbolism and scale. The National Victory Celebration, the largest military parade since the Second World War, featured not only the march of eight thousand troops but also what the Associated Press called a “swarm” of Apache helicopters landing on the National Mall. CBS News noted that a “patriot missile” received “the loudest applause of the day.” No fewer than eighty-two aircraft filled the airspace over D.C., including the deadly F-117 stealth bomber. Bush crowed, “By God, we’ve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all,” and the raw militarism of the National Victory Celebration, replicated in cities and small towns across the country, suggested just that.7 But something was wrong. The Gulf War quickly passed out of popular consciousness. Two years later, the American public yawned when the United States bombed Iraq again. America experienced a pretty good war all in all, prepared for them by an administration and a military/public relations complex that, as commanding general of U.S. forces Norman Schwarzkopf said, “knew how to package an historic event.” Schwarzkopf played an important role in winning media hearts and minds, finding himself christened Stormin’ Norman and generally lionized even as he restricted press coverage of both American and Iraqi deaths.8 Had Americans become bored of their “walk-on parts in a monster documentary”? Had the dark carnival left town forever? 2.Ignoring the Tales from the Hood WHILE BUSH busily kicked the Vietnam Syndrome, millions of Americans did not share in America’s nineties fantasies. White supremacy ensured that, at home and abroad, the horror would continue to take shape. But the Black community did not accept their victimization. Ernest R. Dickerson made his first grad school film with Spike Lee. Joe’s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads told a story of community and violence at a local barbershop. Joe’s shop offered a gathering spot for Black men to talk plainly and profanely about the mysteries of their lives. It also became a contemplation of both violence from within economically walled-off Black communities and brutalities inflicted by the state. A renaissance of Black film occurred in the 1990s. Author and activist Michael Eric Dyson goes so far as to suggest that Black films emerged from a “cultural nationalism” that sought to oppose the era’s “escalation of racist hostility.” Notably, this included a rediscovery of the possibilities of Black horror films to explore the horror of Black history. John Singleton, Matty Rich, the Hughes brothers, Lee, and Dickerson forced audiences to look at their bleak visions of the American past and present.9 Many of these filmmakers worked traditional elements of horror into their films, sometimes directly using tropes of demon possession and zombiism. Lee’s Jungle Fever features a skin-crawling scene of a drug-addicted son confronting his father over money with a gloomy dread that remained with many viewers, myself included, ever since we witnessed it in theaters in 1991. Dickerson would make the cult favorites Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight and Bones, stories of demonic powers and ferocious spirits that intermingled with the realities of mass incarceration and the fate of abandoned urban centers. Unlike white filmmakers, who could still engage with the imperial fantasies of voodoo and cults from abroad, Black filmmakers of the era focused almost entirely on the frayed social structures of urban life, the terror inherent in Black history, and the death of the dreams of Black Pride and Power. By the early seventies, many Black workers, while still segregated from white suburbs, began to join the middle class into which the G.I. Bill and friendly mortgage-lending practices launched whites during the 1950s. A generation after the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South into Northern and Southern cities, men of color in particular found good union jobs in manufacturing with secure employment and a living wage. The new economic options collapsed as soon as they appeared. The deindustrialization of America left the emerging Black middle class an empty shell in many parts of the country, especially in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles where disappearing jobs created wastelands out of formerly vibrant communities. By the 1990s, the outsourcing of American jobs hammered the coffin’s final nail for the traditional American working class. This particularly affected the Black community, and fatalistic discussions of “a permanent underclass” became common despite the irony of American economic hegemony abroad.10 The empire wielded its weapons at home. A spigot of cash to local police departments meant, as a New York University Law Review article noted, rising “costs of coercion” as local police invested in electronic surveillance equipment (once controversial even for the FBI) and purchased military-grade tactical equipment. Under a 1997 program, police departments did not even have to purchase the war material. Instead, they received gratis military surplus that included grenade launchers and armored vehicles called MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush protected) later used in Iraq and Afghanistan. After 2001, police access to battlefield weaponry grew when the new Department of Homeland Security provided block grants for police, even in tiny rural communities, to create “counterterrorism units.”11 The plan for a war on America’s internal troubles needed the legitimacy required of its many wars abroad. John Dilulio, a conservative Princeton professor, provided it when he coined the term superpredator in 1995 to describe an alleged wave of juvenile crime on the rise (in fact, crime of all kinds continued to decline in the 1990s). The term immediately had a racial coding, and Dilulio used phrases like “black inner-city neighborhoods” to heighten an alleged connection. Hillary Clinton made the term infamous when, in a 1996 campaign speech for her husband, she claimed that “superpredators” who had “no conscience, no empathy” emerged in “gangs” across the country. “We need to take these people on,” she said, in contrast to less influential voices that called for direct economic aid, practical job training, and various therapies to aid people whose class location might, in a very direct way, force them into criminal activity.12 Like a fighter all but spent in the early rounds, the Black working class continued to be caught cold by the rain of blows from above. The now infamous Clinton Crime Bill of 1994 lengthened sentencing for nonviolent crimes, providing incentives for dying rural communities to build more prisons to indefinitely detain Americans often convicted for simple possession, and allowing the Department of Justice to send billions of dollars to states who distributed the money to local police departments with no oversight. The 1992 film Candyman captured a host of the Black community’s real-world terrors. Based on a short story by white horror author Clive Barker and made by white director Bernard Rose, the film entered Black consciousness in its brutal portrayal of the daily horrors of systemic racism. American police violence and substandard public housing, gentrification and highways that cut apart communities, and white people who care too much and then turn murderous are all present. The monster, the Candyman, comes out of the violent past, the victim of a lynching on the frontier of empire. The supernatural threat of a powerful Black man, his body ribboned to carrion by white violence, became a powerful totem in the scrying power of hip-hop’s language. Jordan Peele, who produced Nia DaCosta’s elegantly terrifying remake in 2021, said he “[loves] the original Candyman” because “it broke us out of the box. A Black monster was pretty revolutionary. If there was no Candyman, I don’t know that there would be a Get Out.” The Candyman as an image of both power and horror goes hand in glove with Michael Eric Dyson’s discussion of the new culture of Black power that emerged in the 1990s and continued to assert itself in the twenty-first century. From Travis Scott sampling Philip Glass’s soundtrack of the film to Kendrick Lamar’s intentionally threatening “Just say his name,” the Candyman remained a specter of the past that lives out the horrors of the Black present. Billie Jasmine Powell, in her research on horror, hip-hop, and Black life in 1990s America, discovered no fewer than twenty-two references to Candyman in the work of artists ranging from Tupac to Wu-Tang Clan to Pusha T.13 Candyman premiered, in an eerie accident, the same year as what’s sometimes called the Los Angeles riots. South Central LA offers a compellingly cruel example of the systemic destruction of a Black community, slashed apart like the Candyman himself. South Central had become a term of conjurer’s art, words that “tough on crime” pols could repeat to summon the horrors of the superpredator. Although South Central geographically refers to a section of the once middle- and upper-class Central Avenue dotted with prosperous Black-owned businesses, the term came to include imaginary boundaries that went as far as Compton and Watts in the south and stretched westward into Crenshaw and Inglewood. Born in Watts, writer and activist Wanda Coleman described growing up in “the fabulous fifties” of what had become known as Historic South Central. The invidious “neighborhood covenants” had become less common and Coleman lived in an integrated neighborhood. But the city of Los Angeles seemed determined to destroy this vibrant community. During an economic downturn in the 1960s, LAPD police chief William Parker systematically raided Black businesses on Central Avenue. The city’s insistence on building the I-10, the Santa Monica Freeway, split traditional neighborhoods in two or three segments, leaving wastelands of rubble behind and even wrecking part of the Sugar Hill neighborhood, perhaps the most historic and architecturally important Black neighborhood outside of Atlanta and Harlem. Inner city, a term that the Urban Institute designates as a rhetorical device rather than a geographical description, appeared in discussions on both the right and left. In the 1980s, the idea of the “plight of the inner city” took on an increasingly unhelpful moral shading. Rather than thinking systemically about the ways in which specific policies caused urban poverty to accelerate, social commentary frequently framed the issue as a moral problem. The emerging power of Black horror films seldom made direct connections to the imperial role the United States played in the world. Rusty Cundieff, who later contributed his expertise to the edgiest sketches of Chappelle’s Show, made Tales from the Hood (1995). The film doesn’t even glance outside urban centers and instead profiles an understandable obsession with police brutality, politicians with inherently racist agendas, and intracommunity violence. The full-scale assault on the Black community since the 1970s meant that Black horror, much like Black social movements, placed the emphasis on the white supremacy at home rather than abroad. Black critiques of the American empire did exist as an important part of the freedom struggle before the 1980s. Underreported at the time and subsequently ignored in too many textbook accounts of the Black freedom struggle, the assassination of Congo leader Patrice Lumumba ignited a 1961 protest beginning in Harlem that breached the United Nations itself. The Congolese leader’s death had been a joint American-Belgian covert op that, like so many American-led secret operations, absolutely everyone knew about. The United States replaced Lumumba with an acquiescent dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, who became one of the wealthiest men in the world from his burn-and-plunder approach to his own country’s rich raw materials.14 The protest set off an international wave of public demonstrations in Paris, London, parts of the Soviet Union, and Tokyo. James Baldwin wrote a searing op-ed in The New York Times that referenced the killing of Lumumba and the subsequent protests. He warned whites that what was becoming an “Afro-American” struggle meant that Black people wanted much more than to sit down with white people for “the consumption of overcooked burgers and tasteless coffee at various sleazy lunch counters.”15 In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. tied the Vietnam War to segregation at home. The Black Panther Party had suggested that racism and economic power depended on, and simultaneously supported, the American empire abroad. In the well-researched and intensely important book Black Against Empire by Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, we learn that the FBI, in cooperation with local and state law enforcement, systematically destroyed the Panthers, at least in part because of this international agenda. Black history remained Black horror and empire shaped the conditions that Dickerson, Cundieff, and Lee exposed in their films. In the nineteenth century, westward expansion created a “cotton kingdom” as far west as Texas. Four million African Americans worked as chattel property. Segregation and economic immiseration shaped American attitudes toward people of color around the world. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, as mass incarceration became “the new Jim Crow,” racism at home continued to shape American imperial policy. American intervention abroad continued to exhibit the dire inclinations that Black Power advocates had seen for decades. The United States could not, for example, leave Haiti alone, continuing the obsession begun in the early twentieth century. U.S. troops landed in September of 1994 to return Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. This action in the Caribbean was, unlike in Grenada, sanctioned by the UN. However, the decision to invade the country for the second time came about because of the Clinton administration’s concerns over a new wave of Haitian immigrants fleeing a military junta the United States placed in power in 1991. Giants sometimes reel drunkenly with the weight of their own power. This had been the case with the murky meddling of the United States in Haitian affairs. Although it was arguably a defense of democracy to return Aristide to power (and thus the UN sanction), the CIA had trained operatives in the Haitian security services to invalidate Aristide’s election in the first place. To bury the man, that a (once) top-secret report dismissed as “the leftist priest,” the agency created the false story that Aristide received “psychiatric treatment” in Canada. After the Clinton administration decided to deal with Aristide instead of the immigrants, CIA director R. James Woolsey had to explain away his agency’s campaign against the Haitian president-in-exile’s claims on live TV, all the while insisting that the CIA had done nothing wrong.16 The American empire’s continuing creation of zombie republics abroad seeded lethal repercussions at home. CIA assets engaged in trafficking cocaine did, as a matter of public record, help flood South Central and other American communities with drugs. CIA operatives received protection in Columbia, Honduras, and Panama in return for their help with the covert war in Nicaragua. When this fact is remembered at all, it’s disparaged as “urban folklore” about the CIA trying to destroy the Black community. CIA assets did not peddle crack on the corners, nor did they directly supply those who did. But any false conspiracy beliefs hide what the Los Angeles Times called “a different, but equally scandalous truth.” That is, the CIA couldn’t care less about how their actions on behalf of empire affected marginalized Americans while they struck deals with predators across Latin America.17 Martin Luther King Jr. said, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” Tensions in South Central LA exploded in the LA uprising of 1992, a response to the acquittal of police officers responsible for the vicious beating of Rodney King, a troubled guy with a drug problem who found himself alone on one of the shadowy battlefields of America’s war on crime. King’s beating received the most press attention as the trip wire for the sudden eruption of rage. What happened within weeks of the King incident has been too frequently ignored. A store owner in Koreatown shot the Black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins in the back of the head for allegedly attempting to shoplift a $1.79 bottle of juice. Harlins died almost immediately. The woman responsible received a suspended sentence and community service from a white judge. A week later, a Black male resident of Glendale received a tougher sentence from the same judge for kicking a dog. The eruption of anti-police riots left the ruins of South Central in flames and too many whites wondering, while being uninterested in learning, what the people who’d lived in South Central for generations were so damn angry about. Horror, like hip-hop, offered a language of anger. Yet mainstream critics often received efforts to tell the African American story through horror with contempt. Though now lauded as a classic that presaged work by Jordan Peele, Gerard McMurray, Lena Waithe, Nia DaCosta, and Little Marvin, Tales from the Hood (1995) was described by The New York Times as “crudely written and acted.” The reviewer dismissed its critique of American white supremacy as a “political cartoon.” Meanwhile, the Times described the silly white savior fantasy Bulworth, starring Warren Beatty learning to be comfortable saying a racial slur because the film gives him a Black love interest in Halle Berry, as “jubilant political satire” with “chutzpah.” White audiences ignored the tales from the hood, what their country continued to do to Haiti, and systemic efforts to control African American communities through militarist policing. However, it turned out many Americans did care about reliving 1950s alien invasion fantasies and the self-referential gaze of a horror film about horror films. 3.The Rules TWO HORROR films, radically different in their premises and approach and yet both shaped by the military interventions of the 1990s, suggested that Americans wanted to consume violence that catered to their worldview. In 1996, a new Wes Craven venture breathed a peculiar afterlife into the slasher film with Scream. The same year marked the arrival of the summer blockbuster Independence Day, an overstuffed explosion fest that constituted a remake of nearly every alien invasion horror of the 1950s and featured many of Hollywood’s major male stars of the nineties. Both films elicited the nostalgia that would soon become a defining feature of America’s culture industry. Scream became part of a flood tide of movies, and forms of entertainment more generally, that are both aware of their own origins and talk about them incessantly. Craven’s story of murders in a world where everyone knows about slasher films and endlessly references Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street earned the sobriquet meta. Now part of the slang of knowingness, it appeared first in classrooms and the academic cult of the postmodern. More thoughtful analysis attributed this style to postindustrial capitalism’s information economy tendency to script “metanarratives,” a critical mass of logorrhea that finally resulted in talking about the idea of talking about something. The popularity of the Seinfeld approach (“a show about nothing”) and the rise of young hipsters wearing nostalgic clothing or enjoying anachronistic hobbies “ironically” represent the less offensive results of these impulses. In this way of imagining pop culture, the relentless search for profit forged a style of production, advertising, distribution, and consumption that’s the cultural equivalent of a snake swallowing its own tail. The idea appears in simple forms like making sneakers that are self-aware of their status as cool sneakers or films that are conscious of the tropes they march toward audiences in orderly rows. The fascination with the remake and the reboot, though long an element in the history of film, reached market saturation in the early twentieth century. It’s an outlet in the arcades of modern life just adjacent to the nostalgia industry. You can purchase remakes of your memories and reboots of your dreams. Some in academia still take pride in postmodern theory that does little more than put simple, or sometimes demonstrably false, ideas in abstruse terms. But, while the emperor may appear without clothes in the classroom, it’s certainly true that movies about movies, movies that knew they were movies, held a special appeal to audiences as the century closed. In a decade of rising paranoia, it felt good to watch a horror film that let you in on the alleged “rules” of the genre. It gave the same frisson as what Kurt Andersen, in his 2017 book Fantasyland, calls “the X-Filing of America.” Moreover, for a generation that made Kurt Cobain’s discordant hymns of rage their soundtrack, the inescapable maze of violence and commentary on that violence suited their sense of helplessness, anger, and angst. Craven sensed this about the nineties just as he’d understood Freddy Krueger as the nightmare companion to the eighties American dream. The audacity of Craven’s approach remains startling. Scream spills enough blood that producer Bob Weinstein called in all his favors to prevent the box office poison of an NC-17 rating. Yet, unlike the grainy film stock most slasher fans had become inured to, Craven’s masterpiece has the high-gloss look that’s reminiscent of the decade’s self-consciously trashy thrillers (Basic Instinct, Wild Things) and high-concept action films (Total Recall, Starship Troopers). Courteney Cox, beloved by the tens of millions of fans of the sitcom Friends, played a major role along with David Arquette, Rose McGowan, and Neve Campbell. Recognizable names and faces, a cast of absurdly pretty people in which even extras appear to have walked out of an Abercrombie catalog, made the film’s nihilism and sheer bloodlust obsessively interesting to look at. Horror culture received an indelible mark from Scream. Directors could continue the work Alfred Hitchcock began with Psycho. They could force audiences to accept they were watching a film, that they would have to deal with unreliable narrators and see the seams in editing so that entire backstories stayed out of focus until the climax. Over the next decade the inability to know the full story helped create a whole genre of “whodunit horror,” and in some cases “what the hell just happened” horror, in films like The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, Hide and Seek, The Others, and the entire oeuvre of M. Night Shyamalan. Often seen as films that delivered surprise endings, they primarily offered surprise editing. David Fincher’s Fight Club (1999) and Mary Harron’s American Psycho (2000) probably represent the apotheosis of this effort, but Craven opened the final Hitchcockian door, letting audiences in on the secret that the camera had the power to edit the reality they experienced. Did Scream feature much political meaning? In some respects, the film’s only real interest is in itself. In this way, it’s a sheer expression of angst. The bundled anxiety at work in the film even appears in the costume designed for the murderous Ghostface. The totem eschews the blankness of the masks of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers and the open wound that passes for Freddy Krueger’s face and instead evokes the bleak wail of Edvard Munch’s 1893 masterpiece. My apolitical generation may have worried over its own anxiety and shown a tendency to go AWOL from reality, just as social commentary and films like Richard Linklater’s Slacker and Kevin Smith’s Clerks said they did. But the forces of the culture industry helped shape a tendency, easily mated with a love for false conspiracies, toward the gnostic belief that Gen X knew “the rules” of genre, that Craven’s genius in using an overused formula as an actual plot device could also mean that the formulaic could be enjoyed for its own sake. This attitude made MTV’s shamelessly entitled The Real World immensely popular and encouraged the post-Vietnam generation to believe, as had the youth of the roaring twenties, that they invented irony. Scream may have purposefully gazed at its own cinematic navel. But the cultural imperatives that made Craven’s work a hit have an unexamined relationship to Operation Desert Storm. A generation raised by parents who fought in Vietnam or watched it unfold over a decade’s worth of TV dinners and nightly newscasts watched the defeat of Iraq over forty-two days of pizza and beer. Their dawning awareness of current events and their hours playing PC games and Nintendo collided in a conflict often referred to as “the video game war.” A generation’s acquiescence may have appalled aging activists of the anti-war movement of the late 1960s. But Vietnam did not have Desert Storm’s public relations team or high production values. Throughout the twentieth century the U.S. government frequently sought to avoid showing Americans the ruined face of war. But there’s never been such obvious effort to show a false reality of combat as the first invasion of Iraq. The Pentagon carefully crafted palatable and triumphal images the new, content-hungry twenty-four-hour news cycle could release to the American public. Rather than young Americans uncertain of their fate, the public saw images of Patriot missiles striking targets reminiscent of a screenshot of the popular arcade game Missile Command. Only on one or two occasions did actual images seep through, often to suddenly disappear from both public memory and discussion. On February 13, 1991, two guided missiles struck a camouflaged civilian shelter and killed about five hundred people. Dick Cheney, then secretary of defense, declared that it was no mistake and that the shelter had been “plugged into Saddam’s communications network,” whatever that might mean. Even fewer Americans learned about the so-called Highway of Death, a convoy of thousands of retreating Iraqi vehicles bombed and strafed by A-6 Intruders, Apache helicopters, and all manner of American artillery. Perhaps as many as five hundred Iraqi soldiers died in what became more massacre than military operation. These images failed to compete with the satisfying competency of Patriot missiles knocking the dread Scud missiles out of the sky and CNN graphics, complete with sound effects, that entitled the round-the-clock coverage “Showdown in the Gulf.”18 Reality had been thoroughly redacted. Soon after the conflict, documentary film maker Ken Burns asked, rather plaintively, how an event can be remembered with so few photographs. Burns wrote with exasperation that the war seemed a series of “distracting theatrics,” staged in a way that we could see them as if “the war itself might be a wholly owned subsidiary of television.”19 In fact, not remembering the details became the point. The conflict could join the invasion of Grenada and the strike against Panama as a simple story of the last empire standing in the ruins of the twentieth century able to deliver a killing blow against any adversary. If the console game generation’s memory became dazed and confused, they could simply play Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf or the mentally disturbed 8-bit Storm Over the Desert, where tiny American tanks turn a gigantic Saddam Hussein into mush. Nintendo seemed to believe that this was, in fact, a video game war. A Gulf War veteran’s Game Boy (a handheld gaming device), melted into slag, appeared on display in Nintendo’s New York store in 2014. Scream assayed to give us a controllable formula for the slasher film. Americans also considered themselves well-versed in the rules of global slaughter. The extent to which this became true explains why America could become fascinated with a horror movie about horror movies. But even more Americans crowded into theaters to watch a star-spangled, big-budget adaptation of every alien invasion movie ever made. During a moment in the nineties when few Americans could tell you where their country currently intervened in the world, Independence Day opened to a one hundred-million-dollar week. 4.Let’s Nuke the Bastards “EVERY STATION’S making like it’s the 1950s,” exclaims a character in Roland Emmerich’s Independence Day. The line refers to TV screens around the world empty but for a snowstorm of stray signals, interference caused by alien invaders dickering with satellites. It’s also a nod to the film’s fifties roots, as are visual references like the one working television playing The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).20 Emmerich took some big risks. The seemingly invincible alien ships destroy all the major landmarks in Washington, D.C., from the Capitol Building to, in a shot that became iconic, the White House itself. In a dreadful presaging of events already in motion the year the film released, the shadow of the mothership stretches menacingly across the Twin Towers. Emmerich borrows these moments from the exceptionally well-done effects of Ray Harryhausen in Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), but the sensibilities of the 1990s and the post–Jurassic Park power of computer-generated imagery (CGI) made the effect startling.21 Audiences knew that the United States would strike back. American moviegoers brought to the film an attitude shaped by the triumphalism that came with the end of the Cold War and the utter humiliation of the Iraqi army, touted by the Pentagon in a weird reverse propaganda campaign as “the world’s third largest military.” The first act of the film reassures audiences of American prestige with establishing shots of patriotic images that we won’t see destroyed in the film, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Marine Corps War Memorial, and shots of crisp, rather outsized America flags snapping angrily in the wind. Most films that want to make the kind of box office numbers Independence Day did must offer a consensus narrative. That is, they can’t offer political diatribes for either the left or right. The heroic president played by Bill Pullman is presented to us as neither a Republican or Democrat, his youthful optimism and experience as a pilot in the Gulf War making him a mash-up of what people liked about Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush while transcending the many failings of both. Will Smith’s role as a Marine pilot seemed a quick salute to growing conversations about diversity even if there’s no allusion to racism in the film. Smith, extremely popular with white audiences for his accessible hip-hop and his sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, acts the role of the top gun who helps save the day. The film’s producers never even considered Chuck D, Ice Cube, or anyone that signified real political meaning in Black culture. In fact, white actor Ethan Hawke was the only other star in the running. Even UFO conspiracy buffs found something in the film for them, as we inevitably go back to Roswell (the latest round of books on the topic had just appeared) to learn that the government cover-up was real and that the alien ship captured in the fifties will help America carry out the president’s wish to “nuke the bastards.” Cover-ups are important and maybe keeping the American public out of the loop wasn’t right but, hey, at least it saved America (and, of course, prevented a mass extinction event). Two aspects of Independence Day made it especially appealing in the aftermath of the Gulf War. In a reiteration of audience expectations shaped by the video game war of 1991, the film celebrated the American military but, visually and in dialogue, put more focus on America’s hardware, much as the Patriot missiles became the heroes in the war with Iraq. There are some American heroes on screen but, as with the Gulf War, they are never detached from their weapons of mass destruction. F-18 fighters, tactical nuclear weapons, stealth bombers, helicopter gunships, and even an early allusion to cyber warfare . . . almost all weapons Americans had met and applauded in the “crisis in the Gulf” are rolled out in Independence Day. Mimicking CNN, the film shows attacks on the aliens on the same green-hued night-vision screens that created what looked like, but wasn’t, a bloodless fireworks show over Baghdad. Second, the film’s use of the terminology and American mentality of the Gulf War goes far beyond these cues. Independence Day helped shape the summer blockbuster’s penchant for catastrophic yet bloodless violence. Emmerich’s catastroflick includes an unhinged moment in which the president’s chief military advisor assures him that a plan to explode nuclear missiles all over the United States to take out the invaders is basically sound. The cities have all been deserted, he tells the president, and confidently announces that “civilian casualties should be down to a minimum.” There’s nothing in the film that breaks the spell by questioning this bullshit. Finally, George H. W. Bush’s feeling that the Vietnam Syndrome had been “kicked” gets a troubling reiteration in Independence Day. Randy Quaid plays Casse, an alcoholic and generally clownish veteran of Vietnam. Volunteering to fly against the alien ships in one final effort to “nuke the bastards,” Casse announces, in a sepulchral-sounding echo of his generation’s disastrous war, “Hello, boys, I’m back.” He sacrifices himself to save Gen X and their children, a deeply cruel suggestion that perhaps he should have made such a noble sacrifice in Southeast Asia thirty years before. Independence Day represented slack-jawed awe at American military power, at times evoking some of the worst angels of our nature, and joined an established cinematic tradition of portraying Vietnam veterans as troubled, dangerous, and disposable (The Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Rambo: First Blood). Independence Day outdid Forrest Gump in both ticket sales and its indifference to the wounds it reopened and the ideas it celebrated. Horror science fiction in American culture soon took new and more interesting turns, asking some of the philosophical questions Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke offered in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Soviet science fiction pondered for decades (Solaris, 1972). American sci-fi horror turned toward political satire that held a frightening mirror to America’s role in the real world (Annihilation, Arrival, District 9, Sunshine, Moon). These films avoided simplistic tales of aliens as marauding invaders or peaceful “space brothers.” This change owed a lot, more than has been credited, to a director known for over-the-top films that made exploitation mainstream and a satirical reading of a Robert A. Heinlein classic the late grand master had meant with deadly seriousness. 5.Very Pretty Space Fascists DUTCH DIRECTOR Paul Verhoeven believes strongly in using violence in film. In his view, a refusal to show violence did more to inure the public to real-world violence than hiding what the mangled and dead human form looked like. He once told James Cameron that whenever a filmmaker suggested his work “too violent,” he told them their movies probably “weren’t violent enough.” Verhoeven had blended graphic sex with over-the-top mayhem and served it with slapdash social commentary since the 1970s. The nineties seem the decade American cinema was ready for him . . . sort of. Basic Instinct (1992) did become a (kind of) cultural touchstone, setting off a craze for neo-noir psychosexual thrillers—Alfred Hitchcock meets the grind house. The director’s Showgirls (1995) became a touchstone of a different kind, a schlocky farrago of a movie that won seven of the satirical Golden Raspberry Awards given for “the worst films of the year.” Subsequently, the film won some grudging respect for its willful banality, its intentionally superficial obsession with Vegas glitz, bad music, and sentimental outbursts. What film critic Naveen Kumar calls the “deliberate mess” of the film echoed the vacuity of nineties white American culture. Verhoeven’s post-Showgirls decision to adapt Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers may seem highly peculiar. Actually, it made perfect sense. Graphic violence must play a role in any nod to Heinlein’s orgiastic celebration of patriotic genocide, fulfilling the 1950s cinematic traditional assumption that the alien must be destroyed and that a scientific and military elite could band together to do it. These are the “rules” that Verhoeven followed but, perhaps more diligently than Wes Craven in Scream, he subverted these prescriptions. What if, he wondered, I made a sci-fi movie about “fascists who aren’t aware of their fascism”?22 Starship Troopers did for shoot-’em-up science fiction what Scream did for slasher films. Verhoeven saw in Heinlein’s work exactly what Heinlein wanted his readers to see in 1959, a message about discipline, violence, and the glories of a militarized state. Verhoeven, too bored by Heinlein’s novel to finish it, combined that message with his own experience as a youth in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and his belief that militarism seeped into the groundwater of American entertainment, opinion, and corporate power. The result is a film in which the characters feel empty because they are. The monsters are silly because the real monsters are the young, lovely, unthinking death dealers who never question orders or even question why they are not questioning orders. The enemies that Earth has long been at war with for reasons that remain unclear are the Bugs. This designation recalls American racist tropes directed at Japanese soldiers that, combined with the Japanese sense of their own cultural superiority, created the utter savagery of the Pacific War. The exposition we receive that frames the film, videos posted on some future version of the internet, are Big Brother fireside chats presented in a soothing male AI voice. Indeed, the point seems to be that fascism will come in such a pleasantly instructive fashion that you’ll barely feel the boot in your face forever. Roger Ebert complained that Verhoeven created “the most violent kiddie movie ever made.” He does admit the film contains some “sly satire” but found it off-putting that the main characters seem unable to reflect on why they are at war with the Bugs and appear “soulless.” He then makes what could only be described as an invidious comparison to George Lucas’s universe, certainly a poor juxtaposition not only because they are very different films but because the bad guys in the Star Wars universe are barely disguised fascists themselves.23 One of America’s most respected critics missed that Verhoeven wanted to play it straight in hopes of making audiences appalled at the film’s attractive heroes who unthinkingly accept the violent logic of fascism. The actors are carved out of the shiny polymer of youthful sexuality and include the nineties platonic ideal of male heteronormative fantasy, Denise Richards. These pretty space Nazis remain secure in their rancid xenophobia, utter devotion to the state, and passion for violence to the very end. Perhaps the film’s time simply had not come. David Roth wrote about the cult classic for The New Yorker in 2020 and noted that the theme of endless and indecisive war describes the last two decades of American life. Critic Phil Coldiron called it “one of the greatest of all anti-imperialist films.” Calum Marsh described the film in the November 2013 issue of The Atlantic as undermining Heinlein’s “saber-rattling” with “archetypes on loan from teen soaps and young-adult fiction.” Verhoeven’s satire remains controversial with science fiction and horror fans. The director used a machete to dig into the divided mind of sci-fi, a violent corpus callosotomy that left synapses dangling but still vibrating painfully. Heinlein defenders saw the film as a betrayal. They failed to recognize that Verhoeven’s parody worked because he took the book literally. Another arguably much larger group of fans knew exactly what the film did and grew up with a sense that sci-fi could wield the chain saw too. 6.Unadorned Butchery THE HORROR of a war without meaning against monsters of our own making had been examined by Joe Haldeman in The Forever War. Like so many Vietnam veterans, Haldeman felt no desire to go to war. A pacifist, he had been studying at the University of Maryland pursuing his twin interests in physics and astronomy, disciplines to which he’d later add an MFA. His interest in creative writing baffled his professors, who urged him to take more courses in advanced differential equations. Telling them he had an interest only in “garden variety differential equations,” he did some of his first writing and published a story later adapted by the eighties Twilight Zone reboot. After graduating in 1967, he was drafted to serve as a combat engineer. His family was in Montreal when his Selective Service notice arrived. He and his wife discussed staying in Canada, moving to Sweden, or possibly even accepting a prison sentence. He decided against these options because of a lifelong dream of working for NASA that resisting the draft would destroy. He said he always wanted “to be a spaceman.”24 Haldeman would never achieve this in a literal sense, and he probably knew that as he dropped into a so-called hot LZ (a landing zone under fire). The author remembers forgetting everything he thought he’d learned from war movies and simply running in the direction he heard English being spoken. But he mostly recalled the smell of the dead. Like veterans of every industrialized mass murder of the last century, his memory became a cubist painting that ignored linear space and insisted that the eye read its surroundings as one simultaneous explosion of visual excess. Haldeman’s own synesthesia of violence included the smell of nearby bodies that he would forever associate with roadkill and noticing the way that one of the corpse’s feet twisted at uncomfortable-looking angles. It would not be Haldeman’s last experience with the dead stacked after combat. The pacifist left Vietnam with a Purple Heart and an even stronger distaste, if deeper understanding, of military adventurism. The Forever War became the science fiction classic Haldeman ensorcelled from the chaos of his experience. First published in 1974, it won essentially every single award for achievement in science fiction. It told a story recognizable to readers of Robert A. Heinlein but one that drew very different conclusions. Private William Mandella shares the same fictional DNA as Heinlein’s space marines but fights with an awareness that he knows little about Earth’s Tauran enemies other than the fact that they must be destroyed. He calls the first encounter he takes part in “murder, unadorned butchery . . . We had just herded them up and slaughtered them.” By the end of the novel, we learn that Earth’s military industrial complex fought what becomes a thousand-year conflict because a militarized society promised big defense contracts. At some point over the centuries, not unlike the illogic of the American empire, the economy simply became a war economy. Life without the war became unimaginable.25 Haldeman has called his work “social satire” but disavowed the idea of being a sci-fi prophet. In the late 1990s, he wrote a follow-up to The Forever War, a much more optimistic and even spiritual work called Forever Peace. It never received the recognition of his earlier work, perhaps because he had, in fact, been too much of a prophet. Discussions of a war without end waged for confusing reasons opened the American empire’s new century. 7.Apocalypse, Right Now HOPEFUL PROPHETS of the 1990s promised “the end of history.” This chilling phrase actually expressed some of the more optimistic assertions about the post–Cold War world, particularly the belief that free markets and democracy would work in tandem to end ethnic conflict and political authoritarianism. R.E.M.’s anthem “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” seemed like the cue music for the whole decade. But not everyone was so sure or felt especially fine. Horror certainly took an apocalyptic turn. Independence Day played with the idea, but so did films of mass destruction like Deep Impact (1998) and the straightforwardly named Armageddon (1998). Both films imagined destruction on a global scale. Deep Impact, about a meteor creating an extinction-level event that wipes out the East Coast of the United States, showed viewers images of the leveling of cities that horror films, traditional disaster movies, and even superhero franchises soon made a commonplace of cineplex entertainment. Such images battered us so incessantly after 9/11 that Village Voice film critic Bilge Ebiri could say of the unending flood tide of CGI catastrophe, “It’s the end of the world as we know it—and I feel tired.”26 Roland Emmerich, meanwhile, parlayed the success of Independence Day to direct what he hoped would become the ultimate monster disaster film, a nineties iteration of Godzilla for American audiences. The 1954 classic imagined a creature of primeval history roused from the seabed by American nuclear tests. Japan, the target of the only atomic weapon attacks in history, must suffer again at the hands of a monster created by Americans. That version of the story disappears in Emmerich’s hot take. It’s an illegal test by the French government that awakens the creature, making the United States, with its world-destroying nuclear arsenal, a victim of European maleficence when the creature finally makes its way to American shores. Cue massive explosions and catastrophic destruction, violence both impossible to comprehend in scale yet bloodless in representation. After all’s said and done, the United States wins big. While apoco-disasters in the form of dread cosmic events or monsters rising out of the sea increasingly invested in more and more entertainment real estate, religious fears reminiscent of the satanic panic continued to thrive in the decade. Omen IV appeared and a reboot of the original Omen, slightly updated, went into the works. Demonic children proliferated at an alarming rate, some of them born to become the Antichrist. End of Days, The Devil’s Advocate, and Bless the Child appeared, or went into production, in the late nineties and all shared the basic theme of the devil’s interest in destroying the world. These films reflected the enormous popularity of the Left Behind series, a set of novels that attempted to dramatize the evangelical conception of the end of time using the techno-thriller tricks and tropes of a Tom Clancy tale. Like Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth in the seventies, the books had a reach and a popularity that went far outside the fold of the faithful. The series became a franchise worth hundreds of millions of dollars with films, PC games, and spin-off series in its train. This all seems a bleak side to the promises of nineties cultural functionaries that the world would be shinier and happier. But the fascination with the world’s end, often more stridently asserted and deeply feared than the very real apocalyptic possibilities of the passé Cold War, emerged from roots in the growing divide in American culture. Political, economic, and even cultural power ballooned to such proportions since 1945, and in some respects since 1918, that individuals felt little sense of autonomy and agency. Political apathy abounded while, by the beginning of the twenty-first century, consumption driven by massive debt and inflated real estate equity reached levels unprecedented in human history. The nineties, more than any other decade, encapsulates the disempowerment of Americans, their role as walk-on extras in Theodor Adorno’s “monster documentary.” End-times fiction shared the assumption that most people are either unaware or incapable of dealing with the real horror of the time. Social movements and the organizations that hardwired them went into decline. Voting rates continued a decade-long slide. By 1994, only about a third of eligible voters went to the polls for the midterm elections. In 1996, less than half of registered voters bothered with the presidential contest. Things would probably be fine.27 Five years later, when explosions shook the ground and bodies floated down from the sky as dust and ash, some Americans felt like they were in a movie, or at least watching one. Minutes after the second aircraft slammed into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, devastated eyewitnesses could only say, “It looks like a movie!” The scriptwriter of Armageddon found that the footage of the attack, so similar to the film, gave him “the creeps,” and the director of Die Hard reflected with horror that it looked like one of his movie posters.28 The America that woke up on September 12, 2001, wanted to see itself as a profoundly different epoch, see the change in date as more than simple chronology, chronos, but an emergence of the Greek concept of kairos, ripe time, deep time, time bursting open with meaning, a crack in the geological strata of history that demanded decisive action. Commentators went so far as to suggest that human communication would have to do without irony after the experience. Others suggested that good and evil as categories had come back (as if they’d ever gone away). American culture would be “Rockwellian” again, a reference to the maudlin paintings of Norman Rockwell that featured happy and humorous scenes of a bygone, very white America of soda fountains and sentimental references to family, church, childhood, and dogs. Horror would rip the stitches off this attempt at cultural revanchism. Films that dealt directly with 9/11 failed at the box office. Meanwhile, some of the goriest, most disturbing, and intentionally subversive horror films ever made began to, as Victoria McCollum wrote, engage politics to such a degree that they “vigorously [pummeled] at the audience’s skull with the viciousness of each new atrocity.”29 Eli Roth’s Hostel (2005) generally gets slated into the category of “torture porn,” a phrase so gruesome it seems to have a bad odor wafting out of it. Hostel is much more than this though, a film that, like James Wan’s Saw franchise, sponged up the era’s paranoia and fed it back to audiences as a hellbroth. At a moment when American culture could actually conduct a public debate about the legality of torturing suspected terrorists, suspected accomplices of terrorists, and people suspected to know something about terrorists and their accomplices, the film stripped audiences of their sympathy for young, pretty Americans abroad who themselves became targets of torture. Whatever you think of the ethics of such a gory display, it’s impossible to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of the boundary-busting film. Dominick Suzanne-Mayer wrote in 2016 that Hostel became a hit with millennials like himself, as it seemed to fit the bizarre tone of the times when “Lee Greenwood’s ‘Proud to Be an American’ could be piped in over crackling junior high school PA systems for months on end, daily, and nobody ever really stopped to interrogate how surreal the whole thing was.”30 Audiences walked away from Roth’s disturbing masterpiece with complex feelings about what they had seen. Foreign places are dangerous, un-American, and to be disdained. Yet the film also conveyed the sense that the Americans who walked around like they owned these places got everything they deserved. Suzanne-Mayer says this may have been little more than the feeling that “the rest of the world is scary, huh?,” but this at least left more space for rumination than the president of the United States saying things like, “I’m amazed that . . . people would hate us. I, like most Americans, I just can’t believe it, because I know how good we are.”31 Horror increasingly made the point that we had little to brag about. Films such as Rob Zombie’s The Devil’s Rejects (2005) not only questioned American exceptionalism, they suggested the worst of us maybe understood the world we’d made much better than the millions who bought a Toby Keith CD to hear him serenade the globe with lyrics like, “we’ll put a boot in your ass / It’s the American way.” The Devil’s Rejects follows up Zombie’s macabre blood carnival of a tribute to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre called House of 1000 Corpses. But Rejects stands on its own in many respects, part outlaw western and part thrill-kill horror. The Firefly family are the Manson commune if “the Family” actually cared about one another. Indeed, the character Otis makes use of Tex Watson’s LSD-induced proclamation “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business” during one nearly unwatchable sequence. It’s so truly violent that it’s a difficult film to endure with some especially egregious scenes that the actors and Zombie himself struggled to film. The whole thing seemed to make critics feel dirty. Reviewers rattled away at their keyboards in a blood-vessel-popping rage about the film’s nihilism in a nation that, only a year before, looked at images of physical and sexual torture from Abu Ghraib prison, where American soldiers had done something witchy with detainees. It’s more of a commentary on America than the film itself that critics could suggest that The Devil’s Rejects had no social and cultural meaning because of its “sickening, socially irresponsible glorification of depraved and sadistic behavior.” Had they been keeping up with the news? Did they know that the image of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi standing hooded on a box, electric wires inserted all over his body, arms extended as if in preparation for crucifixion, went from confrontation with human evil to an offensive meme on American social media platforms within days? Zombie could have replied to critics with the words of his idol Tobe Hooper, “it’s really about America.”32 “Sickening” films like The Devil’s Rejects offered a way to speak about what had become of America’s imperial endeavors at a time when the public square demanded consensus and obedient acceptance to the oddly named “war on terror.” Roth and Zombie offered relief from relentless images of America as victim and vengeful crusader. This construction of the world allowed for the unspoken assumptions of American power since 1945 to become fully public. Hours after the September 11 attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent a memo to aides that proclaimed it time to “go massive—sweep it all up, things related and not.” The attempt to twist the world completely to American wishes defined the next two decades of American life.33 8.Al-Qaedzilla THE TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY American empire made no excuses. Bush said it out loud, telling a graduating class at West Point that the United States must always remain “ready for preemptive action” against “unbalanced dictators.” This enthusiasm for unilateral invasion became the so-called Bush Doctrine, the assurance that the United States would take military action against any power in the world that might threaten the American order of things. War became, as Mark Danner describes it in his important book Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War, “unbounded in space and time.”34 The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have proven disastrous. Perhaps as many as two hundred thousand civilians have been killed in Iraq alone. “Regime change” created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of ISIS and the intervention of Russia on behalf of Syria’s brutal Assad regime. The dead zone of Iraq has strengthened the hand of Saudi Arabia, arguably the world’s most repressive regime, an autocratic monarchy with economic and territorial ambitions that has successfully linked itself to the United States. The withdrawal from Afghanistan fulfilled an agreement with the Taliban made by President Trump in February 2020. Most Americans are unaware that U.S. troops continue to dominate much of the Middle East with no fewer than twenty-three air and naval bases and an unknown number of “black sites” maintained by the CIA in the former Soviet republics. Some of these bases are like small, heavily armed American cities. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar hosts eleven thousand U.S. troops, ensures near total dominance of airspace across most of the region, and features amenities that include two movie theaters, a huge swimming pool, most major American fast-food chains, and lounges with names like the Kasbah, the Zink, and the Fox Sports Skybox. Like Fort Laramie in the nineteenth century and Guantanamo Bay in the twentieth, Al Udeid announces that America is here to stay.35 America would kill all the monsters that threatened “the homeland.” Horror films sometimes attended to the need to assure the public this was so. As a filmmaker, Steven Spielberg was always eager to comfort the zeitgeist. Since Jaws he has been frightening Americans to make them feel better, producing films that even massaged dire historical realities into buddy movies and family dramas. Alien invasions became friends visiting from the stars. Schindler’s List allowed the Holocaust, as critic Akiva Gottlieb put it, to be told in a story about a “Nazi who has a change of heart.”36 War of the Worlds (2005) continued this pattern amid a ruined landscape that magnified the destruction of 9/11 beyond all imagining. And yet, Spielberg ends the film with a virus ex machina that kills the aliens. J. J. Abrams’s Cloverfield (2008) also told a tale of mass destruction by an enormous but shadowy horror. The Village Voice noted that the film’s avalanche of ruin could have come “from the CNN archive,” an attack from what the reviewer snarkily called “al-Qaedzilla.” America the allegedly indomitable had come under the attack of nameless, faceless, and vague entities. No one who watches the carnage of Spielberg’s aliens or Abrams’s kaiju worries about “blowback.” There’s no cause, we are the victims, they must hate our freedoms, and nothing but apathy and hoping for the best can be done. 9.Ghosting in Spook Country THE CONTOURS of empire may not have changed that much in the twenty-first century. But the ways in which the United States defended its global system did. As journalist and historian Nick Turse writes, the State Department, presidential administrations, and even political candidates have bragged for years about the cyber warfare capabilities of the United States. Turse describes “the military’s secret military,” the enormous, and growing, phenomenon of cyber warfare units, drone bases, and special forces.37 William Gibson’s Spook Country (2007) may be the only kind of spy novel that matters in the age of imperial cyberspace. Dead drops and the occasional GRU assassination might still make news, but the world of espionage could no longer exist without a humming digital homunculus, a hive of hundreds of millions occupying almost every single gigabyte of technology’s white zones. A simple phone conversation by Gibson’s protagonist summons possibilities more chilling than “the call is coming from inside the house” analog terror of When a Stranger Calls. Sitting in a Starbucks, she is “afraid to trust her own phone and the net stretching out from it, strung through those creepy fake trees . . . the net of telephony, all digitized, and all, she had to suppose, listened to.” Cloaks and daggers had been replaced by bots and malware. The attacks of 9/11 transmogrified the heady predictions of life online from dreams of an interconnected world to a nightmare of illusion, surveillance, and loss of self. Independence Day gave us the new notion of computer viruses imagined as the key to defeating an alien invasion. When the film launched in 1996, only a little over 30 percent of American households featured a personal computer. A decade later, the danger of viruses to everything from bank accounts to political stability became a common problem, so common it did not always receive the public discussion it deserved. Unless you bricked your computer in 2007 by opening a file that claimed to be a breaking news story, you may not remember Storm Worm. Originating in Russia, Storm Worm compromised ten million personal computers in six months. The email subject lines that duped computer users are themes from the darkest fantasies of the internet, including “British Muslims Genocide” or “Radical Muslim drinking enemies’ blood!” Even the more mundane subject lines the virus used, like “Re: Your text” proved impossible to ignore. The subject line appeared utterly chilling in an age when relationships and careers could end with ill-considered words typed into the ether. Ghost has become a common verb in America’s online vocabulary. Drawn from the idea of a spirit world where restless souls appear and then wink out into the black, to be ghosted means that another person has disappeared from your life—messages unread, texts unreturned, and the seeming community of social media a false front behind which lies a vast ruin. Family, friends, and romantic partners can all ghost, can become hidden from sight in the disconnections of digital interfaces. You can be “unfriended” in an almost ritualistic manner, a combination of public shaming and sacral excommunication. The psychological costs are impossible to tabulate in such an online world where relationships of all kinds can acquire a surprising intensity only to vanish and become weightless, shadows with no mass or circumference. We use the language of horror to describe the connections we hope never to make in the interconnected world. There are those who become ghosts, leaving behind nothing but strange half memories in a deleted files folder. Or we might also face a troll lying in wait beneath the virtual infrastructure of the web. These encounters can range in viciousness from nasty snark aimed at strangers to bullying, stalking, and attempting to destroy another person’s finances or reputation. Although tales from old salts on the cyber sea are rare, and unconfirmed, the idea of “mermaiding” suggests wily women out to use their siren song, by which I mean the offer of nude pics, to monetize their social media accounts. The fear of this possibility draws on the horror of the sea creature cuteified beyond recognition but taken back to its frightening roots in films like Night Tide (1963) and Robert Eggers’s The Lighthouse (2019). You can even meet a zombie online, or at least someone can zombie you. In a peculiar reenactment of the Freudian horror of “the return of the repressed,” romantic attachments gone missing in the digital ossuary suddenly reappear. Perhaps having ghosted you before, they suddenly return to frightful life, wanting to recreate some virtual version of a past connection, a dead thing living inside the synthezoid brain of your hard drive. People have always abandoned one another. Ghosting could, at one time, simply mean refusing to pick up the phone. But there are very real differences, largely shaped by the ease of online contact. A feeling of freedom, of anonymity, of the sense that it’s your gothic double that acts for you in online interactions, allows for a sense of weightlessness to relationships, that they are ephemeral and ethereal. This offers a heady brew for people hungry for, and afraid of, intimacy. It’s the absolute desiderata for sociopaths. But are the intricacies of human relationships really damaged on a large scale by such behavior? After many discussions of online life “eroding empathy” or the dangers of “screen time,” are we more likely to objectify people now rather than earlier periods when economic elites grew fat off of World War I or the Industrial Revolution? Genocide had become a method of state-building long before the personal computer, much less social media. There’s not a clear answer, yet, to whether personal devices have rewired our brains in a “post-human,” or maybe sub-human, experience of the world. But we do know the digital world of ghosts and zombies have affected social institutions and political consciousness. Meeting up with a troll or a mermaid online could have terrifying personal consequences. But cyber life’s uncanny mixture of solitude and intimacy, connections with people that appear to have depth but can be brutally voided in a text or DM, and its ability to make fantasy into a hyperreality have very real implications for the United States as both a nation-state and an empire. The titans who have made vast fortunes and exert extraordinary power over much of the world’s resources implicitly understand that the digital world has become empire’s new frontier. Even the games we play carry this lethal message. 10.Zombie Black Ops UNRELENTING HORDES march from all directions. They are an unstoppable threat to American power. In fact, you will die trying to kill them. There’s not a way to win and you know the endless army of the dead will take you. This does not describe a particular scenario in the revival of the zombie apocalypse film after 9/11, a renaissance that included an aging George A. Romero doing some of his best work since the seventies. Instead, it’s the most popular gaming mode of the Call of Duty series, a cultural phenomenon since 2003. Beginning with a popular first-person shooter (FPS) approach to World War II, Activision updated the game almost every single year since its inception. The zombie mode has appeared in almost every new version of the game, players sometimes staging minor online revolts against the developers when they don’t receive it. The insistence on supernatural zombies and horror film scenarios in what has over the years aimed at being in other respects a stomach-churningly realistic military simulation seems to require some explanation. We could chalk it up to the sheer popularity of zombie films, novels, TV shows, and comics in the twenty-first century. Does putting a military shooter together with zombies simply represent peanut butter and chocolate logic, the simple math that two things we like are better than one? Maybe. But only if Call of Duty had not become the most egregious example of what at least one scholar has called “games of empire.” It’s a series designed to reenact, and ruthlessly celebrate, the extension of American power all over the globe. The killing of monsters, by the hundreds and even by the thousands, has become the game’s trademark. So has a devotion to give an outlet for one set of political views, redacting history to explain away imperial maleficence. The use of horror, especially in the unstoppable waves of the undead, assumes a frightening role in the real world of empire.38 Gaming might appear very far removed from the realities of political and ethical life. You will find a troll or two in online gaming, a stranger who deems you a “noob” and expresses some profane opinions about your mother’s morality and their supposed overfamiliarity with her. But there’s more happening than the occasional ill-natured gamer, including the serious matter of cyberbullying. Beyond these interpersonal cruelties, gaming online has often acted as manservant to the aims of empire, an infomercial for some of the worst ideological assumptions in American life. Resident Evil became, in the late twentieth century and continuing to today, the most popular survival horror franchise and one of the most popular console and PC games period. Spawning nine films and sixteen games (depending on how you count the various remakes, reboots, and episodic content), it gave players a way to live out their apocalyptic zombie fantasies while introducing some real-world ideas including biological weapons, corporate maleficence, and the American government’s addiction to weapons of mass destruction. In the original title, produced in Japan in 1996, the evil Umbrella Corporation produced the bioweapon known as the T-virus for its major client, the U.S. government. The T-virus outbreak in the ludicrously named town of Raccoon City leads to a missile strike that annihilates the zombified town in an homage to Romero’s critique of corporate and government villainy in his film The Crazies (1973). Subsequently, the series frequently celebrates American military power. Heroic special forces units are dispatched later in the series to deal with outbreaks. In the 2009 game Resident Evil 5, a heavily stylized “Africa” becomes another foreign geography in which square-jawed white Americans (in this case a government agent named Chris who mingles frat boy Aryanism with a linebacker physique) fight off hordes of enmonstered African bodies hurled against them, an update of some nineteenth-century colonial stand-off in Sudan or South Africa. The imperial assumptions of the game take us back to the racism of the Hollywood “jungle adventure.” Like the zombie republics imagined by Hollywood throughout the last hundred years, the gamer visits an ill-defined and homogenized Africa, an unnamed state that geographically appears sub-Saharan and politically recently gained independence from its colonial rulers. The latter point seems important in the game only because it can inject into the narrative the idea of African nations being unable to care for themselves and in need of a living action figure like Chris, whose military skill set serves a bizarre trinity of global powers. Chris is a well-armed agent of, I kid you not, the U.S. government, the UN, and the American pharmaceutical industry. Resident Evil 5 appeared at a time when the United States took an increased interest in numerous African nations. Since the end of the Cold War, and the end of widespread Soviet and Cuban influence in much of the continent, America sought to flex its muscles. Under Clinton, the United States offered economic incentives to countries with “a market-based economy that protects private property rights.” Neoliberal think tanks developed an economic and political Geiger counter that used seventeen different indicators that would allow an African nation a favorable trade relationship with the United States. Some of these indicators sound benign and even idealistic, like “political pluralism” and “equal protection under the law.” Other mandates the United States sought to impose are far less disinterested, including “the elimination of barriers to United States trade and investment” as well as a much more generalized demand that no participating nation “engage in activities that undermine United States national security or foreign policy interests.”39 In the early years of the Obama administration, American operations in Africa sent thousands of highly trained Chrises all over the continent through the auspices of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The interservice effort, born in the 1980s, has become integral to uniting all the country’s covert war-fighting capabilities. Operating with no regard to international boundaries and cooperating with agencies that include the CIA, the NSA, and even the FBI, members of SEAL Team Six and Delta Force have killed or kidnapped alleged terrorists with impunity. Journalist Jeremy Scahill in his book Dirty Wars insists that the Obama administration “let JSOC off the leash” in a way that the Bush administration never did. The lack of oversight built into the interagency effort made removing the harness from the dogs of war no more complicated than the stroke of a pen.40 In the dirty wars of the twenty-first century, Call of Duty has a popularity even beyond Resident Evil. Its zombie component makes it something of a survival horror game that also assures players of the power and virtue of the American empire. Once the early games moved beyond the era of World War II, they increasingly focused on the geopolitical present in the “Modern Warfare” series. The premise of Call of Duty, particularly in its “Black Ops” iteration, has been that the protection of ill-defined American interests requires extralegal action and what we might call a broad sense of morality. In other words, a legitimation for how the American empire already behaves. In 2020, Call of Duty made more explicit claims for its real-world relevance in Black Ops Cold War. Using the tag line “Know your history,” the game received criticism for its triumphalist take on America in the Cold War. In its single-player story line, the narrative bundles the Reagan administration’s support for Latin American death squads and the highly illegal Iran-Contra arms pipeline into a realpolitik of “saving the free world.”41 If you don’t get the message, Ronald Reagan appears in the game to reassure you, the late president eerily rendered so that his recognizable voice seems to echo to you, a lonely cowboy dirge carried by the winds across the uncanny valley. Reagan not only grants immense levels of moral latitude to the players, the dead president’s avatar explains to the devoted player that he has been the one to set his imprimatur on the many past adventures of the Black Ops team. “You have been given a great task,” Reagan’s avuncular tone explains, “protecting our very way of life from a great evil.” This sounds like a Reagan remix, his language about empires of evil and the threat of the Soviet Union laid across the repetitive bass beat of a utopian conception of free markets. But Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War pumps up the volume. It offers a platform to an eighties conspiracy theorist who has played such an important role in forming the idea of alt-right that extremist YouTubers have celebrated his appearance in the game.42 Yuri Bezmenov defected from the Soviet Union in the early seventies. Working for a time for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he became best known for publications in the 1980s of various books supposedly outlining the KGB’s interest in so-called active measures that destabilize the culture and the economy. Obviously, most espionage services engage in such actions. But Bezmenov used this truism to make an argument about American domestic politics. He suggested that the Soviets favored the support of feminism and the civil rights struggle to damage their enemy from within. In a 1984 interview, Bezmenov insisted that “hippies” represented rot from within that would prepare the way for a real-world Red Dawn. He railed against the strides for what he called “civil rights for homosexuals,” a movement that gathered power in the eighties but that Bezmenov insisted the KGB crafted to distract the American public. He classed both feminism and the civil rights movements as American failings that the KGB could use to “soften up” the country.43 A redacted version of this interview appears in the teaser for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Also featured are scenes of social unrest that are given no political context. It’s a bizarre commercial for the game to include given the source, especially when there’s really no lack of strident anti-communist speeches from the likes of Churchill, JFK, and Reagan himself. So why choose a right-wing star to narrate the alleged “unrest” of the eighties? Call of Duty developers have a history of building bridges with the far right. In 2014, they enlisted Oliver North as a consultant for the game Black Ops II and featured him as a voice actor playing himself in a segment of the game. North also appeared in an infomercial for the game that adopts the tone of a documentary, in which the disgraced Marine lieutenant colonel worries about a future in which “America’s enemies” use its own high-tech weapons against it. This seems shameless given North’s role in, and conviction for, selling American weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to guerillas in Nicaragua. Shameless and yet also entirely inductive given the peculiar role that Call of Duty has played in relation to the internal life of the American military. Since the beginning of the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, the army has worked actively with military FPS games to use them as tools for recruitment. In 2014, Dave Anthony, a writer for the Call of Duty series, left his job in the video game industry to become a consultant at the Pentagon in order to encourage, in his own words, “outside-the-box thinking.” One example of such thinking is his suggestion that covert ops groups go in deep cover at American high schools in order to prevent terrorist attacks. The Pentagon returned the favor and built a beneficial relationship with game developers. The Pentagon allowed members of SEAL Team Six to provide consultation and even write dialogue for Call of Duty.44 And the zombies keep coming. In the context of what Roger Stahl has called “militainment,” the zombies might feel like an afterthought. In fact, they replicate Call of Duty’s basic premise: the American nation-state must employ overwhelming force of all kinds, legitimize any violence, and generally stride the world as a colossus because America’s enemies surge in overwhelming hordes. There’s no way to finally “win” the enormously popular zombie maps. The player must face wave after wave of the undead, finally succumbing. The point, as with the whole franchise, is to rack up body count. Call of Duty’s most popular mode of play easily slides into the real-world aspects of the game. It’s all zombie mode in a way, indiscriminate slaughter in which “saving the free world” and “keeping America safe” are the only rules of engagement. The game instructs its players that the monsters will keep shambling toward you and you have to keep killing them. It’s Bill Clinton’s Operation Infinite Reach, George W. Bush’s Operation Infinite Justice, or more simply Joe Haldeman’s idea of “a forever war.” There’s no conceivable endgame. How could the American empire eliminate evil, particularly with evil understood as destroying every possible challenge to American power? The zombies that stumble toward us forever in Call of Duty are there to shoot, their mindlessness reflecting the equally thought-free logic of FPS games. The games not only give legitimacy to empire’s crimes, they encourage players to see the world the way an empire sees it. The U.S. military fought for the United Fruit Company, to enforce free market principles on global trade, and to control the flow of petroleum from Latin America, the Middle East, and the Caspian Sea. But, at a certain point, all these individual goals transformed into a single unending struggle for American dominance. Defense contractors, politicians, and average Americans came to believe they are fighting enemies in infinite mode and that, as in Haldeman’s The Forever War, they are propelled by nothing more than the purblind logic of terminal velocity. We sit in front of our screens, absorbing it all, tacitly saying yes to the power of national security states that ask not just for obedience, but for our enthusiasm. 11.Digital Demons THIS IS not the world we were supposed to live in. If you listened to the evangelical heralds of tech globalization, the boundless optimism of the eighties and nineties taught you to believe Silicon Valley created, in the parlance of the era, “an information superhighway.” Marshall McLuhan may be best known for his claim in the 1960s that a convergence of technologies insured that “the medium is the message.” However, he also gave us that well-worn term global village in his 1962 book The Gutenberg Galaxy to describe the interconnection made viable by technology. But it’s a phrase very much out of step with the internet’s rhetoric about itself. For McLuhan, the global village meant a loss of privacy, of sophistication, of separating fact from reality through careful reading and contemplation, a digital return to what Marx called “the idiocy of rural life.” But now the provincial hamlet is your favorite social media platform or the bubble of commentary and commerce that you hermit into. The dark carnival rolled into the global village in the small hours, and few knew what lay behind the sideshows and blowoffs, the games and the gags. The barkers made as if the world could be bought for a dime, and they seduced us with partial truths. John Sculley, Apple’s CEO, perhaps came the closest to understanding the meaning of the wireless connected world. It will be, he said in mythic language, “the mother of all markets.” Sculley made his comments at a gathering of personal computer entrepreneurs in New York City in the summer of 1992, a moment when the corporate entities soon to become world powers on the digital landscape decided to invest their energy into “a handheld box operated by pen, or even voice commands.” Such a revolutionary device might be called, these soon-to-be billionaires suggested, “wireless widgets,” “wallet computers,” or “digital information appliances.”45 We are aware that such devices have taken over our lives. There are 290 million smart phones in the Unites States. When we subtract users of burner phones and young children using parental devices from the remaining number of outliers, we are clearly a country thoroughly wired. We’ve all been, in the threatening-sounding dialect of the nineties, “jacked in.” Much-needed attention has been paid to the emotional and existential costs of this kind of lifestyle. Horror stories of the real dangers posed by cyber life have been documented, cautionary tales and “what if?” scenarios that can make logging on to an app feel like agreeing to meet a stranger in a dark, secluded place. We’ve also become aware of the dangers online life offers to an increasingly fragile democracy in the American nation-state. It’s incorrect to talk of the possible “destruction of democracy” in the nation, as democracy has always been tentative. Its promises have been limited to the fifty fully annexed and highly gerrymandered states. Black ballots have not counted for most of American history; the votes of women did not count until 1920. Some of the most lethal “active measures,” to use Bezmenov’s phrase, being pursued against American democracy right now are efforts to restrict voting by state legislatures. But even the sorry state of democracy in a country that disenfranchises nearly seven hundred thousand people in the District of Columbia can be exacerbated. There’s no evidence that Russia “hacked” the election in 2016 or tried the same in 2020. The work of foreign operatives on social media proved much more serious and effective than risking digital fingerprints on a full-scale voting fraud effort, one that might make cybersecurity experts aware of vulnerabilities that could be used at a later time. Evidence shows that two military units of the GRU, the Russian espionage service, hacked into personal servers of the Democratic National Committee, its volunteers, and even high-ranking Democratic leaders such as John Podesta. Malware harvested over seventy gigabytes of data from a single server in April 2016. In the summer of 2016, Russian security contracted out espionage to a hacker working under the handle Guccifer 2.0 (also known as Fancy Bear). He scored perhaps the most significant data breach of the DNC and began publishing the materials through Facebook, Twitter, and a WordPress blog. In fact, right-leaning Americans met redacted and decontextualized information gleaned from Instagram posts, YouTube channels, Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts. Although they claimed to be sites seeking to defend “Second Amendment rights” or to have an affiliation with state Republican parties, they frequently were simply trolls contracted by the Russian secret service. An investigation by Vietnam Veterans of America produced evidence that troll farms in Macedonia created “Vets for Trump” sites of various platforms while targeting veterans more generally on social media with “Islamophobic” and “xenophobic” sentiments. The organization even found evidence that foreign, and some domestic, actors used their names and logos to support the Trump campaign.46 Shadowy Russian affiliates such as the Internet Research Agency (IRA) even created shell sites that labeled themselves as advocacy platforms for LGBTQ+ rights and the Black Lives Matter movement, and then flooded the page with pro-Trump information or general discouragements to vote. The IRA purchased about four thousand Facebook ads for these and similar sites, amounting to about one hundred thousand dollars. By 2017, Facebook had identified 470 accounts run by the company. The GRU and its partners achieved the equivalent of opening a digital sewage valve that flooded American online life with half-truths and absurdities. Perhaps online horror culture unwittingly helped prepare the country for what American intelligence called “the troll farm” that played a highly significant role in 2016. We certainly became accustomed to real-life horror portrayed online, to horror cultures that expressed anxiety about digital life, and to imagining false horrors that help us ignore the very real terrors of a cyber empire. Both mainstream and independent horror films have maintained a persistent interest in the haunted house becoming the haunted computer, or more likely the haunted source code. At least since 1981’s Evilspeak, our screens as portals to hell have been an obvious metaphor. Unfriended, #Horror, Searching, The Den, The Host, Countdown, Followed, Cam, and Friend Request imagine either supernatural evil or serial murderers coming at you through your phone or your desktop. Unfriended may be one of the more interesting examples of this trend as a film, basing itself on the premise that the audience has basic social media literacy and will watch ninety minutes of footage that allows us to see only what the characters see on their digital devices. It’s horror where we are trapped in McLuhan’s global village where none of us asked to live. These films are a conversation about everything we fear from life online: the possibility of an end to privacy, the sense that every stranger who seems aggressive on social media might be something even worse, and the dread of our own digital personas acquiring a life of their own. Since 2016 and the revelation of a massive cybersecurity threat to American elections, the demonic stalkers of Dark Web and Friend Request have taken on an additional viscous layer of dread, oozing out of our screens. Unfortunately, such films have often shared the American solipsism that hides behind its own borders, the tendency to try and sever the natural relationship between the personal and the political. The narcissism of the world of likes and loves and retweets has made these stories even more apolitical, or at least they pretend to be. Friend Request (2016) offers an example of this strenuous self-involvement, illustrated by the film’s insouciance about its own ghastly assumptions. The first few minutes introduce us to the prettiest, most popular, and wealthiest students at an unnamed college, their friendship, romantic life, and adventures performed for the watching world on social media. The single character with some trace of human feeling makes the mistake of offering a modicum of kindness to a black-clad, unattractive outcast with eccentric ideas about personal hygiene. What may have wanted to be a ham-handed parable about cyberbullying fails even at that. Indeed, it seems to encourage the mistreatment of people on the margin of the American class war when they dare seek to connect on social media. The film goes so far as to make the odd-looking goth girl an actual and fairly terrifying witch whose demonic powers can turn computer code into eldritch glyphs, possess Facebook pages, and even turn you into an abandoned social outcast if you dare befriend her. Friend Request even seeks to raise the tension with jump-scare shots of the protagonist’s friends and followers count dropping precipitously. There’s a very real politics of class at work even in an ephemeral film like this one. It wanted to “say something” about social media and, paradoxically, said more than it knew. The wounds of class are often highly visible on American social media. The assumption of economic and cultural capital is behind the power of social influencers and monetized platforms that encourage you to learn “lifestyle hacks,” some not available to tens of millions of American whose low-wage employment denies them the tech and the time. The believability of theatrical posts that render the happiness of home, family, personal success, or travel depends very much on class and status. That such material exists alongside utter howls of tweeted and posted rage offers a clue to the seething sense of grievance that one often finds in online life. Tens of millions of Americans in economic and personal distress are staring through their phone screens and consuming performative happiness enjoyed by those who can afford to stage garish social functions, vacations to exotic locales, images of dinners unaffordable to minimum-wage workers, and romantic relationships perfected, perhaps made possible, by disposable income. McLuhan told IBM in the sixties, when they produced computers mainly to help businesses run payroll, they had entered “the information business” and that the “dossier” maintained in bytes would create for humanity “one big gossip column.” In the world still living outside the screens, Big Brother would depend less on easily recognizable propaganda and more on the democratic impulse dying the death of a thousand distractions. The “one big gossip column” might have led Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to change their famous formulation to “social media and bombs” as the alliance that kept Americans desensitized. When we do look away from a social influencer paid to sell us face soap or the schadenfreude that comes with the digital downfall of a celebrity, we find that the world of cyber warfare tells its tales as simple parables that are easily graspable. In the age when empire has gone online, the defense establishment has encouraged the idea of the United States as victim, unprepared yet fully expecting an online Pearl Harbor. This possibility caused much public handwringing in the national security establishment after 2016. Lieutenant General Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said at a 2019 conference on cybersecurity held in Aspen, Colorado, that such a full-scale cyber assault on the United States had become “kind of the thing that keeps me up at night.”47 There are definitive holes in America’s cybersecurity plans, and a massive and disruptive hack by U.S. adversaries is likely. But much of the public discussion hides the fact that American imperial ambition has made our own cyber offensives the most poorly kept secret in national intelligence. In fact, the United States planned to use computers as war machines even before the internet became a reality. As early as the 1950s, CIA’s Operation Minerva gave the United States the codes for encryption machines sold by the Swiss-based company that produced the clunky coding apparatus that looked like the mating of a fifties cash register and a typewriter. This allowed for spying on a number of Latin American nations and U.S. allies. In 1993, the agency became the major shareholder in the company.48 Obviously, analog coding proved of little use after the PC revolution and the widespread civilian use of the internet. In 2021, it became general knowledge, at least among cybersecurity experts, that Chinese servers had long been targeted by “Trojan” viruses, as well as direct hacks to websites, apps, and online information related to state and military matters. Many of these acts came to light after a major if little-known cyber offensive against Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran in 2018. These actions, even if the public decided not to know about them, are described in some detail in a U.S. Department of Defense official release simply called “Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.” U.S. intelligence services have a similar long history of cyber attacks against Iran, including sallies against civilian and military infrastructure close to the time of writing. Before 2019, a phantasm-like malware called Stuxnet disabled elements of Iran’s nuclear program. Begun under George W. Bush and fully developed in the first year of the Obama administration, the insidious digital package replicated itself beyond its original intention in such a way that thousands of hackers could code it anew and unleash it to proliferate.49 Horror wears a technological mask because the online American empire operates in William Gibson’s “spook country.” But that doesn’t mean the macabre has been reduced to a meme. Our dark carnival allows for plenty of terror IRL. In fact, horror films increasingly melt the walls between fact and fiction. 12.Purging “My God, how did it get to this?” —The Purge: Election Year THE AMERICAN empire’s cyber-ops campaigns do not change the reality or the danger of foreign powers dealing another blow to an already wobbly democracy at home. It does place such disinformation in a broader context. Moreover, as Richard A. Clarke warned in his 2010 book Cyber War, the United States, since the 1990s, put all its efforts into offensive tactics and strategy. In a 2012 interview with Smithsonian magazine, he insisted that the United States had made no real preparations to defend its digital infrastructure. It was as if the United States launched the equivalent of several D-Day landings while enemy paratroopers floated into American backyards. This, of course, should have been received as a sobering assessment from the man who warned two uninterested administrations of the danger posed by Al-Qaeda.50 But there’s been far more changes brought to the American metropole by online life than an extension of imperial ambition into cyberspace. Amid the ghosting and trolling and the occasional troublesome zombie, a terribly dark thing has found it can attach itself to the nervous system of the internet and become a truly viral infection. You might have dodged forgettable films about satanic witches sending you friend requests or even the bots that emerge from the internet’s noosphere offering sex and companionship. You didn’t join a popular Facebook page called Heart of Texas in 2015, a false front for Russian intelligence that began an experiment with social media that ballooned into the fire hose of misinformation that drove the upcoming election cycle. But what happened on 4chan, or Reddit, didn’t stay there. The violence of rhetoric online transformed internet forums into strategy meetings for an online coup. Horror, as has so often been the case in American history, refused to stay on the screens. Horror franchises that aimed for satire sometimes took on a documentary quality rather than a prediction of dystopia to come. The popular The Purge series occupies a very peculiar place in the culture of horror. It’s not a paranormal possession trip or a slasher flick. It’s not a creature feature or a ghost story. The Purge sometimes employs the terror of home invasion that Michael Haneke made infamous in Funny Games (1997; 2007). But the horror is just as likely to find you in the streets. Its “near future” setting even keeps it from nestling easily into our current fascination with social apocalypse. The Purge films and the adjunct television series are their own genre.51 The terrorists have won in 2013’s The Purge. They are the ruling party of the United States and call themselves the New Founding Fathers (NFF), right wing and white supremist. An economic crash, not unlike the real-world death spiral of 2008, has splintered America. But the NFF has brought economic prosperity and the crime rate down to near zero. Popular opinion gives the credit to the annual “purge,” a twelve-hour period in which robbery, rape, and murder are allowed, civilization unleashes all its discontents, and the Freudian id goes a-wilding. In this first iteration, Ethan Hawke and his family are part of the one-percenters who can afford to live behind massive security gates. But he and his privileged brood find themselves targeted when they help a Black man screaming in the street and find their fortress invaded by a mob who wants the man—whom they call “a dirty homeless pig” who “exists only to fulfill our need to purge”—turned over to them. The politics of The Purge turned more explicit as the series advanced. The Purge: Anarchy features the emergence of a resistance, who look and dress a lot like the Black Panther Party of the sixties and seventies, taking over state broadcasts to launch jeremiads at a country that “[worships] at the altar of Smith and Wesson” and uses violence to “[redistribute] wealth upward.” The gloves are really off with 2016’s The Purge: Election Year, which bore the tagline “Keep America Great.” Director James DeMonaco, known for his anti-gun politics, created a scenario in which the regime’s armed death squads, who look like real-world tactical police units executing no-knock warrants, actively work with neo-Nazis. Appearing the year before torch-bearing mobs marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, under a new administration unwilling to condemn them, DeMonaco’s film seemed like prophecy rather than simple prescience. DeMonaco’s effort at creating a 2018 prequel, The First Purge, imagined the NFF beta testing the carnival of murder on Staten Island, assuming an armed and violent hoi polloi would purge the hell out of themselves. The director solved the plot hole that most people would simply leave the island for the night in a most American way: monetize violence. The state offers residents who will stay checks for five thousand dollars with more compensation if they “purge.” This is life-changing money for many Americans outside the frame. Although accused of “fashionable wokeness,” DeMonaco had been urging horror film audiences to think about wealth inequality since the Obama administration when neither Republicans nor Democrats wanted to talk much about it. The First Purge’s use of Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright,” an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement and Fight for $15, suggests a willingness to engage directly with the American empire’s need to wage war against internal dissent. Perhaps what’s truly become “fashionable” is the cynicism that assumes political awareness always represents a “pose.” Indeed, it seems a confirmation of John Carpenter’s message in They Live that there are so many messages everywhere to “Stay Asleep” that the decision to “Stay Woke” can be dismissed by film critics.52 13.Like Something Out of a Zombie Movie VIOLENCE HAS been celebrated in American life for centuries. The nation’s fascination with the West meant that the empire always hungered for new frontiers, across the Pacific world, in the Middle East, in Vietnam, and even by weaponizing the Earth’s orbit. We’ve remembered the Alamo, Wounded Knee, My Lai, and Spahn Ranch while not learning any of their lessons. We’ve forgotten, or never been told about, the mass murder at Sand Creek, the slaughter of Filipino freedom fighters and civilians in Luzon, the tens of thousands killed by the CIA in Operation Phoenix, the Highway of Death in Desert Storm, or the drone massacre in North Waziristan, Pakistan. We doomscroll through our newsfeeds and shake our heads with bewilderment at the latest atrocity in Yemen or Afghanistan. But then we are surprised when, as Malcom X controversially described the Kennedy assassination, “chickens [come] home to roost.” On January 6, 2021, an aggrieved collection of right-wing groups, incited by a lame-duck president and his enablers, attempted an insurrection. It could have been worse. The hundreds who stormed the Capitol could have killed more police. The mob that chanted “Hang Mike Pence!” could have found the vice president and his family and hauled them to the gallows built outside. The sadist fantasies that ooze out of the internet could have emerged from the shadows, online doxing becoming rape, torture, murder. Not the first purge, and not the last either. All of this could still happen because the structures of American life allow for it. You can’t build an empire on violence and then wonder about the causes of violence. Our fictions have been broadcasting this truth for years. The lives of millions of Americans have reflected it for centuries. Its ugliest face floats out of the idea that the assertion of raw power reshapes reality, controls the fact as well as opinion. Republican congressmen since January 6, 2021, have sounded a bit like my theoretically inclined profs in grad school, with their talk of “constructing narratives.” Some House Republicans speak as if they took a Derrida seminar and accepted the notion that “there is nothing outside the text.” Given the nature of political gangsterism since The Prince, they understand the brutal corollary well-meaning academics often dismiss: all that matters is who controls the texts. It looked like a horror film to many who watched in shock as the mob breached the Capitol. One of the most famous moments in George A. Romero’s Dawn of the Dead features female lead Fran asking her partner, Stephen, “What are they doing? Why do they come here?” Surveying the ruined mall where zombies putter about, some comically stumbling on escalators or flailing about in fountains, Stephen says that perhaps it was “instinct.” Driven only by a vicious hunger, they go to “an important place in their lives.” The insurrectionists weren’t zombies. The oncoming horde that trampled some of its own did have leaders, little Murder Legendres who mastered them with tales of stolen elections and Satanists in high places. Perhaps that’s why some of the more striking images of the day fall into two categories: murderous frenzy, or aimless wandering through the halls and offices of the Capitol, somnolent crowds moving as one only to halt their shamble to take selfies or place MAGA hats on statues in the rotunda. The involvement of leaders from QAnon, the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Boogaloo Boys, and a variety of MAGA stalwarts meant that the mob would do more than fumble about and break some windows. At least one photographer with a close view of what he called “hordes” of rioters jamming into windows while overrunning police and overturning barricades described it as “like something out of a zombie movie.”53 One of the most popular memes of the COVID era became a picture of an angry mob, an image captured by Joshua A. Bickel at the Ohio Statehouse. Anti-mask, anti-quarantine, and mostly pro-MAGA, they attempted to force their way into the statehouse, pressing against the glass doors in such a way that it looked painfully like every zombie fiction’s portrayal of the undead seeking to get at the flesh of the living. The memes created from the image featured predictable titles like “Return of the Brain Dead,” “Dawn of the Dumb,” and the clever, if weary, “Wow, this season of The Walking Dead sucks.” Bickel had mixed feelings about the uses to which his photograph has been put. In an interview not long after the meme went viral, he worried over the portrayal of people as zombies. This makes a great deal of moral sense, especially when some of the memes made the cruel joke that the protestors would likely become the actual “infected” of their own personal horror films. Though seeing their behavior as irresponsible, Bickel told his interviewer that we had no idea what dreadful paths brought fearful, broken, and possibly mentally ill people to such a pass. “These people aren’t zombies,” he said.54 Giving monstrous qualities to human beings does have a terrible stench in America’s history; the photographer has a point. Moreover, in the game of enmonstering, everyone gets to play. During the January 6 insurrection, among the MAGA hats, “Don’t Tread on Me” flags, and signs emblazoned with “Q,” there also appeared caps that read “U.S. Zombie Outbreak Response Team” (USZORT being their preferred acronym). USZORT is an actual organization. It does not foreground politics, though it does go beyond harmless memes into encouraging “doomsday prepping” with the idea that adding zombies puts the fun into preparing for “anything from a person infected by a pandemic outbreak to a crazy nut job . . .” A visit to the USZORT website suggests the group is mostly harmless, despite loose talk of how “a zombie” could be a “gangster” (obvious racial coding) or a “terrorist” (also obvious racial coding). As of January 18, 2021, the forums have been mostly quiet, and posts are either seemingly lonely inquirers looking for “Zombie Preparedness Training” in their state or spam from male performance enhancement products. But the dangers of such a mindset, fear of a natural disaster or mild civil unrest lurching into stockpiling weapons, are pretty plain. Kelly J. Baker, a scholar who studies both horror and white supremacy, describes the unusual links between right-wing violence, doomsday prepping, and zombie obsessions in her excellent book The Zombies Are Coming. These connections include a fascination with military-grade weaponry and viewing people of color as a “horde” shambling toward them to take life and property. In the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, the desire to purge seems to have grown stronger among some segments of American society. Indeed, rather than bothering to see their enemies as monsters, some rightist ideologues have suggested they will become monsters themselves. In the online journal American Greatness, supposedly launched to provide intellectual heft to Trumpism’s meandering grievances, Jack Kerwick urged readers to “become the stuff of nightmares.” In a chilling call to arms, he wrote that “the good man must spare not a moment to train, in both body and mind, to become the monster that he may need to become . . .”55 Is this how the empire collapses into the troubled nation-state? The Soviet Union, seemingly a juggernaut with imperial outposts and interests around the globe, died between 1989 and 1991. Crony capitalism attended the rise of Russia while the Soviet Union collapsed not only into a failed state but a collection of failed states. Putin’s Russia emerged as a threatening regional power, though one able to create chaos in cyber warfare like even smaller, more isolated nations like Iran and North Korea. Has the same process set in here? Does political polarization mean eventual balkanization? Will the extreme right get the civil war it wants? The second decade of the century taught Americans about the unruliness of history. The obvious failures of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us that of the many things empires can do, one thing they’ve always done is decline and fall. The insurrection certainly harmed America’s reputation for invincibility abroad. After a drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, more American military personnel occupied the Capitol in the next week than served in all the Middle East. The forever war had come home. The world watched the monster documentary. Did the wars without end exhaust American military and economic power while a meandering and inhumane foreign policy sputtered and failed? Has the death of manufacturing not only destroyed the working class but left America’s economic grip over much of the world in tatters? One hundred years after the beginning of its ascent to global power, has American hubris ended the American century? Some of the biggest promoters of empire think so. Historian and foreign policy analyst Max Boot, who once made a famous “Case for American Empire,” rather bravely left the Republican Party in 2016 to protest the internal rot of Trumpism. To his credit, Boot worried that his compatriots enabled a drift into authoritarianism. But his primary concern over Trumpism was its know-nothing approach to what he called “the world order created by the greatest generation in the 1940s.”56 Boot understands American global power and its limits well enough to know that a landing by U.S. Marines and/or a regime change supported by the CIA isn’t possible in the way it had been in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s. Adventurism has been more likely to result in the indictments of Iran-Contra, the debacle of Black Hawk down, the confusion of “humanitarian” bombings in the Balkans, ill-considered meddling in the politics of Libya, or the catastrophe of Iraq and Afghanistan. And these are the best-case scenario. The first twenty years of the new century have been a lesson in America’s limited ability to impose its will. Of course, maybe what’s bad for the empire is good for democracy at home. In the American past, imperial overreach did inspire social change. The violence visited on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the sixties inaugurated the anti-war movement that then forged links with the Black freedom struggle, second-wave feminism, and the first efforts toward gay liberation. The same could happen again and the transformations wrought could change our fate. A generation who does not recall a time their country did not wage wars on other peoples could use the streets and the ballot box to effect structural change. The people could demand Congress reclaim its constitutional powers to make war from imperial presidential administrations, now largely made up of unelected proconsuls of empire. They could demand laws that regulate corporate power and campaign finance laws in ways that cripple the national security state forever. History is not an oracle. We don’t actually learn from the past and save ourselves from the doom of repeating it. History is just what happens. It’s a place where, because of atavism, apathy, and greed, the worst possible thing is true. “Empires do not last,” Chalmers Johnson warned, “and their ends are usually unpleasant.”57",

      "content": "1.Do You Like Scary Movies? HORROR TOOK a holiday in the 1990s. Maybe. There’s a consensus that horror’s golden age of the seventies and eighties withered in the more optimistic decade of tech start-ups and stock market ebullience. George A. Romero’s zombies shambled off the stage after 1985’s Day of the Dead, not rising again until the twenty-first century. Critics prematurely declared the slasher film dead, forgetting that the monster always returns. Stephen King remained a best-selling author, though fantasy, science fiction, and realism became the genres most attractive to many of the same fans who had once voraciously read Salem’s Lot, The Stand, Pet Sematary, and Christine. The Green Mile (1999), a wistful story of supernatural healing and redemption, became King’s big hit at the box office. Devoted fans will remind you of some of the new directions taken by classic directors and a new conception of paranormal and gothic horror that suited the fascination with unquiet spirits, demons, and indeed angels that haunted, infested, and flitted around the echoing portal of a new millennium. Apocalyptic films gained some popularity, often mixing genres as in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle End of Days (1999), in which the action hero goes after the Antichrist, guns ablazin’, a crossover event between Die Hard and The Book of Revelation. But Forrest Gump, not Freddy Krueger, won the hearts of Americans in the 1990s. Sentimental and nostalgic, the film reimagined American history and blended it with magical realism to spin a sugared confection of innocence, goodness, and the easily falsifiable notion that there is a God who looks out for fools and little children. The story of a mentally challenged white Southerner with naivete matched only by his gift to align the universe with his wishes, the film takes us on a highly redacted tour of almost fifty years of American history. Audiences left the film charmed as Tom Hanks became an avatar for tens of millions who remained as befuddled as the protagonist about American life. Gump becomes an unsophisticated witness to desegregation, the Vietnam War, and numerous political assassinations. He maintains his innocence through it all and emerges from the bloodbath of history unscathed. Meanwhile, his friends drop like flies. Following the stereotype of so many of the era’s horror films, the Black guy dies first. Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson), a fellow Alabamian who bears the curse of becoming close to Gump in Vietnam, dies with his hands full of his own viscera. The graphic scene in this PG film would have been excised from the era’s slasher films that the Motion Picture Association often threatened with the new NC-17 rating. Shrimp-loving Bubba Blue is far from the film’s only sacrificial offering. The love of Gump’s life, Jenny, also dies in the 1980s. She has been “promiscuous” and done some drugs during the sexual revolution and so dies of an unnamed “disease.” This apparently references the decade’s AIDS epidemic that killed nearly ninety thousand Americans before the Reagan administration even acknowledged its existence in 1988. Again, as with the popular reading of slasher movies, dare to enjoy sex outside of marriage and it’s one, two, Freddy’s coming for you. Gump, meanwhile, becomes wealthy by being an early investor in what he refers to as a “fruit company” called Apple. This gives him the time to sit on park benches and explain to people trying to catch a bus to their low-wage, labor-intensive jobs that “life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.” “It takes a heart of stone to love Forrest Gump,” wrote Mark Edmundson in his book from the nineties and about the nineties called Nightmare on Main Street. This may seem far harsher than even my own judgment of a film still much-beloved after almost thirty years. But, as Edmundson points out, there’s something truly hateful about the sentimental film. What we see in that film is white America blissful in its own ignorance, a kind of blind cruelty in grasping at a vision of the world only possible to citizens of an invincible empire. Edmundson insists that the narrative is not about the adorable Gump. It’s a story about how the United States “despite a few wayward incidents, is still a grand place to live.” At a moment in American history when the gap between wealth and poverty yawned wider than at any time since the 1890s, Edmundson rightly says that the film represented the dangerous idea “that dull virtue in tandem with humble, unresenting poverty is well rewarded.” A decade in which the United States carried out violent interventions that killed thousands of civilians, and corporations joined in the mass incarceration of young Black men in the creation of for-profit prisons, does not suggest a world that’s a box of candy.1 The success of the saccharine film perfectly twinned a politically drowsy decade. Americans, white Americans at least, proved willing to forgive and forget the “wayward incidents” of their country’s past. Despite the 1980s’ reputation for conservatism, well-earned in many respects, the decade also featured the powerful grassroots Nuclear Freeze movement, the Sanctuary movement that sheltered Latin America refugees, and protests against U.S. intervention in Nicaragua and El Salvador by groups such as Witness for Peace. Many of these movements withered after Iran-Contra and the end of the Reagan administration. More important, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a sense of optimism among the white middle class that rose throughout the decade, charging ahead alongside the super-heated stock market driven by Clinton’s international trade deals. This somnolence among the body politic belied the strenuous military adventurism of the decade. The pattern first appeared in the Bush years as a new incarnation of Reagan’s efforts to end the alleged Vietnam Syndrome. In 1989, Bush’s Operation Just Cause removed the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Little reporting appeared in the mainstream press to explain the necessity of this sudden military intervention that amounted to the kidnapping of a foreign leader. Neither did major news outlets give much space to the even more mysterious fact that Noriega had long been an asset of the CIA, receiving up to two hundred thousand dollars in personal funds. He was kicked off the agency’s payroll under the Carter administration (1977–1981) but immediately began receiving funding again in 1981 with the influence of former CIA director George H. W. Bush.2 Operation Desert Storm (1991) often now simply called the “first invasion of Iraq,” set the tone for the decade, one that had its roots in the first stirrings of America’s empire after World War I and would have consequences deep into our future. A truly ludicrous affair, the rise of twenty-four-hour news, particularly CNN, made the conflict in the Gulf into one of the most popular wars in American history. Public opinion, unhindered by facts and context, discovered another “good war,” a simple struggle between good and evil. If the invasion of Grenada had been a slightly off-kilter Broadway show with decidedly mixed reviews, the Gulf War became a multi-billion-dollar special effects–laden blockbuster, rivaling Jaws and Star Wars in the cineplex of the American mind. Iraq and Saddam Hussein’s journey to becoming a new monster to replace the Soviet Union had more than a few dramatic twists and turns. Hussein had ruled Iraq as a despot since 1979. He kept no particular ideology, other than what he crazy-quilted together from a vague socialism and a strident nationalism peppered with an occasional reference to the Qur’an. His utter malice toward any opposition became the dominant characteristic of his regime, his dictatorship leading Iraq into a devasting war with Iran that lasted most of the eighties. He cultivated an increasingly absurd cult of personality, creating statues and images of himself that rivalled Stalin’s mania for similar official accolades. A joke among Iraqis, told quietly in a country where the ruler’s security services killed a quarter of a million people between 1979 and 2003, ran that the population of the country recently burgeoned to thirty-four million people . . . seventeen million Iraqis and seventeen million portraits of Hussein.3 Hussein may have been a son of a bitch, but from the standpoint of America’s national security establishment, he was our son of a bitch. Donald Rumsfeld, then serving the Reagan administration as special envoy to the Middle East, made two personal visits to Hussein at a time when the United States provided Iraq with billions in agricultural credits, making Iraq the fourth largest recipient of U.S. aid in the world.4 Support for Hussein in his war against Iran went beyond foodstuffs. The Department of Defense, working hand in glove with the CIA, provided Iraq with satellite photography surveillance of Iranian military movements. Even more damning, the DOD sold Iraq chemical precursors to produce mustard gas and sarin gas. Retired senior intelligence official Colonel Walter P. Lang asserted that the United States would not countenance the use of chemical weapons against civilians but that, in the Iran-Iraq war, “[their] use against military objectives was seen as inevitable.” In 1988, Hussein did use deadly chemicals against the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq. Neither the CIA nor American armed forces played a direct role in this attack and the Reagan administration officially condemned it. Then Vice President Bush argued against continuing chemical weapon precursors to Iraq. But a full investigative report in The New York Times revealed real dissension in the administration over continued support for Hussein even after he made it clear he was a genocidal monster.5 Hussein could claim limited success in his war with Iran, despite enormous casualties and crippling debt to the small oil emirate of Kuwait, which aided him in buying arms and rebuilding infrastructure. Rather than paying the debt, Hussein threatened Kuwait, insisting that the tiny enclave of wealth was long a natural part of Iraq and existed only because of British imperialism. Even murderous megalomaniacs sometimes get their facts straight. Britain had drawn the lines separating the two new states they carved out of the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after the Great War. The process had been so thoroughly dominated by the British Empire that the puppet rulers of both states in 1920 had been confused, and indeed had to constantly badger British foreign secretaries for the precise boundaries of their jury-rigged states. In 1990, Hussein flexed his muscles against Kuwait while also criticizing U.S. support for Israel, the dominant military power in the region. His decision to mount an invasion of Kuwait may have come from mixed signals from American diplomats, who carried a warning about the deployment of troops on his southern border while also assuring that the United States understood his economic problems and that America had “no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts.” Certainly, a sociopath would see this muddled message as two big thumbs up. And he did.6 The successful prosecution of the war against Iraq, with few American casualties, set off a curious wave of celebration, curious in both its symbolism and scale. The National Victory Celebration, the largest military parade since the Second World War, featured not only the march of eight thousand troops but also what the Associated Press called a “swarm” of Apache helicopters landing on the National Mall. CBS News noted that a “patriot missile” received “the loudest applause of the day.” No fewer than eighty-two aircraft filled the airspace over D.C., including the deadly F-117 stealth bomber. Bush crowed, “By God, we’ve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all,” and the raw militarism of the National Victory Celebration, replicated in cities and small towns across the country, suggested just that.7 But something was wrong. The Gulf War quickly passed out of popular consciousness. Two years later, the American public yawned when the United States bombed Iraq again. America experienced a pretty good war all in all, prepared for them by an administration and a military/public relations complex that, as commanding general of U.S. forces Norman Schwarzkopf said, “knew how to package an historic event.” Schwarzkopf played an important role in winning media hearts and minds, finding himself christened Stormin’ Norman and generally lionized even as he restricted press coverage of both American and Iraqi deaths.8 Had Americans become bored of their “walk-on parts in a monster documentary”? Had the dark carnival left town forever? 2.Ignoring the Tales from the Hood WHILE BUSH busily kicked the Vietnam Syndrome, millions of Americans did not share in America’s nineties fantasies. White supremacy ensured that, at home and abroad, the horror would continue to take shape. But the Black community did not accept their victimization. Ernest R. Dickerson made his first grad school film with Spike Lee. Joe’s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads told a story of community and violence at a local barbershop. Joe’s shop offered a gathering spot for Black men to talk plainly and profanely about the mysteries of their lives. It also became a contemplation of both violence from within economically walled-off Black communities and brutalities inflicted by the state. A renaissance of Black film occurred in the 1990s. Author and activist Michael Eric Dyson goes so far as to suggest that Black films emerged from a “cultural nationalism” that sought to oppose the era’s “escalation of racist hostility.” Notably, this included a rediscovery of the possibilities of Black horror films to explore the horror of Black history. John Singleton, Matty Rich, the Hughes brothers, Lee, and Dickerson forced audiences to look at their bleak visions of the American past and present.9 Many of these filmmakers worked traditional elements of horror into their films, sometimes directly using tropes of demon possession and zombiism. Lee’s Jungle Fever features a skin-crawling scene of a drug-addicted son confronting his father over money with a gloomy dread that remained with many viewers, myself included, ever since we witnessed it in theaters in 1991. Dickerson would make the cult favorites Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight and Bones, stories of demonic powers and ferocious spirits that intermingled with the realities of mass incarceration and the fate of abandoned urban centers. Unlike white filmmakers, who could still engage with the imperial fantasies of voodoo and cults from abroad, Black filmmakers of the era focused almost entirely on the frayed social structures of urban life, the terror inherent in Black history, and the death of the dreams of Black Pride and Power. By the early seventies, many Black workers, while still segregated from white suburbs, began to join the middle class into which the G.I. Bill and friendly mortgage-lending practices launched whites during the 1950s. A generation after the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South into Northern and Southern cities, men of color in particular found good union jobs in manufacturing with secure employment and a living wage. The new economic options collapsed as soon as they appeared. The deindustrialization of America left the emerging Black middle class an empty shell in many parts of the country, especially in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles where disappearing jobs created wastelands out of formerly vibrant communities. By the 1990s, the outsourcing of American jobs hammered the coffin’s final nail for the traditional American working class. This particularly affected the Black community, and fatalistic discussions of “a permanent underclass” became common despite the irony of American economic hegemony abroad.10 The empire wielded its weapons at home. A spigot of cash to local police departments meant, as a New York University Law Review article noted, rising “costs of coercion” as local police invested in electronic surveillance equipment (once controversial even for the FBI) and purchased military-grade tactical equipment. Under a 1997 program, police departments did not even have to purchase the war material. Instead, they received gratis military surplus that included grenade launchers and armored vehicles called MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush protected) later used in Iraq and Afghanistan. After 2001, police access to battlefield weaponry grew when the new Department of Homeland Security provided block grants for police, even in tiny rural communities, to create “counterterrorism units.”11 The plan for a war on America’s internal troubles needed the legitimacy required of its many wars abroad. John Dilulio, a conservative Princeton professor, provided it when he coined the term superpredator in 1995 to describe an alleged wave of juvenile crime on the rise (in fact, crime of all kinds continued to decline in the 1990s). The term immediately had a racial coding, and Dilulio used phrases like “black inner-city neighborhoods” to heighten an alleged connection. Hillary Clinton made the term infamous when, in a 1996 campaign speech for her husband, she claimed that “superpredators” who had “no conscience, no empathy” emerged in “gangs” across the country. “We need to take these people on,” she said, in contrast to less influential voices that called for direct economic aid, practical job training, and various therapies to aid people whose class location might, in a very direct way, force them into criminal activity.12 Like a fighter all but spent in the early rounds, the Black working class continued to be caught cold by the rain of blows from above. The now infamous Clinton Crime Bill of 1994 lengthened sentencing for nonviolent crimes, providing incentives for dying rural communities to build more prisons to indefinitely detain Americans often convicted for simple possession, and allowing the Department of Justice to send billions of dollars to states who distributed the money to local police departments with no oversight. The 1992 film Candyman captured a host of the Black community’s real-world terrors. Based on a short story by white horror author Clive Barker and made by white director Bernard Rose, the film entered Black consciousness in its brutal portrayal of the daily horrors of systemic racism. American police violence and substandard public housing, gentrification and highways that cut apart communities, and white people who care too much and then turn murderous are all present. The monster, the Candyman, comes out of the violent past, the victim of a lynching on the frontier of empire. The supernatural threat of a powerful Black man, his body ribboned to carrion by white violence, became a powerful totem in the scrying power of hip-hop’s language. Jordan Peele, who produced Nia DaCosta’s elegantly terrifying remake in 2021, said he “[loves] the original Candyman” because “it broke us out of the box. A Black monster was pretty revolutionary. If there was no Candyman, I don’t know that there would be a Get Out.” The Candyman as an image of both power and horror goes hand in glove with Michael Eric Dyson’s discussion of the new culture of Black power that emerged in the 1990s and continued to assert itself in the twenty-first century. From Travis Scott sampling Philip Glass’s soundtrack of the film to Kendrick Lamar’s intentionally threatening “Just say his name,” the Candyman remained a specter of the past that lives out the horrors of the Black present. Billie Jasmine Powell, in her research on horror, hip-hop, and Black life in 1990s America, discovered no fewer than twenty-two references to Candyman in the work of artists ranging from Tupac to Wu-Tang Clan to Pusha T.13 Candyman premiered, in an eerie accident, the same year as what’s sometimes called the Los Angeles riots. South Central LA offers a compellingly cruel example of the systemic destruction of a Black community, slashed apart like the Candyman himself. South Central had become a term of conjurer’s art, words that “tough on crime” pols could repeat to summon the horrors of the superpredator. Although South Central geographically refers to a section of the once middle- and upper-class Central Avenue dotted with prosperous Black-owned businesses, the term came to include imaginary boundaries that went as far as Compton and Watts in the south and stretched westward into Crenshaw and Inglewood. Born in Watts, writer and activist Wanda Coleman described growing up in “the fabulous fifties” of what had become known as Historic South Central. The invidious “neighborhood covenants” had become less common and Coleman lived in an integrated neighborhood. But the city of Los Angeles seemed determined to destroy this vibrant community. During an economic downturn in the 1960s, LAPD police chief William Parker systematically raided Black businesses on Central Avenue. The city’s insistence on building the I-10, the Santa Monica Freeway, split traditional neighborhoods in two or three segments, leaving wastelands of rubble behind and even wrecking part of the Sugar Hill neighborhood, perhaps the most historic and architecturally important Black neighborhood outside of Atlanta and Harlem. Inner city, a term that the Urban Institute designates as a rhetorical device rather than a geographical description, appeared in discussions on both the right and left. In the 1980s, the idea of the “plight of the inner city” took on an increasingly unhelpful moral shading. Rather than thinking systemically about the ways in which specific policies caused urban poverty to accelerate, social commentary frequently framed the issue as a moral problem. The emerging power of Black horror films seldom made direct connections to the imperial role the United States played in the world. Rusty Cundieff, who later contributed his expertise to the edgiest sketches of Chappelle’s Show, made Tales from the Hood (1995). The film doesn’t even glance outside urban centers and instead profiles an understandable obsession with police brutality, politicians with inherently racist agendas, and intracommunity violence. The full-scale assault on the Black community since the 1970s meant that Black horror, much like Black social movements, placed the emphasis on the white supremacy at home rather than abroad. Black critiques of the American empire did exist as an important part of the freedom struggle before the 1980s. Underreported at the time and subsequently ignored in too many textbook accounts of the Black freedom struggle, the assassination of Congo leader Patrice Lumumba ignited a 1961 protest beginning in Harlem that breached the United Nations itself. The Congolese leader’s death had been a joint American-Belgian covert op that, like so many American-led secret operations, absolutely everyone knew about. The United States replaced Lumumba with an acquiescent dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, who became one of the wealthiest men in the world from his burn-and-plunder approach to his own country’s rich raw materials.14 The protest set off an international wave of public demonstrations in Paris, London, parts of the Soviet Union, and Tokyo. James Baldwin wrote a searing op-ed in The New York Times that referenced the killing of Lumumba and the subsequent protests. He warned whites that what was becoming an “Afro-American” struggle meant that Black people wanted much more than to sit down with white people for “the consumption of overcooked burgers and tasteless coffee at various sleazy lunch counters.”15 In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. tied the Vietnam War to segregation at home. The Black Panther Party had suggested that racism and economic power depended on, and simultaneously supported, the American empire abroad. In the well-researched and intensely important book Black Against Empire by Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, we learn that the FBI, in cooperation with local and state law enforcement, systematically destroyed the Panthers, at least in part because of this international agenda. Black history remained Black horror and empire shaped the conditions that Dickerson, Cundieff, and Lee exposed in their films. In the nineteenth century, westward expansion created a “cotton kingdom” as far west as Texas. Four million African Americans worked as chattel property. Segregation and economic immiseration shaped American attitudes toward people of color around the world. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, as mass incarceration became “the new Jim Crow,” racism at home continued to shape American imperial policy. American intervention abroad continued to exhibit the dire inclinations that Black Power advocates had seen for decades. The United States could not, for example, leave Haiti alone, continuing the obsession begun in the early twentieth century. U.S. troops landed in September of 1994 to return Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. This action in the Caribbean was, unlike in Grenada, sanctioned by the UN. However, the decision to invade the country for the second time came about because of the Clinton administration’s concerns over a new wave of Haitian immigrants fleeing a military junta the United States placed in power in 1991. Giants sometimes reel drunkenly with the weight of their own power. This had been the case with the murky meddling of the United States in Haitian affairs. Although it was arguably a defense of democracy to return Aristide to power (and thus the UN sanction), the CIA had trained operatives in the Haitian security services to invalidate Aristide’s election in the first place. To bury the man, that a (once) top-secret report dismissed as “the leftist priest,” the agency created the false story that Aristide received “psychiatric treatment” in Canada. After the Clinton administration decided to deal with Aristide instead of the immigrants, CIA director R. James Woolsey had to explain away his agency’s campaign against the Haitian president-in-exile’s claims on live TV, all the while insisting that the CIA had done nothing wrong.16 The American empire’s continuing creation of zombie republics abroad seeded lethal repercussions at home. CIA assets engaged in trafficking cocaine did, as a matter of public record, help flood South Central and other American communities with drugs. CIA operatives received protection in Columbia, Honduras, and Panama in return for their help with the covert war in Nicaragua. When this fact is remembered at all, it’s disparaged as “urban folklore” about the CIA trying to destroy the Black community. CIA assets did not peddle crack on the corners, nor did they directly supply those who did. But any false conspiracy beliefs hide what the Los Angeles Times called “a different, but equally scandalous truth.” That is, the CIA couldn’t care less about how their actions on behalf of empire affected marginalized Americans while they struck deals with predators across Latin America.17 Martin Luther King Jr. said, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” Tensions in South Central LA exploded in the LA uprising of 1992, a response to the acquittal of police officers responsible for the vicious beating of Rodney King, a troubled guy with a drug problem who found himself alone on one of the shadowy battlefields of America’s war on crime. King’s beating received the most press attention as the trip wire for the sudden eruption of rage. What happened within weeks of the King incident has been too frequently ignored. A store owner in Koreatown shot the Black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins in the back of the head for allegedly attempting to shoplift a $1.79 bottle of juice. Harlins died almost immediately. The woman responsible received a suspended sentence and community service from a white judge. A week later, a Black male resident of Glendale received a tougher sentence from the same judge for kicking a dog. The eruption of anti-police riots left the ruins of South Central in flames and too many whites wondering, while being uninterested in learning, what the people who’d lived in South Central for generations were so damn angry about. Horror, like hip-hop, offered a language of anger. Yet mainstream critics often received efforts to tell the African American story through horror with contempt. Though now lauded as a classic that presaged work by Jordan Peele, Gerard McMurray, Lena Waithe, Nia DaCosta, and Little Marvin, Tales from the Hood (1995) was described by The New York Times as “crudely written and acted.” The reviewer dismissed its critique of American white supremacy as a “political cartoon.” Meanwhile, the Times described the silly white savior fantasy Bulworth, starring Warren Beatty learning to be comfortable saying a racial slur because the film gives him a Black love interest in Halle Berry, as “jubilant political satire” with “chutzpah.” White audiences ignored the tales from the hood, what their country continued to do to Haiti, and systemic efforts to control African American communities through militarist policing. However, it turned out many Americans did care about reliving 1950s alien invasion fantasies and the self-referential gaze of a horror film about horror films. 3.The Rules TWO HORROR films, radically different in their premises and approach and yet both shaped by the military interventions of the 1990s, suggested that Americans wanted to consume violence that catered to their worldview. In 1996, a new Wes Craven venture breathed a peculiar afterlife into the slasher film with Scream. The same year marked the arrival of the summer blockbuster Independence Day, an overstuffed explosion fest that constituted a remake of nearly every alien invasion horror of the 1950s and featured many of Hollywood’s major male stars of the nineties. Both films elicited the nostalgia that would soon become a defining feature of America’s culture industry. Scream became part of a flood tide of movies, and forms of entertainment more generally, that are both aware of their own origins and talk about them incessantly. Craven’s story of murders in a world where everyone knows about slasher films and endlessly references Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street earned the sobriquet meta. Now part of the slang of knowingness, it appeared first in classrooms and the academic cult of the postmodern. More thoughtful analysis attributed this style to postindustrial capitalism’s information economy tendency to script “metanarratives,” a critical mass of logorrhea that finally resulted in talking about the idea of talking about something. The popularity of the Seinfeld approach (“a show about nothing”) and the rise of young hipsters wearing nostalgic clothing or enjoying anachronistic hobbies “ironically” represent the less offensive results of these impulses. In this way of imagining pop culture, the relentless search for profit forged a style of production, advertising, distribution, and consumption that’s the cultural equivalent of a snake swallowing its own tail. The idea appears in simple forms like making sneakers that are self-aware of their status as cool sneakers or films that are conscious of the tropes they march toward audiences in orderly rows. The fascination with the remake and the reboot, though long an element in the history of film, reached market saturation in the early twentieth century. It’s an outlet in the arcades of modern life just adjacent to the nostalgia industry. You can purchase remakes of your memories and reboots of your dreams. Some in academia still take pride in postmodern theory that does little more than put simple, or sometimes demonstrably false, ideas in abstruse terms. But, while the emperor may appear without clothes in the classroom, it’s certainly true that movies about movies, movies that knew they were movies, held a special appeal to audiences as the century closed. In a decade of rising paranoia, it felt good to watch a horror film that let you in on the alleged “rules” of the genre. It gave the same frisson as what Kurt Andersen, in his 2017 book Fantasyland, calls “the X-Filing of America.” Moreover, for a generation that made Kurt Cobain’s discordant hymns of rage their soundtrack, the inescapable maze of violence and commentary on that violence suited their sense of helplessness, anger, and angst. Craven sensed this about the nineties just as he’d understood Freddy Krueger as the nightmare companion to the eighties American dream. The audacity of Craven’s approach remains startling. Scream spills enough blood that producer Bob Weinstein called in all his favors to prevent the box office poison of an NC-17 rating. Yet, unlike the grainy film stock most slasher fans had become inured to, Craven’s masterpiece has the high-gloss look that’s reminiscent of the decade’s self-consciously trashy thrillers (Basic Instinct, Wild Things) and high-concept action films (Total Recall, Starship Troopers). Courteney Cox, beloved by the tens of millions of fans of the sitcom Friends, played a major role along with David Arquette, Rose McGowan, and Neve Campbell. Recognizable names and faces, a cast of absurdly pretty people in which even extras appear to have walked out of an Abercrombie catalog, made the film’s nihilism and sheer bloodlust obsessively interesting to look at. Horror culture received an indelible mark from Scream. Directors could continue the work Alfred Hitchcock began with Psycho. They could force audiences to accept they were watching a film, that they would have to deal with unreliable narrators and see the seams in editing so that entire backstories stayed out of focus until the climax. Over the next decade the inability to know the full story helped create a whole genre of “whodunit horror,” and in some cases “what the hell just happened” horror, in films like The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, Hide and Seek, The Others, and the entire oeuvre of M. Night Shyamalan. Often seen as films that delivered surprise endings, they primarily offered surprise editing. David Fincher’s Fight Club (1999) and Mary Harron’s American Psycho (2000) probably represent the apotheosis of this effort, but Craven opened the final Hitchcockian door, letting audiences in on the secret that the camera had the power to edit the reality they experienced. Did Scream feature much political meaning? In some respects, the film’s only real interest is in itself. In this way, it’s a sheer expression of angst. The bundled anxiety at work in the film even appears in the costume designed for the murderous Ghostface. The totem eschews the blankness of the masks of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers and the open wound that passes for Freddy Krueger’s face and instead evokes the bleak wail of Edvard Munch’s 1893 masterpiece. My apolitical generation may have worried over its own anxiety and shown a tendency to go AWOL from reality, just as social commentary and films like Richard Linklater’s Slacker and Kevin Smith’s Clerks said they did. But the forces of the culture industry helped shape a tendency, easily mated with a love for false conspiracies, toward the gnostic belief that Gen X knew “the rules” of genre, that Craven’s genius in using an overused formula as an actual plot device could also mean that the formulaic could be enjoyed for its own sake. This attitude made MTV’s shamelessly entitled The Real World immensely popular and encouraged the post-Vietnam generation to believe, as had the youth of the roaring twenties, that they invented irony. Scream may have purposefully gazed at its own cinematic navel. But the cultural imperatives that made Craven’s work a hit have an unexamined relationship to Operation Desert Storm. A generation raised by parents who fought in Vietnam or watched it unfold over a decade’s worth of TV dinners and nightly newscasts watched the defeat of Iraq over forty-two days of pizza and beer. Their dawning awareness of current events and their hours playing PC games and Nintendo collided in a conflict often referred to as “the video game war.” A generation’s acquiescence may have appalled aging activists of the anti-war movement of the late 1960s. But Vietnam did not have Desert Storm’s public relations team or high production values. Throughout the twentieth century the U.S. government frequently sought to avoid showing Americans the ruined face of war. But there’s never been such obvious effort to show a false reality of combat as the first invasion of Iraq. The Pentagon carefully crafted palatable and triumphal images the new, content-hungry twenty-four-hour news cycle could release to the American public. Rather than young Americans uncertain of their fate, the public saw images of Patriot missiles striking targets reminiscent of a screenshot of the popular arcade game Missile Command. Only on one or two occasions did actual images seep through, often to suddenly disappear from both public memory and discussion. On February 13, 1991, two guided missiles struck a camouflaged civilian shelter and killed about five hundred people. Dick Cheney, then secretary of defense, declared that it was no mistake and that the shelter had been “plugged into Saddam’s communications network,” whatever that might mean. Even fewer Americans learned about the so-called Highway of Death, a convoy of thousands of retreating Iraqi vehicles bombed and strafed by A-6 Intruders, Apache helicopters, and all manner of American artillery. Perhaps as many as five hundred Iraqi soldiers died in what became more massacre than military operation. These images failed to compete with the satisfying competency of Patriot missiles knocking the dread Scud missiles out of the sky and CNN graphics, complete with sound effects, that entitled the round-the-clock coverage “Showdown in the Gulf.”18 Reality had been thoroughly redacted. Soon after the conflict, documentary film maker Ken Burns asked, rather plaintively, how an event can be remembered with so few photographs. Burns wrote with exasperation that the war seemed a series of “distracting theatrics,” staged in a way that we could see them as if “the war itself might be a wholly owned subsidiary of television.”19 In fact, not remembering the details became the point. The conflict could join the invasion of Grenada and the strike against Panama as a simple story of the last empire standing in the ruins of the twentieth century able to deliver a killing blow against any adversary. If the console game generation’s memory became dazed and confused, they could simply play Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf or the mentally disturbed 8-bit Storm Over the Desert, where tiny American tanks turn a gigantic Saddam Hussein into mush. Nintendo seemed to believe that this was, in fact, a video game war. A Gulf War veteran’s Game Boy (a handheld gaming device), melted into slag, appeared on display in Nintendo’s New York store in 2014. Scream assayed to give us a controllable formula for the slasher film. Americans also considered themselves well-versed in the rules of global slaughter. The extent to which this became true explains why America could become fascinated with a horror movie about horror movies. But even more Americans crowded into theaters to watch a star-spangled, big-budget adaptation of every alien invasion movie ever made. During a moment in the nineties when few Americans could tell you where their country currently intervened in the world, Independence Day opened to a one hundred-million-dollar week. 4.Let’s Nuke the Bastards “EVERY STATION’S making like it’s the 1950s,” exclaims a character in Roland Emmerich’s Independence Day. The line refers to TV screens around the world empty but for a snowstorm of stray signals, interference caused by alien invaders dickering with satellites. It’s also a nod to the film’s fifties roots, as are visual references like the one working television playing The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).20 Emmerich took some big risks. The seemingly invincible alien ships destroy all the major landmarks in Washington, D.C., from the Capitol Building to, in a shot that became iconic, the White House itself. In a dreadful presaging of events already in motion the year the film released, the shadow of the mothership stretches menacingly across the Twin Towers. Emmerich borrows these moments from the exceptionally well-done effects of Ray Harryhausen in Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), but the sensibilities of the 1990s and the post–Jurassic Park power of computer-generated imagery (CGI) made the effect startling.21 Audiences knew that the United States would strike back. American moviegoers brought to the film an attitude shaped by the triumphalism that came with the end of the Cold War and the utter humiliation of the Iraqi army, touted by the Pentagon in a weird reverse propaganda campaign as “the world’s third largest military.” The first act of the film reassures audiences of American prestige with establishing shots of patriotic images that we won’t see destroyed in the film, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Marine Corps War Memorial, and shots of crisp, rather outsized America flags snapping angrily in the wind. Most films that want to make the kind of box office numbers Independence Day did must offer a consensus narrative. That is, they can’t offer political diatribes for either the left or right. The heroic president played by Bill Pullman is presented to us as neither a Republican or Democrat, his youthful optimism and experience as a pilot in the Gulf War making him a mash-up of what people liked about Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush while transcending the many failings of both. Will Smith’s role as a Marine pilot seemed a quick salute to growing conversations about diversity even if there’s no allusion to racism in the film. Smith, extremely popular with white audiences for his accessible hip-hop and his sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, acts the role of the top gun who helps save the day. The film’s producers never even considered Chuck D, Ice Cube, or anyone that signified real political meaning in Black culture. In fact, white actor Ethan Hawke was the only other star in the running. Even UFO conspiracy buffs found something in the film for them, as we inevitably go back to Roswell (the latest round of books on the topic had just appeared) to learn that the government cover-up was real and that the alien ship captured in the fifties will help America carry out the president’s wish to “nuke the bastards.” Cover-ups are important and maybe keeping the American public out of the loop wasn’t right but, hey, at least it saved America (and, of course, prevented a mass extinction event). Two aspects of Independence Day made it especially appealing in the aftermath of the Gulf War. In a reiteration of audience expectations shaped by the video game war of 1991, the film celebrated the American military but, visually and in dialogue, put more focus on America’s hardware, much as the Patriot missiles became the heroes in the war with Iraq. There are some American heroes on screen but, as with the Gulf War, they are never detached from their weapons of mass destruction. F-18 fighters, tactical nuclear weapons, stealth bombers, helicopter gunships, and even an early allusion to cyber warfare . . . almost all weapons Americans had met and applauded in the “crisis in the Gulf” are rolled out in Independence Day. Mimicking CNN, the film shows attacks on the aliens on the same green-hued night-vision screens that created what looked like, but wasn’t, a bloodless fireworks show over Baghdad. Second, the film’s use of the terminology and American mentality of the Gulf War goes far beyond these cues. Independence Day helped shape the summer blockbuster’s penchant for catastrophic yet bloodless violence. Emmerich’s catastroflick includes an unhinged moment in which the president’s chief military advisor assures him that a plan to explode nuclear missiles all over the United States to take out the invaders is basically sound. The cities have all been deserted, he tells the president, and confidently announces that “civilian casualties should be down to a minimum.” There’s nothing in the film that breaks the spell by questioning this bullshit. Finally, George H. W. Bush’s feeling that the Vietnam Syndrome had been “kicked” gets a troubling reiteration in Independence Day. Randy Quaid plays Casse, an alcoholic and generally clownish veteran of Vietnam. Volunteering to fly against the alien ships in one final effort to “nuke the bastards,” Casse announces, in a sepulchral-sounding echo of his generation’s disastrous war, “Hello, boys, I’m back.” He sacrifices himself to save Gen X and their children, a deeply cruel suggestion that perhaps he should have made such a noble sacrifice in Southeast Asia thirty years before. Independence Day represented slack-jawed awe at American military power, at times evoking some of the worst angels of our nature, and joined an established cinematic tradition of portraying Vietnam veterans as troubled, dangerous, and disposable (The Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Rambo: First Blood). Independence Day outdid Forrest Gump in both ticket sales and its indifference to the wounds it reopened and the ideas it celebrated. Horror science fiction in American culture soon took new and more interesting turns, asking some of the philosophical questions Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke offered in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Soviet science fiction pondered for decades (Solaris, 1972). American sci-fi horror turned toward political satire that held a frightening mirror to America’s role in the real world (Annihilation, Arrival, District 9, Sunshine, Moon). These films avoided simplistic tales of aliens as marauding invaders or peaceful “space brothers.” This change owed a lot, more than has been credited, to a director known for over-the-top films that made exploitation mainstream and a satirical reading of a Robert A. Heinlein classic the late grand master had meant with deadly seriousness. 5.Very Pretty Space Fascists DUTCH DIRECTOR Paul Verhoeven believes strongly in using violence in film. In his view, a refusal to show violence did more to inure the public to real-world violence than hiding what the mangled and dead human form looked like. He once told James Cameron that whenever a filmmaker suggested his work “too violent,” he told them their movies probably “weren’t violent enough.” Verhoeven had blended graphic sex with over-the-top mayhem and served it with slapdash social commentary since the 1970s. The nineties seem the decade American cinema was ready for him . . . sort of. Basic Instinct (1992) did become a (kind of) cultural touchstone, setting off a craze for neo-noir psychosexual thrillers—Alfred Hitchcock meets the grind house. The director’s Showgirls (1995) became a touchstone of a different kind, a schlocky farrago of a movie that won seven of the satirical Golden Raspberry Awards given for “the worst films of the year.” Subsequently, the film won some grudging respect for its willful banality, its intentionally superficial obsession with Vegas glitz, bad music, and sentimental outbursts. What film critic Naveen Kumar calls the “deliberate mess” of the film echoed the vacuity of nineties white American culture. Verhoeven’s post-Showgirls decision to adapt Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers may seem highly peculiar. Actually, it made perfect sense. Graphic violence must play a role in any nod to Heinlein’s orgiastic celebration of patriotic genocide, fulfilling the 1950s cinematic traditional assumption that the alien must be destroyed and that a scientific and military elite could band together to do it. These are the “rules” that Verhoeven followed but, perhaps more diligently than Wes Craven in Scream, he subverted these prescriptions. What if, he wondered, I made a sci-fi movie about “fascists who aren’t aware of their fascism”?22 Starship Troopers did for shoot-’em-up science fiction what Scream did for slasher films. Verhoeven saw in Heinlein’s work exactly what Heinlein wanted his readers to see in 1959, a message about discipline, violence, and the glories of a militarized state. Verhoeven, too bored by Heinlein’s novel to finish it, combined that message with his own experience as a youth in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and his belief that militarism seeped into the groundwater of American entertainment, opinion, and corporate power. The result is a film in which the characters feel empty because they are. The monsters are silly because the real monsters are the young, lovely, unthinking death dealers who never question orders or even question why they are not questioning orders. The enemies that Earth has long been at war with for reasons that remain unclear are the Bugs. This designation recalls American racist tropes directed at Japanese soldiers that, combined with the Japanese sense of their own cultural superiority, created the utter savagery of the Pacific War. The exposition we receive that frames the film, videos posted on some future version of the internet, are Big Brother fireside chats presented in a soothing male AI voice. Indeed, the point seems to be that fascism will come in such a pleasantly instructive fashion that you’ll barely feel the boot in your face forever. Roger Ebert complained that Verhoeven created “the most violent kiddie movie ever made.” He does admit the film contains some “sly satire” but found it off-putting that the main characters seem unable to reflect on why they are at war with the Bugs and appear “soulless.” He then makes what could only be described as an invidious comparison to George Lucas’s universe, certainly a poor juxtaposition not only because they are very different films but because the bad guys in the Star Wars universe are barely disguised fascists themselves.23 One of America’s most respected critics missed that Verhoeven wanted to play it straight in hopes of making audiences appalled at the film’s attractive heroes who unthinkingly accept the violent logic of fascism. The actors are carved out of the shiny polymer of youthful sexuality and include the nineties platonic ideal of male heteronormative fantasy, Denise Richards. These pretty space Nazis remain secure in their rancid xenophobia, utter devotion to the state, and passion for violence to the very end. Perhaps the film’s time simply had not come. David Roth wrote about the cult classic for The New Yorker in 2020 and noted that the theme of endless and indecisive war describes the last two decades of American life. Critic Phil Coldiron called it “one of the greatest of all anti-imperialist films.” Calum Marsh described the film in the November 2013 issue of The Atlantic as undermining Heinlein’s “saber-rattling” with “archetypes on loan from teen soaps and young-adult fiction.” Verhoeven’s satire remains controversial with science fiction and horror fans. The director used a machete to dig into the divided mind of sci-fi, a violent corpus callosotomy that left synapses dangling but still vibrating painfully. Heinlein defenders saw the film as a betrayal. They failed to recognize that Verhoeven’s parody worked because he took the book literally. Another arguably much larger group of fans knew exactly what the film did and grew up with a sense that sci-fi could wield the chain saw too. 6.Unadorned Butchery THE HORROR of a war without meaning against monsters of our own making had been examined by Joe Haldeman in The Forever War. Like so many Vietnam veterans, Haldeman felt no desire to go to war. A pacifist, he had been studying at the University of Maryland pursuing his twin interests in physics and astronomy, disciplines to which he’d later add an MFA. His interest in creative writing baffled his professors, who urged him to take more courses in advanced differential equations. Telling them he had an interest only in “garden variety differential equations,” he did some of his first writing and published a story later adapted by the eighties Twilight Zone reboot. After graduating in 1967, he was drafted to serve as a combat engineer. His family was in Montreal when his Selective Service notice arrived. He and his wife discussed staying in Canada, moving to Sweden, or possibly even accepting a prison sentence. He decided against these options because of a lifelong dream of working for NASA that resisting the draft would destroy. He said he always wanted “to be a spaceman.”24 Haldeman would never achieve this in a literal sense, and he probably knew that as he dropped into a so-called hot LZ (a landing zone under fire). The author remembers forgetting everything he thought he’d learned from war movies and simply running in the direction he heard English being spoken. But he mostly recalled the smell of the dead. Like veterans of every industrialized mass murder of the last century, his memory became a cubist painting that ignored linear space and insisted that the eye read its surroundings as one simultaneous explosion of visual excess. Haldeman’s own synesthesia of violence included the smell of nearby bodies that he would forever associate with roadkill and noticing the way that one of the corpse’s feet twisted at uncomfortable-looking angles. It would not be Haldeman’s last experience with the dead stacked after combat. The pacifist left Vietnam with a Purple Heart and an even stronger distaste, if deeper understanding, of military adventurism. The Forever War became the science fiction classic Haldeman ensorcelled from the chaos of his experience. First published in 1974, it won essentially every single award for achievement in science fiction. It told a story recognizable to readers of Robert A. Heinlein but one that drew very different conclusions. Private William Mandella shares the same fictional DNA as Heinlein’s space marines but fights with an awareness that he knows little about Earth’s Tauran enemies other than the fact that they must be destroyed. He calls the first encounter he takes part in “murder, unadorned butchery . . . We had just herded them up and slaughtered them.” By the end of the novel, we learn that Earth’s military industrial complex fought what becomes a thousand-year conflict because a militarized society promised big defense contracts. At some point over the centuries, not unlike the illogic of the American empire, the economy simply became a war economy. Life without the war became unimaginable.25 Haldeman has called his work “social satire” but disavowed the idea of being a sci-fi prophet. In the late 1990s, he wrote a follow-up to The Forever War, a much more optimistic and even spiritual work called Forever Peace. It never received the recognition of his earlier work, perhaps because he had, in fact, been too much of a prophet. Discussions of a war without end waged for confusing reasons opened the American empire’s new century. 7.Apocalypse, Right Now HOPEFUL PROPHETS of the 1990s promised “the end of history.” This chilling phrase actually expressed some of the more optimistic assertions about the post–Cold War world, particularly the belief that free markets and democracy would work in tandem to end ethnic conflict and political authoritarianism. R.E.M.’s anthem “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” seemed like the cue music for the whole decade. But not everyone was so sure or felt especially fine. Horror certainly took an apocalyptic turn. Independence Day played with the idea, but so did films of mass destruction like Deep Impact (1998) and the straightforwardly named Armageddon (1998). Both films imagined destruction on a global scale. Deep Impact, about a meteor creating an extinction-level event that wipes out the East Coast of the United States, showed viewers images of the leveling of cities that horror films, traditional disaster movies, and even superhero franchises soon made a commonplace of cineplex entertainment. Such images battered us so incessantly after 9/11 that Village Voice film critic Bilge Ebiri could say of the unending flood tide of CGI catastrophe, “It’s the end of the world as we know it—and I feel tired.”26 Roland Emmerich, meanwhile, parlayed the success of Independence Day to direct what he hoped would become the ultimate monster disaster film, a nineties iteration of Godzilla for American audiences. The 1954 classic imagined a creature of primeval history roused from the seabed by American nuclear tests. Japan, the target of the only atomic weapon attacks in history, must suffer again at the hands of a monster created by Americans. That version of the story disappears in Emmerich’s hot take. It’s an illegal test by the French government that awakens the creature, making the United States, with its world-destroying nuclear arsenal, a victim of European maleficence when the creature finally makes its way to American shores. Cue massive explosions and catastrophic destruction, violence both impossible to comprehend in scale yet bloodless in representation. After all’s said and done, the United States wins big. While apoco-disasters in the form of dread cosmic events or monsters rising out of the sea increasingly invested in more and more entertainment real estate, religious fears reminiscent of the satanic panic continued to thrive in the decade. Omen IV appeared and a reboot of the original Omen, slightly updated, went into the works. Demonic children proliferated at an alarming rate, some of them born to become the Antichrist. End of Days, The Devil’s Advocate, and Bless the Child appeared, or went into production, in the late nineties and all shared the basic theme of the devil’s interest in destroying the world. These films reflected the enormous popularity of the Left Behind series, a set of novels that attempted to dramatize the evangelical conception of the end of time using the techno-thriller tricks and tropes of a Tom Clancy tale. Like Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth in the seventies, the books had a reach and a popularity that went far outside the fold of the faithful. The series became a franchise worth hundreds of millions of dollars with films, PC games, and spin-off series in its train. This all seems a bleak side to the promises of nineties cultural functionaries that the world would be shinier and happier. But the fascination with the world’s end, often more stridently asserted and deeply feared than the very real apocalyptic possibilities of the passé Cold War, emerged from roots in the growing divide in American culture. Political, economic, and even cultural power ballooned to such proportions since 1945, and in some respects since 1918, that individuals felt little sense of autonomy and agency. Political apathy abounded while, by the beginning of the twenty-first century, consumption driven by massive debt and inflated real estate equity reached levels unprecedented in human history. The nineties, more than any other decade, encapsulates the disempowerment of Americans, their role as walk-on extras in Theodor Adorno’s “monster documentary.” End-times fiction shared the assumption that most people are either unaware or incapable of dealing with the real horror of the time. Social movements and the organizations that hardwired them went into decline. Voting rates continued a decade-long slide. By 1994, only about a third of eligible voters went to the polls for the midterm elections. In 1996, less than half of registered voters bothered with the presidential contest. Things would probably be fine.27 Five years later, when explosions shook the ground and bodies floated down from the sky as dust and ash, some Americans felt like they were in a movie, or at least watching one. Minutes after the second aircraft slammed into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, devastated eyewitnesses could only say, “It looks like a movie!” The scriptwriter of Armageddon found that the footage of the attack, so similar to the film, gave him “the creeps,” and the director of Die Hard reflected with horror that it looked like one of his movie posters.28 The America that woke up on September 12, 2001, wanted to see itself as a profoundly different epoch, see the change in date as more than simple chronology, chronos, but an emergence of the Greek concept of kairos, ripe time, deep time, time bursting open with meaning, a crack in the geological strata of history that demanded decisive action. Commentators went so far as to suggest that human communication would have to do without irony after the experience. Others suggested that good and evil as categories had come back (as if they’d ever gone away). American culture would be “Rockwellian” again, a reference to the maudlin paintings of Norman Rockwell that featured happy and humorous scenes of a bygone, very white America of soda fountains and sentimental references to family, church, childhood, and dogs. Horror would rip the stitches off this attempt at cultural revanchism. Films that dealt directly with 9/11 failed at the box office. Meanwhile, some of the goriest, most disturbing, and intentionally subversive horror films ever made began to, as Victoria McCollum wrote, engage politics to such a degree that they “vigorously [pummeled] at the audience’s skull with the viciousness of each new atrocity.”29 Eli Roth’s Hostel (2005) generally gets slated into the category of “torture porn,” a phrase so gruesome it seems to have a bad odor wafting out of it. Hostel is much more than this though, a film that, like James Wan’s Saw franchise, sponged up the era’s paranoia and fed it back to audiences as a hellbroth. At a moment when American culture could actually conduct a public debate about the legality of torturing suspected terrorists, suspected accomplices of terrorists, and people suspected to know something about terrorists and their accomplices, the film stripped audiences of their sympathy for young, pretty Americans abroad who themselves became targets of torture. Whatever you think of the ethics of such a gory display, it’s impossible to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of the boundary-busting film. Dominick Suzanne-Mayer wrote in 2016 that Hostel became a hit with millennials like himself, as it seemed to fit the bizarre tone of the times when “Lee Greenwood’s ‘Proud to Be an American’ could be piped in over crackling junior high school PA systems for months on end, daily, and nobody ever really stopped to interrogate how surreal the whole thing was.”30 Audiences walked away from Roth’s disturbing masterpiece with complex feelings about what they had seen. Foreign places are dangerous, un-American, and to be disdained. Yet the film also conveyed the sense that the Americans who walked around like they owned these places got everything they deserved. Suzanne-Mayer says this may have been little more than the feeling that “the rest of the world is scary, huh?,” but this at least left more space for rumination than the president of the United States saying things like, “I’m amazed that . . . people would hate us. I, like most Americans, I just can’t believe it, because I know how good we are.”31 Horror increasingly made the point that we had little to brag about. Films such as Rob Zombie’s The Devil’s Rejects (2005) not only questioned American exceptionalism, they suggested the worst of us maybe understood the world we’d made much better than the millions who bought a Toby Keith CD to hear him serenade the globe with lyrics like, “we’ll put a boot in your ass / It’s the American way.” The Devil’s Rejects follows up Zombie’s macabre blood carnival of a tribute to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre called House of 1000 Corpses. But Rejects stands on its own in many respects, part outlaw western and part thrill-kill horror. The Firefly family are the Manson commune if “the Family” actually cared about one another. Indeed, the character Otis makes use of Tex Watson’s LSD-induced proclamation “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business” during one nearly unwatchable sequence. It’s so truly violent that it’s a difficult film to endure with some especially egregious scenes that the actors and Zombie himself struggled to film. The whole thing seemed to make critics feel dirty. Reviewers rattled away at their keyboards in a blood-vessel-popping rage about the film’s nihilism in a nation that, only a year before, looked at images of physical and sexual torture from Abu Ghraib prison, where American soldiers had done something witchy with detainees. It’s more of a commentary on America than the film itself that critics could suggest that The Devil’s Rejects had no social and cultural meaning because of its “sickening, socially irresponsible glorification of depraved and sadistic behavior.” Had they been keeping up with the news? Did they know that the image of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi standing hooded on a box, electric wires inserted all over his body, arms extended as if in preparation for crucifixion, went from confrontation with human evil to an offensive meme on American social media platforms within days? Zombie could have replied to critics with the words of his idol Tobe Hooper, “it’s really about America.”32 “Sickening” films like The Devil’s Rejects offered a way to speak about what had become of America’s imperial endeavors at a time when the public square demanded consensus and obedient acceptance to the oddly named “war on terror.” Roth and Zombie offered relief from relentless images of America as victim and vengeful crusader. This construction of the world allowed for the unspoken assumptions of American power since 1945 to become fully public. Hours after the September 11 attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent a memo to aides that proclaimed it time to “go massive—sweep it all up, things related and not.” The attempt to twist the world completely to American wishes defined the next two decades of American life.33 8.Al-Qaedzilla THE TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY American empire made no excuses. Bush said it out loud, telling a graduating class at West Point that the United States must always remain “ready for preemptive action” against “unbalanced dictators.” This enthusiasm for unilateral invasion became the so-called Bush Doctrine, the assurance that the United States would take military action against any power in the world that might threaten the American order of things. War became, as Mark Danner describes it in his important book Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War, “unbounded in space and time.”34 The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have proven disastrous. Perhaps as many as two hundred thousand civilians have been killed in Iraq alone. “Regime change” created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of ISIS and the intervention of Russia on behalf of Syria’s brutal Assad regime. The dead zone of Iraq has strengthened the hand of Saudi Arabia, arguably the world’s most repressive regime, an autocratic monarchy with economic and territorial ambitions that has successfully linked itself to the United States. The withdrawal from Afghanistan fulfilled an agreement with the Taliban made by President Trump in February 2020. Most Americans are unaware that U.S. troops continue to dominate much of the Middle East with no fewer than twenty-three air and naval bases and an unknown number of “black sites” maintained by the CIA in the former Soviet republics. Some of these bases are like small, heavily armed American cities. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar hosts eleven thousand U.S. troops, ensures near total dominance of airspace across most of the region, and features amenities that include two movie theaters, a huge swimming pool, most major American fast-food chains, and lounges with names like the Kasbah, the Zink, and the Fox Sports Skybox. Like Fort Laramie in the nineteenth century and Guantanamo Bay in the twentieth, Al Udeid announces that America is here to stay.35 America would kill all the monsters that threatened “the homeland.” Horror films sometimes attended to the need to assure the public this was so. As a filmmaker, Steven Spielberg was always eager to comfort the zeitgeist. Since Jaws he has been frightening Americans to make them feel better, producing films that even massaged dire historical realities into buddy movies and family dramas. Alien invasions became friends visiting from the stars. Schindler’s List allowed the Holocaust, as critic Akiva Gottlieb put it, to be told in a story about a “Nazi who has a change of heart.”36 War of the Worlds (2005) continued this pattern amid a ruined landscape that magnified the destruction of 9/11 beyond all imagining. And yet, Spielberg ends the film with a virus ex machina that kills the aliens. J. J. Abrams’s Cloverfield (2008) also told a tale of mass destruction by an enormous but shadowy horror. The Village Voice noted that the film’s avalanche of ruin could have come “from the CNN archive,” an attack from what the reviewer snarkily called “al-Qaedzilla.” America the allegedly indomitable had come under the attack of nameless, faceless, and vague entities. No one who watches the carnage of Spielberg’s aliens or Abrams’s kaiju worries about “blowback.” There’s no cause, we are the victims, they must hate our freedoms, and nothing but apathy and hoping for the best can be done. 9.Ghosting in Spook Country THE CONTOURS of empire may not have changed that much in the twenty-first century. But the ways in which the United States defended its global system did. As journalist and historian Nick Turse writes, the State Department, presidential administrations, and even political candidates have bragged for years about the cyber warfare capabilities of the United States. Turse describes “the military’s secret military,” the enormous, and growing, phenomenon of cyber warfare units, drone bases, and special forces.37 William Gibson’s Spook Country (2007) may be the only kind of spy novel that matters in the age of imperial cyberspace. Dead drops and the occasional GRU assassination might still make news, but the world of espionage could no longer exist without a humming digital homunculus, a hive of hundreds of millions occupying almost every single gigabyte of technology’s white zones. A simple phone conversation by Gibson’s protagonist summons possibilities more chilling than “the call is coming from inside the house” analog terror of When a Stranger Calls. Sitting in a Starbucks, she is “afraid to trust her own phone and the net stretching out from it, strung through those creepy fake trees . . . the net of telephony, all digitized, and all, she had to suppose, listened to.” Cloaks and daggers had been replaced by bots and malware. The attacks of 9/11 transmogrified the heady predictions of life online from dreams of an interconnected world to a nightmare of illusion, surveillance, and loss of self. Independence Day gave us the new notion of computer viruses imagined as the key to defeating an alien invasion. When the film launched in 1996, only a little over 30 percent of American households featured a personal computer. A decade later, the danger of viruses to everything from bank accounts to political stability became a common problem, so common it did not always receive the public discussion it deserved. Unless you bricked your computer in 2007 by opening a file that claimed to be a breaking news story, you may not remember Storm Worm. Originating in Russia, Storm Worm compromised ten million personal computers in six months. The email subject lines that duped computer users are themes from the darkest fantasies of the internet, including “British Muslims Genocide” or “Radical Muslim drinking enemies’ blood!” Even the more mundane subject lines the virus used, like “Re: Your text” proved impossible to ignore. The subject line appeared utterly chilling in an age when relationships and careers could end with ill-considered words typed into the ether. Ghost has become a common verb in America’s online vocabulary. Drawn from the idea of a spirit world where restless souls appear and then wink out into the black, to be ghosted means that another person has disappeared from your life—messages unread, texts unreturned, and the seeming community of social media a false front behind which lies a vast ruin. Family, friends, and romantic partners can all ghost, can become hidden from sight in the disconnections of digital interfaces. You can be “unfriended” in an almost ritualistic manner, a combination of public shaming and sacral excommunication. The psychological costs are impossible to tabulate in such an online world where relationships of all kinds can acquire a surprising intensity only to vanish and become weightless, shadows with no mass or circumference. We use the language of horror to describe the connections we hope never to make in the interconnected world. There are those who become ghosts, leaving behind nothing but strange half memories in a deleted files folder. Or we might also face a troll lying in wait beneath the virtual infrastructure of the web. These encounters can range in viciousness from nasty snark aimed at strangers to bullying, stalking, and attempting to destroy another person’s finances or reputation. Although tales from old salts on the cyber sea are rare, and unconfirmed, the idea of “mermaiding” suggests wily women out to use their siren song, by which I mean the offer of nude pics, to monetize their social media accounts. The fear of this possibility draws on the horror of the sea creature cuteified beyond recognition but taken back to its frightening roots in films like Night Tide (1963) and Robert Eggers’s The Lighthouse (2019). You can even meet a zombie online, or at least someone can zombie you. In a peculiar reenactment of the Freudian horror of “the return of the repressed,” romantic attachments gone missing in the digital ossuary suddenly reappear. Perhaps having ghosted you before, they suddenly return to frightful life, wanting to recreate some virtual version of a past connection, a dead thing living inside the synthezoid brain of your hard drive. People have always abandoned one another. Ghosting could, at one time, simply mean refusing to pick up the phone. But there are very real differences, largely shaped by the ease of online contact. A feeling of freedom, of anonymity, of the sense that it’s your gothic double that acts for you in online interactions, allows for a sense of weightlessness to relationships, that they are ephemeral and ethereal. This offers a heady brew for people hungry for, and afraid of, intimacy. It’s the absolute desiderata for sociopaths. But are the intricacies of human relationships really damaged on a large scale by such behavior? After many discussions of online life “eroding empathy” or the dangers of “screen time,” are we more likely to objectify people now rather than earlier periods when economic elites grew fat off of World War I or the Industrial Revolution? Genocide had become a method of state-building long before the personal computer, much less social media. There’s not a clear answer, yet, to whether personal devices have rewired our brains in a “post-human,” or maybe sub-human, experience of the world. But we do know the digital world of ghosts and zombies have affected social institutions and political consciousness. Meeting up with a troll or a mermaid online could have terrifying personal consequences. But cyber life’s uncanny mixture of solitude and intimacy, connections with people that appear to have depth but can be brutally voided in a text or DM, and its ability to make fantasy into a hyperreality have very real implications for the United States as both a nation-state and an empire. The titans who have made vast fortunes and exert extraordinary power over much of the world’s resources implicitly understand that the digital world has become empire’s new frontier. Even the games we play carry this lethal message. 10.Zombie Black Ops UNRELENTING HORDES march from all directions. They are an unstoppable threat to American power. In fact, you will die trying to kill them. There’s not a way to win and you know the endless army of the dead will take you. This does not describe a particular scenario in the revival of the zombie apocalypse film after 9/11, a renaissance that included an aging George A. Romero doing some of his best work since the seventies. Instead, it’s the most popular gaming mode of the Call of Duty series, a cultural phenomenon since 2003. Beginning with a popular first-person shooter (FPS) approach to World War II, Activision updated the game almost every single year since its inception. The zombie mode has appeared in almost every new version of the game, players sometimes staging minor online revolts against the developers when they don’t receive it. The insistence on supernatural zombies and horror film scenarios in what has over the years aimed at being in other respects a stomach-churningly realistic military simulation seems to require some explanation. We could chalk it up to the sheer popularity of zombie films, novels, TV shows, and comics in the twenty-first century. Does putting a military shooter together with zombies simply represent peanut butter and chocolate logic, the simple math that two things we like are better than one? Maybe. But only if Call of Duty had not become the most egregious example of what at least one scholar has called “games of empire.” It’s a series designed to reenact, and ruthlessly celebrate, the extension of American power all over the globe. The killing of monsters, by the hundreds and even by the thousands, has become the game’s trademark. So has a devotion to give an outlet for one set of political views, redacting history to explain away imperial maleficence. The use of horror, especially in the unstoppable waves of the undead, assumes a frightening role in the real world of empire.38 Gaming might appear very far removed from the realities of political and ethical life. You will find a troll or two in online gaming, a stranger who deems you a “noob” and expresses some profane opinions about your mother’s morality and their supposed overfamiliarity with her. But there’s more happening than the occasional ill-natured gamer, including the serious matter of cyberbullying. Beyond these interpersonal cruelties, gaming online has often acted as manservant to the aims of empire, an infomercial for some of the worst ideological assumptions in American life. Resident Evil became, in the late twentieth century and continuing to today, the most popular survival horror franchise and one of the most popular console and PC games period. Spawning nine films and sixteen games (depending on how you count the various remakes, reboots, and episodic content), it gave players a way to live out their apocalyptic zombie fantasies while introducing some real-world ideas including biological weapons, corporate maleficence, and the American government’s addiction to weapons of mass destruction. In the original title, produced in Japan in 1996, the evil Umbrella Corporation produced the bioweapon known as the T-virus for its major client, the U.S. government. The T-virus outbreak in the ludicrously named town of Raccoon City leads to a missile strike that annihilates the zombified town in an homage to Romero’s critique of corporate and government villainy in his film The Crazies (1973). Subsequently, the series frequently celebrates American military power. Heroic special forces units are dispatched later in the series to deal with outbreaks. In the 2009 game Resident Evil 5, a heavily stylized “Africa” becomes another foreign geography in which square-jawed white Americans (in this case a government agent named Chris who mingles frat boy Aryanism with a linebacker physique) fight off hordes of enmonstered African bodies hurled against them, an update of some nineteenth-century colonial stand-off in Sudan or South Africa. The imperial assumptions of the game take us back to the racism of the Hollywood “jungle adventure.” Like the zombie republics imagined by Hollywood throughout the last hundred years, the gamer visits an ill-defined and homogenized Africa, an unnamed state that geographically appears sub-Saharan and politically recently gained independence from its colonial rulers. The latter point seems important in the game only because it can inject into the narrative the idea of African nations being unable to care for themselves and in need of a living action figure like Chris, whose military skill set serves a bizarre trinity of global powers. Chris is a well-armed agent of, I kid you not, the U.S. government, the UN, and the American pharmaceutical industry. Resident Evil 5 appeared at a time when the United States took an increased interest in numerous African nations. Since the end of the Cold War, and the end of widespread Soviet and Cuban influence in much of the continent, America sought to flex its muscles. Under Clinton, the United States offered economic incentives to countries with “a market-based economy that protects private property rights.” Neoliberal think tanks developed an economic and political Geiger counter that used seventeen different indicators that would allow an African nation a favorable trade relationship with the United States. Some of these indicators sound benign and even idealistic, like “political pluralism” and “equal protection under the law.” Other mandates the United States sought to impose are far less disinterested, including “the elimination of barriers to United States trade and investment” as well as a much more generalized demand that no participating nation “engage in activities that undermine United States national security or foreign policy interests.”39 In the early years of the Obama administration, American operations in Africa sent thousands of highly trained Chrises all over the continent through the auspices of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The interservice effort, born in the 1980s, has become integral to uniting all the country’s covert war-fighting capabilities. Operating with no regard to international boundaries and cooperating with agencies that include the CIA, the NSA, and even the FBI, members of SEAL Team Six and Delta Force have killed or kidnapped alleged terrorists with impunity. Journalist Jeremy Scahill in his book Dirty Wars insists that the Obama administration “let JSOC off the leash” in a way that the Bush administration never did. The lack of oversight built into the interagency effort made removing the harness from the dogs of war no more complicated than the stroke of a pen.40 In the dirty wars of the twenty-first century, Call of Duty has a popularity even beyond Resident Evil. Its zombie component makes it something of a survival horror game that also assures players of the power and virtue of the American empire. Once the early games moved beyond the era of World War II, they increasingly focused on the geopolitical present in the “Modern Warfare” series. The premise of Call of Duty, particularly in its “Black Ops” iteration, has been that the protection of ill-defined American interests requires extralegal action and what we might call a broad sense of morality. In other words, a legitimation for how the American empire already behaves. In 2020, Call of Duty made more explicit claims for its real-world relevance in Black Ops Cold War. Using the tag line “Know your history,” the game received criticism for its triumphalist take on America in the Cold War. In its single-player story line, the narrative bundles the Reagan administration’s support for Latin American death squads and the highly illegal Iran-Contra arms pipeline into a realpolitik of “saving the free world.”41 If you don’t get the message, Ronald Reagan appears in the game to reassure you, the late president eerily rendered so that his recognizable voice seems to echo to you, a lonely cowboy dirge carried by the winds across the uncanny valley. Reagan not only grants immense levels of moral latitude to the players, the dead president’s avatar explains to the devoted player that he has been the one to set his imprimatur on the many past adventures of the Black Ops team. “You have been given a great task,” Reagan’s avuncular tone explains, “protecting our very way of life from a great evil.” This sounds like a Reagan remix, his language about empires of evil and the threat of the Soviet Union laid across the repetitive bass beat of a utopian conception of free markets. But Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War pumps up the volume. It offers a platform to an eighties conspiracy theorist who has played such an important role in forming the idea of alt-right that extremist YouTubers have celebrated his appearance in the game.42 Yuri Bezmenov defected from the Soviet Union in the early seventies. Working for a time for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he became best known for publications in the 1980s of various books supposedly outlining the KGB’s interest in so-called active measures that destabilize the culture and the economy. Obviously, most espionage services engage in such actions. But Bezmenov used this truism to make an argument about American domestic politics. He suggested that the Soviets favored the support of feminism and the civil rights struggle to damage their enemy from within. In a 1984 interview, Bezmenov insisted that “hippies” represented rot from within that would prepare the way for a real-world Red Dawn. He railed against the strides for what he called “civil rights for homosexuals,” a movement that gathered power in the eighties but that Bezmenov insisted the KGB crafted to distract the American public. He classed both feminism and the civil rights movements as American failings that the KGB could use to “soften up” the country.43 A redacted version of this interview appears in the teaser for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Also featured are scenes of social unrest that are given no political context. It’s a bizarre commercial for the game to include given the source, especially when there’s really no lack of strident anti-communist speeches from the likes of Churchill, JFK, and Reagan himself. So why choose a right-wing star to narrate the alleged “unrest” of the eighties? Call of Duty developers have a history of building bridges with the far right. In 2014, they enlisted Oliver North as a consultant for the game Black Ops II and featured him as a voice actor playing himself in a segment of the game. North also appeared in an infomercial for the game that adopts the tone of a documentary, in which the disgraced Marine lieutenant colonel worries about a future in which “America’s enemies” use its own high-tech weapons against it. This seems shameless given North’s role in, and conviction for, selling American weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to guerillas in Nicaragua. Shameless and yet also entirely inductive given the peculiar role that Call of Duty has played in relation to the internal life of the American military. Since the beginning of the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, the army has worked actively with military FPS games to use them as tools for recruitment. In 2014, Dave Anthony, a writer for the Call of Duty series, left his job in the video game industry to become a consultant at the Pentagon in order to encourage, in his own words, “outside-the-box thinking.” One example of such thinking is his suggestion that covert ops groups go in deep cover at American high schools in order to prevent terrorist attacks. The Pentagon returned the favor and built a beneficial relationship with game developers. The Pentagon allowed members of SEAL Team Six to provide consultation and even write dialogue for Call of Duty.44 And the zombies keep coming. In the context of what Roger Stahl has called “militainment,” the zombies might feel like an afterthought. In fact, they replicate Call of Duty’s basic premise: the American nation-state must employ overwhelming force of all kinds, legitimize any violence, and generally stride the world as a colossus because America’s enemies surge in overwhelming hordes. There’s no way to finally “win” the enormously popular zombie maps. The player must face wave after wave of the undead, finally succumbing. The point, as with the whole franchise, is to rack up body count. Call of Duty’s most popular mode of play easily slides into the real-world aspects of the game. It’s all zombie mode in a way, indiscriminate slaughter in which “saving the free world” and “keeping America safe” are the only rules of engagement. The game instructs its players that the monsters will keep shambling toward you and you have to keep killing them. It’s Bill Clinton’s Operation Infinite Reach, George W. Bush’s Operation Infinite Justice, or more simply Joe Haldeman’s idea of “a forever war.” There’s no conceivable endgame. How could the American empire eliminate evil, particularly with evil understood as destroying every possible challenge to American power? The zombies that stumble toward us forever in Call of Duty are there to shoot, their mindlessness reflecting the equally thought-free logic of FPS games. The games not only give legitimacy to empire’s crimes, they encourage players to see the world the way an empire sees it. The U.S. military fought for the United Fruit Company, to enforce free market principles on global trade, and to control the flow of petroleum from Latin America, the Middle East, and the Caspian Sea. But, at a certain point, all these individual goals transformed into a single unending struggle for American dominance. Defense contractors, politicians, and average Americans came to believe they are fighting enemies in infinite mode and that, as in Haldeman’s The Forever War, they are propelled by nothing more than the purblind logic of terminal velocity. We sit in front of our screens, absorbing it all, tacitly saying yes to the power of national security states that ask not just for obedience, but for our enthusiasm. 11.Digital Demons THIS IS not the world we were supposed to live in. If you listened to the evangelical heralds of tech globalization, the boundless optimism of the eighties and nineties taught you to believe Silicon Valley created, in the parlance of the era, “an information superhighway.” Marshall McLuhan may be best known for his claim in the 1960s that a convergence of technologies insured that “the medium is the message.” However, he also gave us that well-worn term global village in his 1962 book The Gutenberg Galaxy to describe the interconnection made viable by technology. But it’s a phrase very much out of step with the internet’s rhetoric about itself. For McLuhan, the global village meant a loss of privacy, of sophistication, of separating fact from reality through careful reading and contemplation, a digital return to what Marx called “the idiocy of rural life.” But now the provincial hamlet is your favorite social media platform or the bubble of commentary and commerce that you hermit into. The dark carnival rolled into the global village in the small hours, and few knew what lay behind the sideshows and blowoffs, the games and the gags. The barkers made as if the world could be bought for a dime, and they seduced us with partial truths. John Sculley, Apple’s CEO, perhaps came the closest to understanding the meaning of the wireless connected world. It will be, he said in mythic language, “the mother of all markets.” Sculley made his comments at a gathering of personal computer entrepreneurs in New York City in the summer of 1992, a moment when the corporate entities soon to become world powers on the digital landscape decided to invest their energy into “a handheld box operated by pen, or even voice commands.” Such a revolutionary device might be called, these soon-to-be billionaires suggested, “wireless widgets,” “wallet computers,” or “digital information appliances.”45 We are aware that such devices have taken over our lives. There are 290 million smart phones in the Unites States. When we subtract users of burner phones and young children using parental devices from the remaining number of outliers, we are clearly a country thoroughly wired. We’ve all been, in the threatening-sounding dialect of the nineties, “jacked in.” Much-needed attention has been paid to the emotional and existential costs of this kind of lifestyle. Horror stories of the real dangers posed by cyber life have been documented, cautionary tales and “what if?” scenarios that can make logging on to an app feel like agreeing to meet a stranger in a dark, secluded place. We’ve also become aware of the dangers online life offers to an increasingly fragile democracy in the American nation-state. It’s incorrect to talk of the possible “destruction of democracy” in the nation, as democracy has always been tentative. Its promises have been limited to the fifty fully annexed and highly gerrymandered states. Black ballots have not counted for most of American history; the votes of women did not count until 1920. Some of the most lethal “active measures,” to use Bezmenov’s phrase, being pursued against American democracy right now are efforts to restrict voting by state legislatures. But even the sorry state of democracy in a country that disenfranchises nearly seven hundred thousand people in the District of Columbia can be exacerbated. There’s no evidence that Russia “hacked” the election in 2016 or tried the same in 2020. The work of foreign operatives on social media proved much more serious and effective than risking digital fingerprints on a full-scale voting fraud effort, one that might make cybersecurity experts aware of vulnerabilities that could be used at a later time. Evidence shows that two military units of the GRU, the Russian espionage service, hacked into personal servers of the Democratic National Committee, its volunteers, and even high-ranking Democratic leaders such as John Podesta. Malware harvested over seventy gigabytes of data from a single server in April 2016. In the summer of 2016, Russian security contracted out espionage to a hacker working under the handle Guccifer 2.0 (also known as Fancy Bear). He scored perhaps the most significant data breach of the DNC and began publishing the materials through Facebook, Twitter, and a WordPress blog. In fact, right-leaning Americans met redacted and decontextualized information gleaned from Instagram posts, YouTube channels, Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts. Although they claimed to be sites seeking to defend “Second Amendment rights” or to have an affiliation with state Republican parties, they frequently were simply trolls contracted by the Russian secret service. An investigation by Vietnam Veterans of America produced evidence that troll farms in Macedonia created “Vets for Trump” sites of various platforms while targeting veterans more generally on social media with “Islamophobic” and “xenophobic” sentiments. The organization even found evidence that foreign, and some domestic, actors used their names and logos to support the Trump campaign.46 Shadowy Russian affiliates such as the Internet Research Agency (IRA) even created shell sites that labeled themselves as advocacy platforms for LGBTQ+ rights and the Black Lives Matter movement, and then flooded the page with pro-Trump information or general discouragements to vote. The IRA purchased about four thousand Facebook ads for these and similar sites, amounting to about one hundred thousand dollars. By 2017, Facebook had identified 470 accounts run by the company. The GRU and its partners achieved the equivalent of opening a digital sewage valve that flooded American online life with half-truths and absurdities. Perhaps online horror culture unwittingly helped prepare the country for what American intelligence called “the troll farm” that played a highly significant role in 2016. We certainly became accustomed to real-life horror portrayed online, to horror cultures that expressed anxiety about digital life, and to imagining false horrors that help us ignore the very real terrors of a cyber empire. Both mainstream and independent horror films have maintained a persistent interest in the haunted house becoming the haunted computer, or more likely the haunted source code. At least since 1981’s Evilspeak, our screens as portals to hell have been an obvious metaphor. Unfriended, #Horror, Searching, The Den, The Host, Countdown, Followed, Cam, and Friend Request imagine either supernatural evil or serial murderers coming at you through your phone or your desktop. Unfriended may be one of the more interesting examples of this trend as a film, basing itself on the premise that the audience has basic social media literacy and will watch ninety minutes of footage that allows us to see only what the characters see on their digital devices. It’s horror where we are trapped in McLuhan’s global village where none of us asked to live. These films are a conversation about everything we fear from life online: the possibility of an end to privacy, the sense that every stranger who seems aggressive on social media might be something even worse, and the dread of our own digital personas acquiring a life of their own. Since 2016 and the revelation of a massive cybersecurity threat to American elections, the demonic stalkers of Dark Web and Friend Request have taken on an additional viscous layer of dread, oozing out of our screens. Unfortunately, such films have often shared the American solipsism that hides behind its own borders, the tendency to try and sever the natural relationship between the personal and the political. The narcissism of the world of likes and loves and retweets has made these stories even more apolitical, or at least they pretend to be. Friend Request (2016) offers an example of this strenuous self-involvement, illustrated by the film’s insouciance about its own ghastly assumptions. The first few minutes introduce us to the prettiest, most popular, and wealthiest students at an unnamed college, their friendship, romantic life, and adventures performed for the watching world on social media. The single character with some trace of human feeling makes the mistake of offering a modicum of kindness to a black-clad, unattractive outcast with eccentric ideas about personal hygiene. What may have wanted to be a ham-handed parable about cyberbullying fails even at that. Indeed, it seems to encourage the mistreatment of people on the margin of the American class war when they dare seek to connect on social media. The film goes so far as to make the odd-looking goth girl an actual and fairly terrifying witch whose demonic powers can turn computer code into eldritch glyphs, possess Facebook pages, and even turn you into an abandoned social outcast if you dare befriend her. Friend Request even seeks to raise the tension with jump-scare shots of the protagonist’s friends and followers count dropping precipitously. There’s a very real politics of class at work even in an ephemeral film like this one. It wanted to “say something” about social media and, paradoxically, said more than it knew. The wounds of class are often highly visible on American social media. The assumption of economic and cultural capital is behind the power of social influencers and monetized platforms that encourage you to learn “lifestyle hacks,” some not available to tens of millions of American whose low-wage employment denies them the tech and the time. The believability of theatrical posts that render the happiness of home, family, personal success, or travel depends very much on class and status. That such material exists alongside utter howls of tweeted and posted rage offers a clue to the seething sense of grievance that one often finds in online life. Tens of millions of Americans in economic and personal distress are staring through their phone screens and consuming performative happiness enjoyed by those who can afford to stage garish social functions, vacations to exotic locales, images of dinners unaffordable to minimum-wage workers, and romantic relationships perfected, perhaps made possible, by disposable income. McLuhan told IBM in the sixties, when they produced computers mainly to help businesses run payroll, they had entered “the information business” and that the “dossier” maintained in bytes would create for humanity “one big gossip column.” In the world still living outside the screens, Big Brother would depend less on easily recognizable propaganda and more on the democratic impulse dying the death of a thousand distractions. The “one big gossip column” might have led Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to change their famous formulation to “social media and bombs” as the alliance that kept Americans desensitized. When we do look away from a social influencer paid to sell us face soap or the schadenfreude that comes with the digital downfall of a celebrity, we find that the world of cyber warfare tells its tales as simple parables that are easily graspable. In the age when empire has gone online, the defense establishment has encouraged the idea of the United States as victim, unprepared yet fully expecting an online Pearl Harbor. This possibility caused much public handwringing in the national security establishment after 2016. Lieutenant General Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said at a 2019 conference on cybersecurity held in Aspen, Colorado, that such a full-scale cyber assault on the United States had become “kind of the thing that keeps me up at night.”47 There are definitive holes in America’s cybersecurity plans, and a massive and disruptive hack by U.S. adversaries is likely. But much of the public discussion hides the fact that American imperial ambition has made our own cyber offensives the most poorly kept secret in national intelligence. In fact, the United States planned to use computers as war machines even before the internet became a reality. As early as the 1950s, CIA’s Operation Minerva gave the United States the codes for encryption machines sold by the Swiss-based company that produced the clunky coding apparatus that looked like the mating of a fifties cash register and a typewriter. This allowed for spying on a number of Latin American nations and U.S. allies. In 1993, the agency became the major shareholder in the company.48 Obviously, analog coding proved of little use after the PC revolution and the widespread civilian use of the internet. In 2021, it became general knowledge, at least among cybersecurity experts, that Chinese servers had long been targeted by “Trojan” viruses, as well as direct hacks to websites, apps, and online information related to state and military matters. Many of these acts came to light after a major if little-known cyber offensive against Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran in 2018. These actions, even if the public decided not to know about them, are described in some detail in a U.S. Department of Defense official release simply called “Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.” U.S. intelligence services have a similar long history of cyber attacks against Iran, including sallies against civilian and military infrastructure close to the time of writing. Before 2019, a phantasm-like malware called Stuxnet disabled elements of Iran’s nuclear program. Begun under George W. Bush and fully developed in the first year of the Obama administration, the insidious digital package replicated itself beyond its original intention in such a way that thousands of hackers could code it anew and unleash it to proliferate.49 Horror wears a technological mask because the online American empire operates in William Gibson’s “spook country.” But that doesn’t mean the macabre has been reduced to a meme. Our dark carnival allows for plenty of terror IRL. In fact, horror films increasingly melt the walls between fact and fiction. 12.Purging “My God, how did it get to this?” —The Purge: Election Year THE AMERICAN empire’s cyber-ops campaigns do not change the reality or the danger of foreign powers dealing another blow to an already wobbly democracy at home. It does place such disinformation in a broader context. Moreover, as Richard A. Clarke warned in his 2010 book Cyber War, the United States, since the 1990s, put all its efforts into offensive tactics and strategy. In a 2012 interview with Smithsonian magazine, he insisted that the United States had made no real preparations to defend its digital infrastructure. It was as if the United States launched the equivalent of several D-Day landings while enemy paratroopers floated into American backyards. This, of course, should have been received as a sobering assessment from the man who warned two uninterested administrations of the danger posed by Al-Qaeda.50 But there’s been far more changes brought to the American metropole by online life than an extension of imperial ambition into cyberspace. Amid the ghosting and trolling and the occasional troublesome zombie, a terribly dark thing has found it can attach itself to the nervous system of the internet and become a truly viral infection. You might have dodged forgettable films about satanic witches sending you friend requests or even the bots that emerge from the internet’s noosphere offering sex and companionship. You didn’t join a popular Facebook page called Heart of Texas in 2015, a false front for Russian intelligence that began an experiment with social media that ballooned into the fire hose of misinformation that drove the upcoming election cycle. But what happened on 4chan, or Reddit, didn’t stay there. The violence of rhetoric online transformed internet forums into strategy meetings for an online coup. Horror, as has so often been the case in American history, refused to stay on the screens. Horror franchises that aimed for satire sometimes took on a documentary quality rather than a prediction of dystopia to come. The popular The Purge series occupies a very peculiar place in the culture of horror. It’s not a paranormal possession trip or a slasher flick. It’s not a creature feature or a ghost story. The Purge sometimes employs the terror of home invasion that Michael Haneke made infamous in Funny Games (1997; 2007). But the horror is just as likely to find you in the streets. Its “near future” setting even keeps it from nestling easily into our current fascination with social apocalypse. The Purge films and the adjunct television series are their own genre.51 The terrorists have won in 2013’s The Purge. They are the ruling party of the United States and call themselves the New Founding Fathers (NFF), right wing and white supremist. An economic crash, not unlike the real-world death spiral of 2008, has splintered America. But the NFF has brought economic prosperity and the crime rate down to near zero. Popular opinion gives the credit to the annual “purge,” a twelve-hour period in which robbery, rape, and murder are allowed, civilization unleashes all its discontents, and the Freudian id goes a-wilding. In this first iteration, Ethan Hawke and his family are part of the one-percenters who can afford to live behind massive security gates. But he and his privileged brood find themselves targeted when they help a Black man screaming in the street and find their fortress invaded by a mob who wants the man—whom they call “a dirty homeless pig” who “exists only to fulfill our need to purge”—turned over to them. The politics of The Purge turned more explicit as the series advanced. The Purge: Anarchy features the emergence of a resistance, who look and dress a lot like the Black Panther Party of the sixties and seventies, taking over state broadcasts to launch jeremiads at a country that “[worships] at the altar of Smith and Wesson” and uses violence to “[redistribute] wealth upward.” The gloves are really off with 2016’s The Purge: Election Year, which bore the tagline “Keep America Great.” Director James DeMonaco, known for his anti-gun politics, created a scenario in which the regime’s armed death squads, who look like real-world tactical police units executing no-knock warrants, actively work with neo-Nazis. Appearing the year before torch-bearing mobs marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, under a new administration unwilling to condemn them, DeMonaco’s film seemed like prophecy rather than simple prescience. DeMonaco’s effort at creating a 2018 prequel, The First Purge, imagined the NFF beta testing the carnival of murder on Staten Island, assuming an armed and violent hoi polloi would purge the hell out of themselves. The director solved the plot hole that most people would simply leave the island for the night in a most American way: monetize violence. The state offers residents who will stay checks for five thousand dollars with more compensation if they “purge.” This is life-changing money for many Americans outside the frame. Although accused of “fashionable wokeness,” DeMonaco had been urging horror film audiences to think about wealth inequality since the Obama administration when neither Republicans nor Democrats wanted to talk much about it. The First Purge’s use of Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright,” an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement and Fight for $15, suggests a willingness to engage directly with the American empire’s need to wage war against internal dissent. Perhaps what’s truly become “fashionable” is the cynicism that assumes political awareness always represents a “pose.” Indeed, it seems a confirmation of John Carpenter’s message in They Live that there are so many messages everywhere to “Stay Asleep” that the decision to “Stay Woke” can be dismissed by film critics.52 13.Like Something Out of a Zombie Movie VIOLENCE HAS been celebrated in American life for centuries. The nation’s fascination with the West meant that the empire always hungered for new frontiers, across the Pacific world, in the Middle East, in Vietnam, and even by weaponizing the Earth’s orbit. We’ve remembered the Alamo, Wounded Knee, My Lai, and Spahn Ranch while not learning any of their lessons. We’ve forgotten, or never been told about, the mass murder at Sand Creek, the slaughter of Filipino freedom fighters and civilians in Luzon, the tens of thousands killed by the CIA in Operation Phoenix, the Highway of Death in Desert Storm, or the drone massacre in North Waziristan, Pakistan. We doomscroll through our newsfeeds and shake our heads with bewilderment at the latest atrocity in Yemen or Afghanistan. But then we are surprised when, as Malcom X controversially described the Kennedy assassination, “chickens [come] home to roost.” On January 6, 2021, an aggrieved collection of right-wing groups, incited by a lame-duck president and his enablers, attempted an insurrection. It could have been worse. The hundreds who stormed the Capitol could have killed more police. The mob that chanted “Hang Mike Pence!” could have found the vice president and his family and hauled them to the gallows built outside. The sadist fantasies that ooze out of the internet could have emerged from the shadows, online doxing becoming rape, torture, murder. Not the first purge, and not the last either. All of this could still happen because the structures of American life allow for it. You can’t build an empire on violence and then wonder about the causes of violence. Our fictions have been broadcasting this truth for years. The lives of millions of Americans have reflected it for centuries. Its ugliest face floats out of the idea that the assertion of raw power reshapes reality, controls the fact as well as opinion. Republican congressmen since January 6, 2021, have sounded a bit like my theoretically inclined profs in grad school, with their talk of “constructing narratives.” Some House Republicans speak as if they took a Derrida seminar and accepted the notion that “there is nothing outside the text.” Given the nature of political gangsterism since The Prince, they understand the brutal corollary well-meaning academics often dismiss: all that matters is who controls the texts. It looked like a horror film to many who watched in shock as the mob breached the Capitol. One of the most famous moments in George A. Romero’s Dawn of the Dead features female lead Fran asking her partner, Stephen, “What are they doing? Why do they come here?” Surveying the ruined mall where zombies putter about, some comically stumbling on escalators or flailing about in fountains, Stephen says that perhaps it was “instinct.” Driven only by a vicious hunger, they go to “an important place in their lives.” The insurrectionists weren’t zombies. The oncoming horde that trampled some of its own did have leaders, little Murder Legendres who mastered them with tales of stolen elections and Satanists in high places. Perhaps that’s why some of the more striking images of the day fall into two categories: murderous frenzy, or aimless wandering through the halls and offices of the Capitol, somnolent crowds moving as one only to halt their shamble to take selfies or place MAGA hats on statues in the rotunda. The involvement of leaders from QAnon, the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Boogaloo Boys, and a variety of MAGA stalwarts meant that the mob would do more than fumble about and break some windows. At least one photographer with a close view of what he called “hordes” of rioters jamming into windows while overrunning police and overturning barricades described it as “like something out of a zombie movie.”53 One of the most popular memes of the COVID era became a picture of an angry mob, an image captured by Joshua A. Bickel at the Ohio Statehouse. Anti-mask, anti-quarantine, and mostly pro-MAGA, they attempted to force their way into the statehouse, pressing against the glass doors in such a way that it looked painfully like every zombie fiction’s portrayal of the undead seeking to get at the flesh of the living. The memes created from the image featured predictable titles like “Return of the Brain Dead,” “Dawn of the Dumb,” and the clever, if weary, “Wow, this season of The Walking Dead sucks.” Bickel had mixed feelings about the uses to which his photograph has been put. In an interview not long after the meme went viral, he worried over the portrayal of people as zombies. This makes a great deal of moral sense, especially when some of the memes made the cruel joke that the protestors would likely become the actual “infected” of their own personal horror films. Though seeing their behavior as irresponsible, Bickel told his interviewer that we had no idea what dreadful paths brought fearful, broken, and possibly mentally ill people to such a pass. “These people aren’t zombies,” he said.54 Giving monstrous qualities to human beings does have a terrible stench in America’s history; the photographer has a point. Moreover, in the game of enmonstering, everyone gets to play. During the January 6 insurrection, among the MAGA hats, “Don’t Tread on Me” flags, and signs emblazoned with “Q,” there also appeared caps that read “U.S. Zombie Outbreak Response Team” (USZORT being their preferred acronym). USZORT is an actual organization. It does not foreground politics, though it does go beyond harmless memes into encouraging “doomsday prepping” with the idea that adding zombies puts the fun into preparing for “anything from a person infected by a pandemic outbreak to a crazy nut job . . .” A visit to the USZORT website suggests the group is mostly harmless, despite loose talk of how “a zombie” could be a “gangster” (obvious racial coding) or a “terrorist” (also obvious racial coding). As of January 18, 2021, the forums have been mostly quiet, and posts are either seemingly lonely inquirers looking for “Zombie Preparedness Training” in their state or spam from male performance enhancement products. But the dangers of such a mindset, fear of a natural disaster or mild civil unrest lurching into stockpiling weapons, are pretty plain. Kelly J. Baker, a scholar who studies both horror and white supremacy, describes the unusual links between right-wing violence, doomsday prepping, and zombie obsessions in her excellent book The Zombies Are Coming. These connections include a fascination with military-grade weaponry and viewing people of color as a “horde” shambling toward them to take life and property. In the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, the desire to purge seems to have grown stronger among some segments of American society. Indeed, rather than bothering to see their enemies as monsters, some rightist ideologues have suggested they will become monsters themselves. In the online journal American Greatness, supposedly launched to provide intellectual heft to Trumpism’s meandering grievances, Jack Kerwick urged readers to “become the stuff of nightmares.” In a chilling call to arms, he wrote that “the good man must spare not a moment to train, in both body and mind, to become the monster that he may need to become . . .”55 Is this how the empire collapses into the troubled nation-state? The Soviet Union, seemingly a juggernaut with imperial outposts and interests around the globe, died between 1989 and 1991. Crony capitalism attended the rise of Russia while the Soviet Union collapsed not only into a failed state but a collection of failed states. Putin’s Russia emerged as a threatening regional power, though one able to create chaos in cyber warfare like even smaller, more isolated nations like Iran and North Korea. Has the same process set in here? Does political polarization mean eventual balkanization? Will the extreme right get the civil war it wants? The second decade of the century taught Americans about the unruliness of history. The obvious failures of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us that of the many things empires can do, one thing they’ve always done is decline and fall. The insurrection certainly harmed America’s reputation for invincibility abroad. After a drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, more American military personnel occupied the Capitol in the next week than served in all the Middle East. The forever war had come home. The world watched the monster documentary. Did the wars without end exhaust American military and economic power while a meandering and inhumane foreign policy sputtered and failed? Has the death of manufacturing not only destroyed the working class but left America’s economic grip over much of the world in tatters? One hundred years after the beginning of its ascent to global power, has American hubris ended the American century? Some of the biggest promoters of empire think so. Historian and foreign policy analyst Max Boot, who once made a famous “Case for American Empire,” rather bravely left the Republican Party in 2016 to protest the internal rot of Trumpism. To his credit, Boot worried that his compatriots enabled a drift into authoritarianism. But his primary concern over Trumpism was its know-nothing approach to what he called “the world order created by the greatest generation in the 1940s.”56 Boot understands American global power and its limits well enough to know that a landing by U.S. Marines and/or a regime change supported by the CIA isn’t possible in the way it had been in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s. Adventurism has been more likely to result in the indictments of Iran-Contra, the debacle of Black Hawk down, the confusion of “humanitarian” bombings in the Balkans, ill-considered meddling in the politics of Libya, or the catastrophe of Iraq and Afghanistan. And these are the best-case scenario. The first twenty years of the new century have been a lesson in America’s limited ability to impose its will. Of course, maybe what’s bad for the empire is good for democracy at home. In the American past, imperial overreach did inspire social change. The violence visited on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the sixties inaugurated the anti-war movement that then forged links with the Black freedom struggle, second-wave feminism, and the first efforts toward gay liberation. The same could happen again and the transformations wrought could change our fate. A generation who does not recall a time their country did not wage wars on other peoples could use the streets and the ballot box to effect structural change. The people could demand Congress reclaim its constitutional powers to make war from imperial presidential administrations, now largely made up of unelected proconsuls of empire. They could demand laws that regulate corporate power and campaign finance laws in ways that cripple the national security state forever. History is not an oracle. We don’t actually learn from the past and save ourselves from the doom of repeating it. History is just what happens. It’s a place where, because of atavism, apathy, and greed, the worst possible thing is true. “Empires do not last,” Chalmers Johnson warned, “and their ends are usually unpleasant.”57",

      "content": "EPILOGUE Scattered Like Tombstones THE PRESENT “This country is seeking to be whole. Stretching out its arms . . . and consuming all it can. And we merely follow.” —A CANNIBAL EXPLAINS AMERICA’S MANIFEST DESTINY, Ravenous (1999) IT STARTED at the Fleetwood Manor apartment complex in South Carolina in August 2016, as summer faded and attention turned to the national election. Children convinced their parents that clowns skulked out of the woods, wandered our highways in vans with blacked-out windows, called to us from the shadows, and lurked at the edges of their playgrounds, urging them to come and play. This dark fairy tale led anxious male residents to wander into the piney woods behind the rows of identical saltbox units, at times firing randomly into the forest at any shape that might presage a sinister harlequin.1 The strange sightings metastasized across the country, the way they have in earlier periods of change and political discord. In the 1980s, “clowns in a black van” sightings in urban areas tracked with the fraying of the social safety net, the influx of crack cocaine, and the general sense of chaos. Clowns are savage failures, the smell of alcohol and sawdust and sweat a rancid undertone to the dark carnival’s proffered bouquet of fried treats and cotton candy. Clowns never really had a moment of when they “turned bad,” says folklorist Benjamin Radford, “for they were never really good.” Even in late antiquity, Christian bishops worried about the Roman, or Roman-influenced, carnival clown that triggered a Dionysian explosion of rage and horror. Mr. Punch appeared in English marionette theater as a clown prone to extraordinary violence.2 What they all have in common are a poisonous rage, one distinctly masculine in quality. Their efforts to make you laugh are strained, goofy, and unsettling. For small children, they are a threat because it’s not clear what they will do or why they so badly want you to laugh. The brief but intense 2016 clown panic coincided with critics from the left, right, and center describing Trump as a “clown” or “a rodeo clown.” American Horror Story: Cult, a mostly failed effort to satirize Trumpville, made the interesting decision to feature an alt-right imitation of the Manson Family dressed as terrifying clowns. The popularity of the 2017 It remake prompted a New Yorker cover titled “October Surprise” of a pederast clown hiding behind a tree to allude to Trump’s unexpected win. Independence Day of 2018 found the New York Daily News sounding a sensationalistic tocsin by making its entire front page a mock-up of the president slathered in clown makeup. Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone wrote an anti-Trump screed, though a damn good and well-researched screed, entitled Insane Clown President. Memes of Trump as a clown online are numerous. I stopped counting at exactly 126 separate images.3 “It’s hard to get any word in with this clown,” Joe Biden said in his first debate with Trump in September of 2020, “excuse me, this person.” On one level, it’s an easy insult. On another, it’s a realization that the dark carnival is here and cannot be ignored, that its after-midnight jaunts to Haiti, Chile, the Philippines, Vietnam, and most of western Asia brought the violence home. Therefore, Victoria McCollum writes, the horror genre received the attention it did in the Trump years. Horror became less about comforting us, making us think about how we are glad we aren’t at the business end of our nation’s gun, and instead demanding we look at the empire’s homeland. Sometimes, McCollum tells us, it does this with the subtlety of “an amplified death rattle,” even if most films of the Trump era are, as always, commodities and not simply political manifestos.4 It’s impossible to see the clown terrors of recent years as anything but the realization that a bleak and angry nihilism has sunk into the bone and blood of the country. Even the ultimately disastrous American involvement in South Asia, productive of so much evil, had its beginnings in a cockeyed idealism. The empire doesn’t pretend anymore. Under Trump, the United States drew close to neo-fascist regimes in India, Hungary, and Brazil while pondering giving the theocratic House of Saud nuclear weapons. You can’t trust a clown. They might do anything to you. Are they circling economically marginalized neighborhoods in black vans? So goes the legend. But the horrors are verifiably filling the skies with matte-black drones and deadly Apache helicopters, and the dark carnival rolls on its steel wheels to a town near you. “We are living in a horror film,” wrote columnist Charles M. Blow in July 2020, “one starring Donald Trump.”5 Blow wrote at a moment when the United States led the world in numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, 3.2 million of the former and 135,000 of the latter. Three states, California, Texas, and Florida, accounted for 20 percent of all global infections. Two months later, the number of dead surged close to 200,000. Six months later, that number doubled to 400,000 dead, a projection many health officials in the spring of 2020 suggested as a worst-case scenario if the virus raged unimpeded. I’m writing this in 2021. The death toll surges toward 800,000 people, exceeding American deaths in the Second World War and closing in on the combined American deaths in both world wars.6 President Donald Trump’s inaugural speech, three years before the outbreak, will forever be remembered for his evocation of “American carnage” and his reference to the country as a landscape of “tombstones.” In an angry sixteen minutes, he avoided the soaring phrases and the nods to American idealism that mark most inaugurals. “America first! America first!” he railed at the crowd, many of those in the instantly identifiable red MAGA hats in no need of convincing. A fifty-year-old white man who spoke to The Guardian that day saw the whole world turning on its axis, with Brexit, Trump, and, he vainly hoped, the triumph of Marine Le Pen in France. Asked what he felt he gained by these events, he simply said, “I’m a white male who owns firearms. At least for the next four years I get to keep my guns and my balls.”7 While the core adherents of Trumpism grasped at their guns and balls, the rest of us have often been aghast at ourselves as much as the daily newsfeed. A motley crew of white liberals, leftists, centrists, libertarians, and not a few conservatives have gravely worried about authoritarianism degrading democratic norms, even though a cursory knowledge of history reveals that democracy has never been the norm in the American experience. Lies about voter fraud used to legitimate voter suppression have their roots in the white terrorism that ended Reconstruction in the 1870s. Southern states, and parts of the rest of the country, moved to forestall the effect of Black and Latino votes in the aftermath of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The grand old American tradition of holding election day between seven and seven on a Tuesday, the time when working people are, of course, working—but also dealing with childcare, transportation issues, and caring for elderly relations—presents one of the greatest obstacles to the basic right to vote. For much of American history, only white men—and in a few states, only white men who owned property—had the right to vote or hold office. Moreover, the South ignored the Fifteenth Amendment. The 1965 Voting Rights Act, meant to reanimate that much-ignored part of the Constitution, has lain in tatters after a series of decisions by the conservative extremists who today hold the balance of power on the Supreme Court and in state legislatures. Since 2010, twenty-four states enforced restrictions ranging from voter ID laws to criminalizing early balloting, all measures intended to restrict Black voting and the working-class vote more broadly. In 2021, the state legislatures of Arizona, Texas, Florida, and Georgia continued the historic American practice of legislating votes out of existence. The Supreme Court for all practical purposes legitimated this decision in the summer of 2021, much like the high court had given state laws that enforced Jim Crow its imprimatur in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision. Given these facts, what, exactly, have been the “democratic norms” of the United States? Still, many of us spent the Trump years eager to “go back to normal.” Such thoughts plagued us before a global pandemic started killing millions. For some, normal meant a time when the daily news, and even issues we cared about, didn’t really affect us or the emoluments received for being white, male, and gainfully employed in America. In other words, we have been waging a quiet, deeply solipsistic campaign to make our America great again. While worrying over the reach, power, and explosive violence of an empire that people like me benefit from, I haven’t wanted things to change much. Viet Thanh Nguyen searingly noted that the Western left has, for decades, been able to voice their support for “resistance” and even “revolution” without having to face what it means for the dispossessed to claim power and use it in the institutions in which these white comrades have built their careers and their security. Rightist trolling on social media would no doubt diagnose me with Trump Derangement Syndrome, a term that aspirant edgelords began using to “own the libs” after 2016. And maybe they’d be right if they agreed that the whole culture suffered some form of this illness. Rick Perlstein labelled the period between 1965 and 1972 “Nixonland.” Recent years, perhaps since 2012, have decidedly been Trumpville. It’s a place at least as pathological as Nixonland, but even more suffocating in its bitterness and paranoia. The nation-state, still a military behemoth abroad, has built a sideshow on the precipice of calamity, flirting with sickly sweet madness. We’ve seen how horror continues to articulate fears of both empire and nation-state. The clowns of the summer of 2016 became a weird reminder of wars waged out of uncontrollable temper tantrums or America’s past sins coming to their logical conclusion in a foreign policy slaved to multinationals and the oligarch class that controls them. But not everyone agrees. Plenty of scholars of the American empire think the con is over and decline has set in. A few despised Trump for precisely that reason. Many, maybe most, “Never Trump” Republicans, and more than a few Democrats, join Max Boot in despising Trump because he may have accelerated the decline of the United States as the hyperpower. The harming of relationships with “allies,” who have largely been subservient to the United States through NATO, has been a primary complaint. Some criticism, of course, focused on climate change denialism that strained alliances to the breaking point after America’s unilateral withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. But various national security experts have mostly been aghast at Trump’s know-nothingism in response to new battlefield technologies, especially artificial intelligence and cyber ops, while not worrying so much about his desire to lash out at whatever seems vulnerable, whether that be the environment or people.8 The particular brand of nationalism that Trump and MAGA represented suggests what looks at first like contradictory impulses. A significant drawdown of troops in the Middle East, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and gutting what little the United States offers its people as a social safety net looks exactly like what many conservatives and liberals see as the worst aspects of Trumpism: narcissistic impulse disguised as aggressive leadership, a pulling in from the periphery of American interests abroad to the core of the nation-state, and a breach with almost a century of policy directed by a rational design of building American corporate and military power. But in many respects, Trump simply stripped America’s imperial project of its pretensions about humanitarian intervention and nation-building. Trump spent an inordinate amount of time over his public career railing about foreign aid, and in the first years of his presidency, he attempted to cut funding to USAID by 30 percent. Meanwhile, the Trump administration lashed out with one of the most powerful tentacles of American power: gunrunning. Trump drew close to the Hindi nationalist regime of India with the sale of the deadly AH-64 Apache gunships. By the summer of 2019, India used its new weapons systems in its provocative move into the disputed region of Kashmir.9 An arms deal with the repressive regime of Saudi Arabia worth 110 billion opened the Trump presidency. Despite significant tension due to the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, the Pentagon sent advanced Patriot missile systems to the kingdom and, in an underreported episode, Trump’s acting secretary of defense Mike Esper ordered 250 American military personnel to train the Saudi military in the use of the systems. In 2019, despite bipartisan attempts in Congress to restrain him, Trump used a declaration of “national emergency” to offer 8 billion in weapons to the Saudis. In early 2020, amid the emerging public health catastrophe, the administration deployed 2,500 new troops to the Prince Sultan Air Force Base in Riyadh. It also approved 290 million dollars in smart bomb sales, aware they’d be used against civilians in Yemen.10 In 2018 and 2019, Trump green-lit two licenses for nuclear technology benefiting the Saudis. Not only did he act without congressional approval, the Committee on Foreign Relations asked for information about these licenses and was met with a two-month silence.11 In the age of empire with the gloves off, the perennial conservative ambition of militarizing space returned, the imperial fantasy of the final frontier, born from a sad and silly combination of Buck Rogers serials and the work of Robert A. Heinlein on Project Moonbase and Starship Troopers. In 2018, the Trump administration’s demand for a new branch of the military called Space Force took much of the public by surprise. Indeed, many perceived it as a tweet-driven ignis fatuus. In fact, it brought to fruition decades of right-wing conceptions of expanding the American empire and capital into space and expanding the global reach of America’s already sturdy surveillance net, one that went back to Wernher von Braun’s fantasies of orbital weapons platforms. Few Americans paid much attention when Trump signed it into existence in 2020. In 2021, the sixteen-thousand-member cadre, under the command of the Air Force, has a proposed budget of more than fifteen billion dollars.12 Heinlein, Manson Family hero, would be pleased. He’s getting his starship troopers. Has the United States chosen the chain saw or the shark, horror as the nightmare unsettling the American unconscious or as the tranquil dreams of our spoiled national id? What does horror have to say right now about how Americans consider their empire abroad and their troubles at home? It seems we punched our ticket to ride or die, gored by the predatory teeth of both. We are settling in with horror films that feel constrained to offering some comment about American life, even American history and its violence. Audiences have come to accept horror as a serious genre, “elevated” or “smart” in the sense of having something to say. And yet, for a true mainstream blockbuster, we must have heroes willing to destroy the global village to save it, to turn monster island into Amity Island. Kong: Skull Island (2017) offered a peculiar collage of very American notions set on precisely one of those “definitely not American” places that so often lived at the margins of empire. A big, loud, summer blockbuster with easy-on-the eyes cinematography, star power (Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston), and dripping CGI off the screen, the flick has more of the chain saw to it than you would expect. In production four decades after the fall of Saigon, that lost war broods over this actioner in ways that may seem confusing to foreign audiences and even young Americans for whom America’s journey into the heart of darkness seems as distant as the Second World War. For a popcorn flick that dealt with one of the world’s most recognized monsters, the film’s need to turn Skull Island into a complicated political allegory surprises. Sent on a mission to aid scientists when they thought they’d be headed home from South Asia, an Air Cav unit finds itself slaughtered in another jungle. Notably, they bring to the small Pacific island the same heavy ordnance, high-caliber guns, and chemical weapons used in Vietnam. Several shots reference images of napalm exploding in the jungle that are an homage to Apocalypse Now, itself borrowing images from military film footage. “This is one war we get to win,” insists Jackson’s Colonel Packard, the Kurtz/Ahab of the film, who is angry the war ended without an American victory and is just as happy to kill King Kong if the United States won’t let him slaughter Viet Cong anymore. The monster gets napalmed in this film, the burning jelly searing swaths in his fur, just in case we are still trying to avoid the subtext. Packard dies, in true Melvillian fashion, at the hands of the monster and his own conflagration. When Steven Spielberg created Jaws, he wanted any reference to contemporary politics expunged from the source material of Peter Benchley’s novel. Kong: Skull Island tells us it’s 1973 at the beginning of the film, in case we want an exact date. In Warner Bros.’ related films, Godzilla (2014) and Godzilla King of the Monsters (2019), the filmmakers make it clear that their monsters are born in American imperial history, with numerous references not only to American nuclear testing (“we woke them up”) but to actual historical tests such as Operation Castle Bravo in 1954, which had a much higher radioactive yield than expected. Fallout drifted from the Marshall Islands to India and Australia, and eventually to the United States itself. To be clear, the popular films are not kaiju for readers of Howard Zinn. At best, they show we are a long way from the nineties revival of Godzilla, when the disruption of his ancient sleep could be blamed on the French. And yet Kong: Skull Island also doesn’t question, in any fashion, the basic premise that U.S. troops can land in an “un-American jungle” anywhere in the world, explode tons of ordnance, and find themselves welcomed and befriended by the Indigenous population. Monarch, a super-secret organization that seems a lot like a CIA tasked with killing monsters, are the human protagonists of all Warner Bros.’ monsterverse flicks. The film’s logic assumes that if only meddling and morally suspect Congressional oversight committees would stop sticking their noses where they don’t belong, then Monarch could get on with their work without the burdens of accountability, operating out of black sites all over the globe. These popular films don’t bother to narrate empire, as did the original King Kong. They assume it. Both Democrats and Republicans who feared that Trump’s American carnage meant the end of empire watch these big-budget popcorn flicks for solace. Americans, even in their most escapist entertainments, assume their armed forces, black ops units, and mercenaries (“civilian contractors”) can go anywhere in the world and kill anything that moves. In fact, in a bizarre confirmation of how much America’s culture industry can globalize its historical obsessions, much of Kong: Skull Island was filmed in northern provinces of Vietnam, showing the war against the monster fought in the gorgeous provinces of Ninh Binh and Quang Ninh. The Vietnamese government happily cooperated and granted the film’s director status as “tourism ambassador,” the first person not of Vietnamese descent to ever receive this title.13 Films and bombs. But also films about bombs used against a monster, produced in a country with millions of tons of still-unexploded ordnance hurled into the country’s body and bones for nearly fifteen years. These terrible relics have maimed and killed tens of thousands of civilians since 1975. But the power of America’s “industry of memory” can sell a country a horror allegory about a war that killed millions of their people, seen from the standpoint of the aggressor, and make them like it.14 Empires stand alone. There’s so often an immense loneliness at the heart of contemporary horror films, the stories leeching out our inner poisons, replaying for us the terrors of living in a fortified nation-state. Even before the pandemic of 2020, themes of blindness, deafness, and, above all, isolation saturated contemporary horror in films like Bird Box, A Quiet Place, The Silence, Hush, Here Alone, It Comes at Night, The Wind, and Don’t Breathe. Empire’s apocalypse has come to mean suffering alone, a peculiarly haunting echo of the failed promises, and the horrors, of the global village. The writer Linh Dinh, in his novel Love Like Hate, admits that Vietnam, especially his beloved Saigon, is a disaster, but he adds that at least one doesn’t die alone in the desolation, the “solitary nightmare” of America. Americans are “so cool” they manage to be “quiet about their desperation.”15 Isolation may seem a strange condition at empire’s twilight. Perhaps it’s the pondering of the aftermath of the world we made that horror plays with now. The clowns are terrifying, the sound of the calliope tingles the spine with its weirdness, the music of the carousel jangles, its Wurlitzer tune broken and serrated. But once something wicked coming this way has passed, what does it leave behind? Is our insatiate need to victimize, or at least glamorize those who victimize in our name, part of the reason for our polarizations and isolations? American myths adore the loner and the rogue, the quiet man of action. Teddy Roosevelt tore a canal into Panama and Ted Bundy tore apart sorority girls. John Wayne buried his kills by old Red River and John Wayne Gacy laid his to rest in the crawl space at 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Speaking softly and carrying a big stick has been the American way, as has using that stick to bludgeon others into paralysis and death. It’s lonely at the top of the bone pile. Have Americans chosen the chain saw or the shark? The last hundred years suggest they’ve wanted both. The certainty that the monsters waiting in the deep can be slain by American tough-guyery means we are never afraid to wade back into the water. We still fear the saw but refuse to let its blind roar unsettle our sleep. We can even reimagine it, a weapon we make our own, Ash of the Evil Dead films putting a chain saw on his bloody stump of an arm and marching against an army of darkness with panache, even a John Wayne swagger. War stories are difficult. War stories are so often horror stories that try to ignore their own tropes. Too often when the lights go up, you think “war is hell” but also damn exciting and “has to be done.” But look at it. It’s also the sport of empire that demands full cooperation—your taxes, your apathy, your willingness to hate what you see in the floating gunsight that ranges across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific world. Horror movies, fiction, and games draw on these poisoned waters and reimagine these piles of corpses. In a country that taught itself to become history’s most powerful war machine while keeping less than 1 percent of its population under arms, horror offers one of the few places where the true war story can be told. The truth of war is not about what happens on the front lines. It’s a story about what Americans consume, what we are willing to allow our government to do so we can keep bingeing, and whether we are willing to all play at answering the call of duty, becoming a nation of first-person shooters, most of whom will never have to pick up an actual rifle unless it’s to kill other Americans out of rage and frustration. Instead, the working-class avatars we’d call the cops on if they walked through our neighborhood do the killing for us. We’ll just wrap ourselves in the softer side of empire, tales of soldiers in our wars “defending our freedoms,” and not the truth that they are pawns in a larger game of taking what belongs to others. The war story of America has become the very apotheosis of Aislinn Clarke’s dictum about horror: the worst thing is true. The twenty-first century looms in front of us in darkness, moraines of debris at its base, cobalt vitriol burbling out of its peak, the thunders and lightnings imagined of Sinai casting a phosphorus glow over its seven rucks. Will the stars and stripes appear on its peak, naked power subduing another century? Or could we perhaps become a people rather than an empire? Better angels and all that? There’s nothing in our history or the history of the world that assures us it will be so. We may want war stories that give us a tale of redemption, maybe a bit of survival and glory. But history and its horror refuse to reassure us. The mountain rears up, disappearing into a horizon of fathomless darkness. The tinny sounds of the carnival carry on the hot winds, heard in the quiet of the small hours.",

The Supreme Court for all practical purposes legitimated this decision in the summer of 2021, much like the high court had given state laws that enforced Jim Crow its imprimatur in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision. Given these facts, what, exactly, have been the “democratic norms” of the United States? Still, many of us spent the Trump years eager to “go back to normal.” Such thoughts plagued us before a global pandemic started killing millions. For some, normal meant a time when the daily news, and even issues we cared about, didn’t really affect us or the emoluments received for being white, male, and gainfully employed in America. In other words, we have been waging a quiet, deeply solipsistic campaign to make our America great again. While worrying over the reach, power, and explosive violence of an empire that people like me benefit from, I haven’t wanted things to change much. Viet Thanh Nguyen searingly noted that the Western left has, for decades, been able to voice their support for “resistance” and even “revolution” without having to face what it means for the dispossessed to claim power and use it in the institutions in which these white comrades have built their careers and their security. Rightist trolling on social media would no doubt diagnose me with Trump Derangement Syndrome, a term that aspirant edgelords began using to “own the libs” after 2016. And maybe they’d be right if they agreed that the whole culture suffered some form of this illness. Rick Perlstein labelled the period between 1965 and 1972 “Nixonland.” Recent years, perhaps since 2012, have decidedly been Trumpville. It’s a place at least as pathological as Nixonland, but even more suffocating in its bitterness and paranoia. The nation-state, still a military behemoth abroad, has built a sideshow on the precipice of calamity, flirting with sickly sweet madness. We’ve seen how horror continues to articulate fears of both empire and nation-state. The clowns of the summer of 2016 became a weird reminder of wars waged out of uncontrollable temper tantrums or America’s past sins coming to their logical conclusion in a foreign policy slaved to multinationals and the oligarch class that controls them. But not everyone agrees. Plenty of scholars of the American empire think the con is over and decline has set in. A few despised Trump for precisely that reason. Many, maybe most, “Never Trump” Republicans, and more than a few Democrats, join Max Boot in despising Trump because he may have accelerated the decline of the United States as the hyperpower. The harming of relationships with “allies,” who have largely been subservient to the United States through NATO, has been a primary complaint. Some criticism, of course, focused on climate change denialism that strained alliances to the breaking point after America’s unilateral withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. But various national security experts have mostly been aghast at Trump’s know-nothingism in response to new battlefield technologies, especially artificial intelligence and cyber ops, while not worrying so much about his desire to lash out at whatever seems vulnerable, whether that be the environment or people.8 The particular brand of nationalism that Trump and MAGA represented suggests what looks at first like contradictory impulses. A significant drawdown of troops in the Middle East, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and gutting what little the United States offers its people as a social safety net looks exactly like what many conservatives and liberals see as the worst aspects of Trumpism: narcissistic impulse disguised as aggressive leadership, a pulling in from the periphery of American interests abroad to the core of the nation-state, and a breach with almost a century of policy directed by a rational design of building American corporate and military power. But in many respects, Trump simply stripped America’s imperial project of its pretensions about humanitarian intervention and nation-building. Trump spent an inordinate amount of time over his public career railing about foreign aid, and in the first years of his presidency, he attempted to cut funding to USAID by 30 percent. Meanwhile, the Trump administration lashed out with one of the most powerful tentacles of American power: gunrunning. Trump drew close to the Hindi nationalist regime of India with the sale of the deadly AH-64 Apache gunships. By the summer of 2019, India used its new weapons systems in its provocative move into the disputed region of Kashmir.9 An arms deal with the repressive regime of Saudi Arabia worth 110 billion opened the Trump presidency. Despite significant tension due to the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, the Pentagon sent advanced Patriot missile systems to the kingdom and, in an underreported episode, Trump’s acting secretary of defense Mike Esper ordered 250 American military personnel to train the Saudi military in the use of the systems. In 2019, despite bipartisan attempts in Congress to restrain him, Trump used a declaration of “national emergency” to offer 8 billion in weapons to the Saudis. In early 2020, amid the emerging public health catastrophe, the administration deployed 2,500 new troops to the Prince Sultan Air Force Base in Riyadh. It also approved 290 million dollars in smart bomb sales, aware they’d be used against civilians in Yemen.10 In 2018 and 2019, Trump green-lit two licenses for nuclear technology benefiting the Saudis. Not only did he act without congressional approval, the Committee on Foreign Relations asked for information about these licenses and was met with a two-month silence.11 In the age of empire with the gloves off, the perennial conservative ambition of militarizing space returned, the imperial fantasy of the final frontier, born from a sad and silly combination of Buck Rogers serials and the work of Robert A. Heinlein on Project Moonbase and Starship Troopers. In 2018, the Trump administration’s demand for a new branch of the military called Space Force took much of the public by surprise. Indeed, many perceived it as a tweet-driven ignis fatuus. In fact, it brought to fruition decades of right-wing conceptions of expanding the American empire and capital into space and expanding the global reach of America’s already sturdy surveillance net, one that went back to Wernher von Braun’s fantasies of orbital weapons platforms. Few Americans paid much attention when Trump signed it into existence in 2020. In 2021, the sixteen-thousand-member cadre, under the command of the Air Force, has a proposed budget of more than fifteen billion dollars.12 Heinlein, Manson Family hero, would be pleased. He’s getting his starship troopers. Has the United States chosen the chain saw or the shark, horror as the nightmare unsettling the American unconscious or as the tranquil dreams of our spoiled national id? What does horror have to say right now about how Americans consider their empire abroad and their troubles at home? It seems we punched our ticket to ride or die, gored by the predatory teeth of both. We are settling in with horror films that feel constrained to offering some comment about American life, even American history and its violence. Audiences have come to accept horror as a serious genre, “elevated” or “smart” in the sense of having something to say. And yet, for a true mainstream blockbuster, we must have heroes willing to destroy the global village to save it, to turn monster island into Amity Island. Kong: Skull Island (2017) offered a peculiar collage of very American notions set on precisely one of those “definitely not American” places that so often lived at the margins of empire. A big, loud, summer blockbuster with easy-on-the eyes cinematography, star power (Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston), and dripping CGI off the screen, the flick has more of the chain saw to it than you would expect. In production four decades after the fall of Saigon, that lost war broods over this actioner in ways that may seem confusing to foreign audiences and even young Americans for whom America’s journey into the heart of darkness seems as distant as the Second World War. For a popcorn flick that dealt with one of the world’s most recognized monsters, the film’s need to turn Skull Island into a complicated political allegory surprises. Sent on a mission to aid scientists when they thought they’d be headed home from South Asia, an Air Cav unit finds itself slaughtered in another jungle. Notably, they bring to the small Pacific island the same heavy ordnance, high-caliber guns, and chemical weapons used in Vietnam. Several shots reference images of napalm exploding in the jungle that are an homage to Apocalypse Now, itself borrowing images from military film footage. “This is one war we get to win,” insists Jackson’s Colonel Packard, the Kurtz/Ahab of the film, who is angry the war ended without an American victory and is just as happy to kill King Kong if the United States won’t let him slaughter Viet Cong anymore. The monster gets napalmed in this film, the burning jelly searing swaths in his fur, just in case we are still trying to avoid the subtext. Packard dies, in true Melvillian fashion, at the hands of the monster and his own conflagration. When Steven Spielberg created Jaws, he wanted any reference to contemporary politics expunged from the source material of Peter Benchley’s novel. Kong: Skull Island tells us it’s 1973 at the beginning of the film, in case we want an exact date. In Warner Bros.’ related films, Godzilla (2014) and Godzilla King of the Monsters (2019), the filmmakers make it clear that their monsters are born in American imperial history, with numerous references not only to American nuclear testing (“we woke them up”) but to actual historical tests such as Operation Castle Bravo in 1954, which had a much higher radioactive yield than expected. Fallout drifted from the Marshall Islands to India and Australia, and eventually to the United States itself. To be clear, the popular films are not kaiju for readers of Howard Zinn. At best, they show we are a long way from the nineties revival of Godzilla, when the disruption of his ancient sleep could be blamed on the French. And yet Kong: Skull Island also doesn’t question, in any fashion, the basic premise that U.S. troops can land in an “un-American jungle” anywhere in the world, explode tons of ordnance, and find themselves welcomed and befriended by the Indigenous population. Monarch, a super-secret organization that seems a lot like a CIA tasked with killing monsters, are the human protagonists of all Warner Bros.’ monsterverse flicks. The film’s logic assumes that if only meddling and morally suspect Congressional oversight committees would stop sticking their noses where they don’t belong, then Monarch could get on with their work without the burdens of accountability, operating out of black sites all over the globe. These popular films don’t bother to narrate empire, as did the original King Kong. They assume it. Both Democrats and Republicans who feared that Trump’s American carnage meant the end of empire watch these big-budget popcorn flicks for solace. Americans, even in their most escapist entertainments, assume their armed forces, black ops units, and mercenaries (“civilian contractors”) can go anywhere in the world and kill anything that moves. In fact, in a bizarre confirmation of how much America’s culture industry can globalize its historical obsessions, much of Kong: Skull Island was filmed in northern provinces of Vietnam, showing the war against the monster fought in the gorgeous provinces of Ninh Binh and Quang Ninh. The Vietnamese government happily cooperated and granted the film’s director status as “tourism ambassador,” the first person not of Vietnamese descent to ever receive this title.13 Films and bombs. But also films about bombs used against a monster, produced in a country with millions of tons of still-unexploded ordnance hurled into the country’s body and bones for nearly fifteen years. These terrible relics have maimed and killed tens of thousands of civilians since 1975. But the power of America’s “industry of memory” can sell a country a horror allegory about a war that killed millions of their people, seen from the standpoint of the aggressor, and make them like it.14 Empires stand alone. There’s so often an immense loneliness at the heart of contemporary horror films, the stories leeching out our inner poisons, replaying for us the terrors of living in a fortified nation-state. Even before the pandemic of 2020, themes of blindness, deafness, and, above all, isolation saturated contemporary horror in films like Bird Box, A Quiet Place, The Silence, Hush, Here Alone, It Comes at Night, The Wind, and Don’t Breathe. Empire’s apocalypse has come to mean suffering alone, a peculiarly haunting echo of the failed promises, and the horrors, of the global village. The writer Linh Dinh, in his novel Love Like Hate, admits that Vietnam, especially his beloved Saigon, is a disaster, but he adds that at least one doesn’t die alone in the desolation, the “solitary nightmare” of America. Americans are “so cool” they manage to be “quiet about their desperation.”15 Isolation may seem a strange condition at empire’s twilight. Perhaps it’s the pondering of the aftermath of the world we made that horror plays with now. The clowns are terrifying, the sound of the calliope tingles the spine with its weirdness, the music of the carousel jangles, its Wurlitzer tune broken and serrated. But once something wicked coming this way has passed, what does it leave behind? Is our insatiate need to victimize, or at least glamorize those who victimize in our name, part of the reason for our polarizations and isolations? American myths adore the loner and the rogue, the quiet man of action. Teddy Roosevelt tore a canal into Panama and Ted Bundy tore apart sorority girls. John Wayne buried his kills by old Red River and John Wayne Gacy laid his to rest in the crawl space at 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Speaking softly and carrying a big stick has been the American way, as has using that stick to bludgeon others into paralysis and death. It’s lonely at the top of the bone pile. Have Americans chosen the chain saw or the shark? The last hundred years suggest they’ve wanted both. The certainty that the monsters waiting in the deep can be slain by American tough-guyery means we are never afraid to wade back into the water. We still fear the saw but refuse to let its blind roar unsettle our sleep. We can even reimagine it, a weapon we make our own, Ash of the Evil Dead films putting a chain saw on his bloody stump of an arm and marching against an army of darkness with panache, even a John Wayne swagger. War stories are difficult. War stories are so often horror stories that try to ignore their own tropes. Too often when the lights go up, you think “war is hell” but also damn exciting and “has to be done.” But look at it. It’s also the sport of empire that demands full cooperation—your taxes, your apathy, your willingness to hate what you see in the floating gunsight that ranges across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific world. Horror movies, fiction, and games draw on these poisoned waters and reimagine these piles of corpses. In a country that taught itself to become history’s most powerful war machine while keeping less than 1 percent of its population under arms, horror offers one of the few places where the true war story can be told. The truth of war is not about what happens on the front lines. It’s a story about what Americans consume, what we are willing to allow our government to do so we can keep bingeing, and whether we are willing to all play at answering the call of duty, becoming a nation of first-person shooters, most of whom will never have to pick up an actual rifle unless it’s to kill other Americans out of rage and frustration. Instead, the working-class avatars we’d call the cops on if they walked through our neighborhood do the killing for us. We’ll just wrap ourselves in the softer side of empire, tales of soldiers in our wars “defending our freedoms,” and not the truth that they are pawns in a larger game of taking what belongs to others. The war story of America has become the very apotheosis of Aislinn Clarke’s dictum about horror: the worst thing is true. The twenty-first century looms in front of us in darkness, moraines of debris at its base, cobalt vitriol burbling out of its peak, the thunders and lightnings imagined of Sinai casting a phosphorus glow over its seven rucks. Will the stars and stripes appear on its peak, naked power subduing another century? Or could we perhaps become a people rather than an empire? Better angels and all that? There’s nothing in our history or the history of the world that assures us it will be so. We may want war stories that give us a tale of redemption, maybe a bit of survival and glory. But history and its horror refuse to reassure us. The mountain rears up, disappearing into a horizon of fathomless darkness. The tinny sounds of the carnival carry on the hot winds, heard in the quiet of the small hours.",

The press did little to cover this scandal and details have primarily emerged by the work of later historians. The most meaningful and detailed contemporary critique of the practice appeared in the generally ignored pamphlet by George Breitman, Wartime Crimes of Big Business (New York: Pioneer Publishers and the Socialist Workers Party, 1943). Much more than the Marxist origin of the detailed investigation doomed it; the Socialist Workers Party was a Trotskyite organization and so allowed no oxygen, paradoxically, because the United States allied in the war effort with Stalin’s Soviet Union. Around the same time, Hollywood produced the film Mission to Moscow (1943), which followed the pro-Stalin journals of Ambassador Joseph E. Davies, including a difficult-to-watch celebration of the 1930s show trials that condemned Trotsky as a Nazi collaborator.

For some examples, see Lacy K.

Gates, “War-Related Deaths in the Philippines, 1898–1902,” Pacific Historical Review 53, no. 3 (1984): 367–78.

Moreland’s big break came with a series of films in the thirties and forties, often in roles that were demeaning (then and now). However, his humor often struck a chord with Black audiences, and even today it’s possible to read his burlesque style as a running commentary on the often clueless white characters around him. In King of the Zombies, he is the only character who fully understands the threat and attempts to warn his compatriots. Before his death, he became a regular on the Hallmark Hall of Fame series and appeared in the cult horror film Spider Baby (1968) with Lon Chaney Jr. Spike Lee paid tribute to him in Bamboozled (2000), which showed Black actors carving out spaces of dignity for themselves in Jim Crow Hollywood. 11.Mary A.

The claims here are based on Alfred W. McCoy’s The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (New York: Harper & Row, 1972). McCoy’s claims have never been seriously disputed. In 1981 conversations with Jonathan Mirsky, a former CIA agent who worked closely with General Pao, McCoy confirmed the Hmong’s entanglement with the opium trade. While I am not able to confirm it and so take a different view for now, former CIA agents have also suggested that Air America pilots did carry refined heroin, though without their knowledge. See William E. Colby and Jonathan Mirsky, “Heroin, Laos, and the CIA,” New York Review of Books, November 22, 1990. 43.An official CIA report, classified on its first release, noted that CIA policy forbade transport of “large quantities” of illegal drugs aboard Air America.

Appy, American Reckoning: The Vietnam War and Our National Identity (New York: Penguin Books, 2016), 106. Appy notes that theft and corruption proved so rampant that nearly half of these commodities disappeared. South Vietnamese men and women, for starvation wages, provided the labor behind military bases, often with elaborate services for officers and enlisted men alike that included swimming pools, ice cream shops, maid service, nightly films, and brothels. Private American companies made hundreds of millions of dollars supporting the war, most infamously Brown & Root. This engineering and construction firm became so notorious that GIs regularly referred to them as “Burn and Loot.” Appy, American Reckoning, 108–111. 5.Interview with Tom Savini in Smoke and Mirrors (2015). 6.Savini, Grande Illusions, 12; and interview, Smoke and Mirrors. 7.Al Santoli, Everything We Had: An Oral History of the Vietnam War (New York: Random House, 1981), 63. 8.W.

It’s not even a little surprising that that trade paper of America’s ruling class blamed the plight of American cities on high taxes and bloated city government rather than the glaringly obvious reasons for unemployment and decay of the city services, the latter of which the limousine liberals and conservatives that populate the paper’s op-ed pages regard as government waste. 11.“Examining Chrysler’s 1979 Rescue,” All Things Considered, NPR, November 12, 2008, www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96922222. 12.Tommy Beer, “Top 1% of U.S. Households Hold 15 Times More Wealth Than Bottom 50% Combined,” Forbes, October 8, 2020. 13.Joe Williams, “Show Me the Movies,” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 17, 2005, C1. 14.The Clinton administration’s assumption that what Joshua B. Freeman calls “a global free-trade regime” has resulted in the free movement of American corporations that simultaneously robs American workers of jobs, allows for cheap labor and appalling working conditions overseas, and channels U.S. power through “loans, investments, international treaties, technical expertise, and cultural capital” in a fashion at least as important as military dominance.

Emma Tomalin (New York: Routledge, 2015). One of the more troubling aspects of this discussion, first produced at the London School of Economics as a paper, concerns the suggestion that Pentecostalism might allow for the stealth justification of free market economics. The argument is convoluted but involves Pentecostalism in conjunction with “innovation” to bring on neoliberal change to the “worldview” of African peoples. Marx was right. 44.Under Kennedy and Johnson, the United States expressed support for ending apartheid and even linked it to changes in American society under the civil rights movement. However, Nixon reversed policy and the United States became increasingly weak willed on the subject under Ford and Carter. Increasing pressure from a multitude of sources mounted on the Reagan administration to reverse U.S. support, but the administration proved recalcitrant. Congress finally passed a comprehensive package of sanctions in 1986 . . . however, it survived only after a second supermajority vote overrode a presidential veto. 45.Nicky Falkof, “‘Satan has come to Rietfontein’: Race in South Africa’s Satanic Panic,” Journal of Southern African Studies 38, no.4 (2012): 753–67. 46.“Mapping Anti-Gay Laws in Africa,” Amnesty International UK, May 31, 2018, www.amnesty.org.uk/lgbti-lgbt-gay-human-rights-law-africa-uganda-kenya-nigeria-cameroon. 47.Peter Applebome, “Drugs, Death, and the Occult Meet in Grisly Inquiry at Mexico Border,” New York Times, April 13, 1989. 48.Victor, Satanic Panic, 21. 49.Richard Ofshe and Ethan Watters, Making Monsters: False Memories, Psychotherapy, and Sexual Hysteria (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 188. 50.“CIA-assisted ‘contras’ murdered Sandinistas, Official Reportedly Says,” Knight-Ridder, October 20, 1984; accessed January 23, 2019, www.newspapers.com/newspage/120079409/. 51.“Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair,” House of Representatives, November 13, 1987, archive.org/details/reportofcongress87unit/page/n11/mode/2up.

The allusion becomes more inexplicable given that, in Independence Day, nukes save the United States and, in the logic of the film, the world. 21.It’s worth noting that, while Jurassic Park does have a well-earned reputation for unleashing CGI on the world, the film used a number of practical effects later cleaned up on the green screen. Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur fantasy did not presage entire environments, landscapes, and even characters being motion captured and becoming more or less essential to mainstream films. 22.Verhoeven has been quoted multiple times saying varieties of this.

The press did little to cover this scandal and details have primarily emerged by the work of later historians. The most meaningful and detailed contemporary critique of the practice appeared in the generally ignored pamphlet by George Breitman, Wartime Crimes of Big Business (New York: Pioneer Publishers and the Socialist Workers Party, 1943). Much more than the Marxist origin of the detailed investigation doomed it; the Socialist Workers Party was a Trotskyite organization and so allowed no oxygen, paradoxically, because the United States allied in the war effort with Stalin’s Soviet Union. Around the same time, Hollywood produced the film Mission to Moscow (1943), which followed the pro-Stalin journals of Ambassador Joseph E. Davies, including a difficult-to-watch celebration of the 1930s show trials that condemned Trotsky as a Nazi collaborator. A lie can travel halfway round the world while the truth takes an ice pick to the head. 9.A. H.

For some examples, see Lacy K. Ford Jr., “Making the ‘White Man’s Country’ White: Race, Slavery, and State-Building in the Jacksonian South,” Journal of the Early Republic 19, no. 4 (1999): 713–37. 3.It’s important for the reader to know that my interpretation not only rests on the consensus view of historians of Haiti but also evidence that the period press spoke openly, and often in a celebratory manner, of the U.S. invasion. For two examples, see “Help for a Neighbor,” New York Times, February 21, 1917; “A Plan for Haiti,” New York Times, March 11, 1930. 4.Burk’s stories are collected in Black Medicine (Sauk City: Arkham House, 1966). 5.Daniel Immerwahr, How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States (New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2019), 110–15.

Gates, “War-Related Deaths in the Philippines, 1898–1902,” Pacific Historical Review 53, no. 3 (1984): 367–78. If correct, it’s still a low number given the continued violent American response to insurgency into the 1910s. 6.David Roediger, “Gook: The Short History of an Americanism,” Monthly Review 43, no. 10 (March 1992). 7.Herbert J.

Moreland’s big break came with a series of films in the thirties and forties, often in roles that were demeaning (then and now). However, his humor often struck a chord with Black audiences, and even today it’s possible to read his burlesque style as a running commentary on the often clueless white characters around him. In King of the Zombies, he is the only character who fully understands the threat and attempts to warn his compatriots. Before his death, he became a regular on the Hallmark Hall of Fame series and appeared in the cult horror film Spider Baby (1968) with Lon Chaney Jr. Spike Lee paid tribute to him in Bamboozled (2000), which showed Black actors carving out spaces of dignity for themselves in Jim Crow Hollywood. 11.Mary A.

The CIA worked through a Miami company called Southern Air Transport, which also helped supply arms to the Contras when this report appeared. Both acts were in violation of Congressional proscription. The Times notes that “There was no indication whether George Bush, the Director of Central Intelligence at the time, was aware of the operation.” The reader can ponder all the various implications of this statement. 13.Tim Weiner, Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA (New York: Anchor Books, 2007), 108, 110–13. 14.Doc 2-3333, Memorandum to: Deputy, Plans, FROM: Assistant to the Director, CIA Historical Review Program, November 5, 1951; CIA Cable, January 24, 1954: Security Information, Released as Sanitized 2003. www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000915067.pdf. 15.See Stephen Schlesinger and Stephen Kinzer, Bitter Fruit: The Story of the American Coup in Guatemala, 2nd ed.

The claims here are based on Alfred W. McCoy’s The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (New York: Harper & Row, 1972). McCoy’s claims have never been seriously disputed. In 1981 conversations with Jonathan Mirsky, a former CIA agent who worked closely with General Pao, McCoy confirmed the Hmong’s entanglement with the opium trade. While I am not able to confirm it and so take a different view for now, former CIA agents have also suggested that Air America pilots did carry refined heroin, though without their knowledge. See William E. Colby and Jonathan Mirsky, “Heroin, Laos, and the CIA,” New York Review of Books, November 22, 1990. 43.An official CIA report, classified on its first release, noted that CIA policy forbade transport of “large quantities” of illegal drugs aboard Air America. But the report also admitted it may have happened in smaller quantities in an accidental fashion.

South Vietnamese men and women, for starvation wages, provided the labor behind military bases, often with elaborate services for officers and enlisted men alike that included swimming pools, ice cream shops, maid service, nightly films, and brothels. Private American companies made hundreds of millions of dollars supporting the war, most infamously Brown & Root.

It’s not even a little surprising that that trade paper of America’s ruling class blamed the plight of American cities on high taxes and bloated city government rather than the glaringly obvious reasons for unemployment and decay of the city services, the latter of which the limousine liberals and conservatives that populate the paper’s op-ed pages regard as government waste. 11.“Examining Chrysler’s 1979 Rescue,” All Things Considered, NPR, November 12, 2008, www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96922222. 12.Tommy Beer, “Top 1% of U.S. Households Hold 15 Times More Wealth Than Bottom 50% Combined,” Forbes, October 8, 2020. 13.Joe Williams, “Show Me the Movies,” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 17, 2005, C1. 14.The Clinton administration’s assumption that what Joshua B.

One of the more troubling aspects of this discussion, first produced at the London School of Economics as a paper, concerns the suggestion that Pentecostalism might allow for the stealth justification of free market economics. The argument is convoluted but involves Pentecostalism in conjunction with “innovation” to bring on neoliberal change to the “worldview” of African peoples. Marx was right. 44.Under Kennedy and Johnson, the United States expressed support for ending apartheid and even linked it to changes in American society under the civil rights movement. However, Nixon reversed policy and the United States became increasingly weak willed on the subject under Ford and Carter. Increasing pressure from a multitude of sources mounted on the Reagan administration to reverse U.S. support, but the administration proved recalcitrant. Congress finally passed a comprehensive package of sanctions in 1986 . . . however, it survived only after a second supermajority vote overrode a presidential veto. 45.Nicky Falkof, “‘Satan has come to Rietfontein’: Race in South Africa’s Satanic Panic,” Journal of Southern African Studies 38, no.4 (2012): 753–67. 46.“Mapping Anti-Gay Laws in Africa,” Amnesty International UK, May 31, 2018, www.amnesty.org.uk/lgbti-lgbt-gay-human-rights-law-africa-uganda-kenya-nigeria-cameroon. 47.Peter Applebome, “Drugs, Death, and the Occult Meet in Grisly Inquiry at Mexico Border,” New York Times, April 13, 1989. 48.Victor, Satanic Panic, 21. 49.Richard Ofshe and Ethan Watters, Making Monsters: False Memories, Psychotherapy, and Sexual Hysteria (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 188. 50.“CIA-assisted ‘contras’ murdered Sandinistas, Official Reportedly Says,” Knight-Ridder, October 20, 1984; accessed January 23, 2019, www.newspapers.com/newspage/120079409/. 51.“Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair,” House of Representatives, November 13, 1987, archive.org/details/reportofcongress87unit/page/n11/mode/2up.

The allusion becomes more inexplicable given that, in Independence Day, nukes save the United States and, in the logic of the film, the world. 21.It’s worth noting that, while Jurassic Park does have a well-earned reputation for unleashing CGI on the world, the film used a number of practical effects later cleaned up on the green screen. Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur fantasy did not presage entire environments, landscapes, and even characters being motion captured and becoming more or less essential to mainstream films. 22.Verhoeven has been quoted multiple times saying varieties of this.

The press did little to cover this scandal and details have primarily emerged by the work of later historians. The most meaningful and detailed contemporary critique of the practice appeared in the generally ignored pamphlet by George Breitman, Wartime Crimes of Big Business (New York: Pioneer Publishers and the Socialist Workers Party, 1943). Much more than the Marxist origin of the detailed investigation doomed it; the Socialist Workers Party was a Trotskyite organization and so allowed no oxygen, paradoxically, because the United States allied in the war effort with Stalin’s Soviet Union. Around the same time, Hollywood produced the film Mission to Moscow (1943), which followed the pro-Stalin journals of Ambassador Joseph E. Davies, including a difficult-to-watch celebration of the 1930s show trials that condemned Trotsky as a Nazi collaborator.

For some examples, see Lacy K. Ford Jr., “Making the ‘White Man’s Country’ White: Race, Slavery, and State-Building in the Jacksonian South,” Journal of the Early Republic 19, no. 4 (1999): 713–37. 3.It’s important for the reader to know that my interpretation not only rests on the consensus view of historians of Haiti but also evidence that the period press spoke openly, and often in a celebratory manner, of the U.S. invasion.

Gates, “War-Related Deaths in the Philippines, 1898–1902,” Pacific Historical Review 53, no. 3 (1984): 367–78.

Moreland’s big break came with a series of films in the thirties and forties, often in roles that were demeaning (then and now). However, his humor often struck a chord with Black audiences, and even today it’s possible to read his burlesque style as a running commentary on the often clueless white characters around him. In King of the Zombies, he is the only character who fully understands the threat and attempts to warn his compatriots. Before his death, he became a regular on the Hallmark Hall of Fame series and appeared in the cult horror film Spider Baby (1968) with Lon Chaney Jr. Spike Lee paid tribute to him in Bamboozled (2000), which showed Black actors carving out spaces of dignity for themselves in Jim Crow Hollywood. 11.Mary A.

The claims here are based on Alfred W. McCoy’s The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (New York: Harper & Row, 1972). McCoy’s claims have never been seriously disputed. In 1981 conversations with Jonathan Mirsky, a former CIA agent who worked closely with General Pao, McCoy confirmed the Hmong’s entanglement with the opium trade. While I am not able to confirm it and so take a different view for now, former CIA agents have also suggested that Air America pilots did carry refined heroin, though without their knowledge. See William E. Colby and Jonathan Mirsky, “Heroin, Laos, and the CIA,” New York Review of Books, November 22, 1990. 43.An official CIA report, classified on its first release, noted that CIA policy forbade transport of “large quantities” of illegal drugs aboard Air America. But the report also admitted it may have happened in smaller quantities in an accidental fashion.

Appy notes that theft and corruption proved so rampant that nearly half of these commodities disappeared. South Vietnamese men and women, for starvation wages, provided the labor behind military bases, often with elaborate services for officers and enlisted men alike that included swimming pools, ice cream shops, maid service, nightly films, and brothels. Private American companies made hundreds of millions of dollars supporting the war, most infamously Brown & Root. This engineering and construction firm became so notorious that GIs regularly referred to them as “Burn and Loot.” Appy, American Reckoning, 108–111. 5.Interview with Tom Savini in Smoke and Mirrors (2015). 6.Savini, Grande Illusions, 12; and interview, Smoke and Mirrors. 7.Al Santoli, Everything We Had: An Oral History of the Vietnam War (New York: Random House, 1981), 63. 8.W.

It’s not even a little surprising that that trade paper of America’s ruling class blamed the plight of American cities on high taxes and bloated city government rather than the glaringly obvious reasons for unemployment and decay of the city services, the latter of which the limousine liberals and conservatives that populate the paper’s op-ed pages regard as government waste. 11.“Examining Chrysler’s 1979 Rescue,” All Things Considered, NPR, November 12, 2008, www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96922222. 12.Tommy Beer, “Top 1% of U.S. Households Hold 15 Times More Wealth Than Bottom 50% Combined,” Forbes, October 8, 2020. 13.Joe Williams, “Show Me the Movies,” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 17, 2005, C1. 14.The Clinton administration’s assumption that what Joshua B.

Emma Tomalin (New York: Routledge, 2015). One of the more troubling aspects of this discussion, first produced at the London School of Economics as a paper, concerns the suggestion that Pentecostalism might allow for the stealth justification of free market economics. The argument is convoluted but involves Pentecostalism in conjunction with “innovation” to bring on neoliberal change to the “worldview” of African peoples. Marx was right. 44.Under Kennedy and Johnson, the United States expressed support for ending apartheid and even linked it to changes in American society under the civil rights movement. However, Nixon reversed policy and the United States became increasingly weak willed on the subject under Ford and Carter. Increasing pressure from a multitude of sources mounted on the Reagan administration to reverse U.S. support, but the administration proved recalcitrant. Congress finally passed a comprehensive package of sanctions in 1986 . . . however, it survived only after a second supermajority vote overrode a presidential veto. 45.Nicky Falkof, “‘Satan has come to Rietfontein’: Race in South Africa’s Satanic Panic,” Journal of Southern African Studies 38, no.4 (2012): 753–67. 46.“Mapping Anti-Gay Laws in Africa,” Amnesty International UK, May 31, 2018, www.amnesty.org.uk/lgbti-lgbt-gay-human-rights-law-africa-uganda-kenya-nigeria-cameroon. 47.Peter Applebome, “Drugs, Death, and the Occult Meet in Grisly Inquiry at Mexico Border,” New York Times, April 13, 1989. 48.Victor, Satanic Panic, 21. 49.Richard Ofshe and Ethan Watters, Making Monsters: False Memories, Psychotherapy, and Sexual Hysteria (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 188. 50.“CIA-assisted ‘contras’ murdered Sandinistas, Official Reportedly Says,” Knight-Ridder, October 20, 1984; accessed January 23, 2019, www.newspapers.com/newspage/120079409/. 51.“Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair,” House of Representatives, November 13, 1987, archive.org/details/reportofcongress87unit/page/n11/mode/2up.

The term first appeared in the 1960s, used by Gunnar Myrdal to describe an economic class that has fallen out of the working class (a version of Karl Marx’s term lumpenproletariat). In the 1980s, conservative academics and cultural critics began to racialize the term and to use it to describe allegedly antisocial behaviors and criminality. 11.Rachel A.

The allusion becomes more inexplicable given that, in Independence Day, nukes save the United States and, in the logic of the film, the world. 21.It’s worth noting that, while Jurassic Park does have a well-earned reputation for unleashing CGI on the world, the film used a number of practical effects later cleaned up on the green screen. Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur fantasy did not presage entire environments, landscapes, and even characters being motion captured and becoming more or less essential to mainstream films. 22.Verhoeven has been quoted multiple times saying varieties of this.
