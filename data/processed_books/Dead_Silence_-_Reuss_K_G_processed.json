      "content": "Chapter One I pulled my hoodie over my head, and let my long black hair do the rest of the work of hiding my face as I walked through the chilly evening air. Hiking my messenger bag up onto my shoulder, I picked up my pace, eager to make it back to the warmth of my home. The coldness of Northern Michigan’s spring air caused my breath to visibly puff from my mouth as I hurried along the darkening street. A familiar loud truck rumbled past with its bass booming loudly. Ugh, I groaned inwardly as the angry, red brake lights came on before the truck went in reverse. This was the last thing I felt like dealing with, but I was always a trooper when it came to dealing with unwanted situations. I’d managed to make it through my alcoholic father’s harsh words and heavy hits—watching as he’d terrorized my mother, then running and screaming as he’d terrorized me when his bottle had run dry. I’d managed to make it through my parents’ nasty divorce. I’d even managed to make it through my childhood, which was littered with a creepy, red-eyed shadow person, strange creatures that were born from the dark corners of my dimly-lit bedroom, and the disembodied voices that called out to me. If I could make it through all that, I could certainly make it through a couple of teenage jockstraps yowling at me from the truck purchased by their overindulgent parents. “Ever,” Dylan Reynolds called from the passenger seat as his friends guffawed loudly from their various perches within the vehicle. Ducking my head lower, I pretended I couldn’t hear them. They creeped along beside me, laughing. “Oye, mamacita, qué buena estás? I know your sexy, half-Mexican ass can hear me,” Dylan shouted again as I scowled behind my curtain of dark hair. “Come on, Ever!” Though I kept my head down the entire time they rolled next to me, my senses were attuned to the truck and its occupants. My heart lurched when the tires stopped crunching on the edge of the pavement. Dylan jumped out and stepped in front of me. I sidestepped around him and kept walking, but being the annoying little shit that he was, he got back in front of me and started walking backward. “Ever, seriously. Are you still pissed over Brit’s party the other night?” “Dylan, I know it may be hard for you to understand, but vete a la chingada,” I snapped at him. “You’re right, Ever. I don’t understand what that means. But it sounds good coming from your mouth, whatever it is,” he grinned at me. His hazel eyes sparkled with amusement, and his sandy brown hair fell across his forehead. What did I ever see in him? I spent five months as his girlfriend—five months listening to him mess with people and suspecting he was cheating on me with Britney Stewart. I was over it now, though. “You haven’t been answering my calls or texts. What gives, babe?” “Gee, let me think,” I snapped, stopping suddenly and glaring at him. “I found you sucking face with Britney in the bathroom at her party! Why would I give you the time of day?” “Babe, that was nothing. I was drunk. I thought she was you!” “Ugh, get the hell out of my face, Dylan. You thought that blonde-haired, blue-eyed bimbo was me? Do you think I’m stupid and desperate?” I was losing my patience with him. I’d been avoiding him like the plague since the party last weekend. As far as I was concerned, he could go back to making out with her. “I’m sorry. I was wasted… Come on, Ever. You know, you’re my girl!” he sighed, stopping me by putting his hands on my shoulders. His fingers pushed my dark hair away from my face. “You’re just upset. Give me another chance, babe. I swear it won’t happen again. Just get in the truck with us. We’ll give you a ride home.” “Dylan,” I said sweetly, batting my long lashes at him. “Yeah, babe?” “I’d rather shit in my hands and clap than get in that truck with you jackasses.” “Christ, Ever.” Dylan’s face soured. “You know, maybe you could keep a guy around if you learned to talk like a lady. It’s a huge turnoff when you say shit like that.” “Good. My work here is done.” I stepped around him and continued down the sidewalk. “Whatever!” Dylan shouted at my back. “You know where to find me when you’re ready to come to your senses.” I flipped him off and kept walking, the wind at my back pushing me forward.",

      "title": "Chapter Two",
      "content": "Chapter Two “I’m home!” I called out, opening the door to my house and walking inside. “Ever, I wasn’t expecting you yet.” My mother poked her head around the corner of the kitchen and smiled at me, her dark eyes lighting up. “I thought you had kickboxing tonight. What happened?” “Canceled,” I sighed, coming into the kitchen and breathing in the delicious smell of my mother’s homemade tacos. I’d always had an active life. When I was younger, Mom had enrolled me in gymnastics. I think it was just a way for us to escape our home while my dad was around. Since he decided to walk out on us a few years ago—or rather, was forced out on us by a police order—it had just been the two of us. Not that I missed him. He’d done us a favor by leaving. At least now, we had a home we didn’t have to worry about being evicted from just because he spent the rent money on booze. I’d joined martial arts and kickboxing as a way to protect myself from others ever trying to hurt me or my mom. I’d even taken a self-defense course with her. I think she had the same ideas in her mind about protecting us as I did. In recent months, Dylan and I started training together. Most of our sessions started with sparring and ended with kissing. That was over now, though. “How was work today?” “Surprisingly quiet for the ER,” she responded. I didn’t know how she juggled the stress of nursing and being such a wonderful mother, but I was grateful. Gazing at Mom, I had a glimpse at what I’d look like in twenty some years, except for my green eyes and a missing couple of inches in height. My grandmother always said that what I lacked in height, I made up for in spunk. “I guess that works out.” My mom grinned at me. “I was going to rent a movie on T.V. later, pop some popcorn, and relax. Now, we can do it together.” “Sounds great.” I smiled back at her. I was close to my mother. We’d been through hell together, and that’s the kind of bond you can’t break even through teenage angst and young raging hormones. As we ate our tacos, my mom looked at me thoughtfully before she spoke, “How are you and Dylan doing?” “Don’t get me started,” I grumbled, sinking my teeth into my third taco. “That bad, huh?” She gave me a sympathetic look. “Worse,” I sighed after swallowing. “I caught him with Britney Stewart in her bathroom last weekend. I broke up with him.” “What a creep.” She shook her head, her anger at him evident on her face. My mother never liked Dylan, although she wasn’t mean to him. “I’m glad you kicked him to the curb. The kid is skating around on his dad’s dime. I imagine he’ll be off to some ivy league college and cheating on his trophy wife in no time at all.” “Probably,” I agreed, finishing my dinner. “It’s… whatever. I figured he was messing around with her anyway.” “Well, it still hurts to be betrayed like that.” She frowned, and I knew she was thinking about my dad. She’d caught him many times with other women. I think she spent most of their marriage either cowering from him or crying because of him. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, right?” I replied, plastering a weak smile on my face. That seemed to be our motto. “Right.” She returned my smile with her own, but it didn’t quite reach her dark eyes. It might not kill you, but it could sure change you. We were a testament to that.",

      "title": "Chapter Three",
      "content": "Chapter Three After we finished the movie, I trudged upstairs, and flopped down on my bed, my hair spilling around me as I buried my face in my pillow. That warm, fuzzy, numb feeling was just starting to kick in as my body drifted off to dreamland, when the sound of breaking glass yanked me back to consciousness. Sitting up with a jolt, I looked wildly around my dark bedroom, willing my eyes to adjust. When I still couldn’t see anything, I reached over and fumbled for the switch on my lamp and turned it on, flooding my room with a dim, yellow glow. “What the hell?” I grumbled, getting out of bed and picking up my favorite photograph of me, my mom, and my grandma off the floor. It had been taken last summer when we’d gone to the Grand Canyon. It had been an incredible trip, and the photo served as a reminder. The glass in the frame was shattered and bits were scattered across the floor like tiny diamonds. I looked around. How did it fall off my desk? My window was closed, and there wasn’t a breeze. I frowned, a cold familiarity biting my skin. Déjà vu. I’d done this before. It had been years since I’d seen Shadow or heard the voices. It all gnashed at me, trying to get me to see, to listen. My breath was visible as I exhaled—the tiny white clouds clinging to the frigid air. Despite the delicate late spring chill outside, there was no way I should be able to see my breath in my warm bedroom. My hand gripped the silver pendant hanging around my neck, running the infinity symbol along the chain as I tended to do when I was nervous or thinking about something. Something didn’t feel right. In fact, something felt wrong. Incredibly wrong. I backed away shaking my head with the photo still in my hands. A buzzing feeling rolled within my body, making my knees quake and my stomach churn. I backed away from the desk, my legs hitting the edge of my bed. The buzzing in my body grew until I felt a strange numbness spread through me, almost as if my body had fallen asleep. I let out a yelp and jumped as something brushed against my legs from under my bed, the coldness from its touch making my blood run hot and waking my body up. Rushing out of my room, I entered my mother’s and jumped into bed with her like I’d done as a child. I tugged the blankets up to my chin and burrowed deeply within its warm confines. “What’s wrong, mija?” Mom asked sitting up, sleepily rubbing her eyes. “I—my picture fell off my desk. It scared me,” I answered lamely, my heart still hammering a rhythm in my chest. I didn’t tell her about feeling like my leg had been grabbed. “Probably just a draft,” she yawned, lying back in bed. “We’ll just have a sleepover in here. Try to get some rest. You have school in the morning.” I nodded tightly and pulled the blanket tighter around me. As my eyes darted back and forth through the dimly lit room, memories from long ago resurfaced. Memories I’d spent the better part of my adolescence trying to forget. “Daddy! No!” I screamed, kicking my little legs out as he pulled me across the living room. His big hand was fisted tightly around my pink pajama top. My pigtails bounced as I struggled against him. “They want you!” his voice was loud, making my small body quake as he tugged me roughly to the dark closet by the basement door. “They can have you!” He pulled open the door to the closet, and I let out a scream as he threw me inside it. My small body tumbled forward, as hot tears poured down my face. “Daddy, please!” I reached out for him, but he shook his head at me, shoving me away. His dark eyes wild as they glanced around. “They want you, peanut. The voices—they’re driving me insane. If I give them what they want, they’ll go away.” He snapped the door close with a bang. I heard him slide the table lining the wall against it. I threw my small frame against the door, hammering on it with my tiny fists, and screamed for him to help me. When I was out of breath and tired, I backed away into the coats hanging behind me, sniffling. The coldness seeped into my skin as they arrived. I knew they were there. It was always cold when they came. I moved to bang on the door again, but was jerked back as gnarled hands—tens of them—reached through the coats and tugged me roughly into the dark depths, my screams echoing around me. I struggled to grab onto anything I could, but it was useless. “A tasty morsel he’s given us!” “Eat her soul!” “Kill her now before she becomes a problem!” I let out a blood-curdling scream, as pointed teeth pierced my skin and claws raked over me. Scratching me. Tangling themselves in my hair. “Mommy! Mommy!” I screamed her name over and over, knowing that my father was lost and that he wouldn’t be the one to save me. When she didn’t come, I stopped fighting. The coldness crept over me again, pulling me from the terrible memory. I peered around the room shivering, straining to see into the dark corners of the room. That’s where they liked to hide and emerge from—the darkest corners. My mother kept a night light on in her room because she got tired of stubbing her toe on the dresser by her bathroom door. I’d awoken more than once to the sound of her swearing in Spanish as she nursed a stubbed toe. I couldn’t decide if having the light casting a soft glow throughout the room was good or bad. The situation was sort of a which is better: the Devil I knew or the Devil I didn’t know. Did I want to see it coming or would I prefer to hide beneath my blanket in the dark hoping that it didn’t show itself? Or worse. Touch me. I lay in bed for a long time feeling like I was being watched, and it gave me the creeps. Despite the warmness of the room, I shivered. The shiver was born of fear, not the temperature. From the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow slip silently through my mother’s open bedroom door. My body stiffened as the temperature dipped even lower. My breath came out in tiny gasps and clung to the air like week-old bubblegum holds to the underside of a desk. There was more than just the shadow there. I could feel it. They were there, lurking nearby, the creatures that haunted me as a child. “Go away, go away, go away,” I whispered over and over, fidgeting with my necklace and squeezing my eyes closed, with the blanket still pulled firmly around me. I dared to peek out from beneath my lashes after a moment and saw that the room was empty. I opened my eyes wider and let out an ear-splitting scream as a leathery creature with razor-sharp teeth and claws longer than my hair, unfolded from the end of the bed and launched itself at me. It had no eyes, only torn skin where the eyes should be, and snake-like slits for a nose. A nasty, black liquid oozed from its open mouth. It happened in an instant. The shadow from the door planted itself in front of the creature and sliced through its body with a sword as dark and shadowy as the creature itself. The creature fell with thump and a nasty snarl before it hissed and popped, disappearing into black, floating ash. Shadow turned to face me. His red eyes stared at me as he continued to clutch the shadowy sword in his hand. Fear ripped a scream from my throat. “Ever! Ever!” My mother shouted frantically, shaking me. Shadow disappeared in a puff of black mist as my mother wrapped her arms around me. “Mija, what’s wrong?” “There-there was a monster. A creature. It attacked me. And there was a shadow. It was a man. I think,” I cried incoherently, clinging to her, burying my head in her neck. “There’s nothing here, sweetheart. Nothing.” She held onto me as I sobbed, her hand gentle as she pushed my damp hair away from my face. “It was a bad dream. That’s all. Just a dream.” She pressed me to her until I’d calmed down, repeating her words in my head. Bad dream. Just a dream. Not real! “Dios mío, it’s cold in here,” she murmured, giving me a hug as I pulled in a shaky breath and wiped at my eyes. It couldn’t have been a dream. I was awake. I knew I was. I couldn’t shake it. No matter how many times I said it wasn’t real in my head. It had to be. It was just too vivid to not be. “I’m sure all the stress you’ve been under is causing you to have nightmares—,” she started again. “No, I saw it. It lunged at me from the floor. Then there was a shadow man with a sword,” I choked out, wiping more tears from my eyes, her words not the blanket of comfort I needed. I knew what I’d seen. “I swear it wasn’t a dream.” “Mija, we’ve lived in this house for ages now. I’m sure it was nothing. You need to go back to sleep, child. You’re stressed out over Dylan, and it’s making you have nightmares. It’s happened to me before, too. Come on. Lie back down. Want me to get Mr. Boggles for you?” she teased, trying to make me feel better as she referred to the stuffed bunny from when I was a kid. I’d hug the crap out of that thing whenever I was scared. It was one of the only things that got me through my childhood. I’d blocked out all the weird things I’d seen crawling and slithering around in the night or when my dad locked me in dark closets. It had been years since I’d seen anything scary. Mom claimed I had an overactive imagination. She’d told me to pray, as was her way with most things, and they’d go away. Eventually they had, but I was sure it wasn’t because I’d prayed. It was because I made myself block it all out, just like I blocked out the pain whenever my dad would hit me. Creating a hard exterior, had kept me safe from both living and non-living things. Tonight reminded me that the things in the dark were clearly still around, however dormant they may have seemed. Eventually I managed to fall into a fitful sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my mom had already left for work. Not wanting to waste time being in this house of horrors, I showered quickly, dressed, and skipped breakfast. I ran the entire way to school hoping to catch breakfast there before it ended. *** “Hey, Ever,” Nina Hamilton, my best friend, greeted me as I sat down across from her. Her blue eyes sparkled as she looked at me. With her blonde hair pulled up into a tight ponytail, she was the epitome of the pretty, girl-next-door. She was popular with a soft, caring streak and didn’t really fit in with the group she hung out with. When she’d taken me under her wing in second grade after Greg Kildner cut off my Barbie’s hair, cemented our friendship. We mostly hung around the same people. However, I tended to be more withdrawn and sarcastic. I was probably only tolerated because I was Nina’s friend. I knew damn well I didn’t fit in with them, and they certainly didn’t go out of their way to invite me places. The fact that Dylan had even asked me out was a miracle. “Hey, Nina,” I yawned. “You look exhausted,” she frowned, her blue eyes sweeping over me quickly. “What’s wrong? Is it Dylan?” “No,” I grimaced. She knew that I’d really liked him, and I think she was under the impression I still did. She wasn’t wrong. Maybe I did. It was a complicated emotion that I wasn’t sure how to explore. “It’s OK if it is. He was a total douchebag,” she continued, not buying what I was selling. I found my eyes wandering over to him as he laughed with a group of his jock friends. He was always the center of attention. Unfortunately, a lot of the attention came from females. And he enjoyed it as much as any red-blooded, teenaged guy would. I hadn’t realized how he was with other girls. It had become blaringly clear over the past few weeks though. I didn’t regret ignoring his texts. I felt let down by him. My father hadn’t been much of a husband or parent, and I’d always pictured myself with someone who would make me happy, someone who would challenge me—in good ways. I thought I had that with Dylan, but I’d been wrong. It left me feeling empty, angry, and hurt on the inside. “I don’t care,” I muttered, suddenly not hungry for the toast and breakfast bar in front of me. “He can have Brit. He clearly wanted her, so I guess we both win.” “How do you both win?” Nina demanded. “He gets what he wants while you, what? Get hurt? Screw that. You deserve better than him, Ever. You’re so beautiful and smart and funny—” “Nina, it’s OK. Really,” I cut her off and gave her my most winning smile, knowing that it didn’t quite reach my eyes. She let out a sigh, still not buying it. Yeah, I was bummed, but I’d get over it. He wasn’t the person I thought he was. Lesson learned. Moving on. “You know, Andy Daniels and Clare Morgan just broke up. I heard Andy had a crush on you. Maybe I can set you two up,” Nina switched gears, her eyes lighting up at the prospect of playing matchmaker. “No thanks, Nina,” I said, getting to my feet. “I think I’m all set for the time being. I need to take some me time. You know, figure out who I really am on the inside.” “Ever,” she scoffed, rolling her eyes at my jest. “Shut up! You’re the last person who needs that. I’ve never met a girl more confident and sure of herself in my life!” “You flatter me,” I teased, pulling my bag over my shoulder. “Well, it’s true,” she continued, getting to her feet and walking with me to my locker. “Where did you get that sweater? It’s really pretty.” She eyed my emerald-green sweater enviously, and I laughed. “My grandmother gave it to me. She said it would bring out my eyes,” I answered, shrugging. “It brings out more than your eyes.” She waggled her eyebrows suggestively, and we both burst into fits of giggles. It felt good to laugh. “Hey, now,” I admonished her as our laughter died down. “Personally, I’d go down a size. You know that.” “And hopefully give it to me,” she grinned, glancing down at her own chest. “I wish mine were bigger.” “Of all the people to complain about her body, you’re the last one who should, Nina. You’re beautiful. You should know that by now.” “Of course, I am,” she flipped her ponytail over her shoulder, grinning. “I just want bigger boobs.” We laughed together as I stuffed my history book into my bag, my terrible night forgotten, and we made our way to class. The morning wore on as only a morning at school could. By lunch, I’d heard rumors about me and Dylan circulating, and while most of them were just plain stupid, a few of them touched on a nerve and hurt me. “Is it true that you wouldn’t put out and that’s why Dylan Reynolds broke up with you?” Casey Michaels asked, snapping her gum loudly as she stood over us at lunch, her dark eyes flashing wickedly at me. “Get out of here,” Nina snapped getting to her feet. “Crawl back to your hole, Casey.” “I’m only asking because Dylan is on the market again and some of us,” she sneered at me, plowing on as if Nina hadn’t insulted her, “actually enjoy doing the things that Ever doesn’t like to do.” “We all know you’re one of those people,” Nina snorted, rolling her eyes. “I’ll make sure Dylan gets the memo.” “Thank you.” Casey grinned like she thought Nina was serious before marching away, her chestnut-colored hair swinging behind her. “Can you believe her?” Nina shook her head in amazement, a muscle thrumming along her jaw. “Seriously. What an idiot!” “Actually, I can. She’s had her eye on Dylan for a long time.” I rested my head on my hand and stabbed at my salad listlessly. “I’m surprised he hasn’t already been with her.” “He’s the one who lost out, Ever,” Nina stated, her eyes focused on me. “We both know that.” “Yeah, yeah,” I muttered, waving her off. I didn’t feel like having this conversation. Again. Regardless if it was his loss, it still hurt. I was grateful that this was the last month of school before summer break hit. At least once classes were out, I wouldn’t have to see Dylan all the time. Nina sighed without another word, and we were soon joined by Beth and Gemma, two of the popular girls that Nina chummed around with. Grateful that Nina was distracted, I let my mind wander, trying to figure out what I’d actually seen in our house last night. I had the niggling feeling that the shadow was the same one from my childhood, just bigger. He was always about the same size as me. He seemed to have grown up over the years. Like me. I tried figuring it all then and failed. It didn’t seem like much had changed in that respect. “Ever?” Dylan’s voice pulled me out of my thoughts, and I frowned up at him as he stood at our table. “Hey.” He flashed me his perfect smile, his dusty brown hair falling across his forehead in a way I used to love. Now it only made my stomach churn. “Can we talk?” “Talk?” I asked dumbly. “Uh, yeah. Just us.” “No,” I shook my head, the word tumbling from my mouth without me having to think about it. Beth looked at me like I was crazy to be blowing him off. Maybe I was. I mean, I thought I’d seen a shadow man with red eyes in my house last night. I imagined that he’d grown up with me. That would probably warrant a trip to the hospital for a psych evaluation. “Ever, please. Just for a minute,” Dylan sighed, looking frustrated, his hands stuffed deep into his pockets. “Fine,” I huffed, getting up and tossing my salad in the trash. I wasn’t hungry anyway. I followed him out of the cafeteria and wasn’t surprised when he pulled me into an empty classroom and closed the door. “Ever, I really do want to apologize for what happened at Brit’s party. I know I made a huge mistake. I’ve been a jerk lately over it, and I’m sorry. I don’t want to lose you. Being without you this week has made me realize how important you are to me.” “Are you feeling well?” I asked, shaking my head at him, my eyes narrowed. “Did you suffer a head injury lately?” “Ever, come on. You know I care about you—” “All I know, Dylan, is that I can’t trust you. That pretty much officially ends anything we had.” “So that’s it? You’re really doing this?” he asked, a deep frown carving his features. “I didn’t do it. You did when you decided I wasn’t enough. I’m just finishing what you started.” “Ever.” He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. As fast as lightening, his hands fell away from his head and landed on me, pulling me flush to his body. His mouth found mine and he kissed me deeply, his tongue pushing against my own. For a fraction of a second, I parted my lips for him until I realized what I was doing. He’d always had that effect on me. He knew it, too. “No,” I said, shaking my head at him and pulling away. “No, Dylan. You don’t get to decide this. Not like this.” “Ever, I love you, OK?” he said desperately. “Is that what you want to hear? I do.” He reached for me again and grasped my hands. “Please. Give me another chance.” “Dylan—” “Ever. Please.” His eyes flashed with sincerity. “I’m sorry, Dylan. It’s not happening. Not right now anyway. I’m still really mad at you. I need time to figure out how I really feel.” “How long do you need?” “I don’t know,” I answered honestly. “It’s not really something I can put a time limit on. I’d rather us just be friends, OK?” “You’re serious.” His face fell, his Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat. “Yes,” I nodded. “I’m serious. I can’t trust you. Why can’t you understand that?” “I get it.” His eyes narrowed at me, his mouth turned down into a frown. “You’ve always thought you’re better than everyone.” “What? How can you even say that?” I demanded, my temper flaring. “I-I don’t know,” he groaned, rubbing his eyes. “Tell me, Ever. What do I have to do to make this right?” “Well,” I breathed out, still irritated at his words. “Think about it like this, if I’d done this to you, what would you do if you were me?” He grew quiet, a shadow of sadness covering his face. “You’re right.” He took a step away from me. “You’re right. I screwed up. I wouldn’t trust you either. There’s probably nothing you could do to change that.” “See?” “I-I don’t even know what to say right now. I’m sorry. I really screwed this up. I-I can’t believe we’re over.” I shrugged helplessly. “I really do love you,” he murmured, his voice shaking. “Do you love me?” “Dylan—” “Ever, please. Did you ever love me?” “I have to go,” I backed away from him, my chest aching from heartbreak. Maybe I had loved him. Funny, I realized it as I was walking away leaving him to stand there looking as devastated as I felt.",

      "title": "Chapter Four",
      "content": "Chapter Four The rest of the week was torture. The rumor mill churned out more stories, most of them even worse than before. There was one going around that I’d begged Dylan to take me back and was going to give it up to him, but he turned me down because he wasn’t into “pity lays”. That one probably came from one of his friends. On the bright side, I hadn’t seen anything weird in my house the past few days, so I was able to sleep in my room again without incident. I counted that as a small victory. My avoidance of Dylan was even greater than before. He’d angered me to the point where I was tempted to scream at him in front of the student population. Because despite saying he loved me and wanted me back, he didn’t bother to quell the nasty rumors. I wanted to confront him and roundhouse kick him in his face—a move I was rather good at—but that seemed like a bad idea, so I did my best to keep my head down. Instead, I took to beating my punching bag in the basement, imagining it was him. Saturday night, I was sitting at home with my nose stuck in a book after a punishing workout session, where I beat the crap out of my punching bag and then proceeded to kick a lawn chair violently, when my phone rang with a call from Nina. “Party central,” I answered on the second ring. “Yeah, right,” she laughed. “You must have been reading my mind, though. I’m headed over to Jax’s party. Come with me.” “Thanks, but I’ll pass,” I said immediately. Jax was Dylan’s best friend and therefore guilty by association. “Ever, you need to face these people so you can show them that none of the crap going on matters,” Nina stated evenly. “We don’t have to stay long. Just long enough to prove that you don’t care, and then we’ll leave.” “But I don’t care,” I pointed out. “Really, I don’t. School will be out for the summer in less than a month. No one will remember any of this next year.” “Ever, you do too care. You can lie to everyone else, but I know you. All this crap is bothering you. You know how people are. You need to take a stand. Something they’ll remember you for come next year. Come with me tonight. One hour and we’ll go. You can prove to Dylan you don’t care, too. Hell, maybe you’ll even meet a hot guy to move on with.” “That’s the last thing I feel like doing,” I grumbled, closing my book, knowing I was losing the battle with her. “Ever, please? I want to go to bed tonight knowing I tried to save my best friend from public humiliation.” “Fine,” I sighed. “One hour. That’s it. I’ll leave without you. You know I will.” “One hour. Two tops.” “Nina—” I warned. “I’m just saying, if you end up having fun then there’s no reason to leave, right?” “You’re such a shit,” I grumbled, rubbing my eyes. “But you love me anyway.” “I do,” I admitted. She had a way of always trying to fix things, even when I just wanted to be left alone. “Wear something cute. That jean skirt you just bought last weekend and that black off-the-shoulder number that shows off your fabulous assets.” “Whatever,” I yawned. “Hurry up so we can get there and then leave.” “I’ll be there in fifteen.” We hung up, and I groaned as I got to my feet. Damn her. I went to my closet and rifled around in it, coming out with the outfit she’d indicated. After I put it on, I ran a brush through my hair leaving the long, black locks to flow around me. I was putting on some makeup, because I knew Nina wouldn’t let me out of the house without it, when movement from the corner of my room caught my eye. I slowly lowered my pink gloss back to my vanity and closed my eyes. Counting to ten, I drew in deep, calming breaths. Please, God. Don’t let there be anything there. Let it just be my imagination. I’ll open my eyes and there will be nothing there. Please. I opened my eyes on my final breath and let out a strangled cry as I peered into my mirror. Standing behind me next to my bed, was Shadow. His red eyes glowed just as bright as the last time I’d seen him. The only things on him that moved were his eyes as he stared at me. Those pools of lava moved slowly up my body and fell on my face, freezing me with his gaze. I stood there, staring at him through my mirror, not brave enough to turn around. My lips parted, and I let out a shaky breath after what felt like an eternity. “W-who are you?” I managed to say, my voice choked and small. He cocked his head, regarding me silently. “W-what do you want?” Instead of answering, he faded away, leaving behind wisps of black shadow tendrils. I let out another breath, my body trembling. Dropping my lip gloss, I rushed from the room and went downstairs to meet Nina. My guard was firmly in place as I nervously looked around making sure nothing else was lurking about. When her car pulled into my driveway, I rushed from the house and greeted her outside. I threw myself into the passenger seat before she could even get out of her car. “I knew that would look incredible on you!” she squealed as I closed the door. “Thanks,” I said, looking over my shoulder at the house as I put my seatbelt on. There was nothing there. I let out a breath of relief and relaxed against the seat as Nina started gabbing on and on about Jax’s party—who was going, who wasn’t, and all the alcohol she’d heard was going to be there. I tuned her out as I watched the dark scenery whiz past, my mind on what had just happened in my bedroom. He didn’t hurt me. I wracked my brain, recalling all the times I’d encountered him. He’d never actually hurt me, even when we were kids. He’d always just watched me. OKKKK. So, he was back. He’d gotten rid of that monster in Mom’s room. Maybe his presence wasn’t such a bad thing. I stiffened as we passed the cemetery, the last thought freezing in my mind. A feeling of foreboding washed over me. The full moon shining off the tombstones caused goosebumps to snake their way through my body. I gulped as two dark figures emerged from the shadows and began walking down one of the cemetery paths. They looked a lot like the shadow from my room, right down to their red eyes. I averted my eyes and looked at Nina to see if she noticed anything. She was still animated, talking a mile a minute about Jax’s party and had clearly not seen what I’d just seen. Breathe, Ever. Breathe. I said it over and over in my mind, breathing in and out slowly until I relaxed. Deciding it was best to remain quiet about the shadow people, I pushed the whole thing out of my head and smiled and nodded when appropriate. When we arrived at Jax’s house, I was ready to leap out of the car and drown my fears in copious amounts of alcohol despite my bad feeling. “Nina! Girl, I’m so glad you’re here,” Beth squealed, hugging Nina the moment her foot entered the house. “Oh, and look, you brought Ever,” Gemma simpered, eyeing my outfit, an envious glint in her eyes and a sneer on her lips. “Yeah,” I muttered, pushing past them. “I’ll be by the keg if you need me.” I located the keg and poured myself half a glass. I knew I wouldn’t drink any more than that, even though I really wanted to. Living with my dad all those years really put the fear in me about drinking. I didn’t want to end up like him. Plus, sipping a half a glass all night made me appear like I was living it up with my peers, most of whom hated me. I shook my head and tipped the glass back. Ugh. I hated the way beer tasted. It was like vomit in reverse. “Hey, Ever,” Jax greeted me. He looked good with his blond hair perfectly gelled into his signature faux hawk and his blue eyes sparkling. Jax was always in a good mood. If I was a dark cloud, then Jax was the sunshine. I had to hand it to the guy, he always tried to make me feel welcomed. “Hey,” I replied, giving him a tight smile, as my eyes darted around to make sure Dylan wasn’t nearby. “Having fun?” “I’d probably be having more fun at home reading a book, but Nina insisted I come and grace your party with my presence.” “Well, even though you’re having a shit time, I’m glad you came.” He grinned as he leaned in and gave me a hug. “Dylan is outside on the patio in case you want to avoid him.” “Thanks for the tip,” I muttered as Jax pulled away a bit. “For real, Ever,” He leaned down to speak in my ear, “You’re better off without Dylan. We’re friends and all, but he’s an ass sometimes. If I’d have known what he was doing, I’d have told you. You didn’t deserve that shit. He’s taking it kind of hard, though. He’s been talking about it all night.” “Great,” I grumbled. I was not in the mood for this. “Sorry. Figured you should know.” He gave me a helpless shrug as he moved away from me. “Thank you.” I smiled sincerely at him. He nodded and then grinned as Brandon, another one of their group, came up and started talking to him. Alone once again, I looked around at everyone enjoying themselves. I wasn’t much for parties. Or people in general really. I liked keeping to myself. Leaning against the counter, I lost track of time, which sounded weird considering I wanted to leave within the hour. I was jolted out of my random thoughts by the sound of people laughing loudly. I looked in the direction of the commotion and saw Dylan stumble into view, a wild look on his drunken face, his eyes dazed. “You can’t drive, man,” Jax said, putting his hands on Dylan’s chest as Dylan lurched to the side. “I gotta go, dude,” Dylan slurred, tripping and falling into the wall. “I gotta call my girl.” “You don’t have a girl,” Jax said evenly, stepping in front of him again to stop him. “Yeah-yes, I do,” Dylan shot back indignantly, pushing him aside. “You say that all because you want her to yourself.” “Whatever, man. You’re not driving.” Jax was firm as he snatched the keys out of Dylan’s hands. “You’re going to take my girl, man. I know it!” “Go sleep it off, Dylan,” Jax said, pushing Dylan forward. “Ever!” Dylan’s eyes fell on me and his face broke into a wide, lopsided smile. “There she is. That’s my girl. Baby, come here.” He stumbled his way over and wrapped his arms around me, crushing my small body to his. “Mm, baby, you smell so good.” He took a deep breath. “I’m so glad you came to see me. I was gonna go see you, but Jax is bein’ an ass-an asshole.” “You’re drunk,” I grumbled pushing him off me. “Drunk for you,” he laughed loudly, his arm snaking around my waist. “I miss you, Ever. My hot mamacita.” His voice became louder as he started to shout, “All you bitches listen up. This is my girl. Ever is the hottest, sexiest chick in the whole school, and I majorly screwed up.” “Dylan, stop it,” I hissed, grabbing his raised arm and pulling it down to his side, knowing damn well my face was flushed with embarrassment. “No, babe. They need to hear this. So do you.” This was going to be the most embarrassing moment of my life. I could feel it coming on in 3. . . 2. . . 1. . . “I love Ever,” Dylan bellowed while people around us snickered loudly. “She’s my girl. I’m not going to be screwing you other chicks anymore because she’s it. She’s my forever.” “I swear I’m going to stab you,” I growled at him. “Come here, babe. Kiss your man,” he slurred out, reaching for me. “If I kiss you, will you shut the hell up?” I growled angrily at him, my eyes darting around the room hoping that people had lost interest in his drunken shenanigans. “Cross my heart,” he answered with a lopsided grin. He didn’t wait for my answer. He pressed his wet mouth to mine, jamming his tongue inside. I nearly threw up at the way he tasted—like stale alcohol and vomit. I hurriedly pushed him away and wiped at my mouth in disgust. “Come on! I know you can do better than that,” he shouted. “You’re my little jalapeno. Give daddy some spice.” I grabbed him by the arm roughly and tugged him away from the snickering crowd he’d accumulated. “Keys?” Jax handed me Dylan’s keys. “Thank you,” I said, snatching them from his hand. “Get him home safely, OK? Do you want me to go with you?” “No, I got it,” I muttered, pulling Dylan and his grabby hands away. “We’re going to go make out, aren’t we?” Dylan asked gleefully, squeezing my backside. “We’re going to get back together, right?” “I’m going to tear your arm off and beat you with the bloody stump if you grab my ass again,” I snapped at him. “Ooh, foreplay,” he grinned stupidly, reaching out for my butt again. I turned and slapped his hand away, and he jerked it back in alarm. “Damn, babe. We can do rough if you want. Remember all those times we sparred together? We could work on your form again.” “Get in the freaking car, Dylan,” I snapped, opening the passenger door of his car and gestured for him to get in. He stumbled forward and after some major effort and patience on my part, he was inside the car and buckled in. I climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine, then quickly backed out of the driveway. “You’re so sexy, Ever. Damn,” he murmured, eyeing me hungrily. His hand came forward to caress my thigh. “Knock it off, Dylan,” I snapped again, pushing his hand away as I tried to stay focused on the road. “Why? We’re back together!” “No, we aren’t,” I snarled. “I’m giving you a ride home so you don’t end up dead. That doesn’t mean I want to suck face with you.” “Why are you being like that, Ever?” he demanded angrily, his good mood gone. “We dated for months and you never put out. What the hell? I think I deserve something from you since I had to deal with you and your smart ass for so long.” “Had-had to deal with me?” I sputtered in disbelief, looking from the road to him then back again. “You’re kidding, right? You were screwing everything that had a pulse while we were together. Beso mi culo, Dylan.” “Stop speaking that stupid language. You know I can’t understand what you’re saying,” Dylan growled angrily. “It means ‘kiss my ass’.” “Believe me, I’ve been trying to do a lot to that ass for months now,” Dylan spat at me, his words still slurring. “You’re a prude, Ever. You’ll die a virgin at the rate you’re going.” “You’re disgusting,” I bit out, pulling the car over to the side of the road. I put it in park and got out, slamming the door hard behind me. “Where are you going?” Dylan demanded, climbing clumsily out behind me. I looked around and gave a shiver. We were in front of that damn cemetery where I’d seen those shadow people. I wrapped my arms around myself, angry that I hadn’t been paying more attention to where we were. “You can sit there all night,” I yelled, my voice shaking as I turned and began walking away from him, deciding that beating the pavement in my wedges in the dark with creepy shadow people lurking around was ten times better than listening to his drunken crap. “You can’t be serious.” Dylan grabbed my arm and pulled me to a stop. “Give me my keys. I’ll drive myself.” “Like hell! You’ll kill yourself or someone else.” “I’ve done it a bunch of times before,” he countered, stumbling forward and grabbing at the keys in my hand. He got a hold of my hand, and we had a tugging match. I held on as tightly as I could. Dylan managed to tear the keys away, and I stumbled backward unable to stop myself. The screech of tires filled my ears. Then there was a blinding pain and white light. Dylan yell out in horrified shock as I fell forward, my face hitting the pavement with a terrible crack.",

      "title": "Chapter Five",
      "content": "Chapter Five Wet. Hot. Sticky. Blood. So much blood. I was bathing in the hot, sticky mess. My entire body was saturated with it. The acrid smell clung to the air like a dense fog. My body lay on a bed of broken glass, the tiny shards biting into my skin painfully. There were voices around me—dull, panicking echoes that sounded far away. I tried my hardest to pull air into my lungs. Despite my best efforts, my breathing was shallow. My lungs deflated as I tried to gasp in tiny, rapid breaths. Panic began to set in—my chest aching as my heart hammered, the erratic thud of it reverberating in my ears. I’m dying. This can’t be how I go. My mom! Nina! “Ever! Jesus,” Dylan shouted. His face was ashen and his lips trembled as he fell to his knees beside me. “Call an ambulance! What have I done? Oh my God, Ever. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to—” “Don’t touch her,” a shaky unfamiliar voice managed to cut through the panic. “9-1-1 says not to move her.” “Ever,” Dylan reached out and clutched my hand. A river of fresh hot tears snaked down his pale cheeks. “I’m sorry, baby. I’m so sorry. Oh God. T-there’s so much blood. What do I do? Tell me what to do!” I tried to open my mouth to speak, but there was nothing. My body violently spasmed, causing Dylan to sob loudly as he held onto my hand. I was in so much pain. The world around me started going dark, as my breathing became more difficult. Each breath felt like razorblades bearing down into my lungs. I was acutely aware of a shadow moving along the edge of the scene. His red eyes narrowed on me. I whimpered timorously as he approached with sure and steady movements. “Help! Someone help!” Dylan shouted desperately in a strained voice. His hand gripped mine even tighter, as if holding me harder would keep me there. “Ever, no! Don’t die, OK? Help is coming! Help! Someone!” Little sparkles of black and white began to dot my vision, and my heart slowed down to a stumbling thud in my ears. I tried once more to breathe. Nothing. The shadow approached me and finally stopped, looming over me with his head cocked. It was the shadow I’d seen only hours ago in my bedroom. I don’t know how I knew it was him. I just did. His face was shrouded in darkness, his features indiscernible, as he gazed down at me. I wasn’t afraid of him in that moment. Call it acceptance of the inevitable, stupidity, whatever, but I felt calm, safe even, as he went down to a knee and hesitantly reached out to me. His red eyes—eyes like fire— were intense, like he was warring within himself about touching me, taking my hand in his. Something within me told me it was in my best interest to take what he offered, even if I didn’t know what it was, even if it was death. I needed to trust this creature who knelt before me. I reached weakly out to him, and his hand wrapped around mine, as he kept his ruby-colored eyes focused on me. Where I had expected coldness, there was only warmth. I shuddered violently, closing my eyes. Flashes of color, flashes of people I didn’t recognize, invaded what was left of my quickly failing mind. Voices shouted out to me. Voices of the dead. Screaming at me to hear them. I swallowed thickly. The blood that had pooled in my mouth made me sputter and gurgle. The taste was hot and metallic, biting at my tongue, reminding me that this was real—and that I was going to die. “Ever! Ever! No! NO!” Dylan shouted frantically. His voice sounded far away. “I’m sorry, Ever! Oh my God! Help! HELP!” His voice dissolved around us, and all I was left with was the image of Shadow leaning over me. He consumed everything around me, darkening the world until only the two of us existed. “Breathe,” his deep distorted voice commanded, shaking my heart. “I’ll do the rest.” I tried to suck in a shaky breath. It was too hard. Too painful. I felt hollow—empty—inside. I couldn’t. . . “Everly!” he shouted, his voice frantic as he started to shimmer like he was fading away. “Don’t stop! Focus on me. Stay with me. No matter what, don’t stop.” “My heart,” I sputtered out, not sure if I was even talking. It felt like it was all in my head. Everything was so surreal, like I was caught in the eye of a hurricane, with the world blowing past me while I stood in the eerie calm awaiting the aftermath, awaiting the inevitability that life brought with it—death. I couldn’t feel my heart like before. The familiar thump no longer hammered a rhythm in my chest. It stuttered every few seconds, like tiny jolts of fading thunder within my ribcage. “It’s not beating like it should.” He came into focus once more, like he knew my thoughts. As I gazed up at him, I concentrated all I had on him, begging him with my fixed gaze to do something to save me, even if saving me meant taking the pain away so my soul could be freed. “Am I dead?” “Not yet,” he murmured in that oddly distorted voice. “Your heart barely beats, but you still live. Do you want to die?” his voice cracked as he asked the question. Those red eyes of his softened, making him appear younger—or as young as a shadow man could appear when one couldn’t see his face. “I-no,” I was starting to shiver violently. My voice shook with each tremor that painfully tore through my body, “I-I want to live.” “You will not be the same. You’re special. Who you were will die tonight on this pavement, and a new you will be reborn from the ashes and misery. Death stalks you tonight.” His eyes swept my face quickly before he let out a shuddering breath. His eyes closed momentarily. He squared his shoulders as he seemed to come to a decision. “Do you accept what this could mean for you? Do you understand that nothing will ever be the same? Because Ever, you’re going to die here tonight, whether you continue to breathe or not.” “I’m afraid.” Hot, wet tears rolled from my eyes as a strange tugging slowly started to build within my core. Like a fire aching in my soul, it was mercilessly grasped by the hands of Death. The delicate tendrils that held me in my body slowly gave way to the destiny of the living. I clung to his hand, silently begging him to save me. “Fight it,” Shadow commanded, his red eyes filled with realization as the burning intensified within me. “It will be my battle, not yours. I will take it all away. Trust me, Everly. I won’t hurt you. I would never hurt you.” “Who are you?” I gasped, as the tugging grew stronger and the desire to just let go enveloped me. I was meant to leave this body. I could sense it. The pressure was intense, like I was being pulled and flattened in all directions. “Tonight, I’m your lucky penny.” Shadow breathed out slowly. Reaching forward with the hand that wasn’t clutching mine, he placed it over my chest. The warmth that I’d become accustomed to from his touch began to spread through me. The coldness of impending death started to trickle away, the fire in my soul quenched with whatever he was doing to me. “Are you an angel?” I choked out, still not sure if this was real or just in my head. I’d read that when people died, their synapses fired off randomly making them think they were seeing things they weren’t. Maybe that was what was happening. Maybe death was just a conversation with the unknown—one only I could hold in that moment, until my heart made its final bow out of those painful last moments. “Definitely not an angel,” I could hear the sadness in his voice before he spoke again. “I’m your only hope—your last hope. This will change everything and for that I am sorry. If you want this, if you want life and what this moment means, then breathe for me, Ever. Don’t stop once you start. I’ll be weakened until you awaken and won’t be able to help you.” I wanted to live. Consequences be damned. And in that moment, I’d have done whatever he asked me to do. I pulled in the painful breath he instructed me to—the ache a searing, tearing pain within me as the oxygen burned through my body. The air ignited a completely different fire within me—a tiny spark of life. I pulled in another breath and another, my eyes locked on his. A shock shuddered throughout my body, and my heart stuttered in my chest once again. Shadow remained focused on me. The mesmerizing depths of his red eyes were endless. While they were terrifying, there was also peace and safety within the pools of hot lava. I wanted to fall into those bright eyes and stay hidden there forever. They were beautifully frightening with a mirror of my pain shining in them. He felt everything I felt. I could sense that from him, and that made me hurt even more because something deep within me was changing. It was morphing into something I’d never be able to come back from—and neither would he. He was right. This was going to change everything. The change was blanketing me, flowing through me, connecting me to him with an unbreakable link that we’d never be able to escape from. “Breathe,” he murmured fiercely. His now trembling hand was still on my chest spreading warmth. Another shock. Another thud in my chest. Voices murmured in the distance. The blackness was receding. “Keep breathing, Everly. Breathe for me.” “Who are you?” I called out again, frantically wanting a name before he disappeared. “I-I am everything we both fear,” his voice was laced with pain as he said the words. I watched in horror as his brilliant red eyes closed, and he let out a shuddering breath, his black form crumpling to the ground beside me.",

      "content": "Chapter Six Beep. Beep. Beep. The incessant noise grew louder. Maybe I was late for school. I wanted to reach for my alarm and shut it off, but I couldn’t seem to get my arms to move. A white-hot pain seared through my body as I attempted to shift in bed. Something thick and heavy dug into my throat making me wince. As I realized I couldn’t breathe on my own, panic set in. Something was wedged deep within my throat. I struggled to open my eyes. My body aches became more pronounced. “Ever, sweetheart,” An unfamiliar female voice called out to me. “Hon, stay calm, OK? There’s a tube in your throat helping you breathe. The doctor is coming to take it out. I’m going to give you a shot. It’s going to make you feel sleepy. Stay calm. Your mom is on her way.” Moments later, I fought to keep my eyes open with the nurse’s words on repeat in my mind. A tube was breathing for me? What the hell had happened? As hard as I tried, I couldn’t overcome the drugs flowing through my veins. Everything faded away into the distance again, my memory wiped clean of whatever had happened to me. I wasn’t sure of the time, but when I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I stared around blearily, my body hurting and my mind in overdrive as I tried to replay the events leading up to that moment. “Everly?” my mom called out, her voice choked up as she clutched my hand. “Mom?” I croaked, my voice hoarse and my throat tender as I strained to get the words out. “Oh, mija!” she cried, leaning over and kissing my face. “Thank God! I thought I’d lost you. My sweet, sweet girl.” Her tears were damp on my cheek as she pulled away and gazed down at me fondly. Her large doe eyes wavered with a fresh swell of sadness. “What happened? Why do I hurt? Where am I?” “You don’t remember?” her voice was quiet. I peered out at her from beneath my thick lashes, my head aching, my brows crinkled in confusion and fear. “Mom, I’m scared. What’s going on?” “Sweetie, you were in an accident. You were hurt. You-you were unconscious and your heart—it wasn’t beating the way it should.” her voice was barely above a whisper, as fresh tears flowed down her cheeks. “I thought I was going to lose you. Forever. I’ve never been so scared in my life.” Her words engulfed me like a summer heat—heavy and stifling, the kind of heat that creates nausea. As I fidgeted slightly, a pain snaked its way into my side. A memory nagged at the back of my mind, but I couldn’t get it to come into focus. “I almost died?” I whispered huskily. My heart beat frantically in my chest at the news. “Yes, baby.” Mom sniffled. “Don’t try to move, OK? You have broken ribs and a fractured ankle.” “Broken ribs and fractured ankles don’t nearly kill people,” my voice low as I winced painfully. “No, but the trauma from getting hit by a car can cause the body a great deal of pain—and in some cases, even stop the heart from beating,” a deep voice cut into our conversation. A middle-aged man stepped into the room. His salt and pepper hair was combed back from his forehead and a gentle smile graced his face. “Everly, I’m Dr. Sanders.” I looked up at him and gave him my best smile, which felt more like a painful grimace as my ribs spasmed. “How are you feeling?” he asked, coming to stand beside my bed. His brows knitted as he looked down at me, cataloguing my reactions. “Like I was hit by a truck,” I muttered, wincing as my muscles gave another painful spasm. “That’s pretty accurate. It was actually an SUV.” Dr. Sanders gave me a kind smile and his eyes twinkled with humor despite the somberness of the conversation. “By all accounts, you shouldn’t be here with us right now. You were nearly dead when responders got there. Without their prompt response and a miracle, you’d be gone.” I swallowed thickly at his words. A dark memory prodded me in the back of my mind. There was more to this miracle of life. I frowned as I tried to remember, but my head throbbed, making me wince. I almost died. I should be dead. I couldn’t stop the words from repeating in my mind. “H-how is Dylan?” I whispered, remembering he’d been there with me. “Dylan is fine,” Mom assured me, her voice filled with disdain. “He wasn’t injured.” I tried to wipe at my tears, but failed. My arm had an IV in it and was wrapped heavily. My mom dabbed at my cheeks for me, her touch tender and loving. I looked down at my other arm and noticed a brace on it. I took a quick survey of my body and noted my leg was wrapped too. I had faint, fading bruises on my arms. My heart flip flopped in my chest. “What day is it?” “Ever, honey—” my mom started. “Elena.” Dr. Sanders said gently to her. “I-I… OK,” she sighed, resigned, and nodded to Dr. Sanders. “Tell her all of it.” “Everly,” Dr. Sanders turned back to face me and pulled a chair up next to my bed. The scraping noise as the legs slid over the floor made me cringe. “You suffered a traumatic brain injury. In fact, we didn’t even have any brain activity on you at first. You sitting here talking to us, well frankly, is a miracle. Truly. You’ve been in a coma for nearly two weeks.” “I didn’t think you were coming back, sweetheart,” my mom choked out, cutting in. “I-I almost let you go.” She broke into tears, her small frame shaking uncontrollably. Dr. Sanders reached out and rubbed her shoulder. “I’m so sorry, baby. I didn’t want you to suffer.” “Mom,” I murmured, as their words settled like a heavy weight on my chest. “It’s OK. I understand.” My eyelids were heavy, and I was hurting. Dr. Sanders took note of it and pulled a syringe out of his pocket and inserted it into my IV. “I’ll have pain meds ordered for you. You’ll be able to simply push a button if you need them,” he said gently, pulling the syringe out of the line. “I’ll have some more tests ordered. I want to check your bloodwork again and do some scans. If everything looks good, we can start looking at getting you out of here. How does that sound?” “Good,” I think I said as my eyes fell closed. Maybe I’d only thought it, though since I didn’t remember hearing an answer.",

      "content": "Chapter Seven The weeks passed in a blur. Dr. Sanders insisted on keeping me in the hospital a little longer than expected due to the severity of my injuries. My mom came up from the emergency room and saw me whenever she had a spare moment. I’d refused to move too much that week. The pain wasn’t horrendous, but it wasn’t great. Each breath made me ache. Each hobble on my feet made me whimper. Each cough made my head feel like it was going to explode. Through it all, I was grateful. It could’ve been worse. I could be dead. I’d made it to the bathroom and that was about the extent of my movements. I guess it was too much to ask to simply go from being unconscious for almost two weeks to being healed. My whole body seemed to have reserved all the pain so I wouldn’t miss out on it. In addition to my fractured ankle, broken leg, broken arm, broken ribs, and brain injury—which didn’t really feel like an injury aside from the headaches—my lungs had collapsed, my liver had been lacerated, and my skull had been fractured. And, of course, there were countless other small things like cuts and bruises. My face was still puffy and the ugly purple bruises had faded into a yellow color. I’d had staples on my forehead by my hairline because apparently, the skin had torn when I smashed my head on the pavement. I made sure to have my mother keep mirrors away from me. They made me uncomfortable. And it wasn’t just because I could see myself in them. It was something else, something I didn’t want to say out loud. My mom had brought me makeup in case I wanted to fix myself up. At first, the idea sounded good because I wanted to feel normal again. But the moment I opened the compact mirror, I could’ve sworn I was looking in a dark tunnel through the mirror. A man waited at the end of it, shrouded in shadows. I’d gulped, slamming the compact shut, and hadn’t opened it since. I’d much rather look like I’d run headlong into a brick wall than be creeped out. I’d been contemplating that maybe the brain injury I’d suffered had made me wonky in the head, when there was a soft knock on my door. When I looked over, Nina stood timidly in the doorway, with her large, blue eyes peering at me nervously. “Nina?” I asked sitting up, surprised to see her. My mom said she’d stopped by to see me in the beginning before, when they thought I wasn’t going to make it. Nina had broken down and her mom and dad had to practically carry her out of the room. I wasn’t even sure if she knew I was awake. I hadn’t bothered to call her to let her know it was safe to see me now, mostly because I didn’t think I’d be good company considering I was stuck in a hospital room looking like I’d just gone ten rounds with a world heavy weight boxing champ. “Hey, Ever.” She cleared her throat as she stepped into the room. Her eyes darted around, taking in all the machines still in the room before landing back on me. “Come here,” I motioned her to me, giving her an encouraging smile and wincing as I tried to sit up further. She was a welcome distraction since all I had at the moment were terrifying thoughts about seeing things that weren’t there. She walked to the side of my bed and a tear slipped down her cheek. Her long, dark lashes blinked rapidly to hold back the damn that was fit to burst. “How are you doing?” she asked, her voice cracking as she sniffled. “Well, I pretty much died,” I chuckled softly, forcing a smile to my face. “Other than that, not bad.” “Oh, Ever.” She flopped down in the chair beside my bed and held my hand. “I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. If I hadn’t made you come out with me, none of this would have happened.” “Nina, it’s not your fault.” I frowned at her feeling guilty. “Don’t blame yourself, OK? Besides, I’m fine. See?” I wiggled the fingers on my good hand. “I didn’t—I couldn’t—even come see you. The one time I was here, I freaked out. I thought you were going to die. Everyone said you almost had and that your mom was going to have to pull your life support. I-I’m the worst friend, Everly.” The dam finally gave way, and her tears poured down her cheeks. She hastily wiped them away—her nose red, her mascara now smudged. “You’re not the worst friend. Not even close.” I gave her hand a tiny squeeze. “Don’t beat yourself up, Nina. I’m fine. Really. I’m not mad at you. I’ve missed you.” “Really?” she sniffled and wiped at her eyes. “Really,” I assured her, giving her the best smile I could muster. “I’m sorry I didn’t call you when I woke up. I-I just didn’t really want anyone to see me like this.” “I understand.” She wiped at her eyes again, smudging her makeup further. “Your mom told my mom the day you woke up. I had to work up the courage to come see you.” “All is forgiven. I promise.” I gave a big yawn, my eyelids heavy. I didn’t want to fall asleep, so I had to keep the conversation going. “How is everyone?” “You were really big news there for a while.” She smiled sheepishly at me. “Everyone at school was talking about you. Here,” she released my hand and pulled out her phone and showed me a photo of my locker. There were flowers strewn around it—some on the floor, some propped up against it with writing scrawled across the door. It was too small to see, but I assumed it was words of encouragement and well-wishes. It touched my heart a little. I didn’t realize anyone really gave a damn. I wasn’t that big a deal, not even when Dylan and I were dating. The only reason people knew my name was because of him and Nina. Without them, I’d have faded away into high school obscurity, just another face in the yearbook. “Wow,” I murmured, studying the photo. “And just to answer the question you haven’t asked, Dylan is a mess,” she stated matter-of-factly, her shoulders relaxing a bit, her tears now gone. “Why?” I asked, crinkling my brows. I remembered he seemed pretty broken up that night. He hadn’t bothered to check on me since it happened though. “He blames himself. Said it was all his fault. He hasn’t really said what happened that night. I tried to talk to him about it, but he just clams up. So?” “So?” I parroted innocently, knowing damn well what she wanted. “What really happened, Ever? Why were you out of the car? There are all sorts of rumors flying around school. Some people say you were mad at Dylan for embarrassing you and you two fought. Some say you were trying to get him out of the car so you could leave him there. S-some even say you jumped in front of the car to kill yourself to get back at Dylan over Brit. What really happened?” “Ugh.” I rubbed my eyes, annoyed that people had nothing better to do with their time than to speculate how I almost died. “I don’t even know. It was stupid. Yes, we were arguing. He was wasted and annoying me. I got out and was going to just walk home. Leave his sorry ass there. He got out and tried to take the keys from me. It was an accident. He grabbed the keys, and I fell backward and well, you know. Car. Uh, SUV, actually. I don’t remember much after that. He was upset. I just remember it hurting and being scared. He stayed by my side though, so there’s that.” I bit my bottom lip before continuing, a flash of Shadow in my mind. I’d started having flashes of him—his red eyes, his warm touch—two days prior to Nina’s visit, but when I tried to dig deeper, it all faded away. It was hard to tell if it was real or just part of my brain injury. I wanted to tell her about Shadow, but I also didn’t want to sound like a lunatic, so I kept my mouth closed for the time being. I’d accepted that my brain was just firing randomly and he’d probably been a figment of my imagination because I’d seen him earlier that night. “I-I don’t blame him. Dylan. Whatever people are saying is a bunch of crap. It was just an accident.” “Wow.” Nina shook her head, her blonde hair spilling over her shoulders. “It was his fault. I mean, maybe he didn’t mean for it to happen, but it did because he was being a jackass.” “It wasn’t really anyone’s fault.” I frowned, not sure why I was defending him. He’d done me dirty with Brit and didn’t deserve an ounce of my time or compassion, but old habits died hard, and I couldn’t stop myself from trying to protect him. “He was drunk, and I was just being me. I’m not dead, so it’s all good.” “But you were almost dead, Ever! It’s not all good. You even almost died again. They said you had no brain activity. Your mom said she was going to-to let you go. Seriously. A machine was breathing for you. I came in here, not believing it, but it was true. You were so pale, so cold. It was like you were a shell. You were dead for three days.” “What?” I asked, my eyebrows shooting upward in surprised confusion. “I wasn’t dead, Nina.” “Well, a machine was breathing for you, and you had no brain waves or whatever. That equals dead. You were on a freaking machine for almost two weeks. You couldn’t even breathe on your own. My mom said they were going to put a trach thing in you. You narrowly missed it. If you hadn’t woken up when you did, you’d have a freaking tube coming out of your throat right now.” “Guess I lucked out,” I joked weakly, my heart pounding wildly in my chest. Nina’s words made my stomach churn. My mom and Dr. Sanders had failed to mention that little bit of information to me. “You really did,” she replied seriously. “I want to kill Dylan right now.” “No one else needs to suffer.” I waved her off tiredly. She gazed incredulously back at me with her large blue eyes. “What?” “How are you so-so… easygoing about this?” she demanded, her full lips turned down into a frown. “I went with your mom to pick out your casket.” “Did you get it?” “Get what?” “The casket,” I rolled my eyes. “You can’t be serious,” she squeaked. “It was the second worst experience of my life, Ever! The first was hearing the news about you and seeing that it was true. Don’t joke about that. I’m still having nightmares.” “I’m sorry,” I apologized softly, my eyes not meeting hers. “It’s just, it’s hard for me too, Nina. I-I feel different now. And it’s not just because I hurt and feel like crap. It’s something else. I can’t explain it. Can I tell you something without you thinking I’m crazy?” “Of course,” she answered, her brows furrowed as she studied me. “I-I think I saw someone in my mirror,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “And that night…I-I think there was someone there with me. Like a guardian angel or something.” “What?” she asked sounding confused. “Like, I opened my makeup compact and there was this tunnel in the mirror. There was a man standing at the end of it. He was watching me. It freaked me out. And then I keep getting these flashes of this shadow man with red eyes. He was with me that night. I-I think he saved me.” “Seriously?” Nina asked, cringing. “Yeah, and I keep hearing voices, but they sound far away. I can’t make out what they’re saying.” Nina’s face fell, but she quickly forced a smile back onto it. “Maybe it’s because you hit your head. You’re still healing, Ever. That sort of thing takes time, right? I’m sure in a few weeks it’ll all go away. I mean, we all know it was just you, Dylan, and the driver there that night. That’s it. I’m pretty sure it was just the trauma from the accident making you think there was an angel or a shadow with you. Same goes for the mirror and voices. You’ve been through something really scary. I think you just need some time to heal.” “Right,” I said tightly, nodding. “You’re probably right.” I prayed she was right. The possibility of her being wrong made my stomach clench painfully.",

      "title": "Chapter Eight",
      "content": "Chapter Eight The following week, I got to go home. I was beyond excited. I couldn’t stand being holed up in that hospital room any longer. The nurses and doctors were great, but there was no place like home. Mom had fixed up the spare bedroom downstairs. That gave me easy access to the kitchen, which was helpful since navigating the stairs in our house seemed like way more effort than it was worth. We argued about her returning to work. She wanted to be home with me, but I wouldn’t have it. Working kept her mind off things and helped her cope. The last thing I wanted was her to be constantly babying me after everything. She’d started working a few shifts again while I was in the hospital and was finally going back full-time tonight. “Do you need anything?” she asked as she wheeled me into my new bedroom. The doctor said I only had about three weeks left before I’d be up on my feet again without so much effort. I couldn’t wait. “No, I’m good.” I gave her a smile, hoping to ease her worries. “I really don’t want to go back to work tonight,” she frowned worriedly, her pretty eyes tired. “I could stay, hon—” “Mom, stop,” I said, sighing. “Nina is coming to stay with me. We’ll be fine. I promise.” “You’re right.” She gave me a watery smile. “I’m just worried. You’re my baby.” “I know, but I swear I feel fine.” I took her hand as I hobbled to my bed and sat down on the edge of it. “I’m just a little tired and sore, but other than that, I’m great. Never better.” She looked at me like she didn’t believe me, but gave herself a little shake before speaking again, “I’m going to leave your pain medication on the table by your bed, OK? Take it if you need it.” She began running through instructions for me, “It’ll probably make you sleepy.” She pulled a couple bottles of water out of her bag and placed those beside the pills and gave me a pointed look. “Just in case you get thirsty.” “Thanks, Mom,” I smiled at her. “I’m going to try for a shower and a nap before Nina gets here.” “OK, sweetie. I’ll order a pizza for you girls. Do you want anything else?” “No,” I yawned, taking the crutches that she’d placed beside me. “I’ll be in the living room if you need me—” “Mom, I’m fine,” I assured her, getting to my feet and hobbling to the bathroom. I didn’t wait for her to respond. She’d coddle me all night if I let her. Once in the bathroom, I closed the door softly behind me and ran a hot shower. I hadn’t been able to have one since before the accident. Everything had been sponges and cool water. I did my best to take my clothes off and get beneath the hot water, adopting an awkward stance with all my weight on one leg and other leg outside the shower, straddling the edge. Washing with one hand took a lot of effort, but when I finished, I felt almost human again. Hobbling out, I dried off and stared at myself in the mirror. A frown pulled my lips down as I noticed a red mark on my shoulder. I rubbed it and winced. It was tender. I leaned closer to the mirror. It looked like an infinity symbol for some reason. My fingers went immediately to the silver infinity hanging around my neck. The mark on my skin wasn’t the same size as the pendant, so it couldn’t be an impression from that. “What the heck?” I muttered, the frown deepening on my face. It wasn’t incredibly large, but it was definitely there. And it definitely resembled an infinity. I touched it gingerly once more. Maybe it was just something from the accident. But how could an accident leave a perfectly shaped infinity mark on me? A quick run through with a brush tamed my hair. Then I gingerly pulled on my favorite plaid pajamas and went back to my room, where I flopped down onto my bed and snuggled deep into my nest of blankets. My eyes had barely closed when the voices started. At first, they sounded far away, almost like I was hearing them through earmuffs, but then they grew. It was like I was in the same room with them—hundreds of them. I covered my ears and shook my head, trying to make them go away, but they were relentless, growing louder and more insistent. “Stop! Stop! STOP!” I whimpered, rocking in my bed. At the hospital, it had only been whisperings and only one or two voices. This time I was being suffocated by them, as their voices closed in on me, shouting for me to acknowledge them. My brain rapidly tried to process each voice and what it said. One was calling to me. “Ever! Everly,” a girlish voice warbled. Others were upset, almost angry. A small few sounded hopeful. “He changed her! He knew it and he did it anyway. He’s just as bad as they are. Now they have a weapon,” one argued with incredulity. “Reborn, that one. She’s been chosen. Hasn’t been a Whisperer in over two hundred years.” “Maybe she’ll help us. Not hurt us,” an optimistic voice said. “We should kill her before they take her,” a hoarse voice rasped. The voices wanted to kill someone. Me? I was losing my mind. Admitting to going crazy didn’t stop the voices echoing around inside of me. “Ever, help me,” a voice cried. “Ever, can you hear me? I’m outside your window. Let me in, please.” “Look at her. She’s so weak. She can never help us. She can’t even help herself,” another scoffed. “SHUT UP!” I screamed, grabbing my lamp and throwing it across the room. It hit the wall and shattered, the glass shards landing with a crash as they exploded upon impact. “Everly?” My mom came rushing into the room breathless, a panicked look on her face. “Honey, what happened? Are you OK?” Her eyes darted from me to the shattered lamp on the floor. “I-I’m fine,” I replied, my voice small and shaking. “I-I heard voices—” “Voices?” she frowned, the cut of confusion and displeasure carved deeply on her mouth, as her eyes swept quickly over my face. “What are you talking about?” “I-I don’t know. Maybe I was dreaming,” I lied hastily, suddenly feeling like the world’s biggest lunatic. The voices had stopped the moment she’d entered the room. I stared up at her from beneath the dark fringe of my bangs guiltily, wondering what the hell was happening to me. “Sweetie,” she sat down on the bed beside me and pushed my hair away from my face. “You’ve been through so much.” She wiped at her tears and drew in a deep breath. “You can talk to me. If you’re really hearing voices, we can get Dr. Sanders to recommend us to another doctor—” “I don’t need a shrink,” I interrupted, pulling away from her. “It might help to talk through some things, Everly,” she sighed, folding her hands in her lap. “You never really dealt with your father leaving or-or any of the things he did. And now this. Sweetheart. You nearly died. Your heart stopped. You weren’t breathing. You’ve had a brain injury. Anything is possible. We can have some more tests done.” “I don’t want more tests done,” I grumbled, rubbing my eyes. “I just want to go to sleep, OK?” “OK,” she gave me a watery smile. The look in her eye said this conversation wasn’t over, just tabled for now as she got to her feet. I closed my eyes and listened as she cleaned up the mess I’d made. “I’m sorry, Mom,” I whispered. “It’s OK, baby,” she replied before the click of the door closing signaled that she’d left. I lay in bed, my heart pounding, hoping that I wouldn’t hear the voices again. When only silence greeted me, I allowed myself to drift off into a fitful sleep before the sound of Nina giggling from my living room woke me. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and looked at the clock. It was nearly eight at night. I couldn’t believe how long I’d slept. I fumbled with my sheets, finally untangling myself from them, and hobbled to the hallway on one crutch. The smell of fresh, buttery popcorn invaded my senses as I tottered down the hallway. As I peered around the corner, I saw Nina sitting on my couch, a bowl of popcorn in her hands, and her phone pressed to her ear. In the background, the television flashed with images from a chick flick she was watching. She must have felt me hovering because she looked over her shoulder at me. Her eyes lit up and a wide grin spread over her pretty face. “Ever is awake. I’ll call you later.” She tossed her phone aside and got to her feet. Her arms were outstretched as she reached out to help me. “I didn’t want to wake you, so I came in here and put on a movie.” She steadied me as I hobbled to the couch and sat down. “How are you feeling?” “Tired,” I admitted. “I bet,” Nina said sympathetically. “Do you want a drink? Your mom left us some sodas.” “Sure,” I answered. Nina got up and went into the kitchen and a tiny buzzing started in my ear. It was like a pesky gnat was circling my head. I shook my head and rubbed my ear, hoping to make it stop, but it grew more insistent. “Here,” Nina handed me a can of soda and the buzzing came to an abrupt stop. I breathed out a sigh of relief and relaxed against the cushions. “I’m watching Sixteen Candles, but we can change it if you want.” “That’s fine,” I grunted, popping the top on my drink and sucking down a mouthful. “I was talking to Dylan today,” Nina started delicately, gauging me for my reaction. When I continued to stare impassively at her, she launched into a more detailed description of her encounter with him. “He asked about you. He wanted me to tell you that he hopes you feel better soon.” I nodded, not really knowing what to say. I didn’t think a game of conversation tag was in order, so I remained quiet. “He’s been seeing Casey. I guess they made it official,” Nina confirmed softly, keeping her blue eyes downcast as she fiddled with a piece of lint on her sweater. I chuckled quietly and shook my head, still not saying anything. “Ever, come on,” Nina urged, her eyes meeting mine. “Say something! He almost freaking killed you for God sake. Don’t you have anything to say?” “I’m happy for him,” I answered, clearing my throat. She stared at me in disbelief. “Are you serious?” “As death.” I gave her a small, sad smile before looking away. I climbed clumsily to my feet, tottering to the side before catching myself on the arm of the couch. I wiped quickly at my tears and turned away before Nina could see. But I wasn’t as fast as I thought I was because she got to her feet and gave me a hug. “It’s OK, Ev,” she sniffled with me. “He’s a jerk.” “I don’t even know why I’m upset,” I chuckled darkly, pulling away and shaking my head, not bothering to dry my tears. What was the point? The cat was out of the bag now. “It’s not like I wanted to be with him anymore. I just thought—I don’t even know what I thought.” I scoffed, “Whatever. I think I’m going to go lie back down.” “Are you sure?” “Yeah. Thanks for coming over. I’m sorry I’m not more fun.” I turned and hobbled back to my room. The buzzing was back in my ears the moment I closed the door behind me. And then the voices started. Again.",

      "content": "Chapter Nine “She doesn’t know,” an astonished voice shouted. “She’s been Marked.” “They’ll come for her, and then she won’t be able to help,” the astonished voice argued. “Ever, I’m locked in your closet. Come let me out. I can grant a wish. Save me,” a hypnotic promise. “She’s lying, Ever. Come help me. I’m under your bed. If you don’t help me, I’ll grab your feet the next time you stand too close,” a sinister voice bellowed. “She won’t come, you fools. She needs to die and be done with it. We can deal with her when she’s here,” another cackled. “Stop it!” I shouted, covering my ears and losing my balance. I fell to the floor with a heavy thump. The air escaped my lungs, leaving me gasping painfully. “Ever?” Nina burst into my room and ran to my side, her eyes flashing fearfully. “Oh my God. What do I do? Should I call your mom?” “Give me my pain pills,” I groaned out. My ribs ached. My leg and arm screamed at me. And all the while the voices got louder. The voices only I seemed to be able to hear. I covered my ears and rocked back and forth on the floor as tears streamed down my face. “Exactly like her father. The pills won’t silence us forever.” “The alcohol might,” another voice added miserably. “It worked for him.” “Shit,” I groaned, grabbing the bottle from Nina’s hand and downing two of the pills without bothering to ask for a glass of water. Nina stared wide-eyed at me. “Ever…those are really strong. Do you think you should’ve taken two of them?” she asked sounding worried, her eyes wavering. “Water, please,” I croaked out, ignoring her worries. A pill felt like it was stuck in my throat. Nina grabbed a bottle of water from my nightstand and handed it to me. I drank down half of it, breathlessly, before handing it back to her. She helped me to sit up, and I almost leaned against my bed until I remembered what the voice had said about being under it. I got to my feet with her help. The voices started to fade away. My brow was dotted with sweat and my hands shook. “Nina, can you bring my pillow and blanket out to the living room? I think I’ll sleep out there tonight,” my voice was weak, and I trembled with fear. “Sure,” she said moving to the edge of my bed and grabbing my pillow. A scream slipped through my lips, as a blackened hand reached out from beneath the bed and swiped at her bare leg. Its nails were broken and jagged. Blood covered what wasn’t already black with decay. It went right through her leg without her batting a lash. The smell of death and decay filled my nostrils—a putrid smell, heavy in the air, clinging to it, making the room seem smaller as the smell grew stronger. I gagged a little as I whimpered. “What’s wrong?” she asked, her face displaying how worried she was as she turned to look at me. I was vaguely aware of the sound of my own heartbeat in my ears. “Ever! What’s wrong?” “I-I gotta get out of here. I-I can’t-,” I stumbled backward, catching myself on the edge of my dresser. A set of dark eyes peered out at me from beneath the bed A growl emanated from its twisted, bleeding lips. “Ever, wait!” Nina rushed at me, steadying me as I fell back a step, my gaze locked with the being peering out at me from under my bed. Clearly, she couldn't hear the voices or see the thing glaring at me. And that made me feel even crazier. “I’ll wait for you,” it hissed before backing away to the shadows beneath the bed—the very place I knew was now home to more than just that monster. “G-get me out of here, Nina,” I choked out. Nina did as I commanded, steering me to the doorway of my bedroom, but not before I noticed my closet door creaking open and a hand reaching around the door jam. Its fingernails tapped as if letting me know it would wait too.",

      "title": "Chapter Ten",
      "content": "Chapter Ten The pills hit me hard and fast, and before I knew it, I was out. I didn’t wake up the entire night, for which I was grateful. The sweet smell of pancakes roused me. Sitting up from my nest on the couch, I looked to see Nina stretching on an adjacent couch—her blonde hair in a messy ponytail and her makeup smeared on her face. “Good morning.” Mom popped her head in and grinned. She’d changed from her emergency room scrubs to a comfortable pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. “I’m making pancakes. Chocolate chip or blueberry? You pick.” She disappeared back into the kitchen humming a song. “Is she serious?” Nina groaned, rubbing her eyes. “Yep,” I answered, pushing my hair out of my face. “She loves making breakfast. You should see what she makes for Christmas morning.” “Wow. I’m lucky if my mom throws me a package of Pop-Tarts,” Nina chuckled as she stood up. She helped me to my feet, and I hobbled along with a crutch under my good arm into the kitchen. My mom was a fantastic cook. It smelled like heaven in the kitchen, and despite my rotten night, I was eager to eat something. “Chocolate chip or blueberry?” she asked, placing a plate in front of me, a spatula in her hand. “Both,” I said, licking my lips. She chuckled and put one of each on my plate, then added some fresh fruit. “This looks amazing, Mrs. Torres,” Nina exclaimed, sitting down and pulling her plate toward her. My mom grinned widely and gave me a wink. The smile faltered on my face as the buzzing started in my ears again. I shook my head quickly hoping to silence it, but it grew more intense. And then the low hiss of the voices invaded my senses. “Ever, look at me. I’m right here.” “Tiny thing, isn’t she? Don’t know how she’s ever going to make it. . .” “He’ll come and take her. Then we’ll be doomed. She still doesn’t acknowledge us. Ever, look behind you. You stupid girl.” “Our world is in turmoil and she’s eating.” “WHY WON’T YOU NOTICE ME!” “Stop! STOP IT!” I shouted. My fork dropped to the floor with a loud clatter, as I pressed my hands to my ears, and shook my head frantically. “Stop! Please!” “Ever!” Mom stared at me horrified, frozen in place, her plate of pancakes clutched tightly in her hands. Nina looked frightened as she gaped open-mouthed at me. “Make them stop, Mamá. Please!” I begged, sobbing, my eyes pleading with her to make the voices go away. “Make what stop, baby?” she whispered, finally thawing from her horrified position and rushing over to me, wrapping her arms around me tightly after she placed the plate of pancakes on the table. “The voices. The-the people. . . the dead people. Make them go away!” “Ever?” Nina asked, climbing to her feet and backing away, as her eyes flicked cautiously around the room, no doubt looking for what I was talking about. “Sweetie, there’s nothing here,” Mom murmured, pushing my hair out of my face. “There’s nothing, Mija.” “There is,” I whispered in a trembling voice. My hands fell away from my ears. “They’re everywhere.” “Mrs. Torres?” Nina asked, her voice shaky as she peered around the room. “Nina, get my phone,” my mother’s voice was eerily calm. Her arms remained around me. “Fetch my purse as well. It’s hanging on the hook by the door.” Nina scurried off, knocking her chair over with a clatter in the process, and returned a few moments later with my mom’s phone and purse. My mom dug through it quickly and pulled out a bottle of pills and handed me one. “Take this,” she said evenly. I opened my mouth, eager for any relief since the voices had turned into a loud roar that was making me dizzy. I swallowed down the pill with a cool glass of water Nina handed me. “Nina, please, stay with Ever.” Nina nodded and knelt beside me as my mom took her phone and dialed someone. A moment later a man’s voice came on the line, his words indistinct. She cast a hasty look at me before she left the room. I could hear her hurried murmurings, but was unable to make out what she was saying. I chuckled bitterly as I thought about the irony of it—I could hear voices that no one else could, yet I couldn’t hear my own mother talking to someone one room over. “Ever,” Nina said softly, her warm hand rubbing my back. “It’s going to be OK.” “No, it’s not,” I whispered, my voice shaking as Shadow entered the room from the living room as if he’d just been hanging out the whole time. His red-eyed gaze focused on me. Something inside me lit up at his presence. Words from weeks ago as I lay dying on the cold, black pavement poured into my mind—everything was going to change, and I’d never be the same again. I stared at Shadow with wavering eyes as the voices continued screaming out at me. He took a silent step toward me, his red eyes burning in his black form. Silence followed him, and I breathed out slowly, voicing the words I knew in my heart to be true. “Everything will never be OK again.”",

      "content": "Chapter Eleven My mom swept me off to the doctor after breakfast, which I didn’t even bother to finish eating. Nina tried to stay with us, but I assured her that I was fine and that I’d call her once we got home. She relented, complaining the whole time like I figured she would. I didn’t want her to be a part of whatever was happening to me. I didn’t want her to see me that way. And we were off. “Everly, honey, we’re going to meet with Dr. Brighton. Dr. Sanders recommended him,” Mom said, wheeling the car into a parking space in a large, empty parking lot. “He practices on Sundays?” I asked skeptically as I gazed up at the plain, brown brick building in front of us. “When I spoke to him earlier, he was more than willing to see you immediately.” She gave me a forced smile, the fear very real in her brown eyes as she turned to look at me. “Mom? Do you think I’m crazy?” I whispered, my eyes not meeting hers, my voice hoarse. I played with a piece of lint on my pants waiting for her to answer. “No, sweetheart. I don’t think you’re crazy. You endured a very traumatic experience. I think you might need some help sorting through some things. You had a brain injury as well. Perhaps something isn’t healing the way it should or-or maybe something was damaged that we didn’t see on the scans. We’re going to figure it out, and then everything will be fine. I promise.” She gave me a watery smile. “Dr. Sanders has put in the order for more scans tomorrow. Dr. Brighton comes highly recommended by Dr. Sanders. He’s going to talk to you to see if there’s something he can do to help until we get more answers.” “OK,” I answered, swallowing hard as the buzzing started in my ears again. They were like angry little gnats, with their incessant demands to be heard overpowering everything around me. I managed to weakly get out of the car, then followed my mom into the building. Despite the drab exterior of the building, the inside was immaculate. The smell of chlorine greeted us at the door. A working fountain splashed in the center of the lobby. The floors were polished marble, the kind that were so shiny that I could almost see my reflection in them. The lush green foliage added just the perfect touch to the interior. I gaped in awe at it all. We didn’t bother to stop and look at the directory on the wall. Mom seemed to know where she was going, so I followed her wordlessly to the elevator. She pushed the large number two, and we ascended to the second floor where Dr. Brighton’s office apparently was. The voices were dull, in the distance almost. I drew in a shaky breath as we entered the third door on the right and was surprised to find the doctor waiting for us at the entrance to the waiting room. “Ms. Torres, Everly, I’m Dr. Brighton.” He gave me a warm smile as he opened the door revealing the hall that must have went to his office. He was middle-aged and in good shape. I suppose one might even go as far as calling him handsome with his dark hair and gray eyes. A goatee peppered with a smattering of gray adorned his chin. “Dr. Brighton,” my mom shook his hand and gave him a wobbly smile. “Please, call me Elena.” “And call me Ever,” I said softly. He gave me a kind smile before turning to my mom. “Elena,” he smiled warmly at her and shook her hand. “If you have anything you need to do in town, feel free to do so. I’ve received Ever’s file from Dr. Sanders, and I’d like to take some time to speak to Ever privately if you don’t mind. Perhaps we can get something underway for her today.” “That would be wonderful.” Mom gave me a watery smile, her hand touching her chest. “She’s been through so much.” “I understand,” he answered, his stormy eyes finding mine before giving me a reassuring smile. “Please, Ever, step this way. Elena, we’ll be about an hour. That’s usually what my sessions run. You can wait out here or run some errands. The choice is yours.” “I do need to get a few things at the grocery store,” Mom said as she looked at me worriedly. “Don’t worry,” Dr. Brighton assured her. “She’ll be just fine here.” “Ever, do you want me to stay?” my mom asked, her face pinched with worry. “Mom, it’s fine. Go. I’ll be here when you get back.” I gave her the best smile I could muster, and she relented, backing away. “Come on, Ever,” Dr. Brighton motioned for me to follow him. We entered a room that looked comfortable, but generic. It was the stereotypical shrink’s office right down to the tan leather sofa and chair in the center. There was a desk in the back of the room with all his degrees hanging on the wall behind it. Various serene photos lined the walls, and there were vases filled with colorful flowers throughout the space. “Have a seat.” He motioned to the couch. I sat down on it nervously, the leather making a creaking noise beneath my weight. His eyes focused on me as he sank into the leather chair. “So… Your mom tells me you’ve been having auditory hallucinations since your accident.” “No,” I shook my head. “I-I just didn’t sleep well the night before—” “Ever.” He sat forward and fixed me with a steely look. “There’s no need to hide it. These things can happen after a traumatic event—in your case, a brain injury.” “So, let’s say I did hear something,” I said delicately after a moment, my eyebrow raised as I picked absently at bits of fuzz on my sweater. “What would happen to me?” “Well,” he answered thoughtfully, sitting back in his chair and steepling his fingertips in a contemplative manner. “I think it depends on a few factors. Perhaps we could help you by prescribing some medicines that can help with that sort of thing. We need to find the root cause first, though. Dr. Sanders seems to think everything looked good on your most recent scans. He wouldn’t have released you if they weren’t. So that begs us to address another possible issue. So… Tell me about it. I want to help you, Ever.” “And no one will know? It’s just between me and you?” “Absolutely. I only share with your mother what you want me to share,” his voice was firm and reassuring. “OK.” I swallowed hard, fidgeting nervously in my seat. “May I have some water?” “Of course.” He got to his feet and came back with a glass of water and placed it on the coffee table in front of me. I picked it up and drank down half of it before wiping my mouth and taking a deep breath. “It started when I was three,” I said softly. Dr. Brighton raised his eyebrows at me, but didn’t say anything so I continued, “There was this shadow. A small one. Like my size. He never left. Like, I mean he did, but he always came back. He seemed to grow with me. As I got older, bigger, so did he. He never spoke to me. He’d just appear in my bedroom and watch me.” Dr. Brighton jotted things on his yellow legal pad the whole time I spoke. He paused and looked up at me. “And do you still see this shadow?” Dr. Brighton asked, scribbling on his pad of paper. “Yes,” I answered hoarsely. “I stopped seeing it for a few years. I learned to block it all out. Before I learned to do that, these-these people would stand over me at night and ask me for things—help, my soul, lots of things. I was so scared growing up.” “And your father? Where was he?” “It’s not a daddy issue,” I muttered, bitterly giving him a dirty look. “That’s not what I’m suggesting here, Ever.” “He was there until I was twelve. Then he left.” “How was your relationship with him?” “I don’t know.” I shook my head. “Turbulent. Abusive. He hit me and my mom. He used to tie me up and put me in a dark closet while screaming incoherently. He was an alcoholic.” “I see,” Dr. Brighton scribbled more on his pad of paper. “Did you stop seeing things after he left?” I frowned. I’d never thought about it before. “Uh, actually, yes,” I answered, still frowning. “And then after your accident, they’ve come back?” “Yes, I suppose so,” I muttered. “They’re worse now. I did see the shadow before the accident, though.” “I see. And these voices, what are they saying to you? Do they tell you to hurt yourself?” “No,” I shook my head. “They ask me to see them, to let them in, to listen to them.” “Have you seen them this time around? Or is it just auditory?” “I-I’ve seen them,” I answered softly, shivering as I recalled the creatures from my closet and under my bed. “I’m afraid.” “Tell me, Ever,” Dr. Brighton leaned closer, his voice low. “Do you think they’re real?” “I…No.” I shook my head before sighing and looking him in the eyes, my heart hammering in my chest. “Yes.” “And therein lies the problem.” He gave me a small smile. “That’s where the line between reality and psychosis is. It’s the belief.” “So, I’m crazy?” I asked lamely, choking on the words. “No.” He shook his head at me. “I don’t think that at all. There are perfectly sane people walking around in the world who believe in things like ghosts. And even some who have captured them on record.” “You think I’m seeing ghosts?” I yelped. Of course. I knew that’s what they had to be if I wasn’t crazy, but hearing him address it so casually made it that much more terrifying. I think I’d rather be crazy. “It’s one of a million possibilities, Ever. I’m openminded about most things in the world.” He laid his pad and pen on his lap, before leaning forward to continue, “It could very well be related to your brain injury. But because you’ve always seen things, I’m more inclined to say it’s something more than just your body going through a traumatic event. I’m going to recommend that you come see me twice a week. And I’m going to prescribe you some medication to help you sleep at night, plus something to take the edge off. I’m also going to say this to you—I wouldn’t be so afraid of this shadow you’ve seen or think you’ve seen. If he hasn’t harmed you in all these years, I don’t think he will.” He winked at me, a small smile on his lips and went back to scribbling on different pad of paper that he withdrew from his pocket. He acted like this was no big deal, and maybe it wasn’t. He probably dealt with way crazier people than me. My case was probably a walk in the park. He handed me slips of paper with prescriptions scrawled on them and a card with his number on it. “My cell number is on the back. If you need anything, just call me anytime day or night. I’ll be there to help you.” “So, you’re like a really involved shrink?” I frowned looking down at his number scrawled on the back. “Something like that,” he chuckled softly. We both got to our feet, and he ushered me out the door. He seemed somber. Tense. Who knew. Maybe I was imagining that, too. I mean, I was seeing things that no one else could see. Imagining his feelings wasn’t too far out of the ballpark.",

      "title": "Chapter Twelve",
      "content": "Chapter Twelve Immediately after getting my prescriptions filled, I took them and within the hour I felt ridiculously mellow and tired—my mind muddled and fuzzy feeling. When we got home, I lay on the couch and zonked out. And that’s how the next few weeks went, I lived in a pharmaceutical fog and the voices faded to distant whispers. I’d been going to my appointments with Dr. Brighton and had even done more brain scans on Dr. Sanders’s orders—all those were normal. Dr. Brighton continued to grill me about my past, as well as the things I was seeing and hearing. But because I was so doped up, I didn’t have much to report to him except I still heard the voices in the distance. It struck me as odd that he seemed almost delighted by my accounts, as he rushed to write everything down on his pad of paper. It was well into summer break before I was able to move around without my crutches and grimaces of pain. Nina came over after my latest session with Dr. Brighton, and we went out to get ice cream. When we got back, she’d wanted to come inside, but I was exhausted and told her I was just going to nap. We said our goodbyes, and I went into the house. I limped to the couch and flopped down, falling into a deep sleep. When I woke up, it was late in the evening. I got up and rubbed my eyes, my head still feeling weird. “Mom? Mamá?” I called out. “¿Dónde estás?” I hobbled through the downstairs, frowning when she didn’t answer. I called out loudly to her three more times, receiving no response. She wouldn’t just leave me, and I knew she didn’t have to work. It took forever, but I managed to make it up the stairs. I knocked on her bedroom door before cracking it open and going inside. “Mamá?” Silence greeted me. I stepped up to her bed where she had a box of old photos opened. Scooping up a handful, I smiled down at the pictures of me and her together at the park, at Christmas, with grandma. And then there was one with me and my dad. He was grinning widely, his green eyes—the same color as mine—alight with humor, his dark hair a mess on his head, as he sat in his favorite chair with his arm around me. I must have been about three years old. We both looked so happy. So normal. My lips parted as I peered more closely at the photo. In the background, surrounding us, were dozens of creatures—maybe humans. Possibly the dead. Some looked like they were screaming in pain, others in anguish, and some were just watching. How anyone could miss seeing them was beyond me. My hands trembled as I held the photo. I wasn’t crazy. I wasn’t crazy! A loud crash pulled me from my thoughts, and my head snapped up to see a vase of flowers had smashed to the floor. I took a step back, the photo still clutched in my hands. “Everrr, come child,” a voice beckoned. “No,” I whispered, backing away, shaking my head. “We’re coming. We are many. You cannot run! You must dieeeee!” “Leave me alone,” I screamed, looking around the room frantically as I tried to find where the voice was coming from. Wicked laughter surrounded me. I covered my ears with my hands, shaking, sobbing, as I tried to block it out. Cold bit my skin, making me shiver. “We will get you, girl.” A nasty, black figure broke through the mirror on my mother’s vanity causing the glass to shatter into bits around me. I screamed and fell onto my backside, my still tender ankle and wrist protesting as I tried to crabwalk away. The gnarled, bony body came at me on all fours like a spider might skitter toward its prey. It was covered in blood and soot and things I didn’t want to even think about. Its hair was matted and dirty. Hollow holes marked the area where eyes should’ve been. In its hand, a shard of glass gleamed in the setting sunlight that streamed in through the open window. I was on my back, propped up by my elbows. My chest ached with every breath I tried desperately to rake in. Its face was only inches from mine. Breath soured with death and decay blew across my face. Blood dripped from its mouth onto my white tank top as it glared at me with its sightless eyes. I was frozen in fear while I waited for whatever would happen next. The thing whipped its arm back and brought the shard of broken mirror down onto my arms over and over, stabbing into my tender skin. I screamed from the sheer agony as my flesh was torn. Blood pooled around me, running from my arms like a river. Maniacal laughter echoed from the creature—the ghost—as I bled and sobbed on the floor of my mother’s bedroom. “Ever! Oh my God! Ever!” My mom ran into the room, her face a mask of terror. The creature over me disappeared as quickly as it had appeared, leaving me hurting and panting on the floor. “Mija, what did you do,” my mom choked out. I looked down at my bleeding arms and sputtered on my shock. I was clutching the shard from the broken mirror in my hand, still etching it into my flesh. “I-I didn’t, Mamá.” I shook my head, tears streaming down my face. “It-it was them. I swear.” “Dios míos.” My mom rushed to her bathroom and brought back two towels, wrapping my arms tightly. “Mom, I’m scared,” I whispered, shaking. “Me too, baby,” she murmured, her eyes wavering as she looked at me. “We need to go to the hospital. I’m going to call an ambulance. Stay right there. I’ll be right—” “No,” I interrupted, shaking my head vigorously and reaching out desperately to her with my good arm. “Please, don’t leave me.” “Sweetie, look at me.” She took my face in her hands and made me look at her. “I will be right back. I promise.” “No,” I choked out as she got to her feet. She rushed from the room, her footfalls on the stairs echoing in my ears.",

      "title": "Chapter Thirteen",
      "content": "Chapter Thirteen I was sick of hospitals and doctors. I’d seen more doctors in the past few weeks than I’d seen in my entire life before the accident. Once again, I found myself sitting in a cold hospital room. The white walls washed all the color from my skin, and made me feel cold and uncomfortable. This time I was totally conscious and very aware of what happened to me. Or what I did to myself. I guess it was just a matter of whose opinion you got. Everyone that had come into my room to talk to me seemed to think I was a danger to myself. I was positive that thing had done it to me, though. Voicing that thought only got me strange looks and a shot of something that made my head feel fuzzy. They stitched up both arms, shooting me concerned and skeptical looks. I was tired of trying to explain to everyone what had happened. I was groggy and tired and just wanted to sleep. Apparently, someone decided to consult Dr. Brighton because to my surprise, he walked into my hospital room later that night. “Ever, how are you?” he greeted me in a serious tone. He looked impeccable with his dark hair combed back perfectly and his straight teeth nearly as white as the walls of the hospital room. “Well,” I chuckled bitterly. “I apparently hallucinated. Then tried to kill myself. I’ve had a bit of a bad day.” “It would appear you have.” He closed the door behind him and sat down in the chair beside my bed. “I told your mom I wanted to speak to you alone. Are we? Alone?” He looked around the room interestedly. “Really?” I snorted dryly. He continued to look serenely at me. I sighed and rolled my eyes. “Yes, we’re alone.” “Good,” he answered. “So, tell me what happened.” I went into detail about the entire thing, even telling him about the photo of me and my father. He nodded and made some notes. When I finished, I sat and waited for his verdict. “And the shadow? Was he there this time?” Dr. Brighton asked. We’d talked at length about how I felt like Shadow wanted to protect me. “No,” I answered softly. “He never came.” “I see.” Something like anger flashed in his eyes before he cleared his throat and made another note on his pad of paper. “I think we’ll double your dosage, Ever. Now, one final question. Do you want to hurt yourself?” “No.” I frowned at the question. “Great. I think we can spring you out of here tonight.” “That’s it? What-what about those things? H-how am I going to go back home and try to sleep? Or even function?” “Well,” he answered delicately as he closed the leather-bound legal pad he’d used to write his notes in. “They may just be figments of your imagination. For the sake of both of us not appearing off, let’s assume they are simply hallucinations due to your injuries and leave it at that. I’ll double your medications. That should keep things at bay, I daresay. You’ll be safe. I promise.” “How can you promise that?” I demanded bitterly, glaring at him. “I saw a thing burst through my mother’s mirror and cut me. Then it had the nerve to make it look like I’d done it to myself. I-I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not.” I looked at him helplessly, silently pleading with him to understand my terror. “It won’t happen again. Let’s just call it intuition.” He got to his feet. “You still have my card?” “Yep,” I muttered, disgusted at everything that was transpiring. “Great. Well, let’s hope I don’t have to see you before your next appointment.” He pulled open the door and started to step out. “Oh, and Ever. Stay away from mirrors. Seven years of bad luck and all that.” He departed, and I scowled after him. If that was his idea of a joke, it sucked.",

      "content": "Chapter Fourteen I went home with extra meds and lived in such a dense fog over the next few weeks that I didn’t know if I was coming or going. Sometimes I didn’t even remember where’d I’d been or how I’d gotten there. It was frustrating. I hated it. On the flipside of it all, I wasn’t really seeing or hearing anything. Or if I was, I had no recollection of it. By the end of the summer, I’d healed completely with the exception of the strange mark on my shoulder. Maybe it was a scar and would be there forever. I didn’t leave my house often, and I spent most of my time alone. Ever since my accident, I didn’t like to be around people, not even Nina or my mom. I felt different, more than I’d ever felt before. This overwhelming, nagging feeling of not belonging continued to plague me. I couldn’t shake it. My appointments with Dr. Brighton continued. When I mentioned how weird things seemed, he’d make a note, nod, and then ask me how it made me feel. I didn’t feel like we were really getting anywhere with the therapy, something I made mention of at every visit. He’d added a new anti-anxiety medication to my ever-growing list of pharmaceuticals. I’d snatched it out of his hand with a scowl, all while telling him I didn’t suffer from anxiety disorders. There was something seriously out there trying to get me. Even if I couldn’t see them or hear them anymore, I could feel them lurking just beyond the veil of heavy drugs and the delusions that everything would be OK. Annoyed that he didn’t seem to be taking me seriously, I started telling him I wasn’t hearing or seeing anything anymore. He simply looked at me impassively and made more notes on his yellow legal pad, then offered me a piece of green, hard candy that tasted very sweet with a hint of mint. It was actually rather enjoyable. But when he asked me if I liked it, I’d only grunted. He’d made another note on his paper before proclaiming our session over. “Ever? Earth to Ever,” Nina’s voice cut through my brooding thoughts during our lunch period on the first Friday back since the new school year started. “Huh?” I asked, looking at her in a daze made possible by the latest round of morning meds. “I asked if you wanted to go to Jax’s party tomorrow. I mean, you don’t have to. I don’t want you to think I’m making you—” “Thanks, I’ll pass,” I mumbled tiredly. I chanced a look over to where Dylan was sitting with his friends and caught him staring at me, a frown on his face. I figured it was because of how I looked—all gaunt and thin, sickly with dark circles under my eyes, limp hair, and dried, cracked lips. When I looked in the mirror, I reminded myself of an old house—the kind that was falling apart but that had once been beautiful. Now it looked haunted. I was haunted. I snorted at the thought and pulled my eyes away from his. He hadn’t spoken to me once since I’d gotten out of the hospital or returned to school. I didn’t expect him to. He was seeing Casey now anyway. So much for love. I got to my feet, the bitter thoughts too much to bear. “You OK?” Nina asked, rising to her feet and looking at me with so much concern and pity it made my stomach turn. Gemma and Beth gazed at me nervously making me wonder if Nina had told them about my hallucinations. “Yeah.” I gave her a forced smile. “Just need some air.” Nina gave me a tight nod, her eyes never leaving me as I backed away from the table. Out of the corner of my eye I made out a creature crawling along the wall. Whenever the meds waned, I started to see them again. It happened every day at that time. I swallowed hard and blinked rapidly, whispering frantically, begging God to make it go away just like my mom had told me to do. It didn’t work. Instead, the creature came more into focus, its scaly, gray skin dripping chunks of flesh and thick, putrid-smelling liquid onto the floor. Its large all-white, sightless eyes glared at me. With abnormally long humanoid fingers and toes ending in four-inch-long claws, the sight of it sent a chill up my spine. The bones protruded from its skin in some spots. “Go away, go away, go away,” I whispered. My hands clenched into fists so hard that my nails dug into my tender flesh tearing the skin on my palms. The creature cocked its head at me and made a funny clicking, hissing noise. I took a shaky step back. My breath leaving my lungs in ragged puffs. Not here. Anywhere but here! Everyone was going to see. “Ever?” Nina’s voice called out to me. It sounded far away. “Ever? Hey!” The creature’s lips opened to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth. A nasty screech emitted from its twisted, ugly mouth. I covered my ears with my hands trying to shield myself from the horrid sounds. And then, the unthinkable happened.",

      "title": "Chapter Fifteen",
      "content": "Chapter Fifteen It lunged at me, with teeth barred and claws aiming to tear, to maim, to kill. I fell backward, a scream erupting from deep within me. I desperately tried to scoot away, my hands frantically going out behind me to pull myself away from the nightmare that was before me, but I hit the legs of someone’s innocently eating lunch, thus halting my pathetic plans for an escape. “Ever! Oh my God.” Nina rushed toward me, unknowingly putting herself between me and the creature. I was screaming too hysterically to warn her to move. She let out a scream that matched mine and fell forward as the creature leapt off her, completely invisible to everyone but me. She rolled over and groaned as I stared transfixed, locked in a death gaze with the creature. Its pungent spittle dripped from its hissing mouth, while its forked tongue flicked out, sliding roughly against my skin. I turned my head and whimpered, as its tongue continued to brush against my cheek. My entire body trembled. Its tongue slurped back into its mouth, as it turned its hungry eyes over to Nina, who was trying to sit up. Her forehead was bleeding where she’d smacked it on a chair when she went down. He slinked over to her, hunkered down like a cat getting ready to pounce on a mouse. “N-no,” I choked out. “Y-you will not touch her.” The creature snapped its angry jaws at me, as it eyed me over its shoulder. Its milky white eyes narrowed on me. Someone was going to be its dinner, Nina or me. I could see that by looking into its eyes. It moved back a step, turned back to me, and hunched down, ready to spring. I covered my head, sobbing, as it rushed forward. I sat frozen waiting for the inevitable pain that would accompany its pointed teeth sinking into my flesh. But the pain never came. It never made contact. The shadow from my bedroom appeared out of nowhere and drew a weapon—the same sword he used before—and plunged it through the creature’s body. The creature fell with a yip and a whine to the ground. Its body twitched violently until it exploded, leaving nothing but a spot of black on the floor before fading away to nothing but a few bits of ash in the air. “Ever? Are you OK?” Dylan called out to me. I gazed up at Shadow, my savior, with wide, frightened eyes. He returned my stare with his own red-eyed gaze. I couldn’t see any part of him but darkness. My lower lip quivered as I remained captivated by him. There were so many unsaid words behind his eyes. So many secrets. So many things that frightened me. Was he real? Was this happening? I knew him all too well. He’d been in my thoughts, perhaps only a flash, over the past few weeks. I couldn’t count the number of times I’d struggled to remember the night with him when I’d almost died. I’d been trying to make sense of it—of all of it—and had failed miserably. But there he was, staring me down in the school cafeteria, a picture of mystery for my eyes only. “Ever,” Dylan pulled me to my feet, and I stumbled into him, my eyes still locked on Shadow’s. “We need to get you to the nurse’s office. You hit your head pretty hard.” “I-I,” I stammered, glancing at Dylan before turning to look back at Shadow who was still standing in the same spot, unmoving. His eyes glared red at me, a heat coming from him that I’d never felt before. Was it anger? Was he going to ram his shadowy blade through my abdomen too, so I could join the creature he’d just killed? He didn’t seem the type to harm me. In fact, out of all the crap I’d been seeing and hearing, he was the only one that didn’t want to kill me or scare me. At least that’s what I felt. “Come on.” Dylan tugged me away from the stoic shadow, and I looked around to see that Jax had gotten Nina to her feet. Everyone in the cafeteria looked stunned. Many of them whispered behind their hands, as they looked at me with eyes filled with pity. I allowed him to pull me away, my eyes locked on the very thing I feared but had needed. Shadow gave me a curt nod before turning on his heel and disappearing through the brick wall of the school cafeteria, his heat retreating with him. I didn’t dare think that my hallucinations were warring with one another. That was just crazy talk. Crazy talk from a crazy person.",

      "title": "Chapter Sixteen",
      "content": "Chapter Sixteen Dylan didn’t say anything as he helped me to the nurse’s office. It was just as well. I was speechless, still seeing things slithering along the walls and hearing the growls and wails coming from places my mind couldn’t reach out to. I could only imagine what it would be like if I didn’t have my psych meds. But then, the very real thought of how they were breaking through now hit me. I needed something else to make them go away. Something stronger. And I needed it fast. But I didn’t want to ask Dr. Brighton for more. I didn’t even want to mention it to him. He hadn’t questioned me much when I’d said I was no longer experiencing the hallucinations. I didn’t want to revisit all that. He’d seemed hopeful and told me things would get better soon. While I appreciated his optimism, he was full of crap. This wasn’t getting better. It was getting worse. Way worse. “Ever?” Dylan’s soft voice cut through my thoughts, as I huddled even closer to him for the rest of our walk. His arm went around my waist, and I gratefully got closer. His nearness leeched calmness into me as we stopped outside the nurse’s office. I knew I shouldn’t want to feel the comfort of his nearness, but I couldn’t help myself. “I-I can’t go in there,” I whispered hoarsely, gazing forward, my body stiff with fear and apprehension. “It’s OK. Come on. I’m here with you,” he said gently, nudging me forward. “No.” I shook my head vigorously, putting my brakes on. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to go in. I very much wanted to. The problem was, there was some nasty, rotting being hanging by a noose a few feet into the room. Its head was angled oddly with its eyes wide and unblinking on mine. “I’ll go with you,” he coaxed. “Dylan?” I tore my eyes away from the dead body in front of me. “Yeah?” His eyes swept my face quickly. “Can you take me home instead?” I looked back at him and saw what I didn’t want to see—fear, sympathy, and the exact same look my mom wore when she didn’t think I was looking. The look that said she knew I was going crazy, and it was killing her to watch me catch fire and burn. “If that’s what you want,” he answered, his arm tightening around my waist. I nodded, and he wasted no time steering me away from the nurse’s office and outside to his car. I didn’t even bother to retrieve my backpack from my locker. I climbed into the passenger seat, and he closed my door, then got in on his side. We backed out of the parking lot and drove to my place, neither of us saying much. When we pulled into the driveway, he put the car in park and turned to look at me. “Ever, about everything—” “I know. You’re sorry.” I gave him a watery smile. “Yeah,” he breathed out, reaching forward and taking my hand in his. “I mean, it’s been really hard on me.” “I can only imagine the torment you’re going through,” I chuckled bitterly. Whatever he was going through was nothing compared to what I was. He must have taken my words seriously because he answered quickly, “It’s been bad. I felt so guilty. I’ve been worried about you. Are you OK? You seem, I don’t know, off. And you look terrible. No offense.” “I’m not OK, Dylan,” I whispered, watching his eyes widen as he stared back at me. “I’m never going to be OK. You see, I’m crazy. I see dead people. Or at least I think they’re dead. I see creatures that are so terrifying that you couldn’t even imagine them in your worst nightmares. I hear voices. So, I can only imagine what you’re going through when compared to me.” “You hear voices and see things that aren’t there? Are you seeing a doctor about it? Is that what happened to you today?” There was that sympathetic fearful look again. Oh, and there was the “damn, she really is crazy” look. “Yeah, I’m medicated for it,” I answered bitterly, looking away from him. A moment later his fingers brushed against my cheek causing me to turn back to him. “I’m still here for you. You know that, right?” “You’re also there for Casey too,” I replied softly, our eyes meeting. “It’s not like that with her. We’re just…I don’t know. We’re messing around. Having fun, you know? Just waiting for you to come back.” “That’s how you wait for someone?” I mused, snorting a little but not looking away from him. “What do you want me to do, Ever? You made it clear you didn’t want me! I’m just doing whatever. Like I said, I’m still here for you. It’s hard seeing you like this, though. You’re not the same girl I knew—” “That girl pretty much died on the pavement months ago,” I snapped at him. “You were there, remember?” He flinched like I’d struck him. I shook my head and looked down at my hands in my lap. “I’m sorry. I’m on edge. I don’t mean to snap,” I whispered. A moment later Dylan’s arms were around me, hugging me. “I know,” he murmured. “I don’t understand what’s happening to you. I blame myself for it all, though.” “I don’t think it’s all your fault,” I sniffled as I buried my face in his neck, breathing in his familiar scent. How I missed what once held so much pleasure for me. Everything had changed. I hated it. Our problems seemed so insignificant now. “Regardless,” he replied, pulling away from me, raking his eyes over my face, cupping my cheek tenderly with his hand, “I miss you. I didn’t know how much until you were gone… And now I’m afraid you aren’t going to come back.” “I’m afraid you’re right. That girl really is gone,” I murmured as he leaned in, his mouth close to mine. “She’s still in there. I know she is.” His lips brushed against mine, and for a moment, I lost myself in him—the guy I’d once felt so much for. He kissed me gently at first before he pressed his mouth firmer on mine. And I kissed him back with wild abandon. “Why’d you stop?” he breathed out with hooded eyes when I pulled away. “It’s…I just can’t,” I shook my head sadly. “You and Brit. You and Casey—” “Ever, I messed up! Come on. I told you how sorry I was about Brit. And Casey doesn’t mean anything to me. I know you can feel what I feel when you kiss me. Just let go and make yourself happy for once.” “Is that what you tell them?” my voice was barely audible as I looked at him, my heart aching. “What?” He crinkled his brows, confused. “When you kiss them… did you tell them the same thing about me? That I didn’t mean anything?” “Ever, no. No!” He shook his head, a frown on his lips. “I never said that about you. I-I don’t know. I just screwed up. I always wanted to be with you in ways you didn’t want me. I made some mistakes that I wish I could change. If I’d have been a better boyfriend, you wouldn’t be suffering right now.” His fingers gripped mine in a desperate attempt to hold on. “That night with the accident wouldn’t have happened. We’d still be together and planning on what to wear for homecoming and prom. I’d be pulling you into an empty classroom and kissing you right now and telling you how beautiful I think you are. These other girls just don’t hold a candle to you. No one compares. I want you back, Ever. So bad.” He finished with a deep breath, his eyes sad as he stared at me. “I-I can’t. I need some time.” “I’ll give it to you,” he answered quickly, his eyes wide and pleading. “Please, just consider us again.” “And Casey?” “Gone if you want me,” his voice determined and resolute. “I-I don’t know.” I hugged myself, my bottom lip pulled between my teeth as I tried to sort through all the weird emotions going through me. I wanted him. God help me, I did. But it wasn’t right. Not then. Maybe not ever. What could me, a broken girl, even offer him now? What could he, a liar and a cheater, offer me now? If anything, our relationship would just be even more messed up. “Think about it, Ever. I don’t need an answer today. Just get yourself straightened out. I’ll be here.” “OK,” I whispered, swallowing hard. He gave me another gentle kiss, which I accepted despite knowing better, before I got out and walked into my house. I wanted what he offered. I wanted it so much that my heart ached for it. I had way too many confusing thoughts in my head and not enough energy to sort through them. I wanted to be normal again. All I knew was that I had to find a way to numb all my pain. Just like my dad used to do.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen I’d never felt so alone in my life. Everyone was here for me. They seemed to care about me and wanted to help me get better. But they couldn’t. I didn’t suffer from a sickness that could be healed. Deep in my heart, I knew that, and it made the pain that much worse. The only person that might be able to understand was my father. I’d seen the picture. I’d lived through his torment. I became part of his nightmare. The one person that I feared, may be the one person that could offer me the answers I so desperately needed. The realization that my father may have struggled with the same issues made me mad. But if it was true, then I understood his anger, perhaps not how he directed it, but I understood it. When I went into the house after Dylan dropped me off, I picked up Mom’s address book and looked up my dad’s number. I didn’t even know if she had it. I was surprised to find it scribbled in the back. I hadn’t spoken to him in years. I wondered if maybe she had, although it seemed unlikely considering how things went the last time they were near each other. I shook that idea out of my head. My mom hated him and for good reason, but what if. . . Taking a deep breath, I dialed his number and listened as it rang, my heart racing. What was I going to say to him if he answered? Finally, after the eighth ring, I was going to hang it up, but his deep voice came across the line, “Elena?” I stood there with the phone in my hand, unable to speak. I hadn’t heard his voice in so long. It brought tears to my eyes, reminding me of when he used to hold me and read me bedtime stories. “Elena, is that you?” “N-no. It’s me. Ever,” I breathed out, my voice shaking as I held the phone in my trembling hand. “Everly? Is your mom OK? Is there something wrong?” It seemed odd that he’d ask that considering he used to smack us around all the time. Our well-being hadn’t seemed to matter back then. “S-she’s fine, Dad. I-I’m the one who’s sick,” I answered softly, a knot forming in my stomach. “They’ve come, haven’t they?” his voice sounded just as shaky as mine. “I heard about the accident.” “I think they’ve always been there,” I whispered in a choked voice. “I-I need to talk to you.” “Does your mother know you’ve called?” his voice became stronger, and I imagined him straightening to his impressive height as he waited for my answer. “No, but I can’t tell her this. She’s already stressed out. I-I just need to ask you a question, then I promise to leave you alone.” I bit my bottom lip waiting for him to respond. “Are you home?” “Yeah.” “Meet me at Lucinda’s Diner on the edge of town off Old Ten. Do you remember it?” Of course, I remembered it. He used to take me there for their super breakfast special. I’d order the chocolate chip pancakes with whipped cream. “Yes. I’ll leave now.” “Ever, be careful and try to come alone,” he said softly before the line went dead, making me wonder if he meant alone in the same way I did.",

      "title": "Chapter Eighteen",
      "content": "Chapter Eighteen I pulled up to Lucinda’s Diner and looked around. It hadn’t changed much over the years, unless you counted that they’d replaced the blown-out lights in half the neon sign so now it read Lucinda’s Diner and not da’s Diner. The grass was mowed down to nearly the dirt, and the parking lot was still cracked with tiny weeds cropping up through the jagged cuts in the faded pavement. I turned off my car and went inside, not knowing if I’d even recognize my dad. It had been years since we’d seen each other. “Can I help you, hon?” a middle-aged waitress with graying hair and a kind smile greeted me as I walked to the faded yellow counter, the smell of deep fried food greeting me. “Um, I’m just waiting for my dad.” “You want a booth?” “Yeah,” I nodded and followed her to a booth near the back. I ordered a soda and sat there fidgeting as I waited for him. Five minutes into the wait, the bell over the door jingled causing my head to snap in the direction of the new arrival. My heart was in my throat thinking this was it. This was the moment I’d be face-to-face with my abusive father. Again. My lips parted and a strange buzzing started inside as I watched a tall, blond guy, about my age with piercing blue eyes, walk into the diner and sit down at the counter. His long black trench coat nearly reached his ankles. His all black attire made his white-blond hair stick out in stark contrast. He was breathtaking to look at it, and my heart stuttered in my chest when he turned and locked eyes on me from over his shoulder. His eyes swept me up and down lazily, before he turned away without so much as a change in his expression and drummed his fingers lazily on the counter. I cleared my throat and took a sip of my soda, my heart still racing. He seemed out of place as he sat on the worn yellow stool. The waitress brought him a slice of pumpkin pie complete with a fluffy cloud of whipped cream on top. He dug into it calmly, his fingers poking out of his fingerless gloves holding the fork like a weapon. He struck me as someone who knew how to use that fork, and not just as an eating utensil. He seemed dangerous. And scary. How someone could look so cool and intimidating eating a slice of pumpkin pie was beyond me. I’d been so caught up watching the guy at the counter that I failed to notice my father walk in and approach my table looking bedraggled. His shaggy dark hair was graying and his face was gaunt, but he looked infinitely better than the last time I saw him. Of course, back then he was being led away in handcuffs by the police, with his face bloodied from Mom clocking him with a decorative vase my grandma had given her for her birthday after he’d hit her repeatedly. That was the last time I’d seen him. His dark eyes fixed on me as he walked forward. His large frame was still as intimidating as I remembered. Just looking at his hulking form made me shake, as old memories flooded my thoughts—memories that I didn’t want to think about, memories I’d kept locked away in the dark recesses of my mind. It had been rough living with him as a kid. He seemed to have changed overnight. One day he was my daddy—tickling me and calling me princess—and the next, he was choking my mother and dragging me by my hair to throw me into a dark closet, while yelling maniacally for them to just take me. I never knew who they were, but I was beginning to piece it together. “Everly?” He used my full first name in his deep voice He looked me over quickly as I got to my feet. My body shook as I looked up at him through my thick lashes. “H-hi, Dad,” I answered softly, my tongue heavy in my mouth. A small smile touched his lips. He made to reach for me, but I flinched, those old memories a reminder of what could happen if he got a hold of me. He pulled back instead and gestured for us to sit. I sat nervously across from him, and we stared at one another for a moment before he cleared his throat and spoke, “You’ve grown quite a lot. Seventeen, now, huh?” “Growing up happens. An inevitability to those of us blessed enough to experience it,” I mumbled, averting my eyes from his face as I fidgeted in my seat. I focused my attention over my dad’s shoulder at the guy at the counter. He rose from his seat and moved to sit in the booth in front of where we were. If I didn’t know better, I’d think he was trying to listen in to our conversation. “Indeed,” he nodded at me, his eyes sweeping over my face quickly and halting on the silver infinity around my neck. “You look like your mom. You’re quite beautiful, Ever. It’s been, what? Four years?” “Five, but I-I’m not here for a reunion.” I cleared my throat, pulling myself together. I caught a glimpse of one of the dead lurking outside on the sidewalk, peering in at us—jagged cuts on its body, clothes tattered and bloodstained. I shuddered and closed my eyes as I drew in a deep breath trying to calm myself. When I opened my eyes, mysterious counter guy glanced over his shoulder at me with a frown on his face. He quickly turned away and looked out the window to where the dead man stood. I swallowed hard wondering if maybe he could see him too. I laughed inwardly. Of course, he couldn’t. I was being ridiculous. A side effect of my poor mental health. I looked back out the window, cringing as I saw the dead guy cock his head at me. His mouth broke into a crooked smile, and bugs skittered out from behind his blackened teeth. “I didn’t think you were here for a reunion,” my dad answered, following my gaze outside and letting out a sigh. “So, I suppose we should just get to the point.” I nodded wordlessly as I tore my eyes away from the man outside. “First, I’m sorry, Everly. For your awful childhood. That’s on me. I can’t change it, though. It is what it is, and that’s all it will ever be. Is that what you wanted? An apology from me?” “No,” I shook my head at him, wishing the guy sitting at the booth would go away. He’d stilled in his seat with his head inclined to us. I drew in another deep breath. I had to get my crap together. I was being paranoid. “I didn’t ask you here for that.” “No?” he raised an eyebrow at me. “Then what is it? I already know about the accident. Your grandma called and told me. I wanted to see you then, but I knew I couldn’t.” “It-it’s not about that. Not really. I’m here about this,” I placed the photograph of him and me onto the table and looked at him, swallowing hard. He stared down at it, no emotion on his face. After a few moments of silence his eyes found mine. “I need answers, Dad.” His eyes went to my fingers fiddling with my necklace. “You’ve always worn that necklace, haven’t you?” What the hell did that have to do with anything? “Yeah, I don’t remember when I got it. I think Mom told me when I was a little girl that Grandma, your mom, gave it to me. Kind of a symbol to remind me that love was infinite.” He chuckled darkly, “Yeah, love is infinite and so are other things…like death. Unfortunately, you’re learning more about those things now that you’re getting older. And life…” His eyes searched my face, looking for something. I had no idea what, but I’d be patient while he figured it out. He had answers that I needed. “Do you know how you got your name, Everly?” I cocked my head as I thought back through my memories. I hadn’t ever heard anyone mention it before. “No. I always assumed Mom found it in a baby book or something.” “My mother picked that name out for you. I know you were little when she died. But she loved you so much. Your grandmother was different…special. She knew things she shouldn’t know. Saw things others couldn’t.” A chill went down my spine. “What do you mean, Dad?” He looked over his shoulder to make sure no one was close by. Leaning forward, he pitched his voice low and said, “She was psychic. Not about everything, but about key, instrumental things. She knew your mom was pregnant with you before we even knew. She told us your name was to be Everly and that you’d be special. More gifted than anyone in our family has ever been before. The Torres family is cursed… or blessed, depending on how you look at it, with supernatural gifts.” “Gifts?” I scoffed. What I had experienced so far couldn’t be considered a gift. If it was, I needed to return it. “That’s what your grandmother called it when she explained it to me when I was a kid. I saw them too. Not many before you were born, just random ones here and there. But I remember Mom telling me that they just wanted to be heard. They had things to tell us.” “Who?” He looked at me with knowing eyes. “You know who, Ever. The dead.” “What do they have to tell us?” “When I was a kid, they told me nothing. I actually convinced myself when I became an adult that they weren’t real. Just a product of my mother’s imagination. They weren’t around anymore. Then after Mom told us that you were on the way and that you’d change everything, they started appearing again. I think the dead told Mom that you were coming.” “How would they know something like that?” He shrugged. “Same way they know anything I guess. They just do. Anyway, Mom said you were coming and that you’d be the greatest gift the world would get in a long time. That you’d save everyone.” “I think she got some bad information.” “No. And when you were little and she was dying, on her deathbed, she gave me the infinity necklace you wear. With her last breath she tried to tell me something. But all I could make out was Everly, fin, job, save and live forever. I assumed she was trying to say something about the infinity and that it was my job to save you and love you forever. Failed on those fronts, I’d say.” With a sigh and a shake of his head he opened his mouth and continued, “Funny thing about life,” he murmured, tearing his eyes away from me and looking back out the window. He grew quiet for a moment before speaking, “I want you to know that I always only wanted what was best for you and your mother, Ever. I know I didn’t showcase that in a positive way. I was fighting my own demons that grew bigger as time passed, and unfortunately, I waged war on the two people I cared most about. In fact, it got to the point where I was willing to sacrifice those I loved for a moment of peace. I wasn’t able to do my job and save you.” He grew quiet again, his eyes focused on the dead man, before continuing, “Do you see the dead man on the sidewalk?” “Y-yes,” I whispered, still surprised at how easily he spoke of it. “Yes, well, there are more, and they’re going to come for you, Ever. Thousands of them will come for you just like they came for me.” He nodded, still not looking at me. “But why—” “I suspect you’ll have a harder time dealing than I have,” he mused, finally dragging his eyes back to me, a small, sad smile on his lips. “And I don’t know why they’ll come for you. I can only catch bits of words. I can’t hear them as well as I’m guessing you can. And don’t ask me how to get rid of them. Do you think if I knew I’d be the man I am today?” He snorted and shook his head. “I tried you know. To get rid of them. I told them they could have you if they wanted you so bad. Remember when I tied you up and shoved you in that dark closet? I thought they’d take you then. They tried. I remember when your mama pulled you out, you had all those cuts and bruises on your body. She thought I’d done it to you. I was guilty of putting you there, but those cuts and bruises weren’t my doing. It was them. The dead.” His voice grew soft and his eyes darkened as he twirled the fork he was holding between his fingers. I had a flash of him jamming the fork through my flesh. I sat back, swallowing hard, my breathing picking up. He was crazy, maybe even more so than me! What kind of father would do those things to his own child? “They’ve always wanted you. You’re special to them. Your place is among them, Everly. You belong among the dead.” His dark eyes were hard and cold as he stared at me, his mouth turned down into a frown. “If you go to them, you’ll save many, myself included. Don’t you want to be a savior, my sweet, beautiful daughter?” He wasn’t the same man who’d walked into the diner twenty minutes before. He was cold, calculating. Insane. “You think I should kill myself?” I asked softly, my eyes on the fork in his hand. “I think that if you don’t do it, they will. There’s something bigger at work here. I think you need to choose between the lesser evil.” He paused and licked his lips before he spoke again, his voice a low, snake-like hiss, “They’ve been whispering about your importance. And he’s going to come for you. I don’t know who he is, but it must be bad to have them around this much. None of them will stop until you submit.” “Who are they? Who are any of them?” I asked, my body trembling, my mouth dry. “You don’t have any idea?” “He’s important. In fact,” he paused as he cast narrowed eyes to the ghost still standing on the sidewalk, before continuing, “I think he’s already been visiting you. Or at least, that’s the impression I’m getting. Funny,” he chuckled darkly, “I think they want me to take you away. He must be a very bad creature, if they’re begging me to take you because we both know how terrible I am.” He laughed maniacally this time, a hint of bitterness in the harsh barking sound. “I think they know they can trust me to finish the job.” “You’re nuts,” I whispered, the bile rising in my throat. My own father was willing to kill me. Crazy ran deeply in my family apparently. “So, they tell me,” he grinned wickedly at me, his green eyes flashing. “It probably wasn’t the best idea to call me. There’s a restraining order against me for a reason.” “What happened to you?” I asked, my voice trembling. “You were once a good man. A good father!” “And then they came back. I’m willing to do anything for some peace. You’ll understand soon enough. You’ll do it yourself. That’s what I’ve always told myself. My sweet, beautiful daughter will kill herself. You must, Everly. Kill yourself. Or let me do it. It’ll be quick. And we’ll both have peace.” “You’re sick!” I hissed at him, bristling at his words. “I am,” he agreed, looking out the window again. “And I hate myself for it. I don’t like wishing for your death, Everly. You were my princess. Despite my words, I do love you. But sometimes loving someone means letting them go. And I need to let go of you. You’re the reason for my torment. My pain. Your mother’s pain. Her sadness. All of it. You’re the reason no one is happy. You don’t belong here. In time you’ll understand it, and you’ll end it.” “I won’t kill myself,” I snarled at him through clenched teeth, tears burning my eyes. “I won’t!” “You will. You’ll die. You’re meant to. Hopefully, you’ll stay dead this time. For your own sake. The alternative isn’t something I want for you. I never wanted any of this for any of us.” His voice grew more bitter as he laid the fork on the table and picked up the knife. “I could do it for you. Right now. End it all. Don’t you want the pain to go away?” “Yes,” I whispered, warm tears snaking their way down my cheeks. “But I don’t want to die for it.” “You’ll want to die. It’s best to do it now. Fast. Clean. I’ll do it with you. My car is outside. We can get in it, and I’ll hit a tree or drive it into the river. If you’re afraid, I have pills. You can take them and sleep, Everly. I’ll drive us over a cliff. It’s your death. Choose which method you’d prefer. It’ll be my final gift to you. My death with yours so you won’t have to go alone.” Was my father seriously suggesting we Thelma and Louise it off a cliff? “You’re really insane,” I whispered, a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. “I’m not going to kill myself. I’ll figure this out without you. I’ve been doing it on my own so far.” “If you could do it on your own, you wouldn’t have called me.” He sat back in his seat, the knife still in his hands and his gaze leveled on me. “And you will try to kill yourself. It’s the only way to really get answers.” “I just wanted to know if you were like me. It’s clear to me that we are nothing alike,” I seethed at him. Fear and anger warred within me to be the stronger emotion in my trembling body as I stared at the man who contributed half my DNA. “We’re more alike that you realize.” He smiled sadly at me, my old daddy peeking through for a moment before the darkness in him surfaced again. “And I’m so sorry, peanut.” I let out a shriek as he lunged across the table at me, the knife raised, a maniacal glint in his dark eyes.",

      "title": "Chapter Nineteen",
      "content": "Chapter Nineteen I squeezed my eyes shut and threw my hands up to shield myself from my father’s attack. It happened so fast—one moment he was talking to me, and the next he was lunging at me with a knife poised to kill. When the impact and pain didn’t happen, I peeked through my lashes to see that my father was frozen in place—his mouth twisted open, a bit of spittle falling from his lips, eyes just as crazy as they’d been moments before. Lowering my arms, I looked around in confusion. Everyone and everything was frozen in place. A fly hovered in mid-air, its wings no longer moving. Coffee hung suspended in a brown trail from a pot in the waitress’s hand, on its way to the cup. “What the hell,” I whispered, my heartbeat pounding in my ears. Was I dead? Was this what the last moments of life looked like? I frowned as I remembered the car accident. It hadn’t been that way when I’d been hit by the SUV. This was different. This was something else. The guy from the booth in front of ours got to his feet and came to my table. I stared up at him even more confused. We were the only two people not frozen in place. “You should run,” the guy said softly, his voice deep with a slight accent. His blue eyes remained focused on my father. “I won’t be able to hold this stitch forever.” “What’s happening?” I asked, my voice shaking as I slid slowly out of the booth. I wasn’t even sure if I could stand on my own. My entire body quivered in fear. “I’m saving your life so someone won’t have to save your death,” he answered, his eyes moving from my father to me. “I-I don’t understand,” I stammered, my legs quaking beneath me as I tried to maintain my balance. He reached out to steady me, and I stared up into his bright blue eyes. “You will. Soon.” “Who are you?” I breathed out as he released me and turned his focus back to my father, who was still frozen in place. “My name’s Eric. We’ll meet again. Now you have about ten seconds to get as far from here as you can because this stitch is about to reach its end. Don’t look back, Ever. Never look back.” His blue eyes flicked back to me quickly before going back to my father, his lip curling up, as a terrifying look fell over his face. He was going to do something I didn’t want to see. I backed away, keeping my eyes glued to him. “Five seconds,” he hissed. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead as his hand rose up from his side, his fingers curling. A strange blue glow began to flicker around him, the cobalt color swirling out of his hand in waves. I didn’t need him to say it again. I turned and fled, leaving the frozen patrons at Lucinda’s Diner behind. I was in my car and tires squealing when a deep boom shook my vehicle. I hit the accelerator harder and watched in my rearview mirror as the building lit up in the same blue glow as that which had engulfed Eric. I didn’t even want to know what was happening in there. I focused on the road ahead of me without bothering to look back again.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty My dad had tried to kill me. Some strange guy had stopped time. I saw dead people—this had to be the most bizarre, worst day of my life, and that included the night I’d been hit by the car. At least I’d spent most of that event unconscious. This I was very much awake for. Or at least I thought I was. Maybe it was just more of my weird delusions and hallucinations. Maybe I hadn’t really met with my dad. Maybe I only thought I did. Yeah. That seemed likely. None of this was real. All of it was just a figment of my imagination, created from my brain injury. I was so delusional that I was having delusions about my delusions. Deep down I knew it was more than just crazy thoughts. And that was scarier than being nuts. “Everly Lucia! ¿Dónde estabas? I got a call from the school today that you left early. I was worried sick. I kept calling you, but you didn’t answer.” My mom met me at the front door with her hands on her slender hips and her mouth turned down into a frown. “Sorry,” I muttered pushing past her and going to the kitchen where I grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and swallowed down my nightly snack of high-powered pharmaceuticals. I knew everything was real. I hadn’t imagined it. There was no way my mind was that imaginative. If it was, I’d probably have been better in art class or my writing class. “I-I had to meet someone.” “Just because you want to hang out with your friends doesn’t mean you can just walk out of school whenever you want. You need to tell me where you’re going. You’re not well, Ever—” “You’re right,” I laughed disgustedly, the day’s events still all too fresh in my mind’s eye. “I’m not. And no amount of pills or coddling is ever going to change that! I think it’s safe to say we both need to learn to get over it!” “Ever, you’ll get better—” “No, I won’t, Mamá! I have a sickness that can’t be cured. Prayers and tears and hopes and positive thinking won’t change me back. You know why? Because I’ve always been this person. This is me. Broken and crazy,” I shouted at her hysterically. A ghost hovered in the corner of the dining room, and I laughed maniacally, the sound a mixture of bitterness and anger. It reminded me of my lunatic father. “Come get me, you shits!” I shouted at it, spit flying from my mouth. “Here I am. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for?” I taunted and threw my bottle of water across the room at it. Tears streamed down my face. I was losing it. Jesus. I was the female version of my father. All I needed now was a knife and a bottle of alcohol. “Whatever,” I breathed out, my lower lip quivering and my eyes on fire with unshed tears. “I’m going to bed. Maybe they’ll kill me this time so no one else will have to. Save me the trouble of doing it myself.” “Ev—” my mom’s voice cracked. “Goodnight,” I called over my shoulder at her as I disappeared up the stairs. I slammed my door closed behind me and went to my bed and sat down on the edge of it making sure to sit with my feet off the floor. I pulled the picture of me and my dad out of my pocket and looked down at it. Tears continued to stream down my face as soft sobs escaped my trembling lips. The air shifted in my room. I didn’t need to look up to know I wasn’t alone anymore. “What do you want from me?” I whispered, closing my eyes, feeling warm sadness snaking its way down my cheeks. There was a gentle touch on my face, like someone was wiping my tears away. I opened my eyes to find myself face to face with Shadow as he knelt in front of me. His red eyes wavered like he was crying with me. Little tendrils of blackness curled off him like tiny serpents. “Why did you save me if I’m meant to die?” I managed to choke out, my body quivering as I stared at him. I knew he’d been there. It was coming back to me in small, terrifying pieces. He’d always been there. My childhood, growing with me. My accident, healing me. The cafeteria, saving me. Now, comforting me. He reached forward and placed a black finger to my lips, and his head gave a slight shake. His warm finger slipped slowly away from my lips, and he took my hand and lifted it, placing it against the spot on his chest where his heart would be. He rested his other hand over my heart as his glowing ember eyes focused on me. A memory surfaced. His hand had been over my heart when I’d had the accident. Beneath my palm, his heart thumped along in his chest. How could he have a heartbeat if he was dead? If he was just a shadow? “This doesn’t make any sense,” I murmured. He leaned in to me and rested his forehead against mine and breathed out slowly. He breathed. He was warm. He had a heartbeat. Was he another creature like the guy from the diner? I closed my eyes as our foreheads stayed pressed to one another. None of this seemed real, yet I knew it had to be. If it wasn’t, then I’d been sick since the day I saw the first spirit. Since the first time I saw the shadow. Since. . . forever. Always. When he pulled away from me, his eyes looked even sadder if that was even possible. I watched as he got to his feet and backed away from me. “Where are you going?” I asked worriedly, reaching out for him. I needed him. I felt like he needed to be here with me. He couldn’t just disappear. I had the sudden crazy thought that I couldn’t exist without him. “Why won’t you talk to me!” He bowed his head as tiny wisps of black smoke puffed up around him He faded away within them, leaving me all alone again in my bedroom. I couldn’t do this. Forty-five minutes ago, all I wanted was answers and to resist dying by the hands of my father. None of this made sense. Ghosts haunted me. A strange shadow man was worried about me, so it seemed. And there was a guy who could literally stop time. My father’s crazy rantings echoed in my mind. He said I’d want death. I wasn’t sure how in forty-five minutes I could go from wanting life to wanting death just to escape. It was a nod to my mental issues, that was for sure. My dad drank. Heavily. He did it to dull the voices. The voices I could hear humming in the distance even now. They were coming. He wanted me dead to what? Save me? Save himself? If I was dead, none of this would matter. Peace. My dad had wanted peace. God, I did too. He found it in the bottom of a bottle of alcohol, or at least he found tolerance there. I wanted something, anything, just so I could breathe without fear. Maybe he’d been onto something. There was really only one way to find out. I just had to take that step. I had to become what I feared—my dad.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-One I fell asleep, my mind plagued with my father’s words, my fears, and the image of what I’d seen that day. I awoke sometime later that night to an odd sensation of being watched. And it wasn’t Shadow this time. The full moon cut through my bedroom window, sending a sliver of pale white light to splay across my floor and casting the room in shadow. I pulled a deep breath into my lungs as the hairs on the back of my neck stood at attention. “Breathe, Ever. Breathe,” I commanded myself softly, pulling my blankets up to my chin as I tried to get comfortable in bed. My attention snapped in the direction of a floorboard squeaking, and I swallowed hard. “Just the house settling,” I whispered, trying to reassure myself. My hands gripped my blanket tightly as I settled back against my pillow, my body on high alert. When nothing else happened, I closed my eyes, hoping that I’d be able to sleep through this nightmare. Creeeak! My eyes snapped open, and I looked at my closet door. It was opening slowly, the creaking like electricity coursing through the room, the energy nearly palpable. “Crap,” I swallowed hard, burying myself deeper into my bed. The creaking stopped when the door was completely open. I waited for whatever was within it to show itself. The room grew eerily quiet. Too quiet. Dead quiet. This silence was thick. Stagnant. Suffocating. BANG! Something slammed against my bedroom window, shaking the walls around it. “Crap, crap, crap,” I hissed, my grip on the blankets tight and painful. And then the black, decayed hand appeared. Its long broken gray nails scratched across the broken pane of glass. Wreeeeeet! The terrible scratching sound echoed around me. I covered my ears with my hands, as my body trembled with fright. Ever! Let me in, child. I have something that belongs to you.” The voice cut through my body, sending a river of chills over me. The pane of glass cracked again as the fingers dug their way through. I tugged my blankets fiercely, wanting to cover my head like I’d done as a child. I wanted to hide. I wanted to escape! “ARGH,” I screamed as I covered my head and found a body covered in bugs, rot, and blood clawing its way up beneath my blanket from the end of my bed. Its broken teeth gnashed as its jagged fingernails cut painfully into my legs. I kicked furiously. The acrid taste of rotting flesh filled my mouth as I struggled and fell out of bed, hitting the floor hard. I tried to scramble away, to run as far from there as I could, but something wrapped its cold hands around my ankles and tugged me ferociously. I reached out, screaming, clawing at anything I could to hold on, but it was useless. I was pulled under my bed into complete darkness, the only sound was my screaming and the heavy breathing from my captor.",

      "title": "Chapter Twenty-Two",
      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Two I woke up the next morning under my bed and quickly crawled out. My body felt like I’d been beaten and left for dead. And who knew, maybe I had been. It certainly felt that way as I tried to stretch my sore muscles. I had no idea what had happened to me, but I was certainly grateful that I was still alive. A quick shower helped to relieve some of the ache. When I saw the mark on my shoulder, I frowned. It was even redder than before, and now it had a purple tint too, like a bruise. It seemed larger, too. I hastily tried to rub the reddened skin but winced when that proved to be quite painful. Great. Something else to worry about. Having no memory of what happened once I’d been pulled under, freaked me out. Any fear I had of turning into my dad was outweighed by the fear of existing like this. I grabbed the flask that Dylan had given me after an evening of heavy sparring and went downstairs to my mom’s liquor cabinet. After filling it, I made sure to drink down a large portion straight from the bottle. Then I took my handful of small miracles and stuffed the flask into my bag as I sank down on the couch. My mom was working a double, but she texted me throughout the day to check on me. By eight that night, I was so drunk that I couldn’t see straight. It seemed to work even better than the pills did. My father had given me the best gift he could—his desire to drink gallons of alcohol to escape his problems. If it kept my own demons away, then I was game. It beat his alternative—death. At least at the moment. But the night was young, and my mind wasn’t in the best place. “Nia?” I slurred into the phone. “Ever? What’s wrong?” “You still going to the party tonight?” I asked, shaking my head to clear my vision. It only made it worse. “Um, yeah. I’m leaving now. Why?” “Come get me?” I asked. “O-kay. I’ll be there in a few minutes.” She sounded hesitant, no doubt because the last party I went to I’d been hit by a car. “Be fast. I hate being alone in this house. You know how crazy I am.” Not waiting for her answer, I hung up and stumbled to my room. I pulled on a short jean skirt and tight black tank top that left way too much skin exposed. Old Ever would’ve been appalled. New Ever didn’t care. Unable to stay inside the house any longer, I sat outside and waited for Nina to pull up. When the crunch of the gravel sounded, I climbed to my feet, ambled out to her car, and climbed into the front seat. “Good evening,” I exclaimed drunkenly. My vision blurred and my heart fluttered madly in my chest. “Ever, are you drunk?” Nina asked, wide-eyed. “Abso-freaking-lutely!” I laughed, struggling with my seatbelt. “It’s so much easier like this. I can’t see any of the people or hear their voices. I know why my dad was always wasted so much now.” “Ever, maybe you should just stay home and sleep it off—” “No. I have to go! I have to. OK?” I stilled in my seat as I gazed at her. I couldn’t be alone. It wasn’t a good idea. “OK,” she murmured, backing out of the driveway and heading to Jax’s house. She rambled the entire way about how she wasn’t sure what she’d tripped on that day in the cafeteria when she’d fallen, but she’d been embarrassed over it. I stared out the window and winced as we passed the cemetery. There were no shadows wandering the path this time. Something about that bothered me. I knew there were others out there besides him. I’d seen them. And what was his deal anyway? Why did he show up sometimes but not others? Why wouldn’t he talk to me? Why was I so worried about a shadow talking to me? God, I was screwed in the head. Once we got to the party, I made my way to the keg and continued to drink. My eyes scanned the room, seeking Jax. But he was nowhere. By midnight, I was stumbling around hugging everyone. Everyone but Dylan, who still hadn’t shown up yet. “Ever, maybe you should slow down,” Nina frowned at me as I finished my tenth beer for the night. With bleary eyes I stared back at her, wondering when she became a hater of fun. Not that I was having fun. I was numbing the pain, silencing the voices, blinding myself so I wouldn’t have to deal with all of it. If I didn’t, I feared that I’d do something stupid. I knew I was on the verge of it. It was like knowing a word but not being able to say it. That’s what it was like with me, as I teetered on the line between sanity and insanity, with my dad telling me to just kill myself on repeat in my head. He was right. It was a means to an end. “You’re right,” I slurred out morosely. “This beer isn’t working.” The voices were still there, just muted. With one hand I dug in my purse and pulled out the bottle of pills I’d hidden inside. I fumbled with the lid for a moment before I was able to get it off. With a shake, I poured two small pills into my hand and tossed them back, using my eleventh beer to wash them down. “Ever, come on,” Nina pleaded, her blue eyes big as she stared at me. “Stop, OK? Do you want me to call your mom? She can help you-,” “My mom?” I scoffed, steadying myself on the wall. “She already thinks I’ve slipped off the deep end. She’ll have me committed before sunrise.” I let my bleary eyes wander over to where Dylan was standing with a beer in his hand. He was finally here. His handsome face looked amused as Jax and his group of friends laughed. He said he wanted me still. He said he’d always be there when I was ready. Well, I was ready for something else to distract me. Casey stood beside him. She kept touching him lightly on the arm or chest. I narrowed my eyes and pushed my drink into Nina’s hand. I was doing this. Alcohol was my liquid courage. “Ever, what are you doing?” Nina reached out for me, the worry evident in her voice. I pulled away and didn’t answer her as I made my way over to Dylan. I wasn’t even sure what I was doing. There was this wild idea in my head that I had to do something drastic to make the pain and confusion disappear. Dylan seemed like the best place to start. If I wasn’t with him, then everything that had happened to me had been in vain. “Dylan,” I called his name out softly, and his eyes snapped to me, his arm dropping away from Casey’s waist. “Hey, Ever,” he replied, a careful, curious smile on his face. His eyes raked over my body quickly, lingering in some places before finding my eyes and locking on them. I swallowed hard as Casey glared at me. Dylan’s friends went quiet as they watched. Blame it on the alcohol or my sudden craziness, but I had to have him back. I wanted to be normal again. With a step forward, I rested my hand on his chest, pushing Casey out of the way. He stared down at me for a moment with a look of confusion on his face, before I went up on my tiptoes and pressed my mouth to his. He seemed stunned by my move, and I heard Casey sputter out a protest, but it was short-lived as his hands landed on the small of my back, tugging me to him. His tongue swept my mouth quickly. When we broke apart, Dylan’s friends stared at us, stunned. Casey’s face was livid, her hands clenching and unclenching into fists as she stared daggers at me. “Want to leave?” Dylan asked softly, glancing from Casey to me. “Yeah,” I nodded breathlessly, letting him steer me away. “Ever,” Nina shouted after me as she tried to break through the crowd of partygoers. “Ever! Wait!” I didn’t bother to stop. I’d give Dylan whatever he wanted if it made me feel normal again.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Three I was wasted. I let Dylan take me out to his car, him pushing me along quickly as I stumbled around trying to maintain my balance. Clumsily, I climbed in, and he shut the door. Nina and Jax approached. Jax looked apprehensive with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Nina pointed her finger at Dylan as her pretty face twisted into a scowl. I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but she was definitely angry as her mouth moved quickly and her eyes flashed. She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest, seemingly tired of their conversation. After another moment of arguing, she pushed him out of the way and opened my door. “Ever, get out of the car. Now,” she demanded, her voice hard. “Nina, leave her alone,” Dylan snapped from behind her as he tried to move her aside. “I’m not getting out,” I slurred, my head spinning. “I’m going with Dylan.” “See? She wants to go, Nina, so why don’t you go back to the party and drink a little and loosen up. God knows you could use it.” Dylan managed to wedge himself between me and Nina effectively blocking me from her view. “Ever, you’re drunk. Just get out and come with me. I won’t tell your mom. We can go back to my place, and you can sleep it off,” she reasoned breathlessly, pushing him so I could see her. “No,” I shook my head, staring straight ahead. “Jax, take Nina back to the party, would you?” Dylan cut in, sighing in exasperation. “Don’t you hurt her, Dylan,” Nina breathed out shakily, her voice dangerous. “You nearly killed her last time.” “Piss off, Nina,” Dylan growled, moving to shove her. Jax jumped between them and put his hand on Dylan’s chest to stop him from getting too close to her. “Dylan, chill, man. Ever’s really messed up right now. Maybe it’s best if she does go home with Nina,” Jax said diplomatically. Nina’s soft sniffles fell on my ears making my heart clench. I knew she was upset about the situation. I just had to do this. “She’s sick, Dylan,” Nina shouted, pointing accusingly at him, her voice trembling. “She needs to be home, not getting you off in the backseat of your car.” “Get her out of my face, Jax,” Dylan spat, backing away from Nina. Jax pulled Nina away, her face falling. He said something to her and she shook her head, looking over her shoulder at me. I drew in a deep breath, my mind made up. I was going with Dylan. He climbed into the car and started it. His hand moved over the console to rest on my bare thigh briefly. His eyes were hungry. Giving my leg a slight squeeze, he let go, put the car in gear, and we sped off down the street. We didn’t talk until he pulled into his driveway. “My parents are away for the weekend,” he murmured, his dark eyes shining as he gazed at me. “No one will bother us.” Without waiting for me to answer, he got out of the car and came around to my side to help me out. I stumbled into him as my head spun. Leaning down, he pressed his warm mouth to mine. His hands roved over my back. “I’ve missed you, Ever,” he said, peppering my face with kisses. “Come on.” He pulled away and helped me into his house and up the stairs to his bedroom. He didn’t waste any time getting his hands on me again as we fell onto his bed. “I’m so sorry about us. About what happened to you that night,” he breathed out between kisses. “I’ve been so worried about you, baby. I’m glad you decided to end this nonsense and be with me again.” I kissed him back, ignoring the war my heart and mind waged within me—the alcohol and pills fought a war I wasn’t sure either would win. “I-I shouldn’t be doing this,” I managed to gasp as he pulled me closer, the old Ever trying to claw her way out. “Shh, baby,” he kissed me deeply. “Stop overthinking it. I’ll make you feel so good.” I lay back on the bed, my body numb, as Dylan gazed down at me fondly. He leveled his body over mine, his mouth finding mine again. His hands moved to touch every bit of my warm skin. “He’s going to find out,” a voice whispered frantically through the haze. I raked my fingers through Dylan’s hair, desperate to distract myself from whatever the voice was talking about. “He’s going to be so mad,” another shaky voice whispered. “We should go. Who knows what he’ll do when he finds out.” “I’m not leaving. She brought this on herself. What’s he going to do to us? We’re already dead.” “You know damn well what he’ll do if he gets his hands on us. We’ll be forced into a box and used—sucked dry.” I pushed Dylan off me, panting, and dropped my head into my hands. “Ever?” Dylan asked, confusion making his voice thick. “You OK?” “No,” I shook my head, trying to breathe evenly. I looked at Dylan, his hair messy, his handsome face concerned. He never looked concerned about anything. Maybe I really was a freak if even he looked at me odd. I didn’t want to be a freak. I didn’t want pity. I wanted to be Ever again, not the crazy girl who heard voices and saw strange things lurking around. I leaned in and kissed him again. He didn’t resist, his mouth opening easily so he could run his tongue along mine. I let him lay me back down as his hands went back to holding me. The air shifted around us. It grew heavy and thick with foreboding. I squeezed my eyes closed, ignoring it as I continued to kiss Dylan. “He’s coming,” the first voice squealed with fright. “Hide! Hide so he won’t find us,” another voice called out frantically. “She’s in so much trouble, He won’t be happy,” a third voice shouted. “He might remedy the problem for us, though,” another sneering voice hissed. “Stop,” I screamed out, the noise too much. “Stop, please,” I whimpered as my hands covered my ears. Dylan stopped kissing me, and stared down at me with a frazzled look on his face. “Ever, baby, come on. Relax,” he murmured as he raked his fingers through my hair. His lips found mine again, only I didn’t kiss him back this time. Frustrated, his mouth moved down to my neck. His hips dug into mine. “Dylan, stop. Please,” I whispered, suddenly needing to get out of there. The air was difficult to breathe. Something terrifying was coming. Something I’d already faced only yesterday in my bedroom. Shadow appeared at the foot of the bed. His eyes glowed red and fiery. Anger resonated from every bit of blackness that blanketed him. Dylan was lifted off me. His face twisted in terror and shock, as he was tossed easily across the room. He landed with a thud against the wall before sliding down it. Shadow stalked purposefully toward him. Dylan clearly couldn’t see it, but fear was written on his face. His wild eyes darted about frantically, as he tried to process what just happened. “No,” I screamed, trying to scramble out of the bed. My feet tangled in the bedsheets from Dylan’s unmade bed. “No. Don’t hurt him.” Shadow ignored me and leaned down. He wrapped his fingers around Dylan’s neck causing Dylan to choke and sputter in protest. His beautiful eyes bulged as he scrambled to claw at Shadow’s invisible hand around his neck. “Stop,” I shouted, tears pouring down my cheeks. My chest ached with fear. “Please, stop!” Finally able to cross the room, I reached out, not knowing what else to do, and touched Shadow’s arm. He turned his head to me, his grip on Dylan’s neck loosening. He seemed to be contemplating something. His gleaming red eyes gazing deeply into my own as he cocked his head. Appearing to have come to a decision, he turned back to Dylan and tightened his grip again. Effortlessly, he lifted Dylan to his feet and then just a little higher so he was pinned to the wall with his feet dangling inches from the floor. Terror filled Dylan’s features as he was held against his will to the wall, his body flailing, his hands clawing at his invisible attacker. Shadow leaned forward and whispered something to Dylan causing him to still. A tear leaked out of his eye and he nodded, gasping. Shadow tightened his grip on Dylan’s neck some more, and Dylan reached out to push against the force that was holding him but came up empty. He still couldn’t see Shadow. My heart sank as Dylan’s eyes met mine, fear flashing in them. “I-I understand,” Dylan choked out as another tear leaked from his eye. Shadow seemed satisfied with his answer because he released his grip, and Dylan slid to the floor with a loud thud. “Dylan!” I rushed to him and reached out, but he scooted away from me, shaking his head. “Go away, Ever,” he rasped out, shrinking back from me. “Wh-why? Let me help you!” I tried again, but he batted my hands away. “You need to go. Now. Leave, Ever! I don’t want you here,” Dylan’s voice was firm, scared, insistent. “I-I’m sorry,” I whispered, backing away from him. Grabbing my jacket from the floor, I tugged it on and glared at Shadow who still stood in the center of the room, daring me, challenging me, to go back to Dylan. I knew it was in Dylan’s best interest that I leave. I cast his frightened body one final look before stumbling down the stairs and out his front door.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Four I didn’t go home. I couldn’t. My mind was plagued with the night’s events. My dad’s voice telling me to just end it, ran circles in my head. He was beginning to sound like the voice of reason. What just happened? In the past Shadow always seemed to protect me, to watch over me. Why did he feel the need to hurt Dylan? It was wrong! I could handle myself with Dylan. I didn’t need him to intervene. The thought of him keeping tabs on me like that, made me sick. What else had he watched me do? If he could lift someone like Dylan and toss him like a ragdoll across a room, there was no telling what else he was capable of. I was sick of trying to sort through all the madness happening in my world. I needed an escape, a bigger one than I’d been using. I wandered to Gleeman’s Liquor, a store in the middle of town. There were voices all around me, whispering and clawing at my mind. My buzz was starting to wear off. I needed more. The adrenaline rush from what went down at Dylan’s no doubt had a sobering effect. I went to the hard liquor aisle and chuckled darkly as I stared at the selection. I’d just witnessed my boyfriend—ex-boyfriend—get flung across the room and choked by some supernatural being. I was hearing voices. I was seeing creatures and humans that had once existed but had left this world long ago—or had never existed, but wanted to. I couldn’t take it. I was done. So. Done. I grabbed a bottle of amber liquid off the shelf and popped the lid off. “Bottoms up,” I muttered morosely. I tipped the bottle back and downed half of it before moving on to another bottle. Then another. “Hey,” a clerk shouted ten minutes later. “What the hell are you doing?” “Whas it look-hic-like?” I slurred, stumbling back and knocking over a shelf of loose tobacco. It landed with a clatter and a crash. “I’m calling the cops,” he yelled, his face red with anger. “Call the ghos’ busers while you’re at it,” I shouted after him as he ran back to the front to phone the police. I continued to drink, the voices finally gone. I smiled in satisfaction as I finished another bottle. My vision went wonky then, causing me to stumble forward and then back before I crumpled to the ground with vomit coming out of my mouth. My vision blurred. Maybe I’d finally finished the job of killing myself—a process that had started months ago when the car hit me. Maybe I’d make my dad proud. I breathed out a ragged breath, hoping beyond anything that there would finally be silence. And darkness. And peace. I craved them more than my next breath as my eyes closed and I faded away.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Five I woke up with a tremendous headache. The sun streamed in, bathing me in light and warmth. The familiar beep of the monitors filled my ears, making my head throb. “You’re awake,” my mom murmured. I snapped my head in the direction of her voice and winced at how bright the sun was coming through the window. “Then I guess that means I failed,” I muttered with a sigh, burrowing deeper in my bed. “What?” she asked, frowning. “Were you actually trying to kill yourself, Ever?” Her large dark eyes were glossy with tears, her lower lip trembling. “Doesn’t matter,” I rolled over and pulled the blanket up tighter around me. “When are they letting me out of here?” “Ever, we need to tal—” she started, but I silenced her by sitting up suddenly and shouting. My long hair was wild and messy as it clung to my damp, sweaty skin in chunks. “No! No talking. All I freaking hear are voices. Voices all the damn time. I don’t want to hear anything but silence.” I paused and turned my head in the direction of a small, dark creature with large black eyes, tiny black horns, and charcoal-colored matted fur as it lurked by the doorway to the hospital room. “Get out of here,” I bellowed louder, throwing my pillow at the creature. It dodged the pillow and glared at me, its eyes narrowing. It let out a low growl and started pacing the doorway again. I lunged out of the bed causing the IV in my arm to rip out. My arm started bleeding, and the wires attached to me gave way, as I rushed forward at the creature. “Ever,” my mom shouted frantically, trying to get to me. She must have hit the call button because a couple nurses and a doctor rushed in and grabbed me as I tried to chase the creature around the room. It was quick and let out a low growl as I kicked at it. Its mouth opened to reveal a row of razor-sharp teeth. My arms were restrained by the nurses, but that didn’t stop the fight in me as I tried to go back at the creature, kicking out ferociously at it. “I hate you,” I shouted, gnashing my teeth at it. “I hate you! Leave! Get out of here!” There was a sudden pinprick pain in my butt diverting my attention to the person beside me. “Sorry, sweetheart,” Dr. Brighton said softly as my vision blurred. He capped the syringe. My mother sobbed in the distance. A smile touched my lips. The silence. It was coming. Thank God.",

      "title": "Chapter Twenty-Six",
      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Six When I woke up, I wasn’t in the same room. This room was small. Too small. Not much was in it. It had the hard bed I lay in, a dresser, and a heavy metal door with a tiny window in it. The walls were an ugly shade of mint, a color that made me feel cold. My head felt fuzzy and my mouth felt thick and dry. I stumbled forward and tried to open the door, but it was locked. My fists banged loudly on it. My heart hammered a matching rhythm in my chest as the anxiety started to build. I was locked inside this room—this cell. “Help,” I screamed. “Help! Let me out! Please!” I screamed and screamed until my voice barely worked. I slid to the floor, my hands bruised from pounding on the door for so long and so hard. I wept big, fat, ugly tears. My body trembled violently as I hugged my knees to my chest. Moments later, the door opened and two large men entered the small area. Fear made me scoot on my butt away from them. The hasty motion made my hospital gown slip off my shoulder. I was terrified of what was happening. One held a jacket with buckles on it that looked like something they put crazy people in. I pressed my body against the wall as their large hands reached forward and tugged me to my feet. “No,” I screamed, my voice hoarse. “NO!” My words fell on deaf ears. I struggled against them as they forced my arms into the jacket and secured the straps so I was a prisoner in the rough fabric. I cried out, wanting to wipe the tears away, but I was unable. Panic crept up my throat. The straps were so tight that it was hard to breathe. My sweat-dampened hair was matted to my tear-soaked face. The metallic ting of blood filled my taste buds where I’d bitten my tongue during my futile struggles. They wordlessly took me by my arms and tugged me from the room. I tried putting the brakes on, dragging my feet in fear of what was happening and where I was being taken. “Who are you?” I croaked out, fighting against them. “Please! Where are you taking me?” They didn’t answer no matter how I kicked and screamed. I was lifted easily and hauled to an elevator where we descended swiftly. When the doors opened, I was pulled out and taken down a long hallway with flickering, buzzing fluorescent lights that made my head throb. The dull glow from them was the only indicator that the place was even inhabited. One of the men rapped once on a heavy metal door, and it swung open. Without a word, I was pulled through and left to just stand there as the men left. The sound of the door closing firmly behind them was a resounding thud. “You’re afraid,” a deep familiar voice stated from behind me. “D-Dr. Brighton?” I asked, my voice hoarse and shaking as I squinted at him through the tangled mess of hair hanging in my face. The dim flickering, fluorescent lights made it difficult to see him clearly. He was shrouded in shadow as he sat in his chair behind a metal table. “Where am I? What’s happening?” “You’re at a facility in Traverse City,” he answered, gesturing to a chair across from him for me to sit in. “Why am I here? Why am I wearing this?” I demanded, my throat aching from screaming so much. “Where’s my mom?” “Calm down, Ever. I’ll undo your restraints if you promise to be good. If you aren’t, I’ll sedate you. OK?” “O-Ok,” I breathed out, scared. Dr. Brighton came over and quickly undid the straps on the jacket and removed it from me. “This was a necessary evil, unfortunately,” he explained, holding up the strait jacket. “We didn’t want you to lash out, especially with all your training.” He tossed the jacket onto the table. How did he know about my self-defense classes? I narrowed my eyes at him. I’d never told him about my training with Dylan or my other martial arts classes. “Please. Sit,” he gestured to the chair again. I hesitated a moment before moving forward to sit as he indicated. My eyes roved around the stark, cold room. There was nothing but a small table and two chairs in there along with a camera in the corner. “How did you know about my fighting?” I demanded, staring him down. “I know a lot about you, Ever. I’ve been studying you for a very long time.” Dr. Brighton looked down at me, his face expressionless. “What?” I frowned. “You’ve been on the Order’s radar since you were a child. I’ve followed you closely since you were young. We actually got lucky with that accident.” “I’d hardly call me getting hit by a car and nearly dying, lucky,” I scoffed. “It’s all a matter of perspective. It brought you directly to me, which is a good thing. You see, I’m really the only one who’ll be able to help you now.” “Why am I here?” I whispered, trembling. His words scared me and didn’t make any sense. “I don’t understand.” “Because you need help, Ever. Wouldn’t you agree?” I didn’t say anything. Of course, I needed help, but I doubted that he’d be the one to help me. Unless he had a knife. Or pills. Or alcohol. Or drugs. Or a gun. I wasn’t picky. Whatever I could get my hands on to get the hell out of this miserable life. He and his pad of yellow legal paper weren’t cutting it anymore. “You can’t help me, Dr. Brighton,” I said softly, hoarsely. “No one can. I want to die.” “Ah, and that’s where the problem lies, I’m afraid,” Dr. Brighton commented, coming to sit in front of me at the metal table. “We cannot let you leave because you’re a danger to yourself, Everly.” “No, I’m not,” I muttered, denying the words I’d just told him. “You’re lying. We both know it. So, let’s cut to the chase.” Dr. Brighton folded his hands on the table and surveyed me with his gray eyes. “How long have you really been hearing the voices? You told me in our last session that everything was back to normal.” “What voices?” I played dumb. “I’m not hearing voices.” If I told him the truth, he’d keep me locked up in a padded room, or worse, back in that damn jacket. “The ones whispering to you right now.” A small smile touched his thin lips as he watched me. I fidgeted uncomfortably, wincing at the voices in the distance. “They’re going to take you away,” a sing-song voice taunted. “She’s already doomed,” another voice wailed. “It’s too late. She’ll become one of them.” “Should’ve finished her off in that closet all those years ago. Now we’re all screwed,” a gruff voice lamented. “Mm,” I whimpered, shaking my head, my jaw quivering. “I really can help you with them.” He leaned forward, lowering his voice, “Tell me what they’re saying, Ever. I know they’re speaking to you. Remember the candy in my office?” “Yes,” I answered softly. “Butter mint. That was my test. It’s only tolerable by Specials. The Naturals, or humans, can’t handle the bitter flavor. I know you can hear the voices. I know I can help you. Tell me, Ever. Tell me what are they saying to you?” “They said I’m doomed. That I’ll become one of them. I don’t even know what that means. I-I can’t do this.” My fingers dug into the palms of my hands as I struggled to find a way out of my despair. “Dr. Brighton, if there’s a compassionate bone in your body, please. Please, kill me or give me the means to do it myself,” I burst out, begging him, tears streaming down my face. “I want to die. I didn’t before. But I do now. Let me go.” I sniffled and wiped at my tears, feeling defeated. I had no idea what a Special or a Natural was. I didn’t even care. All I cared about was getting rid of the dead and their insistent voices. I wanted everything gone. “And therein lies the problem, you poor child,” he leaned back in his chair and rubbed the stubble on his face. “You’re clearly a very gifted girl, possibly the strongest of your kind in years. Tell me, what would death do for you that it’s not doing already? You wish to walk among the dead? You already are. You wish to be dead so you won’t feel? You already are dead inside. Tell me, Ever, because I want to understand where your mind is right now.” “What?” I shook my head, wiping at my eyes. “I-I don’t understand.” “If you only take one thing away from our meeting today, let it be this—You will never die. You could set yourself on fire, take all the pills in your mother’s medicine cabinet, drink every lick of alcohol your rotten father has in his mobile home, and yet, you will live if he comes. I believe that you, my poor child, are meant to exist. Forever.”",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Seven “No one lives forever,” I said softly, narrowing my burning eyes at him. My throat was tight and aching. I was exhausted. And the voices. They were getting louder. “Why would they even want to?” “True,” Dr. Brighton agreed. “And false. Mortals—Naturals—don’t live forever. You, however, are a bit above the cut.” “Dr. Brighton, I don’t mean to be rude, but get to your point. You’re beginning to sound crazier than me, and I’m going to be honest, that’s not something you should strive to be considering you’re sitting in the doctor seat over there. I really just want to go back to my room and hang myself with my bedsheets. You’re holding me up. No pun intended.” “You are a feisty one.” He tilted his chin up in disdain. “You’re special, Ever. A Special, to be more exact. That means you’ve been gifted with a certain amount of abilities—abilities many would run from. You’re not crazy. The voices are real. The shadows are real. The creatures—all real.” “And me in this loony bin?” I bit out, snorting at him. Great! Even my doc was a nut job. “Real,” he smiled again. “Only this isn’t the place for you. It’s more of a halfway house until we get you to where you need to be.” “And where would that be?” I asked dryly, shaking my head as the voices grew louder. “She’d be better off drunk in an alley somewhere than at Dementon.” “That’s where he is. You know what it means,” a voice warbled with worry. “He’s lying, Ever. You are crazy. Insane. This isn’t even real. It’s all an elaborate setup. You’re unconscious in a hospital bed. You were hit by a car. This is part of your coma. Wake up, Ever! WAKE UP!” a voice shouted. “ARGH!” I screamed, leaping to my feet, swinging my arms. Something had hit me hard across my back, making it burn and sting. The pain was agonizing. I continued to swing madly, allowing my anger taking over. The doors to the room burst open and the two large orderlies barged in, took my arms hard, and pulled them behind my back, restraining me. I cried out, not sure which was worse—the pain from the invisible blow or the pain from their massive hands holding me hostage. “Let me go,” I screamed, bucking and fighting as best I could against them. Finally, I managed to break free, and when one of the large men reached for me, I kicked him square in the chest, my kickboxing classes flooding back to me. The man stumbled backward and fell into the wall. The other man advanced on me and lunged. With a punch to the face, I knocked him back. He let out a ferocious growl and grabbed me by the arms. I wrestled and twisted in his grasp, unable to break free. Dr. Brighton jumped to his feet and jabbed me with a needle. I whimpered and gnashed my teeth, as the other orderly recovered and helped restrain me. Dropping my head, I caught him in the arm with my teeth and drew blood. Jerking back, he struck me across the face, causing my body to go limp. Blood pooled in my mouth. My head rung from the blow. And my eyes and senses dulled from whatever had been in the needle. With a whimper, I slumped forward. A blurry dark figure, dressed in black, appeared in front of me. He came forward quickly, and I was released. I fell forward as the orderlies were tossed roughly aside by the figure moving swiftly between them. “Help,” I choked out, my vision darkening as the figure swept forward and scooped me off the floor. I couldn’t make out who or what he was because of a dark hood pulled over his head. “Please. Let me die.” “Where’s the fun in that?” he murmured, his voice distorted as my world spun and darkness descended on me.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Eight I woke up bleary-eyed in that same ugly, mint-colored room sometime before the sun broke out over the horizon. I knew someone had entered the room I was in with Dr. Brighton last night and helped me. But who? And how? He seemed to poof in out of nowhere. My brain throbbed. I was sick of trying to figure everything out. Staggering to my feet, I tore the sheets off my bed. As I knotted them together, I looked around for a suitable place to die from. I was being reckless. I knew it. But I wanted out. Just like my dad said I would. That disembodied voice that told me this it was all a dream, and I was still in a coma, whispered in my mind. Only one way to find out. With a boost, I scrambled onto the dresser. I reached up and tapped the ceiling tiles. They were the loose kind. Perfect. Pushing a few aside, I looked up at the steel rafters. In one toss, I’d slung my roped sheets over the rafters and knotted them quickly. I stared at the makeshift noose I’d made and licked my lips. My heart hammered wildly in my chest. Third time’s a charm. I stuck my head through the noose and closed my eyes With a deep exhale, I poised myself to jump. My knees bent. My mind racing. An eerie calm settled over me. The voices whispered from the depths of wherever they existed. “Do it quick. Don’t hesitate,” one encouraged. “I remember when I killed myself. It was glorious.” “You won’t die,” one taunted. “Jump, Ever. He’s coming for you. Then you won’t be able to come see the truth. Quick, JUMP.” “JUMP! JUMP! JUMP,” a chorus of voices picked up the chant. The voices became excited. It was contagious. The truth? I wanted that. “If you’re listening, tell me what you’re talking about. What truth is out there?” “We’re listening. Always listening,” the voice encouraging me to jump answered. “The truth about you. What you are. We can help. You just have to come here.” “He stopped you last time. Be quick about it, girl. Come see the truth,” a voice begged. “Become what you fear.” “It’ll change everything, Ever. Are you prepared for it?” “Yes,” I whispered, closing my eyes in resignation. I made the jump with tears streaming down my face. It didn’t even matter to me if the voices were right or not. Real or not. They could be, or they could just be a manifestation of my brain injury. I didn’t care. I wanted the truth, whatever deep, dark, final truth that was. I’d die for it.",

      "title": "Chapter Twenty-Nine",
      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Nine The sheets caught, pulling me roughly to a stop before I hit the floor. I dangled above it, not struggling as my vision began to pop, dotted with sparkles. My body begged for its next breath, but my soul demanded to be set free. Through my sparkly vison, I saw a face peering in through the window on my door. “Ever! Everly,” Dr. Brighton shouted through the locked door, his face stricken with panic. “Open the damn door!” “I-I can’t,” someone shouted. “It won’t open.” Dr. Brighton shouted frantically, hammering his fists on the heavy, metal door. “Where the hell is he,” Dr. Brighton hollered. “This can’t be happening.” I watched as beings slithered from beneath my bed and barred the door by pressing their ghostly forms against it. One turned and looked at me. A man whose face was covered in blood and twisted in pain. “Go, Ever! Let go,” he urged. The last breath in my lungs was finally extinguished like a flame, and I let go. Death wasn’t what I expected. The last time I’d almost died, I hadn’t seen anything. At least nothing I remembered. I was disappointed to see that there wasn’t a brilliant white light at the end of a tunnel. No family members greeted me. Instead, it was just me standing in a dull, gray, foggy world still wearing my ugly hospital gown. Frantically, I looked around. Hissing and scurrying sounds travelled through the dense fog. I yelped as something skittered past and grabbed at my leg. With a kick, I sent it away. Stumbling, I rushed blindly through the fog. “Where are you going?” a male voice called out. He didn’t sound menacing. I halted and looked around trying to find the source of the voice. A moment later, a young man wearing jeans and a blue t-shirt came into view. His russet-colored hair was windswept, and his green eyes were bright, alive. “W-who are you?” I asked, my voice trembling as I looked around uncertainly. “A messenger,” he answered, stopping in front of me, keeping his hands in his pockets. “Did I succeed? Am I dead?” “Yes… And no.” He shrugged and gave me a small smile. “It’s complicated.” “Either I’m dead or I’m not. It’s not all that complicated,” I snapped at him. Seemed death hadn’t made me any less irritable. “Where am I?” “Fine. You’re dead enough to be here—the Veil—and alive enough to continue to exist. Your body is hurt, but it lives. For how long? I don’t know. It depends, but I daresay it won’t matter if he gets here in time. And the Veil, the place between life and death—you’re the only one of your kind able to walk here. That makes you very special, Ever. Your body is still alive, your soul is just on hiatus until he gets to you.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” I demanded, wondering where were all the answers I was promised. “It means, that he hasn’t come for you yet. But, I don’t doubt he will. We’re holding him off as best we can. If we can hold him off long enough, maybe he won’t be able to get you back. We’ve never done it before, so we don’t know,” he shrugged again. “It’s a bit of a new adventure for all of us.” “Who is he? And who is us?” “You know who he is,” he scoffed. My mind raced. The light bulb finally came on. “Shadow? You mean Shadow when you’re talking about him?” He nodded and continued, “He is a powerful being. More powerful than you can imagine. He has several roles. Primarily, he deals in redemption and punishment.” “Like a judge?” “You could say that, but on a supernatural level. But the biggest thing you need to know is that he has the power to take your death from you. Only yours.” “Why would he do that? Not that I even understand what THAT is.” Frustration was rising rapidly. I was supposed to get answers, not more questions. “It may not seem like it, but it’s a huge honor. He chose you. He cares about you. He has spent his entire life watching over you, trying to keep you safe. And he would stop at nothing to do that, even Marking you. Even taking your death to experience as his own so that you can live.” So many questions rolled in my mind, each fighting for supremacy. Who is this guy talking to me? What am I? What did he mean by Marking me? Is that what that bruise is? Finally, a question won in my mind. “Why are all the voices so concerned about me living or dying?” “Because. You’re meant to tip the tide of war, Ever. The war within the Special world. And unfortunately, the poor fool protecting you has been given misinformation. That’s the problem with taking orders and being blinded though, isn’t it? Once the Order realized what he might be many years ago, he was taken under their wing and honed to be what he’s become—dangerous.” “I don’t understand. Who’s the Order?” I shook my head at him frowning. None of what was happening made a lick of sense to me. “There are so many things I need to explain to you. But I would need hours to make you understand. And we don’t have hours. When he reaches you, he’ll lift the Veil and pull you back. So, this is what matters. You’re a special girl, Ever.” He smiled easily at me. “Unfortunately, you’re dangerous because of it.” Confusion crossed my face. I was dangerous? I only ever hurt myself or defended myself. Never anyone else for no reason. He rushed to explain, “You see, the world you live in isn’t only what you think it is. There are others like you with gifts. There’s a special place for them. A place to get away. They go there to harness their abilities so that they can function in the “real world” should they choose to. If they decide to stay in Xanan or any of their home realms, they may—” “This isn’t making any sense—” “Just listen. We’re running out of time,” the man said, his voice becoming urgent. Apprehension marred his features as a loud crash sounded from somewhere behind us. “He’s strong.” I looked through the fog to where the crash came from. “Ever, listen,” the man said quickly, “he doesn’t know that what he’s doing is wrong. There’s a bigger picture here that he doesn’t see or doesn’t know about. He thinks he’s helping, but he isn’t. If you go back, it’s your job to save us.” “What?” “The dead, the Specials, the Naturals, even him—we’re all in danger. Something is happening to us—the dead, and even to the Specials. There’s a man, a Special, who wants power, Ever. He gets it from us. He’s taking us and turning us into something twisted and vile. You have to fight him.” “I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention, but I’m barely functioning. I can’t fight anything, not even myself. I can’t help you. I can’t even help myself.” “You have to. Innocents are being harmed. Life is being taken. He doesn’t want you to live if you don’t join his insane crusade to take over. You’re a threat to him. You’re a threat to all of us.” “How am I a threat? I am locked up in a padded room, where I keep trying to figure out a way to leave this world. “You make Shadow stronger, Ever. And he follows orders blindly because he’s been tricked into thinking he’s saving you. He doesn’t know the one giving the orders is also the one sending the dead after you. Don’t join him. Play the game as long as you have to. When you get a chance to break free, do it. The fate of all of us, falls on you. We fear what the two of you together are capable of. Everyone’s in jeopardy. I’d keep you safe and dead here if I could.” “This isn’t making any sense,” I shouted for what felt like the hundredth time as the wails of pain echoed around us. “He’s here,” the man murmured. “He’s going to take you.” “Who’s here? What’s your name?” I asked frantically, the shouts grew louder. “My name is Marek. Ever, listen. Everything you see and hear is real. You aren’t crazy. You’re a Special. Your ability is veil walking and ghost whispering. So far. More will manifest.” I opened my mouth to ask more questions about these abilities and what other freakish things might develop, but a swift headshake from him stopped me. “They’ll be taking you to Dementon, something we expected when you came here. You’ll hone your skills and abilities there like the others. Like you would if you could go to Xanan. But you’re not like them. You’re so much more. Shadow will show you, but be careful. He knows not what he does. He’s more lost than the souls he’s taking. But he’ll keep you safe from those who wish to harm you. I have faith that you will not join his quest, and you’ll realize what you need to do in order to save all those involved. But beware, if you are not with him, you are apart from him.…And that makes you an enemy to the crusade they’re on. We can’t change what you’re meant to be.” “And what is that?” I asked, trying to absorb everything he was saying to me. “We don’t know. That’s why we’re so afraid,” Marek whispered, swallowing hard. “Just stay who you are. Trust your heart. Your gut. I believe you’ll make the right choices. You have enemies all over. The dead. The living. Specials. The creatures from the void. We’re all separated by fear.” There was a tremendous tugging inside of me, and I fell to my knees before him. “W-what’s happening?” I asked, staring fearfully at my hands as they began to flicker, becoming transparent. “He broke through. He’s bringing you back before your heart completely stops. He’ll take your injuries as his own, again, and regenerate. He gives you his strength. It’s part of who—and what—he is. Please, Ever, try to remember what I’ve told you. I don’t know that you’ll retain this information. I pray that you do.” “Marek!” I screamed, as pain seared my body. Tiny flickers of blue electricity crackled through my transparent skin. “Be brave,” Marek shouted desperately. Another tug. I clawed uselessly at the air around me as some invisible force started pulling me back in the direction I’d come from. My body felt heavy. “Ever! Come on! Don’t leave me,” pleaded a ragged, desperate, distorted voice in the distance. The veil closed, and I slammed back in place. The experience was jarring. Something was wrapped around me. Holding me. It was nice. I had the feeling of being lifted, then laid flat. I opened my eyes. Filling my field of vision was darkness. After a few blinks, the darkness began to resolve and shift. My eyes focused on mesmerizing red orbs floating a few inches from my face. It was him. He came. “Why?” he cried in an anguished voice. A shock of white flashed through his body. I could almost make out features. But the flash was so quick, I might have imagined it. I opened my mouth to speak. I needed to answer him. He deserved an answer. But I was afraid he’d be disappointed in me. His hold on me was loosening. Before he let go of me, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to my lips. It was warmer than I expected. I reached a hand up to cradle his cheek. He sighed against my mouth and whispered, “Everly,” then he faded away. My hand clutched at the empty air. The loss of him was crushing. I closed my eyes and surrendered to the darkness as a tear leaked out.",

Why does this hurt so much?” “Well,” Dr. Brighton answered curtly, “you hung yourself. You decided to kill yourself in your bedroom yesterday before morning meds were passed out. Congratulations. You almost succeeded there for a minute.” “Where’s my gold star?” I muttered, adjusting myself to sit up. I winced at how sore my body was. “Or my participation trophy.” “Everly, this isn’t a joke,” Dr. Brighton reprimanded sternly, his gray eyes narrowed at me and his lip curled. “Whatever. Did you tell my mom?” He didn’t need to say anything for me to know the answer. “Really? You have me in this facility, I nearly kill myself, and you don’t tell my mom?” “Your mother has been through enough, wouldn’t you agree?” Dr. Brighton replied icily. “Do you really want me to add to it?” “No,” I muttered, rubbing my eyes. “So,” Dr. Brighton said after a moment of silence, “did you find the answers you were looking for?” “Like that I should use a rope instead of a bed sheet next time?” “You know what I mean, Ever,” he said sternly. “You may have had this strange urge to end it all, but you were also looking for confirmation. Did you find it?” I bit my lip and looked at him, flashes of my conversation with the man surfaced. I couldn’t recall it all. I frowned as I dug deeper into my mind. But nothing significant came back to me, with the exception of him telling me I was going to a place called Dementon. And him assuring me that everything I was experiencing was real. Oh, and Shadow could pretty much take my pain away and die for me should my heart stop so that I wouldn’t die. Figured. I couldn’t escape if I wanted to. A niggling of fear and doubt crept in at my hazy memory of Shadow bringing me back from wherever I was. My heart ached at the despair that was so visible on a featureless being. I knew that I had somehow let him down. What if he never came back? What if there was a limit to how many times he could save me from myself? Or worse, what if he was fed up with me? What if he no longer wanted to be my get out of death free card? Yes, I’d gotten answers and thousands more questions. “I guess,” I mumbled. “Are you done being reckless?” Dr. Brighton demanded. “Probably not,” I said with a shrug. “But as far as trying to kill myself, it doesn’t make much sense to keep doing something that I can’t succeed at. Isn’t that what insanity is? Doing the same thing over and over yet expecting different results?” “According to some,” he answered, his lip still curled with disdain. “When am I leaving?” “And where do you think you’ll be going?” Dr. Brighton leveled his steely gaze on me. “Dementon.” I stated matter-of-factly. “I know that’s where I’m supposed to go. I don’t get a choice in it, do I?” “It may seem harsh that you don’t get to choose where you go,” he replied, not bothering to play dumb with me. “But to be fair, Dementon is the top facility in our country for Specials. We accept many into the program. So, yes, you’ll be going there. I expect your mother wants you to have a top-notch education, and Dementon will afford you that in addition to being a place where you can learn about yourself and how to hone and control your abilities.” “And have you told my mother that I’m some kind of immortal, ghost-chatting freak?” I asked sweetly, my voice still raw. “No.” He gave me a small smirk. “All your mother knows is that you’re not well, and Dementon will help you. It’s disguised as a place for troubled youth. She’s already signed the paperwork to send you there.” “Nice,” I muttered. “How’s she going to pay for it? It’s not like we’re rolling in fat stacks of cash—” “Don’t worry, Ever. You’re special to Dementon. Your enrollment is on the house.” “I must be pretty amazing to get a free ride to this prestigious freak show of a school.” I rolled my eyes. “How many other freaks like me are going to be there? And how the hell am I going to be OK around others when all I hear are voices and see ghosts?” “You are amazing, Ever. More than you realize. You’d do well to remember that you’re also a ‘freak’, so please, use the term sparingly around your peers. There will be many. It seems this happened at the perfect time. Dementon’s classes for the year are beginning this week. And you’ll be fine there because, lucky for you, the ghosts can’t, or won’t, penetrate the walls of Dementon. Nothing unwanted can enter our walls.” “Wait. What? Why can’t, I mean won’t, they?” I narrowed my eyes at him as I sat forward, eager to hear what he had to say. “It seems a dangerous folly to go a place loaded with Specials. A place where the Conexus has its most elite soldiers guarding it, don’t you think?” he asked, smiling smugly at me. “What’s a Conexus?” I frowned. “Not what, who, but that’s information for another time. Right now, we have more important things to tend to. For instance, your medication. I’ll be halting them immediately. I suspect the next week will be a rough one for you. Just know I’ll do all I can to try to control it for you. And you’ll be on watch every second of every day until you leave here and are safely tucked away at Dementon.” “You can’t just take them away! I need them! They dull the voices—” “You won’t be needing them on the Dementon grounds,” Dr. Brighton stated firmly. “I already told you, none of that will bother you there. You have my word.” “How can I trust you? You’re moonlighting as a doctor when you’re really Professor X. Plus, if you knew I was a Special, why didn’t you help me sooner? Why did you let me suffer?” “We find our strengths in our suffering. Consider it your first test. It will be one of many.” He smiled serenely and got to his feet. “This new world is a strange one. It’s different. You’ll see things that will blow your mind. You’ll learn things you never thought possible. And you’ll become something extraordinary, if you take the right paths. You’re a lucky one—your path is already set for you. You’re meant for more than the others at Dementon. I hope you’re ready for it. We’re counting on you.”",

      "title": "Chapter Thirty-One",
      "content": "Chapter Thirty-One A week later, I was standing in the entranceway to Rolling Thunder Psychiatric Facility, the place where I’d been locked up. The past week had been a nightmare, truly. The dead plagued me. They never came into my room, but they whispered through the walls. The sounds of their distressed voices sent shivers down my spine. Ever since my hanging stunt, they had backed off a bit. I was grateful, yet still terrified. I was pulled from my thoughts of despair as my mom and Nina entered through the heavy oak front doors. “Sweetie,” my mom greeted me, rushing up with tears in her eyes. She flung her arms around me and held me tightly as we rocked back and forth. “How are you?” “Better,” I lied. I’d spent the night cowering in the corner of my bedroom while the shouts from other patients echoed around me. Sometimes I couldn’t tell if the shouts were from other patients or the dead, which made it more unnerving. “You look exhausted,” she continued, pulling away and staring at me. “But still so beautiful. Dr. Brighton says you’re getting better too and that Dementon will be a good place for you. You know I wouldn’t send you there if I had another choice—” “Mom, I know. It’s OK. I-I need to go. I need the help they offer.” I gave her a forced smile. Truth be told, I was eager to check the place out. Not because I wanted the help, but because I was promised the voices and sightings would end. That was enough for me to go. I wasn’t happy that I had to be somewhere else to do it, but I’d deal with it. And if I got answers as well, then I guess it wasn’t a total loss. “Well, I don’t want you to hate me for it. I’ve been worried sick.” “I don’t hate you, Mom,” I scoffed. She was quiet for a minute, her eyes sad as she gazed at me. “I love you.” “I love you too, mija.” She sniffled and wiped at her eyes before she seemed to collect herself. “I need to check in.” She cleared her throat, giving my hand a squeeze. “I’ll be right back, OK?” I gave her a reassuring nod and a weak smile. She accepted it and walked to the front desk to check in. “Hey,” Nina said softly, giving me a small smile. “Hey,” I answered awkwardly, shoving my fidgeting hands in my pockets. The last time we’d seen each other I’d been climbing into the car with Dylan. I hadn’t spoken to her since. I figured she was mad at me. And disappointed. Hell, I was disappointed with me. I’d been a pain. “I’ve been worried about you. Everyone has been. Even Dylan,” Nina said, giving me a tight hug. “Really? Dylan?” I frowned. I figured he’d be terrified considering what Shadow had done to him that night. “Yeah,” Nina nodded, pulling away from me. “He said you ran out of his house after freaking out. He said you two got into a fight and you left. He’s the one who called me to see if I’d seen you. But then I heard a-about Gleeman’s…” She stopped talking and bit her bottom lip. “Are you going to be OK, Ever? I’m really worried.” “Nina, I’m going to be better than OK. I already feel myself getting there.” I gave her my best reassuring smile. It was a damn lie. I’d basically died a week ago. Things were only getting weirder. “OK,” she said through a watery smile, her lips trembling as she tried not to let her tears fall. “And Dylan—he didn’t say anything… weird? About that night?” I asked hesitantly. “He seemed OK?” “He seemed concerned about you. He just said you two were making out and that he wanted to go further but you didn’t. Then he said you guys got into an argument and you left. He seems OK other than he’s worried about you.” She sniffled and wiped at her eyes quickly. “Weird,” I muttered, scratching my head. Maybe I’d actually hallucinated the whole thing. Deep down, I knew something else was at play. Something I wanted to figure out. I couldn’t keep trying to talk myself into thinking everything was a delusion. Dr. Brighton told me it was real. I knew it was, too. It was just a hard pill to swallow. “How has Dr. Brighton been for you here?” my mom asked coming back to my side after checking in. “It seems like a really great place.” She rubbed her hands together and looked around. “It’s-it’s been bearable,” I answered, grimacing a little as I tried to block out the memories of the screams still echoing in my head. Every place I went was like that, though. I couldn’t escape them. “I’m so sorry, baby,” she sniffled, hugging me again. “Once we get things sorted, you can come back home. It won’t be permanent.” “OK,” I said tightly. I was fairly certain it wasn’t going to get better. I liked her optimism, though. “I brought your favorite outfits, and I even picked out a few new things for you. Dr. Brighton says you won’t be able to leave or have visitors for the first few weeks as you get situated there. And you don’t get your phone. He said there’s a place to make calls, though.” “Great,” I said through gritted teeth. “I put some stationary in your suitcase so you can write us,” Nina added brightly. “And a journal in case you want to write things down to clear your head or vent. Oh, and I put in a party outfit, a few dresses, and your favorite heels.” She ticked off items on her fingers. “And your makeup and some pictures, so you don’t forget about us!” “Thanks,” I smiled appreciatively at her. “I put Mr. Boggles in,” my mom added. “Elena, hello,” Dr. Brighton emerged from somewhere and shook my mom’s hand halting our conversation. “How are you?” “Great, given the circumstances,” she smiled sadly at him. “I brought Ever some of her stuff.” “Ah, wonderful!” He returned her smile with one of his own. “She won’t need much. She’ll be given a uniform once she’s at Dementon.” “Oh,” my mom seemed surprised at the news. “That’s a… really good thing.” “It is,” Dr. Brighton nodded, still smiling. “In fact, her ride should be arriving shortly to take her there.” “Will you be accompanying her?” “I won’t, but rest assured, she’ll be in perfectly good hands. Dementon likes to send its best to retrieve the new arrivals.” “So-so other students will be caring for her?” My mom didn’t look like she liked the idea of other “delinquents” taking her crazy daughter to her new school. “They’re a bit more than just students. I assure you. She’ll be in very capable hands. I wouldn’t allow her to go, if I wasn’t certain she’d be safe.” “I just worry—” “I’d expect nothing less,” Dr. Brighton nodded solemnly. “It’s what makes you such a good parent. I’ll be in contact with you often. You have my number, and you’ll have the number to reach Ever should you need to. I promise all will be well.” “OK,” my mom breathed out nervously. “Hey,” Nina motioned for me to step away with her for a second. I glanced at my mom. She was still voicing her concerns to Dr. Brighton. I moved over to the large picture windows with Nina. “What’s up?” “Be safe, Ever. I’ve been worried sick about you. After you left with Dylan that night I thought I was going to die. Did something else happen with you two? I mean, you tried drinking yourself to death and Dylan wasn’t even with you.” “Nothing happened,” I mumbled. “He already told you. We were messing around, I freaked out and left. We were close to sealing the deal, you know? Then, I don’t know… Things got weird. I-I had to go. End of story.” I figured it was important to stick to whatever story he’d told her. No sense in freaking her out with my version of the events, since they wouldn’t match Dylan’s, and I’d just come off looking crazier. “He’s been worried about you, Ever,” she squeezed my hand. “I’m not a fan of him, but he wanted me to tell you something. He said he’s sorry and hopes that you two can talk once you’re feeling better.” She shrugged before continuing, “I don’t know. He’s back with Casey, but you know how he is.” “I sure do,” I snorted, rolling my eyes. Well, so much for him being traumatized. “Ever,” Dr. Brighton called out, “it’s time to go. Your ride is here.” I looked out the window as a sleek black SUV with tinted windows pulled up under the awning. I swallowed hard and looked at Nina. This was it. No turning back.",

      "title": "Chapter Thirty-Two",
      "content": "Chapter Thirty-Two My mouth opened in an O of surprised as the guy from the diner walked into the entryway, looking just as breathtaking as he’d been the last time I’d seen him. “Ever, I’d like you to meet Eric Craft and Damien Wick. They’re some of our elite students,” Dr. Brighton nodded to the two large, muscle-bound guys that stopped and stood beside him. They both stood well over six feet tall and were dressed in all black. It was clear they were in their school uniforms. Very slick uniforms. Black blazers, black shirts, black ties, black pants, black shoes. I bet even their socks were black. A red shield with a golden D was embellished on the left breasts of their jackets. “Hello, Ever,” Eric greeted me with a curt nod as if we’d never met before. He was a beautiful creature. His shock of blond hair fell past his ears in a mess, and his blue eyes shone brightly. The guy was a heartbreaker, that was for sure. “We’ve heard a lot about you.” I gave him a shaky smile, still trying to figure out what was going on. Why had he been at the diner that day? This whole thing screamed “beware!” in bright neon lights. “Ever, I’m Damien,” the other guy said, holding his hand out for me to shake. His voice was deep and stern making me think he’d probably slap the sarcasm right out of me if I stepped too far out of line. He was beautiful too. Damien’s hair was a deep shade of brown, and his eyes matched. Both men looked like they could take on an entire football team on their own. “Wow, lucky,” Nina whispered from beside me. Eric’s lips quirked up into a small smile, but it happened so fast I wasn’t even sure if I’d really seen it. I shook Damien’s hand, and he winced before pulling it away quickly. As he flexed his fingers, he cast a quick look to Eric who wore a tight smile on his face. They seemed to be communicating with one another without speaking. Were they telepaths or something? I didn’t even know what sorts of Specials attended Dementon. I’d been so absorbed in my own problems that I’d failed to inquire what I was getting into. “Do you have all your stuff?” Eric asked. “Um, yeah. It’s right here,” I nodded to the stack of suitcases and backpack. Damien grabbed two of the suitcases and took them outside while Eric grabbed the remaining ones. “Backpack?” he nodded to my bag slung over my shoulder. “Um, I can carry it.” “Backpack,” he said it this time as a demand. I hastily took it off and handed it to him. He went out the doors, and we followed. “Ever, Eric and Damien are some of the best Dementon has to offer. You’ll learn a lot with them. Listen to what they say and don’t try to do anything… funny. I assure you it would be unwise.” Dr. Brighton gave me a look that said he meant business. If these guys’ sheer sizes didn’t make them intimidating, then the fact that they had some weird hidden powers made them terrifying. And I’d already seen some of what Eric was capable of. “Dr. Brighton?” I asked softly, biting my bottom lip as I peered past him, keeping my eyes on the guys as they loaded my luggage into the back of the SUV. “Yes?” he leaned down to hear me. “I… When will I see you? What-what if I need help?” “I suggest you make some friends, Ever. You’re going to need to pick a faction eventually. Eric and Damien will explain it to you on the way. These guys are the exception to all the rules, so trust them. Even if their requests seem strange. They know what they’re doing. I’ll be around. It’s my job, after all.” I nodded, a frown carved deeply onto my face as I cast a look to where Damien and Eric now stood, both gazing intently at me. “Bye, sweetie,” my mom pulled me out of my thoughts and brought me in for a tight hug. “I love you so much. Please, call me if you need anything.” “I will, Mom,” I sniffled. “I love you, too.” After a lengthy embrace, I turned to Nina and hugged her. “Be good. Come back to us better, Ever. We have prom in the spring, and we have to go shopping.” She hugged me tightly. “I will.” I pulled away and wiped at my eyes. “Come on.” Eric cleared his throat, opening the door to the SUV. Damien was already in the driver’s seat. I cast one last look at my mom, Nina, and Dr. Brighton before clambering onto the cool leather seat in the back of the SUV. Eric climbed in behind me and closed the door. “Ready?” he asked, fixing his blue eyes on me. “If I have to be,” I murmured. “You do. Damien, we’re ready. Take us home.” I swallowed hard as the crunch of gravel echoed in my ears, signaling our departure. I turned to look out the back window as my mom and Nina waved at me. I didn’t turn to face forward until they were tiny dark specks in the distance. “Scared?” Eric’s strong voice cut through my morose thoughts. “Should I be?” I asked, meeting his blue eyes. “Only if you know what’s good for you,” he replied smoothly, settling back into his leather seat. Scared wasn’t a word I’d use to describe my feelings. I was flat-out terrified. To Be Continued. . .",

      "title": "Broken Shadow\n            Book 2 in the Everlasting Chronicles",
      "content": "Broken Shadow Book 2 in the Everlasting Chronicles You heard Ever's story in Dead Silence, but you don't have the whole story. Now it's time for mine. She knows me but not really. She doesn't know my name. I've done a lot for her over the years to keep her safe. But to her I'm just Shadow. Excerpt from Broken Shadow (subject to edits and changes) My mom said that we shouldn’t speak ill of the dead. That they were gone, leaving behind only their memories. And they had no way to defend themselves against harsh words or brutal truths. She believed that what was done was done, and we should let them rest in peace. But Mom didn’t know what I knew. Years ago, I flung her beliefs and expectations on that topic out of the highest window from the tallest tower in the known world. The moment the beautiful, green-eyed, raven haired, ivory skin angel entered my life, I learned the truth about the dead. I didn’t know it at the time, didn’t know that she was going to change my world forever. How could I? I was four and she was only three. One moment I was in my room, lying in bed after Mom had tucked me in, and the next there was a terrible pull in my gut, taking me from my room and leaving me frightened in a dark place where I could hear growls, snarls, and voices hissing through the surrounding blackness. It was my time in shadow. My first time through the darkest places of the Veil. I cried. I remember that. I didn’t know where I was or why I was there. Voices were all around me. Claws scraped my skin. I ran. I ran as far and as fast as my little legs could take me. Suddenly, there was a light. A beautiful, promising light. A bright rectangle through an opening. As I ran closer, I could make out the form of a girl sitting on the floor of a room. Her blanket was pulled tightly around her as she rocked back and forth. I burst into the light. The claws scratched my legs, arms, and neck. I tumbled into the girl’s bedroom through her closet door. She didn’t pay any attention to me. Confused about why she wasn’t seeing me, I looked down and found that I was as black as night, having turned into a shadow myself. My heart hammered like mad in my chest. While I was afraid for myself, I was even more afraid for her. She continued to rock, her green eyes wavering as she stared at her bedroom door. Still frightened about what had just happened to me, and how I’d gotten there, I backed into the corner to watch her. I wanted to talk to her, but couldn’t. I didn’t have the words to say. Besides she already looked frightened enough. Yelling came from somewhere else in the house. The screams got louder. She rocked faster as heavy footsteps thudded down the hall. “You will not touch her,” a woman screamed. “Por favor!” My fear for the girl grew as the door to her room slammed open. She jumped, her eyes wider as the menacing form of a large, hulking man with wild green eyes entered her room. “Everly,” he growled, stomping into the room. She scooted away from him, her small hands still clutching her blanket. “They want you.” “Don’t touch her,” the woman screamed, rushing into the room. She looked like the girl—long dark hair and a pretty face. The man reached out and struck the woman across the face, sending her flying into the wall where she banged her head and slid down, her body limp. “Mommy,” little Everly cried out, scrambling to her feet. The little girl tried to run behind her bed, but the man was fast and caught her by her hair, yanking her back to him. He gripped her tightly, pressing his hand over her mouth as she kicked and screamed. “It has started! They want you! You are a curse that they can have!” He pulled her small struggling body to the closet I’d just escaped from and opened the door. The stench of death permeated the room. The wails from the monsters inside caused me to cover my ears. I watched in horror as many sets of gnarled, dead hands reached out. The girl was thrust forward and captured by the creatures in her closet. “Daddy! Daddy! Please,” she screamed as they tore at her, pulling her into the darkness. He only stood here watching, a grim expression on his face as she was taken away. Her father had let her go. I watched as he went to his wife who lay unconscious on the floor. He scooped her limp body up easily and left the room. I stared at the closed closet door, my mind made up before I even contemplated it. I drew in a deep breath as I approached the door. I was going to save her. It was a decision easily made. I was put there for a reason. She was my reason, and I’d die before I let something happen to her.",

They tolerated me “in my office”, which is just me sitting in my bedroom with my noise canceling headset on. I’d also like to thank my mom, sister, and Melinda. You guys have been a big help and are probably heads of my fan club! My grandma (God rest her soul) should be mentioned. Without her belief in me, and my strange ideas, I may have just kept all my stories bottled up inside. I want to thank my grandpa. Every moment of writer’s block was worth it to see the smile on his face as I hand him one of my books. My dad deserves a shout out. He tolerates my weirdness with a laugh, snort, or eye roll. Good on him! Authors S.R. Mitchell, Kelly Moore, K.B. Andrews, C.M. Lally—you ladies rock! Your positivity, chats, and random hot guy images have gotten me through many days. It’s always Wednesday, K.B. Andrews! Charlotte, my editor, has been a godsend. Truly. She’s a word wizard and all-around goddess. Thank you to my beta/ARC readers and members of my street team! Your feedback and excitement propels me to keep writing! A big thank you to you. Yes, you. The person reading this right now. Thank you for taking the time to read Ever’s story. Thank you for the opportunity to pull you into my vortex of oddness. I sincerely hope that I’ve been able to take you into a world filled with adventure and have been able to entertain you for at least two consecutive hours. If I haven’t, message me immediately with your concerns. I’ve been known to send digital chocolate chip cookies! And finally, I want to thank the shadows. The ghosts. The things that go bump in the night. Without all their efforts, I’d have never been able to find the courage within me to carry on through tough times. They made me stronger. Wiser. And super kick-ass. Did I not tell you that Dead Silence was based on a true story?! Oops. I must’ve forgot. . .",

The coldness of Northern Michigan’s spring air caused my breath to visibly puff from my mouth as I hurried along the darkening street. A familiar loud truck rumbled past with its bass booming loudly. Ugh, I groaned inwardly as the angry, red brake lights came on before the truck went in reverse. This was the last thing I felt like dealing with, but I was always a trooper when it came to dealing with unwanted situations. I’d managed to make it through my alcoholic father’s harsh words and heavy hits—watching as he’d terrorized my mother, then running and screaming as he’d terrorized me when his bottle had run dry. I’d managed to make it through my parents’ nasty divorce. I’d even managed to make it through my childhood, which was littered with a creepy, red-eyed shadow person, strange creatures that were born from the dark corners of my dimly-lit bedroom, and the disembodied voices that called out to me. If I could make it through all that, I could certainly make it through a couple of teenage jockstraps yowling at me from the truck purchased by their overindulgent parents. “Ever,” Dylan Reynolds called from the passenger seat as his friends guffawed loudly from their various perches within the vehicle. Ducking my head lower, I pretended I couldn’t hear them. They creeped along beside me, laughing. “Oye, mamacita, qué buena estás? I know your sexy, half-Mexican ass can hear me,” Dylan shouted again as I scowled behind my curtain of dark hair. “Come on, Ever!” Though I kept my head down the entire time they rolled next to me, my senses were attuned to the truck and its occupants. My heart lurched when the tires stopped crunching on the edge of the pavement. Dylan jumped out and stepped in front of me. I sidestepped around him and kept walking, but being the annoying little shit that he was, he got back in front of me and started walking backward. “Ever, seriously. Are you still pissed over Brit’s party the other night?” “Dylan, I know it may be hard for you to understand, but vete a la chingada,” I snapped at him. “You’re right, Ever. I don’t understand what that means. But it sounds good coming from your mouth, whatever it is,” he grinned at me. His hazel eyes sparkled with amusement, and his sandy brown hair fell across his forehead. What did I ever see in him? I spent five months as his girlfriend—five months listening to him mess with people and suspecting he was cheating on me with Britney Stewart. I was over it now, though. “You haven’t been answering my calls or texts. What gives, babe?” “Gee, let me think,” I snapped, stopping suddenly and glaring at him. “I found you sucking face with Britney in the bathroom at her party! Why would I give you the time of day?” “Babe, that was nothing. I was drunk. I thought she was you!” “Ugh, get the hell out of my face, Dylan. You thought that blonde-haired, blue-eyed bimbo was me? Do you think I’m stupid and desperate?” I was losing my patience with him. I’d been avoiding him like the plague since the party last weekend. As far as I was concerned, he could go back to making out with her. “I’m sorry. I was wasted… Come on, Ever. You know, you’re my girl!” he sighed, stopping me by putting his hands on my shoulders. His fingers pushed my dark hair away from my face. “You’re just upset. Give me another chance, babe. I swear it won’t happen again. Just get in the truck with us. We’ll give you a ride home.” “Dylan,” I said sweetly, batting my long lashes at him. “Yeah, babe?” “I’d rather shit in my hands and clap than get in that truck with you jackasses.” “Christ, Ever.” Dylan’s face soured. “You know, maybe you could keep a guy around if you learned to talk like a lady. It’s a huge turnoff when you say shit like that.” “Good. My work here is done.” I stepped around him and continued down the sidewalk. “Whatever!” Dylan shouted at my back. “You know where to find me when you’re ready to come to your senses.” I flipped him off and kept walking, the wind at my back pushing me forward.",

      "content": "Chapter Two “I’m home!” I called out, opening the door to my house and walking inside. “Ever, I wasn’t expecting you yet.” My mother poked her head around the corner of the kitchen and smiled at me, her dark eyes lighting up. “I thought you had kickboxing tonight. What happened?” “Canceled,” I sighed, coming into the kitchen and breathing in the delicious smell of my mother’s homemade tacos. I’d always had an active life. When I was younger, Mom had enrolled me in gymnastics. I think it was just a way for us to escape our home while my dad was around. Since he decided to walk out on us a few years ago—or rather, was forced out on us by a police order—it had just been the two of us. Not that I missed him. He’d done us a favor by leaving. At least now, we had a home we didn’t have to worry about being evicted from just because he spent the rent money on booze. I’d joined martial arts and kickboxing as a way to protect myself from others ever trying to hurt me or my mom. I’d even taken a self-defense course with her. I think she had the same ideas in her mind about protecting us as I did. In recent months, Dylan and I started training together. Most of our sessions started with sparring and ended with kissing. That was over now, though. “How was work today?” “Surprisingly quiet for the ER,” she responded. I didn’t know how she juggled the stress of nursing and being such a wonderful mother, but I was grateful. Gazing at Mom, I had a glimpse at what I’d look like in twenty some years, except for my green eyes and a missing couple of inches in height. My grandmother always said that what I lacked in height, I made up for in spunk. “I guess that works out.” My mom grinned at me. “I was going to rent a movie on T.V. later, pop some popcorn, and relax. Now, we can do it together.” “Sounds great.” I smiled back at her. I was close to my mother. We’d been through hell together, and that’s the kind of bond you can’t break even through teenage angst and young raging hormones. As we ate our tacos, my mom looked at me thoughtfully before she spoke, “How are you and Dylan doing?” “Don’t get me started,” I grumbled, sinking my teeth into my third taco. “That bad, huh?” She gave me a sympathetic look. “Worse,” I sighed after swallowing. “I caught him with Britney Stewart in her bathroom last weekend. I broke up with him.” “What a creep.” She shook her head, her anger at him evident on her face. My mother never liked Dylan, although she wasn’t mean to him. “I’m glad you kicked him to the curb. The kid is skating around on his dad’s dime. I imagine he’ll be off to some ivy league college and cheating on his trophy wife in no time at all.” “Probably,” I agreed, finishing my dinner. “It’s… whatever. I figured he was messing around with her anyway.” “Well, it still hurts to be betrayed like that.” She frowned, and I knew she was thinking about my dad. She’d caught him many times with other women. I think she spent most of their marriage either cowering from him or crying because of him. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, right?” I replied, plastering a weak smile on my face. That seemed to be our motto. “Right.” She returned my smile with her own, but it didn’t quite reach her dark eyes. It might not kill you, but it could sure change you. We were a testament to that.",

      "title": "Chapter Three",
      "content": "Chapter Three After we finished the movie, I trudged upstairs, and flopped down on my bed, my hair spilling around me as I buried my face in my pillow. That warm, fuzzy, numb feeling was just starting to kick in as my body drifted off to dreamland, when the sound of breaking glass yanked me back to consciousness. Sitting up with a jolt, I looked wildly around my dark bedroom, willing my eyes to adjust. When I still couldn’t see anything, I reached over and fumbled for the switch on my lamp and turned it on, flooding my room with a dim, yellow glow. “What the hell?” I grumbled, getting out of bed and picking up my favorite photograph of me, my mom, and my grandma off the floor. It had been taken last summer when we’d gone to the Grand Canyon. It had been an incredible trip, and the photo served as a reminder. The glass in the frame was shattered and bits were scattered across the floor like tiny diamonds. I looked around. How did it fall off my desk? My window was closed, and there wasn’t a breeze. I frowned, a cold familiarity biting my skin. Déjà vu. I’d done this before. It had been years since I’d seen Shadow or heard the voices. It all gnashed at me, trying to get me to see, to listen. My breath was visible as I exhaled—the tiny white clouds clinging to the frigid air. Despite the delicate late spring chill outside, there was no way I should be able to see my breath in my warm bedroom. My hand gripped the silver pendant hanging around my neck, running the infinity symbol along the chain as I tended to do when I was nervous or thinking about something. Something didn’t feel right. In fact, something felt wrong. Incredibly wrong. I backed away shaking my head with the photo still in my hands. A buzzing feeling rolled within my body, making my knees quake and my stomach churn. I backed away from the desk, my legs hitting the edge of my bed. The buzzing in my body grew until I felt a strange numbness spread through me, almost as if my body had fallen asleep. I let out a yelp and jumped as something brushed against my legs from under my bed, the coldness from its touch making my blood run hot and waking my body up. Rushing out of my room, I entered my mother’s and jumped into bed with her like I’d done as a child. I tugged the blankets up to my chin and burrowed deeply within its warm confines. “What’s wrong, mija?” Mom asked sitting up, sleepily rubbing her eyes. “I—my picture fell off my desk. It scared me,” I answered lamely, my heart still hammering a rhythm in my chest. I didn’t tell her about feeling like my leg had been grabbed. “Probably just a draft,” she yawned, lying back in bed. “We’ll just have a sleepover in here. Try to get some rest. You have school in the morning.” I nodded tightly and pulled the blanket tighter around me. As my eyes darted back and forth through the dimly lit room, memories from long ago resurfaced. Memories I’d spent the better part of my adolescence trying to forget. “Daddy! No!” I screamed, kicking my little legs out as he pulled me across the living room. His big hand was fisted tightly around my pink pajama top. My pigtails bounced as I struggled against him. “They want you!” his voice was loud, making my small body quake as he tugged me roughly to the dark closet by the basement door. “They can have you!” He pulled open the door to the closet, and I let out a scream as he threw me inside it. My small body tumbled forward, as hot tears poured down my face. “Daddy, please!” I reached out for him, but he shook his head at me, shoving me away. His dark eyes wild as they glanced around. “They want you, peanut. The voices—they’re driving me insane. If I give them what they want, they’ll go away.” He snapped the door close with a bang. I heard him slide the table lining the wall against it. I threw my small frame against the door, hammering on it with my tiny fists, and screamed for him to help me. When I was out of breath and tired, I backed away into the coats hanging behind me, sniffling. The coldness seeped into my skin as they arrived. I knew they were there. It was always cold when they came. I moved to bang on the door again, but was jerked back as gnarled hands—tens of them—reached through the coats and tugged me roughly into the dark depths, my screams echoing around me. I struggled to grab onto anything I could, but it was useless. “A tasty morsel he’s given us!” “Eat her soul!” “Kill her now before she becomes a problem!” I let out a blood-curdling scream, as pointed teeth pierced my skin and claws raked over me. Scratching me. Tangling themselves in my hair. “Mommy! Mommy!” I screamed her name over and over, knowing that my father was lost and that he wouldn’t be the one to save me. When she didn’t come, I stopped fighting. The coldness crept over me again, pulling me from the terrible memory. I peered around the room shivering, straining to see into the dark corners of the room. That’s where they liked to hide and emerge from—the darkest corners. My mother kept a night light on in her room because she got tired of stubbing her toe on the dresser by her bathroom door. I’d awoken more than once to the sound of her swearing in Spanish as she nursed a stubbed toe. I couldn’t decide if having the light casting a soft glow throughout the room was good or bad. The situation was sort of a which is better: the Devil I knew or the Devil I didn’t know. Did I want to see it coming or would I prefer to hide beneath my blanket in the dark hoping that it didn’t show itself? Or worse. Touch me. I lay in bed for a long time feeling like I was being watched, and it gave me the creeps. Despite the warmness of the room, I shivered. The shiver was born of fear, not the temperature. From the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow slip silently through my mother’s open bedroom door. My body stiffened as the temperature dipped even lower. My breath came out in tiny gasps and clung to the air like week-old bubblegum holds to the underside of a desk. There was more than just the shadow there. I could feel it. They were there, lurking nearby, the creatures that haunted me as a child. “Go away, go away, go away,” I whispered over and over, fidgeting with my necklace and squeezing my eyes closed, with the blanket still pulled firmly around me. I dared to peek out from beneath my lashes after a moment and saw that the room was empty. I opened my eyes wider and let out an ear-splitting scream as a leathery creature with razor-sharp teeth and claws longer than my hair, unfolded from the end of the bed and launched itself at me. It had no eyes, only torn skin where the eyes should be, and snake-like slits for a nose. A nasty, black liquid oozed from its open mouth. It happened in an instant. The shadow from the door planted itself in front of the creature and sliced through its body with a sword as dark and shadowy as the creature itself. The creature fell with thump and a nasty snarl before it hissed and popped, disappearing into black, floating ash. Shadow turned to face me. His red eyes stared at me as he continued to clutch the shadowy sword in his hand. Fear ripped a scream from my throat. “Ever! Ever!” My mother shouted frantically, shaking me. Shadow disappeared in a puff of black mist as my mother wrapped her arms around me. “Mija, what’s wrong?” “There-there was a monster. A creature. It attacked me. And there was a shadow. It was a man. I think,” I cried incoherently, clinging to her, burying my head in her neck. “There’s nothing here, sweetheart. Nothing.” She held onto me as I sobbed, her hand gentle as she pushed my damp hair away from my face. “It was a bad dream. That’s all. Just a dream.” She pressed me to her until I’d calmed down, repeating her words in my head. Bad dream. Just a dream. Not real! “Dios mío, it’s cold in here,” she murmured, giving me a hug as I pulled in a shaky breath and wiped at my eyes. It couldn’t have been a dream. I was awake. I knew I was. I couldn’t shake it. No matter how many times I said it wasn’t real in my head. It had to be. It was just too vivid to not be. “I’m sure all the stress you’ve been under is causing you to have nightmares—,” she started again. “No, I saw it. It lunged at me from the floor. Then there was a shadow man with a sword,” I choked out, wiping more tears from my eyes, her words not the blanket of comfort I needed. I knew what I’d seen. “I swear it wasn’t a dream.” “Mija, we’ve lived in this house for ages now. I’m sure it was nothing. You need to go back to sleep, child. You’re stressed out over Dylan, and it’s making you have nightmares. It’s happened to me before, too. Come on. Lie back down. Want me to get Mr. Boggles for you?” she teased, trying to make me feel better as she referred to the stuffed bunny from when I was a kid. I’d hug the crap out of that thing whenever I was scared. It was one of the only things that got me through my childhood. I’d blocked out all the weird things I’d seen crawling and slithering around in the night or when my dad locked me in dark closets. It had been years since I’d seen anything scary. Mom claimed I had an overactive imagination. She’d told me to pray, as was her way with most things, and they’d go away. Eventually they had, but I was sure it wasn’t because I’d prayed. It was because I made myself block it all out, just like I blocked out the pain whenever my dad would hit me. Creating a hard exterior, had kept me safe from both living and non-living things. Tonight reminded me that the things in the dark were clearly still around, however dormant they may have seemed. Eventually I managed to fall into a fitful sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my mom had already left for work. Not wanting to waste time being in this house of horrors, I showered quickly, dressed, and skipped breakfast. I ran the entire way to school hoping to catch breakfast there before it ended. *** “Hey, Ever,” Nina Hamilton, my best friend, greeted me as I sat down across from her. Her blue eyes sparkled as she looked at me. With her blonde hair pulled up into a tight ponytail, she was the epitome of the pretty, girl-next-door. She was popular with a soft, caring streak and didn’t really fit in with the group she hung out with. When she’d taken me under her wing in second grade after Greg Kildner cut off my Barbie’s hair, cemented our friendship. We mostly hung around the same people. However, I tended to be more withdrawn and sarcastic. I was probably only tolerated because I was Nina’s friend. I knew damn well I didn’t fit in with them, and they certainly didn’t go out of their way to invite me places. The fact that Dylan had even asked me out was a miracle. “Hey, Nina,” I yawned. “You look exhausted,” she frowned, her blue eyes sweeping over me quickly. “What’s wrong? Is it Dylan?” “No,” I grimaced. She knew that I’d really liked him, and I think she was under the impression I still did. She wasn’t wrong. Maybe I did. It was a complicated emotion that I wasn’t sure how to explore. “It’s OK if it is. He was a total douchebag,” she continued, not buying what I was selling. I found my eyes wandering over to him as he laughed with a group of his jock friends. He was always the center of attention. Unfortunately, a lot of the attention came from females. And he enjoyed it as much as any red-blooded, teenaged guy would. I hadn’t realized how he was with other girls. It had become blaringly clear over the past few weeks though. I didn’t regret ignoring his texts. I felt let down by him. My father hadn’t been much of a husband or parent, and I’d always pictured myself with someone who would make me happy, someone who would challenge me—in good ways. I thought I had that with Dylan, but I’d been wrong. It left me feeling empty, angry, and hurt on the inside. “I don’t care,” I muttered, suddenly not hungry for the toast and breakfast bar in front of me. “He can have Brit. He clearly wanted her, so I guess we both win.” “How do you both win?” Nina demanded. “He gets what he wants while you, what? Get hurt? Screw that. You deserve better than him, Ever. You’re so beautiful and smart and funny—” “Nina, it’s OK. Really,” I cut her off and gave her my most winning smile, knowing that it didn’t quite reach my eyes. She let out a sigh, still not buying it. Yeah, I was bummed, but I’d get over it. He wasn’t the person I thought he was. Lesson learned. Moving on. “You know, Andy Daniels and Clare Morgan just broke up. I heard Andy had a crush on you. Maybe I can set you two up,” Nina switched gears, her eyes lighting up at the prospect of playing matchmaker. “No thanks, Nina,” I said, getting to my feet. “I think I’m all set for the time being. I need to take some me time. You know, figure out who I really am on the inside.” “Ever,” she scoffed, rolling her eyes at my jest. “Shut up! You’re the last person who needs that. I’ve never met a girl more confident and sure of herself in my life!” “You flatter me,” I teased, pulling my bag over my shoulder. “Well, it’s true,” she continued, getting to her feet and walking with me to my locker. “Where did you get that sweater? It’s really pretty.” She eyed my emerald-green sweater enviously, and I laughed. “My grandmother gave it to me. She said it would bring out my eyes,” I answered, shrugging. “It brings out more than your eyes.” She waggled her eyebrows suggestively, and we both burst into fits of giggles. It felt good to laugh. “Hey, now,” I admonished her as our laughter died down. “Personally, I’d go down a size. You know that.” “And hopefully give it to me,” she grinned, glancing down at her own chest. “I wish mine were bigger.” “Of all the people to complain about her body, you’re the last one who should, Nina. You’re beautiful. You should know that by now.” “Of course, I am,” she flipped her ponytail over her shoulder, grinning. “I just want bigger boobs.” We laughed together as I stuffed my history book into my bag, my terrible night forgotten, and we made our way to class. The morning wore on as only a morning at school could. By lunch, I’d heard rumors about me and Dylan circulating, and while most of them were just plain stupid, a few of them touched on a nerve and hurt me. “Is it true that you wouldn’t put out and that’s why Dylan Reynolds broke up with you?” Casey Michaels asked, snapping her gum loudly as she stood over us at lunch, her dark eyes flashing wickedly at me. “Get out of here,” Nina snapped getting to her feet. “Crawl back to your hole, Casey.” “I’m only asking because Dylan is on the market again and some of us,” she sneered at me, plowing on as if Nina hadn’t insulted her, “actually enjoy doing the things that Ever doesn’t like to do.” “We all know you’re one of those people,” Nina snorted, rolling her eyes. “I’ll make sure Dylan gets the memo.” “Thank you.” Casey grinned like she thought Nina was serious before marching away, her chestnut-colored hair swinging behind her. “Can you believe her?” Nina shook her head in amazement, a muscle thrumming along her jaw. “Seriously. What an idiot!” “Actually, I can. She’s had her eye on Dylan for a long time.” I rested my head on my hand and stabbed at my salad listlessly. “I’m surprised he hasn’t already been with her.” “He’s the one who lost out, Ever,” Nina stated, her eyes focused on me. “We both know that.” “Yeah, yeah,” I muttered, waving her off. I didn’t feel like having this conversation. Again. Regardless if it was his loss, it still hurt. I was grateful that this was the last month of school before summer break hit. At least once classes were out, I wouldn’t have to see Dylan all the time. Nina sighed without another word, and we were soon joined by Beth and Gemma, two of the popular girls that Nina chummed around with. Grateful that Nina was distracted, I let my mind wander, trying to figure out what I’d actually seen in our house last night. I had the niggling feeling that the shadow was the same one from my childhood, just bigger. He was always about the same size as me. He seemed to have grown up over the years. Like me. I tried figuring it all then and failed. It didn’t seem like much had changed in that respect. “Ever?” Dylan’s voice pulled me out of my thoughts, and I frowned up at him as he stood at our table. “Hey.” He flashed me his perfect smile, his dusty brown hair falling across his forehead in a way I used to love. Now it only made my stomach churn. “Can we talk?” “Talk?” I asked dumbly. “Uh, yeah. Just us.” “No,” I shook my head, the word tumbling from my mouth without me having to think about it. Beth looked at me like I was crazy to be blowing him off. Maybe I was. I mean, I thought I’d seen a shadow man with red eyes in my house last night. I imagined that he’d grown up with me. That would probably warrant a trip to the hospital for a psych evaluation. “Ever, please. Just for a minute,” Dylan sighed, looking frustrated, his hands stuffed deep into his pockets. “Fine,” I huffed, getting up and tossing my salad in the trash. I wasn’t hungry anyway. I followed him out of the cafeteria and wasn’t surprised when he pulled me into an empty classroom and closed the door. “Ever, I really do want to apologize for what happened at Brit’s party. I know I made a huge mistake. I’ve been a jerk lately over it, and I’m sorry. I don’t want to lose you. Being without you this week has made me realize how important you are to me.” “Are you feeling well?” I asked, shaking my head at him, my eyes narrowed. “Did you suffer a head injury lately?” “Ever, come on. You know I care about you—” “All I know, Dylan, is that I can’t trust you. That pretty much officially ends anything we had.” “So that’s it? You’re really doing this?” he asked, a deep frown carving his features. “I didn’t do it. You did when you decided I wasn’t enough. I’m just finishing what you started.” “Ever.” He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. As fast as lightening, his hands fell away from his head and landed on me, pulling me flush to his body. His mouth found mine and he kissed me deeply, his tongue pushing against my own. For a fraction of a second, I parted my lips for him until I realized what I was doing. He’d always had that effect on me. He knew it, too. “No,” I said, shaking my head at him and pulling away. “No, Dylan. You don’t get to decide this. Not like this.” “Ever, I love you, OK?” he said desperately. “Is that what you want to hear? I do.” He reached for me again and grasped my hands. “Please. Give me another chance.” “Dylan—” “Ever. Please.” His eyes flashed with sincerity. “I’m sorry, Dylan. It’s not happening. Not right now anyway. I’m still really mad at you. I need time to figure out how I really feel.” “How long do you need?” “I don’t know,” I answered honestly. “It’s not really something I can put a time limit on. I’d rather us just be friends, OK?” “You’re serious.” His face fell, his Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat. “Yes,” I nodded. “I’m serious. I can’t trust you. Why can’t you understand that?” “I get it.” His eyes narrowed at me, his mouth turned down into a frown. “You’ve always thought you’re better than everyone.” “What? How can you even say that?” I demanded, my temper flaring. “I-I don’t know,” he groaned, rubbing his eyes. “Tell me, Ever. What do I have to do to make this right?” “Well,” I breathed out, still irritated at his words. “Think about it like this, if I’d done this to you, what would you do if you were me?” He grew quiet, a shadow of sadness covering his face. “You’re right.” He took a step away from me. “You’re right. I screwed up. I wouldn’t trust you either. There’s probably nothing you could do to change that.” “See?” “I-I don’t even know what to say right now. I’m sorry. I really screwed this up. I-I can’t believe we’re over.” I shrugged helplessly. “I really do love you,” he murmured, his voice shaking. “Do you love me?” “Dylan—” “Ever, please. Did you ever love me?” “I have to go,” I backed away from him, my chest aching from heartbreak. Maybe I had loved him. Funny, I realized it as I was walking away leaving him to stand there looking as devastated as I felt.",

      "content": "Chapter Three After we finished the movie, I trudged upstairs, and flopped down on my bed, my hair spilling around me as I buried my face in my pillow. That warm, fuzzy, numb feeling was just starting to kick in as my body drifted off to dreamland, when the sound of breaking glass yanked me back to consciousness. Sitting up with a jolt, I looked wildly around my dark bedroom, willing my eyes to adjust. When I still couldn’t see anything, I reached over and fumbled for the switch on my lamp and turned it on, flooding my room with a dim, yellow glow. “What the hell?” I grumbled, getting out of bed and picking up my favorite photograph of me, my mom, and my grandma off the floor. It had been taken last summer when we’d gone to the Grand Canyon. It had been an incredible trip, and the photo served as a reminder. The glass in the frame was shattered and bits were scattered across the floor like tiny diamonds. I looked around. How did it fall off my desk? My window was closed, and there wasn’t a breeze. I frowned, a cold familiarity biting my skin. Déjà vu. I’d done this before. It had been years since I’d seen Shadow or heard the voices. It all gnashed at me, trying to get me to see, to listen. My breath was visible as I exhaled—the tiny white clouds clinging to the frigid air. Despite the delicate late spring chill outside, there was no way I should be able to see my breath in my warm bedroom. My hand gripped the silver pendant hanging around my neck, running the infinity symbol along the chain as I tended to do when I was nervous or thinking about something. Something didn’t feel right. In fact, something felt wrong. Incredibly wrong. I backed away shaking my head with the photo still in my hands. A buzzing feeling rolled within my body, making my knees quake and my stomach churn. I backed away from the desk, my legs hitting the edge of my bed. The buzzing in my body grew until I felt a strange numbness spread through me, almost as if my body had fallen asleep. I let out a yelp and jumped as something brushed against my legs from under my bed, the coldness from its touch making my blood run hot and waking my body up. Rushing out of my room, I entered my mother’s and jumped into bed with her like I’d done as a child. I tugged the blankets up to my chin and burrowed deeply within its warm confines. “What’s wrong, mija?” Mom asked sitting up, sleepily rubbing her eyes. “I—my picture fell off my desk. It scared me,” I answered lamely, my heart still hammering a rhythm in my chest. I didn’t tell her about feeling like my leg had been grabbed. “Probably just a draft,” she yawned, lying back in bed. “We’ll just have a sleepover in here. Try to get some rest. You have school in the morning.” I nodded tightly and pulled the blanket tighter around me. As my eyes darted back and forth through the dimly lit room, memories from long ago resurfaced. Memories I’d spent the better part of my adolescence trying to forget. “Daddy! No!” I screamed, kicking my little legs out as he pulled me across the living room. His big hand was fisted tightly around my pink pajama top. My pigtails bounced as I struggled against him. “They want you!” his voice was loud, making my small body quake as he tugged me roughly to the dark closet by the basement door. “They can have you!” He pulled open the door to the closet, and I let out a scream as he threw me inside it. My small body tumbled forward, as hot tears poured down my face. “Daddy, please!” I reached out for him, but he shook his head at me, shoving me away. His dark eyes wild as they glanced around. “They want you, peanut. The voices—they’re driving me insane. If I give them what they want, they’ll go away.” He snapped the door close with a bang. I heard him slide the table lining the wall against it. I threw my small frame against the door, hammering on it with my tiny fists, and screamed for him to help me. When I was out of breath and tired, I backed away into the coats hanging behind me, sniffling. The coldness seeped into my skin as they arrived. I knew they were there. It was always cold when they came. I moved to bang on the door again, but was jerked back as gnarled hands—tens of them—reached through the coats and tugged me roughly into the dark depths, my screams echoing around me. I struggled to grab onto anything I could, but it was useless. “A tasty morsel he’s given us!” “Eat her soul!” “Kill her now before she becomes a problem!” I let out a blood-curdling scream, as pointed teeth pierced my skin and claws raked over me. Scratching me. Tangling themselves in my hair. “Mommy! Mommy!” I screamed her name over and over, knowing that my father was lost and that he wouldn’t be the one to save me. When she didn’t come, I stopped fighting. The coldness crept over me again, pulling me from the terrible memory. I peered around the room shivering, straining to see into the dark corners of the room. That’s where they liked to hide and emerge from—the darkest corners. My mother kept a night light on in her room because she got tired of stubbing her toe on the dresser by her bathroom door. I’d awoken more than once to the sound of her swearing in Spanish as she nursed a stubbed toe. I couldn’t decide if having the light casting a soft glow throughout the room was good or bad. The situation was sort of a which is better: the Devil I knew or the Devil I didn’t know. Did I want to see it coming or would I prefer to hide beneath my blanket in the dark hoping that it didn’t show itself? Or worse. Touch me. I lay in bed for a long time feeling like I was being watched, and it gave me the creeps. Despite the warmness of the room, I shivered. The shiver was born of fear, not the temperature. From the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow slip silently through my mother’s open bedroom door. My body stiffened as the temperature dipped even lower. My breath came out in tiny gasps and clung to the air like week-old bubblegum holds to the underside of a desk. There was more than just the shadow there. I could feel it. They were there, lurking nearby, the creatures that haunted me as a child. “Go away, go away, go away,” I whispered over and over, fidgeting with my necklace and squeezing my eyes closed, with the blanket still pulled firmly around me. I dared to peek out from beneath my lashes after a moment and saw that the room was empty. I opened my eyes wider and let out an ear-splitting scream as a leathery creature with razor-sharp teeth and claws longer than my hair, unfolded from the end of the bed and launched itself at me. It had no eyes, only torn skin where the eyes should be, and snake-like slits for a nose. A nasty, black liquid oozed from its open mouth. It happened in an instant. The shadow from the door planted itself in front of the creature and sliced through its body with a sword as dark and shadowy as the creature itself. The creature fell with thump and a nasty snarl before it hissed and popped, disappearing into black, floating ash. Shadow turned to face me. His red eyes stared at me as he continued to clutch the shadowy sword in his hand. Fear ripped a scream from my throat. “Ever! Ever!” My mother shouted frantically, shaking me. Shadow disappeared in a puff of black mist as my mother wrapped her arms around me. “Mija, what’s wrong?” “There-there was a monster. A creature. It attacked me. And there was a shadow. It was a man. I think,” I cried incoherently, clinging to her, burying my head in her neck. “There’s nothing here, sweetheart. Nothing.” She held onto me as I sobbed, her hand gentle as she pushed my damp hair away from my face. “It was a bad dream. That’s all. Just a dream.” She pressed me to her until I’d calmed down, repeating her words in my head. Bad dream. Just a dream. Not real! “Dios mío, it’s cold in here,” she murmured, giving me a hug as I pulled in a shaky breath and wiped at my eyes. It couldn’t have been a dream. I was awake. I knew I was. I couldn’t shake it. No matter how many times I said it wasn’t real in my head. It had to be. It was just too vivid to not be. “I’m sure all the stress you’ve been under is causing you to have nightmares—,” she started again. “No, I saw it. It lunged at me from the floor. Then there was a shadow man with a sword,” I choked out, wiping more tears from my eyes, her words not the blanket of comfort I needed. I knew what I’d seen. “I swear it wasn’t a dream.” “Mija, we’ve lived in this house for ages now. I’m sure it was nothing. You need to go back to sleep, child. You’re stressed out over Dylan, and it’s making you have nightmares. It’s happened to me before, too. Come on. Lie back down. Want me to get Mr. Boggles for you?” she teased, trying to make me feel better as she referred to the stuffed bunny from when I was a kid. I’d hug the crap out of that thing whenever I was scared. It was one of the only things that got me through my childhood. I’d blocked out all the weird things I’d seen crawling and slithering around in the night or when my dad locked me in dark closets. It had been years since I’d seen anything scary. Mom claimed I had an overactive imagination. She’d told me to pray, as was her way with most things, and they’d go away. Eventually they had, but I was sure it wasn’t because I’d prayed. It was because I made myself block it all out, just like I blocked out the pain whenever my dad would hit me. Creating a hard exterior, had kept me safe from both living and non-living things. Tonight reminded me that the things in the dark were clearly still around, however dormant they may have seemed. Eventually I managed to fall into a fitful sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my mom had already left for work. Not wanting to waste time being in this house of horrors, I showered quickly, dressed, and skipped breakfast. I ran the entire way to school hoping to catch breakfast there before it ended. *** “Hey, Ever,” Nina Hamilton, my best friend, greeted me as I sat down across from her. Her blue eyes sparkled as she looked at me. With her blonde hair pulled up into a tight ponytail, she was the epitome of the pretty, girl-next-door. She was popular with a soft, caring streak and didn’t really fit in with the group she hung out with. When she’d taken me under her wing in second grade after Greg Kildner cut off my Barbie’s hair, cemented our friendship. We mostly hung around the same people. However, I tended to be more withdrawn and sarcastic. I was probably only tolerated because I was Nina’s friend. I knew damn well I didn’t fit in with them, and they certainly didn’t go out of their way to invite me places. The fact that Dylan had even asked me out was a miracle. “Hey, Nina,” I yawned. “You look exhausted,” she frowned, her blue eyes sweeping over me quickly. “What’s wrong? Is it Dylan?” “No,” I grimaced. She knew that I’d really liked him, and I think she was under the impression I still did. She wasn’t wrong. Maybe I did. It was a complicated emotion that I wasn’t sure how to explore. “It’s OK if it is. He was a total douchebag,” she continued, not buying what I was selling. I found my eyes wandering over to him as he laughed with a group of his jock friends. He was always the center of attention. Unfortunately, a lot of the attention came from females. And he enjoyed it as much as any red-blooded, teenaged guy would. I hadn’t realized how he was with other girls. It had become blaringly clear over the past few weeks though. I didn’t regret ignoring his texts. I felt let down by him. My father hadn’t been much of a husband or parent, and I’d always pictured myself with someone who would make me happy, someone who would challenge me—in good ways. I thought I had that with Dylan, but I’d been wrong. It left me feeling empty, angry, and hurt on the inside. “I don’t care,” I muttered, suddenly not hungry for the toast and breakfast bar in front of me. “He can have Brit. He clearly wanted her, so I guess we both win.” “How do you both win?” Nina demanded. “He gets what he wants while you, what? Get hurt? Screw that. You deserve better than him, Ever. You’re so beautiful and smart and funny—” “Nina, it’s OK. Really,” I cut her off and gave her my most winning smile, knowing that it didn’t quite reach my eyes. She let out a sigh, still not buying it. Yeah, I was bummed, but I’d get over it. He wasn’t the person I thought he was. Lesson learned. Moving on. “You know, Andy Daniels and Clare Morgan just broke up. I heard Andy had a crush on you. Maybe I can set you two up,” Nina switched gears, her eyes lighting up at the prospect of playing matchmaker. “No thanks, Nina,” I said, getting to my feet. “I think I’m all set for the time being. I need to take some me time. You know, figure out who I really am on the inside.” “Ever,” she scoffed, rolling her eyes at my jest. “Shut up! You’re the last person who needs that. I’ve never met a girl more confident and sure of herself in my life!” “You flatter me,” I teased, pulling my bag over my shoulder. “Well, it’s true,” she continued, getting to her feet and walking with me to my locker. “Where did you get that sweater? It’s really pretty.” She eyed my emerald-green sweater enviously, and I laughed. “My grandmother gave it to me. She said it would bring out my eyes,” I answered, shrugging. “It brings out more than your eyes.” She waggled her eyebrows suggestively, and we both burst into fits of giggles. It felt good to laugh. “Hey, now,” I admonished her as our laughter died down. “Personally, I’d go down a size.

      "content": "Chapter Four The rest of the week was torture. The rumor mill churned out more stories, most of them even worse than before. There was one going around that I’d begged Dylan to take me back and was going to give it up to him, but he turned me down because he wasn’t into “pity lays”. That one probably came from one of his friends. On the bright side, I hadn’t seen anything weird in my house the past few days, so I was able to sleep in my room again without incident. I counted that as a small victory. My avoidance of Dylan was even greater than before. He’d angered me to the point where I was tempted to scream at him in front of the student population. Because despite saying he loved me and wanted me back, he didn’t bother to quell the nasty rumors. I wanted to confront him and roundhouse kick him in his face—a move I was rather good at—but that seemed like a bad idea, so I did my best to keep my head down. Instead, I took to beating my punching bag in the basement, imagining it was him. Saturday night, I was sitting at home with my nose stuck in a book after a punishing workout session, where I beat the crap out of my punching bag and then proceeded to kick a lawn chair violently, when my phone rang with a call from Nina. “Party central,” I answered on the second ring. “Yeah, right,” she laughed. “You must have been reading my mind, though. I’m headed over to Jax’s party. Come with me.” “Thanks, but I’ll pass,” I said immediately. Jax was Dylan’s best friend and therefore guilty by association. “Ever, you need to face these people so you can show them that none of the crap going on matters,” Nina stated evenly. “We don’t have to stay long. Just long enough to prove that you don’t care, and then we’ll leave.” “But I don’t care,” I pointed out. “Really, I don’t. School will be out for the summer in less than a month. No one will remember any of this next year.” “Ever, you do too care. You can lie to everyone else, but I know you. All this crap is bothering you. You know how people are. You need to take a stand. Something they’ll remember you for come next year. Come with me tonight. One hour and we’ll go. You can prove to Dylan you don’t care, too. Hell, maybe you’ll even meet a hot guy to move on with.” “That’s the last thing I feel like doing,” I grumbled, closing my book, knowing I was losing the battle with her. “Ever, please? I want to go to bed tonight knowing I tried to save my best friend from public humiliation.” “Fine,” I sighed. “One hour. That’s it. I’ll leave without you. You know I will.” “One hour. Two tops.” “Nina—” I warned. “I’m just saying, if you end up having fun then there’s no reason to leave, right?” “You’re such a shit,” I grumbled, rubbing my eyes. “But you love me anyway.” “I do,” I admitted. She had a way of always trying to fix things, even when I just wanted to be left alone. “Wear something cute. That jean skirt you just bought last weekend and that black off-the-shoulder number that shows off your fabulous assets.” “Whatever,” I yawned. “Hurry up so we can get there and then leave.” “I’ll be there in fifteen.” We hung up, and I groaned as I got to my feet. Damn her. I went to my closet and rifled around in it, coming out with the outfit she’d indicated. After I put it on, I ran a brush through my hair leaving the long, black locks to flow around me. I was putting on some makeup, because I knew Nina wouldn’t let me out of the house without it, when movement from the corner of my room caught my eye. I slowly lowered my pink gloss back to my vanity and closed my eyes. Counting to ten, I drew in deep, calming breaths. Please, God. Don’t let there be anything there. Let it just be my imagination. I’ll open my eyes and there will be nothing there. Please. I opened my eyes on my final breath and let out a strangled cry as I peered into my mirror. Standing behind me next to my bed, was Shadow. His red eyes glowed just as bright as the last time I’d seen him. The only things on him that moved were his eyes as he stared at me. Those pools of lava moved slowly up my body and fell on my face, freezing me with his gaze. I stood there, staring at him through my mirror, not brave enough to turn around. My lips parted, and I let out a shaky breath after what felt like an eternity. “W-who are you?” I managed to say, my voice choked and small. He cocked his head, regarding me silently. “W-what do you want?” Instead of answering, he faded away, leaving behind wisps of black shadow tendrils. I let out another breath, my body trembling. Dropping my lip gloss, I rushed from the room and went downstairs to meet Nina. My guard was firmly in place as I nervously looked around making sure nothing else was lurking about. When her car pulled into my driveway, I rushed from the house and greeted her outside. I threw myself into the passenger seat before she could even get out of her car. “I knew that would look incredible on you!” she squealed as I closed the door. “Thanks,” I said, looking over my shoulder at the house as I put my seatbelt on. There was nothing there. I let out a breath of relief and relaxed against the seat as Nina started gabbing on and on about Jax’s party—who was going, who wasn’t, and all the alcohol she’d heard was going to be there. I tuned her out as I watched the dark scenery whiz past, my mind on what had just happened in my bedroom. He didn’t hurt me. I wracked my brain, recalling all the times I’d encountered him. He’d never actually hurt me, even when we were kids. He’d always just watched me. OKKKK. So, he was back. He’d gotten rid of that monster in Mom’s room. Maybe his presence wasn’t such a bad thing. I stiffened as we passed the cemetery, the last thought freezing in my mind. A feeling of foreboding washed over me. The full moon shining off the tombstones caused goosebumps to snake their way through my body. I gulped as two dark figures emerged from the shadows and began walking down one of the cemetery paths. They looked a lot like the shadow from my room, right down to their red eyes. I averted my eyes and looked at Nina to see if she noticed anything. She was still animated, talking a mile a minute about Jax’s party and had clearly not seen what I’d just seen. Breathe, Ever. Breathe. I said it over and over in my mind, breathing in and out slowly until I relaxed. Deciding it was best to remain quiet about the shadow people, I pushed the whole thing out of my head and smiled and nodded when appropriate. When we arrived at Jax’s house, I was ready to leap out of the car and drown my fears in copious amounts of alcohol despite my bad feeling. “Nina! Girl, I’m so glad you’re here,” Beth squealed, hugging Nina the moment her foot entered the house. “Oh, and look, you brought Ever,” Gemma simpered, eyeing my outfit, an envious glint in her eyes and a sneer on her lips. “Yeah,” I muttered, pushing past them. “I’ll be by the keg if you need me.” I located the keg and poured myself half a glass. I knew I wouldn’t drink any more than that, even though I really wanted to. Living with my dad all those years really put the fear in me about drinking. I didn’t want to end up like him. Plus, sipping a half a glass all night made me appear like I was living it up with my peers, most of whom hated me. I shook my head and tipped the glass back. Ugh. I hated the way beer tasted. It was like vomit in reverse. “Hey, Ever,” Jax greeted me. He looked good with his blond hair perfectly gelled into his signature faux hawk and his blue eyes sparkling. Jax was always in a good mood. If I was a dark cloud, then Jax was the sunshine. I had to hand it to the guy, he always tried to make me feel welcomed. “Hey,” I replied, giving him a tight smile, as my eyes darted around to make sure Dylan wasn’t nearby. “Having fun?” “I’d probably be having more fun at home reading a book, but Nina insisted I come and grace your party with my presence.” “Well, even though you’re having a shit time, I’m glad you came.” He grinned as he leaned in and gave me a hug. “Dylan is outside on the patio in case you want to avoid him.” “Thanks for the tip,” I muttered as Jax pulled away a bit. “For real, Ever,” He leaned down to speak in my ear, “You’re better off without Dylan. We’re friends and all, but he’s an ass sometimes. If I’d have known what he was doing, I’d have told you. You didn’t deserve that shit. He’s taking it kind of hard, though. He’s been talking about it all night.” “Great,” I grumbled. I was not in the mood for this. “Sorry. Figured you should know.” He gave me a helpless shrug as he moved away from me. “Thank you.” I smiled sincerely at him. He nodded and then grinned as Brandon, another one of their group, came up and started talking to him. Alone once again, I looked around at everyone enjoying themselves. I wasn’t much for parties. Or people in general really. I liked keeping to myself. Leaning against the counter, I lost track of time, which sounded weird considering I wanted to leave within the hour. I was jolted out of my random thoughts by the sound of people laughing loudly. I looked in the direction of the commotion and saw Dylan stumble into view, a wild look on his drunken face, his eyes dazed. “You can’t drive, man,” Jax said, putting his hands on Dylan’s chest as Dylan lurched to the side. “I gotta go, dude,” Dylan slurred, tripping and falling into the wall. “I gotta call my girl.” “You don’t have a girl,” Jax said evenly, stepping in front of him again to stop him. “Yeah-yes, I do,” Dylan shot back indignantly, pushing him aside. “You say that all because you want her to yourself.” “Whatever, man. You’re not driving.” Jax was firm as he snatched the keys out of Dylan’s hands. “You’re going to take my girl, man. I know it!” “Go sleep it off, Dylan,” Jax said, pushing Dylan forward. “Ever!” Dylan’s eyes fell on me and his face broke into a wide, lopsided smile. “There she is. That’s my girl. Baby, come here.” He stumbled his way over and wrapped his arms around me, crushing my small body to his. “Mm, baby, you smell so good.” He took a deep breath. “I’m so glad you came to see me. I was gonna go see you, but Jax is bein’ an ass-an asshole.” “You’re drunk,” I grumbled pushing him off me. “Drunk for you,” he laughed loudly, his arm snaking around my waist. “I miss you, Ever. My hot mamacita.” His voice became louder as he started to shout, “All you bitches listen up. This is my girl. Ever is the hottest, sexiest chick in the whole school, and I majorly screwed up.” “Dylan, stop it,” I hissed, grabbing his raised arm and pulling it down to his side, knowing damn well my face was flushed with embarrassment. “No, babe. They need to hear this. So do you.” This was going to be the most embarrassing moment of my life. I could feel it coming on in 3. . . 2. . . 1. . . “I love Ever,” Dylan bellowed while people around us snickered loudly. “She’s my girl. I’m not going to be screwing you other chicks anymore because she’s it. She’s my forever.” “I swear I’m going to stab you,” I growled at him. “Come here, babe. Kiss your man,” he slurred out, reaching for me. “If I kiss you, will you shut the hell up?” I growled angrily at him, my eyes darting around the room hoping that people had lost interest in his drunken shenanigans. “Cross my heart,” he answered with a lopsided grin. He didn’t wait for my answer. He pressed his wet mouth to mine, jamming his tongue inside. I nearly threw up at the way he tasted—like stale alcohol and vomit. I hurriedly pushed him away and wiped at my mouth in disgust. “Come on! I know you can do better than that,” he shouted. “You’re my little jalapeno. Give daddy some spice.” I grabbed him by the arm roughly and tugged him away from the snickering crowd he’d accumulated. “Keys?” Jax handed me Dylan’s keys. “Thank you,” I said, snatching them from his hand. “Get him home safely, OK? Do you want me to go with you?” “No, I got it,” I muttered, pulling Dylan and his grabby hands away. “We’re going to go make out, aren’t we?” Dylan asked gleefully, squeezing my backside. “We’re going to get back together, right?” “I’m going to tear your arm off and beat you with the bloody stump if you grab my ass again,” I snapped at him. “Ooh, foreplay,” he grinned stupidly, reaching out for my butt again. I turned and slapped his hand away, and he jerked it back in alarm. “Damn, babe. We can do rough if you want. Remember all those times we sparred together? We could work on your form again.” “Get in the freaking car, Dylan,” I snapped, opening the passenger door of his car and gestured for him to get in. He stumbled forward and after some major effort and patience on my part, he was inside the car and buckled in. I climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine, then quickly backed out of the driveway. “You’re so sexy, Ever. Damn,” he murmured, eyeing me hungrily. His hand came forward to caress my thigh. “Knock it off, Dylan,” I snapped again, pushing his hand away as I tried to stay focused on the road. “Why? We’re back together!” “No, we aren’t,” I snarled. “I’m giving you a ride home so you don’t end up dead. That doesn’t mean I want to suck face with you.” “Why are you being like that, Ever?” he demanded angrily, his good mood gone. “We dated for months and you never put out. What the hell? I think I deserve something from you since I had to deal with you and your smart ass for so long.” “Had-had to deal with me?” I sputtered in disbelief, looking from the road to him then back again. “You’re kidding, right? You were screwing everything that had a pulse while we were together. Beso mi culo, Dylan.” “Stop speaking that stupid language. You know I can’t understand what you’re saying,” Dylan growled angrily. “It means ‘kiss my ass’.” “Believe me, I’ve been trying to do a lot to that ass for months now,” Dylan spat at me, his words still slurring. “You’re a prude, Ever. You’ll die a virgin at the rate you’re going.” “You’re disgusting,” I bit out, pulling the car over to the side of the road. I put it in park and got out, slamming the door hard behind me. “Where are you going?” Dylan demanded, climbing clumsily out behind me. I looked around and gave a shiver. We were in front of that damn cemetery where I’d seen those shadow people. I wrapped my arms around myself, angry that I hadn’t been paying more attention to where we were. “You can sit there all night,” I yelled, my voice shaking as I turned and began walking away from him, deciding that beating the pavement in my wedges in the dark with creepy shadow people lurking around was ten times better than listening to his drunken crap. “You can’t be serious.” Dylan grabbed my arm and pulled me to a stop. “Give me my keys. I’ll drive myself.” “Like hell! You’ll kill yourself or someone else.” “I’ve done it a bunch of times before,” he countered, stumbling forward and grabbing at the keys in my hand. He got a hold of my hand, and we had a tugging match. I held on as tightly as I could. Dylan managed to tear the keys away, and I stumbled backward unable to stop myself. The screech of tires filled my ears. Then there was a blinding pain and white light. Dylan yell out in horrified shock as I fell forward, my face hitting the pavement with a terrible crack.",

      "content": "Chapter Four The rest of the week was torture. The rumor mill churned out more stories, most of them even worse than before. There was one going around that I’d begged Dylan to take me back and was going to give it up to him, but he turned me down because he wasn’t into “pity lays”. That one probably came from one of his friends. On the bright side, I hadn’t seen anything weird in my house the past few days, so I was able to sleep in my room again without incident. I counted that as a small victory. My avoidance of Dylan was even greater than before. He’d angered me to the point where I was tempted to scream at him in front of the student population. Because despite saying he loved me and wanted me back, he didn’t bother to quell the nasty rumors. I wanted to confront him and roundhouse kick him in his face—a move I was rather good at—but that seemed like a bad idea, so I did my best to keep my head down. Instead, I took to beating my punching bag in the basement, imagining it was him. Saturday night, I was sitting at home with my nose stuck in a book after a punishing workout session, where I beat the crap out of my punching bag and then proceeded to kick a lawn chair violently, when my phone rang with a call from Nina. “Party central,” I answered on the second ring. “Yeah, right,” she laughed. “You must have been reading my mind, though. I’m headed over to Jax’s party. Come with me.” “Thanks, but I’ll pass,” I said immediately. Jax was Dylan’s best friend and therefore guilty by association. “Ever, you need to face these people so you can show them that none of the crap going on matters,” Nina stated evenly. “We don’t have to stay long. Just long enough to prove that you don’t care, and then we’ll leave.” “But I don’t care,” I pointed out. “Really, I don’t. School will be out for the summer in less than a month. No one will remember any of this next year.” “Ever, you do too care. You can lie to everyone else, but I know you. All this crap is bothering you. You know how people are. You need to take a stand. Something they’ll remember you for come next year. Come with me tonight. One hour and we’ll go. You can prove to Dylan you don’t care, too. Hell, maybe you’ll even meet a hot guy to move on with.” “That’s the last thing I feel like doing,” I grumbled, closing my book, knowing I was losing the battle with her. “Ever, please? I want to go to bed tonight knowing I tried to save my best friend from public humiliation.” “Fine,” I sighed. “One hour. That’s it. I’ll leave without you. You know I will.” “One hour.

      "content": "Chapter Five Wet. Hot. Sticky. Blood. So much blood. I was bathing in the hot, sticky mess. My entire body was saturated with it. The acrid smell clung to the air like a dense fog. My body lay on a bed of broken glass, the tiny shards biting into my skin painfully. There were voices around me—dull, panicking echoes that sounded far away. I tried my hardest to pull air into my lungs. Despite my best efforts, my breathing was shallow. My lungs deflated as I tried to gasp in tiny, rapid breaths. Panic began to set in—my chest aching as my heart hammered, the erratic thud of it reverberating in my ears. I’m dying. This can’t be how I go. My mom! Nina! “Ever! Jesus,” Dylan shouted. His face was ashen and his lips trembled as he fell to his knees beside me. “Call an ambulance! What have I done? Oh my God, Ever. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to—” “Don’t touch her,” a shaky unfamiliar voice managed to cut through the panic. “9-1-1 says not to move her.” “Ever,” Dylan reached out and clutched my hand. A river of fresh hot tears snaked down his pale cheeks. “I’m sorry, baby. I’m so sorry. Oh God. T-there’s so much blood. What do I do? Tell me what to do!” I tried to open my mouth to speak, but there was nothing. My body violently spasmed, causing Dylan to sob loudly as he held onto my hand. I was in so much pain. The world around me started going dark, as my breathing became more difficult. Each breath felt like razorblades bearing down into my lungs. I was acutely aware of a shadow moving along the edge of the scene. His red eyes narrowed on me. I whimpered timorously as he approached with sure and steady movements. “Help! Someone help!” Dylan shouted desperately in a strained voice. His hand gripped mine even tighter, as if holding me harder would keep me there. “Ever, no! Don’t die, OK? Help is coming! Help! Someone!” Little sparkles of black and white began to dot my vision, and my heart slowed down to a stumbling thud in my ears. I tried once more to breathe. Nothing. The shadow approached me and finally stopped, looming over me with his head cocked. It was the shadow I’d seen only hours ago in my bedroom. I don’t know how I knew it was him. I just did. His face was shrouded in darkness, his features indiscernible, as he gazed down at me. I wasn’t afraid of him in that moment. Call it acceptance of the inevitable, stupidity, whatever, but I felt calm, safe even, as he went down to a knee and hesitantly reached out to me. His red eyes—eyes like fire— were intense, like he was warring within himself about touching me, taking my hand in his. Something within me told me it was in my best interest to take what he offered, even if I didn’t know what it was, even if it was death. I needed to trust this creature who knelt before me. I reached weakly out to him, and his hand wrapped around mine, as he kept his ruby-colored eyes focused on me. Where I had expected coldness, there was only warmth. I shuddered violently, closing my eyes. Flashes of color, flashes of people I didn’t recognize, invaded what was left of my quickly failing mind. Voices shouted out to me. Voices of the dead. Screaming at me to hear them. I swallowed thickly. The blood that had pooled in my mouth made me sputter and gurgle. The taste was hot and metallic, biting at my tongue, reminding me that this was real—and that I was going to die. “Ever! Ever! No! NO!” Dylan shouted frantically. His voice sounded far away. “I’m sorry, Ever! Oh my God! Help! HELP!” His voice dissolved around us, and all I was left with was the image of Shadow leaning over me. He consumed everything around me, darkening the world until only the two of us existed. “Breathe,” his deep distorted voice commanded, shaking my heart. “I’ll do the rest.” I tried to suck in a shaky breath. It was too hard. Too painful. I felt hollow—empty—inside. I couldn’t. . . “Everly!” he shouted, his voice frantic as he started to shimmer like he was fading away. “Don’t stop! Focus on me. Stay with me. No matter what, don’t stop.” “My heart,” I sputtered out, not sure if I was even talking. It felt like it was all in my head. Everything was so surreal, like I was caught in the eye of a hurricane, with the world blowing past me while I stood in the eerie calm awaiting the aftermath, awaiting the inevitability that life brought with it—death. I couldn’t feel my heart like before. The familiar thump no longer hammered a rhythm in my chest. It stuttered every few seconds, like tiny jolts of fading thunder within my ribcage. “It’s not beating like it should.” He came into focus once more, like he knew my thoughts. As I gazed up at him, I concentrated all I had on him, begging him with my fixed gaze to do something to save me, even if saving me meant taking the pain away so my soul could be freed. “Am I dead?” “Not yet,” he murmured in that oddly distorted voice. “Your heart barely beats, but you still live. Do you want to die?” his voice cracked as he asked the question. Those red eyes of his softened, making him appear younger—or as young as a shadow man could appear when one couldn’t see his face. “I-no,” I was starting to shiver violently. My voice shook with each tremor that painfully tore through my body, “I-I want to live.” “You will not be the same. You’re special. Who you were will die tonight on this pavement, and a new you will be reborn from the ashes and misery. Death stalks you tonight.” His eyes swept my face quickly before he let out a shuddering breath. His eyes closed momentarily. He squared his shoulders as he seemed to come to a decision. “Do you accept what this could mean for you? Do you understand that nothing will ever be the same? Because Ever, you’re going to die here tonight, whether you continue to breathe or not.” “I’m afraid.” Hot, wet tears rolled from my eyes as a strange tugging slowly started to build within my core. Like a fire aching in my soul, it was mercilessly grasped by the hands of Death. The delicate tendrils that held me in my body slowly gave way to the destiny of the living. I clung to his hand, silently begging him to save me. “Fight it,” Shadow commanded, his red eyes filled with realization as the burning intensified within me. “It will be my battle, not yours. I will take it all away. Trust me, Everly. I won’t hurt you. I would never hurt you.” “Who are you?” I gasped, as the tugging grew stronger and the desire to just let go enveloped me. I was meant to leave this body. I could sense it. The pressure was intense, like I was being pulled and flattened in all directions. “Tonight, I’m your lucky penny.” Shadow breathed out slowly. Reaching forward with the hand that wasn’t clutching mine, he placed it over my chest. The warmth that I’d become accustomed to from his touch began to spread through me. The coldness of impending death started to trickle away, the fire in my soul quenched with whatever he was doing to me. “Are you an angel?” I choked out, still not sure if this was real or just in my head. I’d read that when people died, their synapses fired off randomly making them think they were seeing things they weren’t. Maybe that was what was happening. Maybe death was just a conversation with the unknown—one only I could hold in that moment, until my heart made its final bow out of those painful last moments. “Definitely not an angel,” I could hear the sadness in his voice before he spoke again. “I’m your only hope—your last hope. This will change everything and for that I am sorry. If you want this, if you want life and what this moment means, then breathe for me, Ever. Don’t stop once you start. I’ll be weakened until you awaken and won’t be able to help you.” I wanted to live. Consequences be damned. And in that moment, I’d have done whatever he asked me to do. I pulled in the painful breath he instructed me to—the ache a searing, tearing pain within me as the oxygen burned through my body. The air ignited a completely different fire within me—a tiny spark of life. I pulled in another breath and another, my eyes locked on his. A shock shuddered throughout my body, and my heart stuttered in my chest once again. Shadow remained focused on me. The mesmerizing depths of his red eyes were endless. While they were terrifying, there was also peace and safety within the pools of hot lava. I wanted to fall into those bright eyes and stay hidden there forever. They were beautifully frightening with a mirror of my pain shining in them. He felt everything I felt. I could sense that from him, and that made me hurt even more because something deep within me was changing. It was morphing into something I’d never be able to come back from—and neither would he. He was right. This was going to change everything. The change was blanketing me, flowing through me, connecting me to him with an unbreakable link that we’d never be able to escape from. “Breathe,” he murmured fiercely. His now trembling hand was still on my chest spreading warmth. Another shock. Another thud in my chest. Voices murmured in the distance. The blackness was receding. “Keep breathing, Everly. Breathe for me.” “Who are you?” I called out again, frantically wanting a name before he disappeared. “I-I am everything we both fear,” his voice was laced with pain as he said the words. I watched in horror as his brilliant red eyes closed, and he let out a shuddering breath, his black form crumpling to the ground beside me.",

      "content": "Chapter Five Wet. Hot. Sticky. Blood. So much blood. I was bathing in the hot, sticky mess. My entire body was saturated with it. The acrid smell clung to the air like a dense fog. My body lay on a bed of broken glass, the tiny shards biting into my skin painfully. There were voices around me—dull, panicking echoes that sounded far away. I tried my hardest to pull air into my lungs. Despite my best efforts, my breathing was shallow. My lungs deflated as I tried to gasp in tiny, rapid breaths. Panic began to set in—my chest aching as my heart hammered, the erratic thud of it reverberating in my ears. I’m dying. This can’t be how I go. My mom! Nina! “Ever! Jesus,” Dylan shouted. His face was ashen and his lips trembled as he fell to his knees beside me. “Call an ambulance! What have I done? Oh my God, Ever. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to—” “Don’t touch her,” a shaky unfamiliar voice managed to cut through the panic. “9-1-1 says not to move her.” “Ever,” Dylan reached out and clutched my hand. A river of fresh hot tears snaked down his pale cheeks. “I’m sorry, baby. I’m so sorry. Oh God. T-there’s so much blood. What do I do? Tell me what to do!” I tried to open my mouth to speak, but there was nothing. My body violently spasmed, causing Dylan to sob loudly as he held onto my hand. I was in so much pain.

      "content": "Chapter Six Beep. Beep. Beep. The incessant noise grew louder. Maybe I was late for school. I wanted to reach for my alarm and shut it off, but I couldn’t seem to get my arms to move. A white-hot pain seared through my body as I attempted to shift in bed. Something thick and heavy dug into my throat making me wince. As I realized I couldn’t breathe on my own, panic set in. Something was wedged deep within my throat. I struggled to open my eyes. My body aches became more pronounced. “Ever, sweetheart,” An unfamiliar female voice called out to me. “Hon, stay calm, OK? There’s a tube in your throat helping you breathe. The doctor is coming to take it out. I’m going to give you a shot. It’s going to make you feel sleepy. Stay calm. Your mom is on her way.” Moments later, I fought to keep my eyes open with the nurse’s words on repeat in my mind. A tube was breathing for me? What the hell had happened? As hard as I tried, I couldn’t overcome the drugs flowing through my veins. Everything faded away into the distance again, my memory wiped clean of whatever had happened to me. I wasn’t sure of the time, but when I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I stared around blearily, my body hurting and my mind in overdrive as I tried to replay the events leading up to that moment. “Everly?” my mom called out, her voice choked up as she clutched my hand. “Mom?” I croaked, my voice hoarse and my throat tender as I strained to get the words out. “Oh, mija!” she cried, leaning over and kissing my face. “Thank God! I thought I’d lost you. My sweet, sweet girl.” Her tears were damp on my cheek as she pulled away and gazed down at me fondly. Her large doe eyes wavered with a fresh swell of sadness. “What happened? Why do I hurt? Where am I?” “You don’t remember?” her voice was quiet. I peered out at her from beneath my thick lashes, my head aching, my brows crinkled in confusion and fear. “Mom, I’m scared. What’s going on?” “Sweetie, you were in an accident. You were hurt. You-you were unconscious and your heart—it wasn’t beating the way it should.” her voice was barely above a whisper, as fresh tears flowed down her cheeks. “I thought I was going to lose you. Forever. I’ve never been so scared in my life.” Her words engulfed me like a summer heat—heavy and stifling, the kind of heat that creates nausea. As I fidgeted slightly, a pain snaked its way into my side. A memory nagged at the back of my mind, but I couldn’t get it to come into focus. “I almost died?” I whispered huskily. My heart beat frantically in my chest at the news. “Yes, baby.” Mom sniffled. “Don’t try to move, OK? You have broken ribs and a fractured ankle.” “Broken ribs and fractured ankles don’t nearly kill people,” my voice low as I winced painfully. “No, but the trauma from getting hit by a car can cause the body a great deal of pain—and in some cases, even stop the heart from beating,” a deep voice cut into our conversation. A middle-aged man stepped into the room. His salt and pepper hair was combed back from his forehead and a gentle smile graced his face. “Everly, I’m Dr. Sanders.” I looked up at him and gave him my best smile, which felt more like a painful grimace as my ribs spasmed. “How are you feeling?” he asked, coming to stand beside my bed. His brows knitted as he looked down at me, cataloguing my reactions. “Like I was hit by a truck,” I muttered, wincing as my muscles gave another painful spasm. “That’s pretty accurate. It was actually an SUV.” Dr. Sanders gave me a kind smile and his eyes twinkled with humor despite the somberness of the conversation. “By all accounts, you shouldn’t be here with us right now. You were nearly dead when responders got there. Without their prompt response and a miracle, you’d be gone.” I swallowed thickly at his words. A dark memory prodded me in the back of my mind. There was more to this miracle of life. I frowned as I tried to remember, but my head throbbed, making me wince. I almost died. I should be dead. I couldn’t stop the words from repeating in my mind. “H-how is Dylan?” I whispered, remembering he’d been there with me. “Dylan is fine,” Mom assured me, her voice filled with disdain. “He wasn’t injured.” I tried to wipe at my tears, but failed. My arm had an IV in it and was wrapped heavily. My mom dabbed at my cheeks for me, her touch tender and loving. I looked down at my other arm and noticed a brace on it. I took a quick survey of my body and noted my leg was wrapped too. I had faint, fading bruises on my arms. My heart flip flopped in my chest. “What day is it?” “Ever, honey—” my mom started. “Elena.” Dr. Sanders said gently to her. “I-I… OK,” she sighed, resigned, and nodded to Dr. Sanders. “Tell her all of it.” “Everly,” Dr. Sanders turned back to face me and pulled a chair up next to my bed. The scraping noise as the legs slid over the floor made me cringe. “You suffered a traumatic brain injury. In fact, we didn’t even have any brain activity on you at first. You sitting here talking to us, well frankly, is a miracle. Truly. You’ve been in a coma for nearly two weeks.” “I didn’t think you were coming back, sweetheart,” my mom choked out, cutting in. “I-I almost let you go.” She broke into tears, her small frame shaking uncontrollably. Dr. Sanders reached out and rubbed her shoulder. “I’m so sorry, baby. I didn’t want you to suffer.” “Mom,” I murmured, as their words settled like a heavy weight on my chest. “It’s OK. I understand.” My eyelids were heavy, and I was hurting. Dr. Sanders took note of it and pulled a syringe out of his pocket and inserted it into my IV. “I’ll have pain meds ordered for you. You’ll be able to simply push a button if you need them,” he said gently, pulling the syringe out of the line. “I’ll have some more tests ordered. I want to check your bloodwork again and do some scans. If everything looks good, we can start looking at getting you out of here. How does that sound?” “Good,” I think I said as my eyes fell closed. Maybe I’d only thought it, though since I didn’t remember hearing an answer.",

I want to check your bloodwork again and do some scans. If everything looks good, we can start looking at getting you out of here. How does that sound?” “Good,” I think I said as my eyes fell closed. Maybe I’d only thought it, though since I didn’t remember hearing an answer.",

      "content": "Chapter Seven The weeks passed in a blur. Dr. Sanders insisted on keeping me in the hospital a little longer than expected due to the severity of my injuries. My mom came up from the emergency room and saw me whenever she had a spare moment. I’d refused to move too much that week. The pain wasn’t horrendous, but it wasn’t great. Each breath made me ache. Each hobble on my feet made me whimper. Each cough made my head feel like it was going to explode. Through it all, I was grateful. It could’ve been worse. I could be dead. I’d made it to the bathroom and that was about the extent of my movements. I guess it was too much to ask to simply go from being unconscious for almost two weeks to being healed. My whole body seemed to have reserved all the pain so I wouldn’t miss out on it. In addition to my fractured ankle, broken leg, broken arm, broken ribs, and brain injury—which didn’t really feel like an injury aside from the headaches—my lungs had collapsed, my liver had been lacerated, and my skull had been fractured. And, of course, there were countless other small things like cuts and bruises. My face was still puffy and the ugly purple bruises had faded into a yellow color. I’d had staples on my forehead by my hairline because apparently, the skin had torn when I smashed my head on the pavement. I made sure to have my mother keep mirrors away from me. They made me uncomfortable. And it wasn’t just because I could see myself in them. It was something else, something I didn’t want to say out loud. My mom had brought me makeup in case I wanted to fix myself up. At first, the idea sounded good because I wanted to feel normal again. But the moment I opened the compact mirror, I could’ve sworn I was looking in a dark tunnel through the mirror. A man waited at the end of it, shrouded in shadows. I’d gulped, slamming the compact shut, and hadn’t opened it since. I’d much rather look like I’d run headlong into a brick wall than be creeped out. I’d been contemplating that maybe the brain injury I’d suffered had made me wonky in the head, when there was a soft knock on my door. When I looked over, Nina stood timidly in the doorway, with her large, blue eyes peering at me nervously. “Nina?” I asked sitting up, surprised to see her. My mom said she’d stopped by to see me in the beginning before, when they thought I wasn’t going to make it. Nina had broken down and her mom and dad had to practically carry her out of the room. I wasn’t even sure if she knew I was awake. I hadn’t bothered to call her to let her know it was safe to see me now, mostly because I didn’t think I’d be good company considering I was stuck in a hospital room looking like I’d just gone ten rounds with a world heavy weight boxing champ. “Hey, Ever.” She cleared her throat as she stepped into the room. Her eyes darted around, taking in all the machines still in the room before landing back on me. “Come here,” I motioned her to me, giving her an encouraging smile and wincing as I tried to sit up further. She was a welcome distraction since all I had at the moment were terrifying thoughts about seeing things that weren’t there. She walked to the side of my bed and a tear slipped down her cheek. Her long, dark lashes blinked rapidly to hold back the damn that was fit to burst. “How are you doing?” she asked, her voice cracking as she sniffled. “Well, I pretty much died,” I chuckled softly, forcing a smile to my face. “Other than that, not bad.” “Oh, Ever.” She flopped down in the chair beside my bed and held my hand. “I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. If I hadn’t made you come out with me, none of this would have happened.” “Nina, it’s not your fault.” I frowned at her feeling guilty. “Don’t blame yourself, OK? Besides, I’m fine. See?” I wiggled the fingers on my good hand. “I didn’t—I couldn’t—even come see you. The one time I was here, I freaked out. I thought you were going to die. Everyone said you almost had and that your mom was going to have to pull your life support. I-I’m the worst friend, Everly.” The dam finally gave way, and her tears poured down her cheeks. She hastily wiped them away—her nose red, her mascara now smudged. “You’re not the worst friend. Not even close.” I gave her hand a tiny squeeze. “Don’t beat yourself up, Nina. I’m fine. Really. I’m not mad at you. I’ve missed you.” “Really?” she sniffled and wiped at her eyes. “Really,” I assured her, giving her the best smile I could muster. “I’m sorry I didn’t call you when I woke up. I-I just didn’t really want anyone to see me like this.” “I understand.” She wiped at her eyes again, smudging her makeup further. “Your mom told my mom the day you woke up. I had to work up the courage to come see you.” “All is forgiven. I promise.” I gave a big yawn, my eyelids heavy. I didn’t want to fall asleep, so I had to keep the conversation going. “How is everyone?” “You were really big news there for a while.” She smiled sheepishly at me. “Everyone at school was talking about you. Here,” she released my hand and pulled out her phone and showed me a photo of my locker. There were flowers strewn around it—some on the floor, some propped up against it with writing scrawled across the door. It was too small to see, but I assumed it was words of encouragement and well-wishes. It touched my heart a little. I didn’t realize anyone really gave a damn. I wasn’t that big a deal, not even when Dylan and I were dating. The only reason people knew my name was because of him and Nina. Without them, I’d have faded away into high school obscurity, just another face in the yearbook. “Wow,” I murmured, studying the photo. “And just to answer the question you haven’t asked, Dylan is a mess,” she stated matter-of-factly, her shoulders relaxing a bit, her tears now gone. “Why?” I asked, crinkling my brows. I remembered he seemed pretty broken up that night. He hadn’t bothered to check on me since it happened though. “He blames himself. Said it was all his fault. He hasn’t really said what happened that night. I tried to talk to him about it, but he just clams up. So?” “So?” I parroted innocently, knowing damn well what she wanted. “What really happened, Ever? Why were you out of the car? There are all sorts of rumors flying around school. Some people say you were mad at Dylan for embarrassing you and you two fought. Some say you were trying to get him out of the car so you could leave him there. S-some even say you jumped in front of the car to kill yourself to get back at Dylan over Brit. What really happened?” “Ugh.” I rubbed my eyes, annoyed that people had nothing better to do with their time than to speculate how I almost died. “I don’t even know. It was stupid. Yes, we were arguing. He was wasted and annoying me. I got out and was going to just walk home. Leave his sorry ass there. He got out and tried to take the keys from me. It was an accident. He grabbed the keys, and I fell backward and well, you know. Car. Uh, SUV, actually. I don’t remember much after that. He was upset. I just remember it hurting and being scared. He stayed by my side though, so there’s that.” I bit my bottom lip before continuing, a flash of Shadow in my mind. I’d started having flashes of him—his red eyes, his warm touch—two days prior to Nina’s visit, but when I tried to dig deeper, it all faded away. It was hard to tell if it was real or just part of my brain injury. I wanted to tell her about Shadow, but I also didn’t want to sound like a lunatic, so I kept my mouth closed for the time being. I’d accepted that my brain was just firing randomly and he’d probably been a figment of my imagination because I’d seen him earlier that night. “I-I don’t blame him. Dylan. Whatever people are saying is a bunch of crap. It was just an accident.” “Wow.” Nina shook her head, her blonde hair spilling over her shoulders. “It was his fault. I mean, maybe he didn’t mean for it to happen, but it did because he was being a jackass.” “It wasn’t really anyone’s fault.” I frowned, not sure why I was defending him. He’d done me dirty with Brit and didn’t deserve an ounce of my time or compassion, but old habits died hard, and I couldn’t stop myself from trying to protect him. “He was drunk, and I was just being me. I’m not dead, so it’s all good.” “But you were almost dead, Ever! It’s not all good. You even almost died again. They said you had no brain activity. Your mom said she was going to-to let you go. Seriously. A machine was breathing for you. I came in here, not believing it, but it was true. You were so pale, so cold. It was like you were a shell. You were dead for three days.” “What?” I asked, my eyebrows shooting upward in surprised confusion. “I wasn’t dead, Nina.” “Well, a machine was breathing for you, and you had no brain waves or whatever. That equals dead. You were on a freaking machine for almost two weeks. You couldn’t even breathe on your own. My mom said they were going to put a trach thing in you. You narrowly missed it. If you hadn’t woken up when you did, you’d have a freaking tube coming out of your throat right now.” “Guess I lucked out,” I joked weakly, my heart pounding wildly in my chest. Nina’s words made my stomach churn. My mom and Dr. Sanders had failed to mention that little bit of information to me. “You really did,” she replied seriously. “I want to kill Dylan right now.” “No one else needs to suffer.” I waved her off tiredly. She gazed incredulously back at me with her large blue eyes. “What?” “How are you so-so… easygoing about this?” she demanded, her full lips turned down into a frown. “I went with your mom to pick out your casket.” “Did you get it?” “Get what?” “The casket,” I rolled my eyes. “You can’t be serious,” she squeaked. “It was the second worst experience of my life, Ever! The first was hearing the news about you and seeing that it was true. Don’t joke about that. I’m still having nightmares.” “I’m sorry,” I apologized softly, my eyes not meeting hers. “It’s just, it’s hard for me too, Nina. I-I feel different now. And it’s not just because I hurt and feel like crap. It’s something else. I can’t explain it. Can I tell you something without you thinking I’m crazy?” “Of course,” she answered, her brows furrowed as she studied me. “I-I think I saw someone in my mirror,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “And that night…I-I think there was someone there with me. Like a guardian angel or something.” “What?” she asked sounding confused. “Like, I opened my makeup compact and there was this tunnel in the mirror. There was a man standing at the end of it. He was watching me. It freaked me out. And then I keep getting these flashes of this shadow man with red eyes. He was with me that night. I-I think he saved me.” “Seriously?” Nina asked, cringing. “Yeah, and I keep hearing voices, but they sound far away. I can’t make out what they’re saying.” Nina’s face fell, but she quickly forced a smile back onto it. “Maybe it’s because you hit your head. You’re still healing, Ever. That sort of thing takes time, right? I’m sure in a few weeks it’ll all go away. I mean, we all know it was just you, Dylan, and the driver there that night. That’s it. I’m pretty sure it was just the trauma from the accident making you think there was an angel or a shadow with you. Same goes for the mirror and voices. You’ve been through something really scary. I think you just need some time to heal.” “Right,” I said tightly, nodding. “You’re probably right.” I prayed she was right. The possibility of her being wrong made my stomach clench painfully.",

      "content": "Chapter Eight The following week, I got to go home. I was beyond excited. I couldn’t stand being holed up in that hospital room any longer. The nurses and doctors were great, but there was no place like home. Mom had fixed up the spare bedroom downstairs. That gave me easy access to the kitchen, which was helpful since navigating the stairs in our house seemed like way more effort than it was worth. We argued about her returning to work. She wanted to be home with me, but I wouldn’t have it. Working kept her mind off things and helped her cope. The last thing I wanted was her to be constantly babying me after everything. She’d started working a few shifts again while I was in the hospital and was finally going back full-time tonight. “Do you need anything?” she asked as she wheeled me into my new bedroom. The doctor said I only had about three weeks left before I’d be up on my feet again without so much effort. I couldn’t wait. “No, I’m good.” I gave her a smile, hoping to ease her worries. “I really don’t want to go back to work tonight,” she frowned worriedly, her pretty eyes tired. “I could stay, hon—” “Mom, stop,” I said, sighing. “Nina is coming to stay with me. We’ll be fine. I promise.” “You’re right.” She gave me a watery smile. “I’m just worried. You’re my baby.” “I know, but I swear I feel fine.” I took her hand as I hobbled to my bed and sat down on the edge of it. “I’m just a little tired and sore, but other than that, I’m great. Never better.” She looked at me like she didn’t believe me, but gave herself a little shake before speaking again, “I’m going to leave your pain medication on the table by your bed, OK? Take it if you need it.” She began running through instructions for me, “It’ll probably make you sleepy.” She pulled a couple bottles of water out of her bag and placed those beside the pills and gave me a pointed look. “Just in case you get thirsty.” “Thanks, Mom,” I smiled at her. “I’m going to try for a shower and a nap before Nina gets here.” “OK, sweetie. I’ll order a pizza for you girls. Do you want anything else?” “No,” I yawned, taking the crutches that she’d placed beside me. “I’ll be in the living room if you need me—” “Mom, I’m fine,” I assured her, getting to my feet and hobbling to the bathroom. I didn’t wait for her to respond. She’d coddle me all night if I let her. Once in the bathroom, I closed the door softly behind me and ran a hot shower. I hadn’t been able to have one since before the accident. Everything had been sponges and cool water. I did my best to take my clothes off and get beneath the hot water, adopting an awkward stance with all my weight on one leg and other leg outside the shower, straddling the edge. Washing with one hand took a lot of effort, but when I finished, I felt almost human again. Hobbling out, I dried off and stared at myself in the mirror. A frown pulled my lips down as I noticed a red mark on my shoulder. I rubbed it and winced. It was tender. I leaned closer to the mirror. It looked like an infinity symbol for some reason. My fingers went immediately to the silver infinity hanging around my neck. The mark on my skin wasn’t the same size as the pendant, so it couldn’t be an impression from that. “What the heck?” I muttered, the frown deepening on my face. It wasn’t incredibly large, but it was definitely there. And it definitely resembled an infinity. I touched it gingerly once more. Maybe it was just something from the accident. But how could an accident leave a perfectly shaped infinity mark on me? A quick run through with a brush tamed my hair. Then I gingerly pulled on my favorite plaid pajamas and went back to my room, where I flopped down onto my bed and snuggled deep into my nest of blankets. My eyes had barely closed when the voices started. At first, they sounded far away, almost like I was hearing them through earmuffs, but then they grew. It was like I was in the same room with them—hundreds of them. I covered my ears and shook my head, trying to make them go away, but they were relentless, growing louder and more insistent. “Stop! Stop! STOP!” I whimpered, rocking in my bed. At the hospital, it had only been whisperings and only one or two voices. This time I was being suffocated by them, as their voices closed in on me, shouting for me to acknowledge them. My brain rapidly tried to process each voice and what it said. One was calling to me. “Ever! Everly,” a girlish voice warbled. Others were upset, almost angry. A small few sounded hopeful. “He changed her! He knew it and he did it anyway. He’s just as bad as they are. Now they have a weapon,” one argued with incredulity. “Reborn, that one. She’s been chosen. Hasn’t been a Whisperer in over two hundred years.” “Maybe she’ll help us. Not hurt us,” an optimistic voice said. “We should kill her before they take her,” a hoarse voice rasped. The voices wanted to kill someone. Me? I was losing my mind. Admitting to going crazy didn’t stop the voices echoing around inside of me. “Ever, help me,” a voice cried. “Ever, can you hear me? I’m outside your window. Let me in, please.” “Look at her. She’s so weak. She can never help us. She can’t even help herself,” another scoffed. “SHUT UP!” I screamed, grabbing my lamp and throwing it across the room. It hit the wall and shattered, the glass shards landing with a crash as they exploded upon impact. “Everly?” My mom came rushing into the room breathless, a panicked look on her face. “Honey, what happened? Are you OK?” Her eyes darted from me to the shattered lamp on the floor. “I-I’m fine,” I replied, my voice small and shaking. “I-I heard voices—” “Voices?” she frowned, the cut of confusion and displeasure carved deeply on her mouth, as her eyes swept quickly over my face. “What are you talking about?” “I-I don’t know. Maybe I was dreaming,” I lied hastily, suddenly feeling like the world’s biggest lunatic. The voices had stopped the moment she’d entered the room. I stared up at her from beneath the dark fringe of my bangs guiltily, wondering what the hell was happening to me. “Sweetie,” she sat down on the bed beside me and pushed my hair away from my face. “You’ve been through so much.” She wiped at her tears and drew in a deep breath. “You can talk to me. If you’re really hearing voices, we can get Dr. Sanders to recommend us to another doctor—” “I don’t need a shrink,” I interrupted, pulling away from her. “It might help to talk through some things, Everly,” she sighed, folding her hands in her lap. “You never really dealt with your father leaving or-or any of the things he did. And now this. Sweetheart. You nearly died. Your heart stopped. You weren’t breathing. You’ve had a brain injury. Anything is possible. We can have some more tests done.” “I don’t want more tests done,” I grumbled, rubbing my eyes. “I just want to go to sleep, OK?” “OK,” she gave me a watery smile. The look in her eye said this conversation wasn’t over, just tabled for now as she got to her feet. I closed my eyes and listened as she cleaned up the mess I’d made. “I’m sorry, Mom,” I whispered. “It’s OK, baby,” she replied before the click of the door closing signaled that she’d left. I lay in bed, my heart pounding, hoping that I wouldn’t hear the voices again. When only silence greeted me, I allowed myself to drift off into a fitful sleep before the sound of Nina giggling from my living room woke me. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and looked at the clock. It was nearly eight at night. I couldn’t believe how long I’d slept. I fumbled with my sheets, finally untangling myself from them, and hobbled to the hallway on one crutch. The smell of fresh, buttery popcorn invaded my senses as I tottered down the hallway. As I peered around the corner, I saw Nina sitting on my couch, a bowl of popcorn in her hands, and her phone pressed to her ear. In the background, the television flashed with images from a chick flick she was watching. She must have felt me hovering because she looked over her shoulder at me. Her eyes lit up and a wide grin spread over her pretty face. “Ever is awake. I’ll call you later.” She tossed her phone aside and got to her feet. Her arms were outstretched as she reached out to help me. “I didn’t want to wake you, so I came in here and put on a movie.” She steadied me as I hobbled to the couch and sat down. “How are you feeling?” “Tired,” I admitted. “I bet,” Nina said sympathetically. “Do you want a drink? Your mom left us some sodas.” “Sure,” I answered. Nina got up and went into the kitchen and a tiny buzzing started in my ear. It was like a pesky gnat was circling my head. I shook my head and rubbed my ear, hoping to make it stop, but it grew more insistent. “Here,” Nina handed me a can of soda and the buzzing came to an abrupt stop. I breathed out a sigh of relief and relaxed against the cushions. “I’m watching Sixteen Candles, but we can change it if you want.” “That’s fine,” I grunted, popping the top on my drink and sucking down a mouthful. “I was talking to Dylan today,” Nina started delicately, gauging me for my reaction. When I continued to stare impassively at her, she launched into a more detailed description of her encounter with him. “He asked about you. He wanted me to tell you that he hopes you feel better soon.” I nodded, not really knowing what to say. I didn’t think a game of conversation tag was in order, so I remained quiet. “He’s been seeing Casey. I guess they made it official,” Nina confirmed softly, keeping her blue eyes downcast as she fiddled with a piece of lint on her sweater. I chuckled quietly and shook my head, still not saying anything. “Ever, come on,” Nina urged, her eyes meeting mine. “Say something! He almost freaking killed you for God sake. Don’t you have anything to say?” “I’m happy for him,” I answered, clearing my throat. She stared at me in disbelief. “Are you serious?” “As death.” I gave her a small, sad smile before looking away. I climbed clumsily to my feet, tottering to the side before catching myself on the arm of the couch. I wiped quickly at my tears and turned away before Nina could see. But I wasn’t as fast as I thought I was because she got to her feet and gave me a hug. “It’s OK, Ev,” she sniffled with me. “He’s a jerk.” “I don’t even know why I’m upset,” I chuckled darkly, pulling away and shaking my head, not bothering to dry my tears. What was the point? The cat was out of the bag now. “It’s not like I wanted to be with him anymore. I just thought—I don’t even know what I thought.” I scoffed, “Whatever. I think I’m going to go lie back down.” “Are you sure?” “Yeah. Thanks for coming over. I’m sorry I’m not more fun.” I turned and hobbled back to my room. The buzzing was back in my ears the moment I closed the door behind me. And then the voices started. Again.",

      "content": "Chapter Eight The following week, I got to go home. I was beyond excited. I couldn’t stand being holed up in that hospital room any longer. The nurses and doctors were great, but there was no place like home. Mom had fixed up the spare bedroom downstairs. That gave me easy access to the kitchen, which was helpful since navigating the stairs in our house seemed like way more effort than it was worth. We argued about her returning to work. She wanted to be home with me, but I wouldn’t have it. Working kept her mind off things and helped her cope. The last thing I wanted was her to be constantly babying me after everything. She’d started working a few shifts again while I was in the hospital and was finally going back full-time tonight. “Do you need anything?” she asked as she wheeled me into my new bedroom. The doctor said I only had about three weeks left before I’d be up on my feet again without so much effort. I couldn’t wait. “No, I’m good.” I gave her a smile, hoping to ease her worries. “I really don’t want to go back to work tonight,” she frowned worriedly, her pretty eyes tired. “I could stay, hon—” “Mom, stop,” I said, sighing. “Nina is coming to stay with me. We’ll be fine. I promise.” “You’re right.” She gave me a watery smile. “I’m just worried. You’re my baby.” “I know, but I swear I feel fine.” I took her hand as I hobbled to my bed and sat down on the edge of it. “I’m just a little tired and sore, but other than that, I’m great. Never better.” She looked at me like she didn’t believe me, but gave herself a little shake before speaking again, “I’m going to leave your pain medication on the table by your bed, OK? Take it if you need it.” She began running through instructions for me, “It’ll probably make you sleepy.” She pulled a couple bottles of water out of her bag and placed those beside the pills and gave me a pointed look. “Just in case you get thirsty.” “Thanks, Mom,” I smiled at her. “I’m going to try for a shower and a nap before Nina gets here.” “OK, sweetie. I’ll order a pizza for you girls. Do you want anything else?” “No,” I yawned, taking the crutches that she’d placed beside me. “I’ll be in the living room if you need me—” “Mom, I’m fine,” I assured her, getting to my feet and hobbling to the bathroom. I didn’t wait for her to respond. She’d coddle me all night if I let her. Once in the bathroom, I closed the door softly behind me and ran a hot shower. I hadn’t been able to have one since before the accident. Everything had been sponges and cool water. I did my best to take my clothes off and get beneath the hot water, adopting an awkward stance with all my weight on one leg and other leg outside the shower, straddling the edge. Washing with one hand took a lot of effort, but when I finished, I felt almost human again. Hobbling out, I dried off and stared at myself in the mirror. A frown pulled my lips down as I noticed a red mark on my shoulder. I rubbed it and winced. It was tender. I leaned closer to the mirror. It looked like an infinity symbol for some reason. My fingers went immediately to the silver infinity hanging around my neck. The mark on my skin wasn’t the same size as the pendant, so it couldn’t be an impression from that. “What the heck?” I muttered, the frown deepening on my face. It wasn’t incredibly large, but it was definitely there. And it definitely resembled an infinity. I touched it gingerly once more. Maybe it was just something from the accident. But how could an accident leave a perfectly shaped infinity mark on me? A quick run through with a brush tamed my hair. Then I gingerly pulled on my favorite plaid pajamas and went back to my room, where I flopped down onto my bed and snuggled deep into my nest of blankets. My eyes had barely closed when the voices started. At first, they sounded far away, almost like I was hearing them through earmuffs, but then they grew. It was like I was in the same room with them—hundreds of them. I covered my ears and shook my head, trying to make them go away, but they were relentless, growing louder and more insistent. “Stop! Stop! STOP!” I whimpered, rocking in my bed. At the hospital, it had only been whisperings and only one or two voices. This time I was being suffocated by them, as their voices closed in on me, shouting for me to acknowledge them. My brain rapidly tried to process each voice and what it said. One was calling to me. “Ever! Everly,” a girlish voice warbled. Others were upset, almost angry. A small few sounded hopeful. “He changed her! He knew it and he did it anyway. He’s just as bad as they are. Now they have a weapon,” one argued with incredulity. “Reborn, that one. She’s been chosen. Hasn’t been a Whisperer in over two hundred years.” “Maybe she’ll help us. Not hurt us,” an optimistic voice said. “We should kill her before they take her,” a hoarse voice rasped. The voices wanted to kill someone. Me? I was losing my mind. Admitting to going crazy didn’t stop the voices echoing around inside of me. “Ever, help me,” a voice cried. “Ever, can you hear me? I’m outside your window. Let me in, please.” “Look at her. She’s so weak. She can never help us. She can’t even help herself,” another scoffed. “SHUT UP!” I screamed, grabbing my lamp and throwing it across the room.

Come let me out. I can grant a wish. Save me,” a hypnotic promise. “She’s lying, Ever. Come help me. I’m under your bed. If you don’t help me, I’ll grab your feet the next time you stand too close,” a sinister voice bellowed. “She won’t come, you fools. She needs to die and be done with it. We can deal with her when she’s here,” another cackled. “Stop it!” I shouted, covering my ears and losing my balance. I fell to the floor with a heavy thump. The air escaped my lungs, leaving me gasping painfully. “Ever?” Nina burst into my room and ran to my side, her eyes flashing fearfully. “Oh my God. What do I do? Should I call your mom?” “Give me my pain pills,” I groaned out. My ribs ached. My leg and arm screamed at me. And all the while the voices got louder. The voices only I seemed to be able to hear. I covered my ears and rocked back and forth on the floor as tears streamed down my face. “Exactly like her father. The pills won’t silence us forever.” “The alcohol might,” another voice added miserably. “It worked for him.” “Shit,” I groaned, grabbing the bottle from Nina’s hand and downing two of the pills without bothering to ask for a glass of water. Nina stared wide-eyed at me. “Ever…those are really strong. Do you think you should’ve taken two of them?” she asked sounding worried, her eyes wavering. “Water, please,” I croaked out, ignoring her worries. A pill felt like it was stuck in my throat. Nina grabbed a bottle of water from my nightstand and handed it to me. I drank down half of it, breathlessly, before handing it back to her. She helped me to sit up, and I almost leaned against my bed until I remembered what the voice had said about being under it. I got to my feet with her help. The voices started to fade away. My brow was dotted with sweat and my hands shook. “Nina, can you bring my pillow and blanket out to the living room? I think I’ll sleep out there tonight,” my voice was weak, and I trembled with fear. “Sure,” she said moving to the edge of my bed and grabbing my pillow. A scream slipped through my lips, as a blackened hand reached out from beneath the bed and swiped at her bare leg. Its nails were broken and jagged. Blood covered what wasn’t already black with decay. It went right through her leg without her batting a lash. The smell of death and decay filled my nostrils—a putrid smell, heavy in the air, clinging to it, making the room seem smaller as the smell grew stronger. I gagged a little as I whimpered. “What’s wrong?” she asked, her face displaying how worried she was as she turned to look at me. I was vaguely aware of the sound of my own heartbeat in my ears. “Ever! What’s wrong?” “I-I gotta get out of here. I-I can’t-,” I stumbled backward, catching myself on the edge of my dresser. A set of dark eyes peered out at me from beneath the bed A growl emanated from its twisted, bleeding lips. “Ever, wait!” Nina rushed at me, steadying me as I fell back a step, my gaze locked with the being peering out at me from under my bed. Clearly, she couldn't hear the voices or see the thing glaring at me. And that made me feel even crazier. “I’ll wait for you,” it hissed before backing away to the shadows beneath the bed—the very place I knew was now home to more than just that monster. “G-get me out of here, Nina,” I choked out. Nina did as I commanded, steering me to the doorway of my bedroom, but not before I noticed my closet door creaking open and a hand reaching around the door jam. Its fingernails tapped as if letting me know it would wait too.",

      "content": "Chapter Ten The pills hit me hard and fast, and before I knew it, I was out. I didn’t wake up the entire night, for which I was grateful. The sweet smell of pancakes roused me. Sitting up from my nest on the couch, I looked to see Nina stretching on an adjacent couch—her blonde hair in a messy ponytail and her makeup smeared on her face. “Good morning.” Mom popped her head in and grinned. She’d changed from her emergency room scrubs to a comfortable pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. “I’m making pancakes. Chocolate chip or blueberry? You pick.” She disappeared back into the kitchen humming a song. “Is she serious?” Nina groaned, rubbing her eyes. “Yep,” I answered, pushing my hair out of my face. “She loves making breakfast. You should see what she makes for Christmas morning.” “Wow. I’m lucky if my mom throws me a package of Pop-Tarts,” Nina chuckled as she stood up. She helped me to my feet, and I hobbled along with a crutch under my good arm into the kitchen. My mom was a fantastic cook. It smelled like heaven in the kitchen, and despite my rotten night, I was eager to eat something. “Chocolate chip or blueberry?” she asked, placing a plate in front of me, a spatula in her hand. “Both,” I said, licking my lips. She chuckled and put one of each on my plate, then added some fresh fruit. “This looks amazing, Mrs. Torres,” Nina exclaimed, sitting down and pulling her plate toward her. My mom grinned widely and gave me a wink. The smile faltered on my face as the buzzing started in my ears again. I shook my head quickly hoping to silence it, but it grew more intense. And then the low hiss of the voices invaded my senses. “Ever, look at me. I’m right here.” “Tiny thing, isn’t she? Don’t know how she’s ever going to make it. . .” “He’ll come and take her. Then we’ll be doomed. She still doesn’t acknowledge us. Ever, look behind you. You stupid girl.” “Our world is in turmoil and she’s eating.” “WHY WON’T YOU NOTICE ME!” “Stop! STOP IT!” I shouted. My fork dropped to the floor with a loud clatter, as I pressed my hands to my ears, and shook my head frantically. “Stop! Please!” “Ever!” Mom stared at me horrified, frozen in place, her plate of pancakes clutched tightly in her hands. Nina looked frightened as she gaped open-mouthed at me. “Make them stop, Mamá. Please!” I begged, sobbing, my eyes pleading with her to make the voices go away. “Make what stop, baby?” she whispered, finally thawing from her horrified position and rushing over to me, wrapping her arms around me tightly after she placed the plate of pancakes on the table. “The voices. The-the people. . . the dead people. Make them go away!” “Ever?” Nina asked, climbing to her feet and backing away, as her eyes flicked cautiously around the room, no doubt looking for what I was talking about. “Sweetie, there’s nothing here,” Mom murmured, pushing my hair out of my face. “There’s nothing, Mija.” “There is,” I whispered in a trembling voice. My hands fell away from my ears. “They’re everywhere.” “Mrs. Torres?” Nina asked, her voice shaky as she peered around the room. “Nina, get my phone,” my mother’s voice was eerily calm. Her arms remained around me. “Fetch my purse as well. It’s hanging on the hook by the door.” Nina scurried off, knocking her chair over with a clatter in the process, and returned a few moments later with my mom’s phone and purse. My mom dug through it quickly and pulled out a bottle of pills and handed me one. “Take this,” she said evenly. I opened my mouth, eager for any relief since the voices had turned into a loud roar that was making me dizzy. I swallowed down the pill with a cool glass of water Nina handed me. “Nina, please, stay with Ever.” Nina nodded and knelt beside me as my mom took her phone and dialed someone. A moment later a man’s voice came on the line, his words indistinct. She cast a hasty look at me before she left the room. I could hear her hurried murmurings, but was unable to make out what she was saying. I chuckled bitterly as I thought about the irony of it—I could hear voices that no one else could, yet I couldn’t hear my own mother talking to someone one room over. “Ever,” Nina said softly, her warm hand rubbing my back. “It’s going to be OK.” “No, it’s not,” I whispered, my voice shaking as Shadow entered the room from the living room as if he’d just been hanging out the whole time. His red-eyed gaze focused on me. Something inside me lit up at his presence. Words from weeks ago as I lay dying on the cold, black pavement poured into my mind—everything was going to change, and I’d never be the same again. I stared at Shadow with wavering eyes as the voices continued screaming out at me. He took a silent step toward me, his red eyes burning in his black form. Silence followed him, and I breathed out slowly, voicing the words I knew in my heart to be true. “Everything will never be OK again.”",

      "content": "Chapter Ten The pills hit me hard and fast, and before I knew it, I was out. I didn’t wake up the entire night, for which I was grateful. The sweet smell of pancakes roused me. Sitting up from my nest on the couch, I looked to see Nina stretching on an adjacent couch—her blonde hair in a messy ponytail and her makeup smeared on her face. “Good morning.” Mom popped her head in and grinned. She’d changed from her emergency room scrubs to a comfortable pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. “I’m making pancakes. Chocolate chip or blueberry? You pick.” She disappeared back into the kitchen humming a song. “Is she serious?” Nina groaned, rubbing her eyes. “Yep,” I answered, pushing my hair out of my face. “She loves making breakfast. You should see what she makes for Christmas morning.” “Wow. I’m lucky if my mom throws me a package of Pop-Tarts,” Nina chuckled as she stood up. She helped me to my feet, and I hobbled along with a crutch under my good arm into the kitchen. My mom was a fantastic cook. It smelled like heaven in the kitchen, and despite my rotten night, I was eager to eat something. “Chocolate chip or blueberry?” she asked, placing a plate in front of me, a spatula in her hand. “Both,” I said, licking my lips. She chuckled and put one of each on my plate, then added some fresh fruit. “This looks amazing, Mrs. Torres,” Nina exclaimed, sitting down and pulling her plate toward her. My mom grinned widely and gave me a wink. The smile faltered on my face as the buzzing started in my ears again. I shook my head quickly hoping to silence it, but it grew more intense. And then the low hiss of the voices invaded my senses. “Ever, look at me. I’m right here.” “Tiny thing, isn’t she? Don’t know how she’s ever going to make it. . .” “He’ll come and take her. Then we’ll be doomed. She still doesn’t acknowledge us. Ever, look behind you. You stupid girl.” “Our world is in turmoil and she’s eating.” “WHY WON’T YOU NOTICE ME!” “Stop! STOP IT!” I shouted. My fork dropped to the floor with a loud clatter, as I pressed my hands to my ears, and shook my head frantically. “Stop! Please!” “Ever!” Mom stared at me horrified, frozen in place, her plate of pancakes clutched tightly in her hands. Nina looked frightened as she gaped open-mouthed at me. “Make them stop, Mamá. Please!” I begged, sobbing, my eyes pleading with her to make the voices go away. “Make what stop, baby?” she whispered, finally thawing from her horrified position and rushing over to me, wrapping her arms around me tightly after she placed the plate of pancakes on the table. “The voices. The-the people. . . the dead people. Make them go away!” “Ever?” Nina asked, climbing to her feet and backing away, as her eyes flicked cautiously around the room, no doubt looking for what I was talking about. “Sweetie, there’s nothing here,” Mom murmured, pushing my hair out of my face. “There’s nothing, Mija.” “There is,” I whispered in a trembling voice. My hands fell away from my ears. “They’re everywhere.” “Mrs. Torres?” Nina asked, her voice shaky as she peered around the room. “Nina, get my phone,” my mother’s voice was eerily calm. Her arms remained around me. “Fetch my purse as well. It’s hanging on the hook by the door.” Nina scurried off, knocking her chair over with a clatter in the process, and returned a few moments later with my mom’s phone and purse. My mom dug through it quickly and pulled out a bottle of pills and handed me one. “Take this,” she said evenly. I opened my mouth, eager for any relief since the voices had turned into a loud roar that was making me dizzy. I swallowed down the pill with a cool glass of water Nina handed me. “Nina, please, stay with Ever.” Nina nodded and knelt beside me as my mom took her phone and dialed someone.

      "content": "Chapter Eleven My mom swept me off to the doctor after breakfast, which I didn’t even bother to finish eating. Nina tried to stay with us, but I assured her that I was fine and that I’d call her once we got home. She relented, complaining the whole time like I figured she would. I didn’t want her to be a part of whatever was happening to me. I didn’t want her to see me that way. And we were off. “Everly, honey, we’re going to meet with Dr. Brighton. Dr. Sanders recommended him,” Mom said, wheeling the car into a parking space in a large, empty parking lot. “He practices on Sundays?” I asked skeptically as I gazed up at the plain, brown brick building in front of us. “When I spoke to him earlier, he was more than willing to see you immediately.” She gave me a forced smile, the fear very real in her brown eyes as she turned to look at me. “Mom? Do you think I’m crazy?” I whispered, my eyes not meeting hers, my voice hoarse. I played with a piece of lint on my pants waiting for her to answer. “No, sweetheart. I don’t think you’re crazy. You endured a very traumatic experience. I think you might need some help sorting through some things. You had a brain injury as well. Perhaps something isn’t healing the way it should or-or maybe something was damaged that we didn’t see on the scans. We’re going to figure it out, and then everything will be fine. I promise.” She gave me a watery smile. “Dr. Sanders has put in the order for more scans tomorrow. Dr. Brighton comes highly recommended by Dr. Sanders. He’s going to talk to you to see if there’s something he can do to help until we get more answers.” “OK,” I answered, swallowing hard as the buzzing started in my ears again. They were like angry little gnats, with their incessant demands to be heard overpowering everything around me. I managed to weakly get out of the car, then followed my mom into the building. Despite the drab exterior of the building, the inside was immaculate. The smell of chlorine greeted us at the door. A working fountain splashed in the center of the lobby. The floors were polished marble, the kind that were so shiny that I could almost see my reflection in them. The lush green foliage added just the perfect touch to the interior. I gaped in awe at it all. We didn’t bother to stop and look at the directory on the wall. Mom seemed to know where she was going, so I followed her wordlessly to the elevator. She pushed the large number two, and we ascended to the second floor where Dr. Brighton’s office apparently was. The voices were dull, in the distance almost. I drew in a shaky breath as we entered the third door on the right and was surprised to find the doctor waiting for us at the entrance to the waiting room. “Ms. Torres, Everly, I’m Dr. Brighton.” He gave me a warm smile as he opened the door revealing the hall that must have went to his office. He was middle-aged and in good shape. I suppose one might even go as far as calling him handsome with his dark hair and gray eyes. A goatee peppered with a smattering of gray adorned his chin. “Dr. Brighton,” my mom shook his hand and gave him a wobbly smile. “Please, call me Elena.” “And call me Ever,” I said softly. He gave me a kind smile before turning to my mom. “Elena,” he smiled warmly at her and shook her hand. “If you have anything you need to do in town, feel free to do so. I’ve received Ever’s file from Dr. Sanders, and I’d like to take some time to speak to Ever privately if you don’t mind. Perhaps we can get something underway for her today.” “That would be wonderful.” Mom gave me a watery smile, her hand touching her chest. “She’s been through so much.” “I understand,” he answered, his stormy eyes finding mine before giving me a reassuring smile. “Please, Ever, step this way. Elena, we’ll be about an hour. That’s usually what my sessions run. You can wait out here or run some errands. The choice is yours.” “I do need to get a few things at the grocery store,” Mom said as she looked at me worriedly. “Don’t worry,” Dr. Brighton assured her. “She’ll be just fine here.” “Ever, do you want me to stay?” my mom asked, her face pinched with worry. “Mom, it’s fine. Go. I’ll be here when you get back.” I gave her the best smile I could muster, and she relented, backing away. “Come on, Ever,” Dr. Brighton motioned for me to follow him. We entered a room that looked comfortable, but generic. It was the stereotypical shrink’s office right down to the tan leather sofa and chair in the center. There was a desk in the back of the room with all his degrees hanging on the wall behind it. Various serene photos lined the walls, and there were vases filled with colorful flowers throughout the space. “Have a seat.” He motioned to the couch. I sat down on it nervously, the leather making a creaking noise beneath my weight. His eyes focused on me as he sank into the leather chair. “So… Your mom tells me you’ve been having auditory hallucinations since your accident.” “No,” I shook my head. “I-I just didn’t sleep well the night before—” “Ever.” He sat forward and fixed me with a steely look. “There’s no need to hide it. These things can happen after a traumatic event—in your case, a brain injury.” “So, let’s say I did hear something,” I said delicately after a moment, my eyebrow raised as I picked absently at bits of fuzz on my sweater. “What would happen to me?” “Well,” he answered thoughtfully, sitting back in his chair and steepling his fingertips in a contemplative manner. “I think it depends on a few factors. Perhaps we could help you by prescribing some medicines that can help with that sort of thing. We need to find the root cause first, though. Dr. Sanders seems to think everything looked good on your most recent scans. He wouldn’t have released you if they weren’t. So that begs us to address another possible issue. So… Tell me about it. I want to help you, Ever.” “And no one will know? It’s just between me and you?” “Absolutely. I only share with your mother what you want me to share,” his voice was firm and reassuring. “OK.” I swallowed hard, fidgeting nervously in my seat. “May I have some water?” “Of course.” He got to his feet and came back with a glass of water and placed it on the coffee table in front of me. I picked it up and drank down half of it before wiping my mouth and taking a deep breath. “It started when I was three,” I said softly. Dr. Brighton raised his eyebrows at me, but didn’t say anything so I continued, “There was this shadow. A small one. Like my size. He never left. Like, I mean he did, but he always came back. He seemed to grow with me. As I got older, bigger, so did he. He never spoke to me. He’d just appear in my bedroom and watch me.” Dr. Brighton jotted things on his yellow legal pad the whole time I spoke. He paused and looked up at me. “And do you still see this shadow?” Dr. Brighton asked, scribbling on his pad of paper. “Yes,” I answered hoarsely. “I stopped seeing it for a few years. I learned to block it all out. Before I learned to do that, these-these people would stand over me at night and ask me for things—help, my soul, lots of things. I was so scared growing up.” “And your father? Where was he?” “It’s not a daddy issue,” I muttered, bitterly giving him a dirty look. “That’s not what I’m suggesting here, Ever.” “He was there until I was twelve. Then he left.” “How was your relationship with him?” “I don’t know.” I shook my head. “Turbulent. Abusive. He hit me and my mom. He used to tie me up and put me in a dark closet while screaming incoherently. He was an alcoholic.” “I see,” Dr. Brighton scribbled more on his pad of paper. “Did you stop seeing things after he left?” I frowned. I’d never thought about it before. “Uh, actually, yes,” I answered, still frowning. “And then after your accident, they’ve come back?” “Yes, I suppose so,” I muttered. “They’re worse now. I did see the shadow before the accident, though.” “I see. And these voices, what are they saying to you? Do they tell you to hurt yourself?” “No,” I shook my head. “They ask me to see them, to let them in, to listen to them.” “Have you seen them this time around? Or is it just auditory?” “I-I’ve seen them,” I answered softly, shivering as I recalled the creatures from my closet and under my bed. “I’m afraid.” “Tell me, Ever,” Dr. Brighton leaned closer, his voice low. “Do you think they’re real?” “I…No.” I shook my head before sighing and looking him in the eyes, my heart hammering in my chest. “Yes.” “And therein lies the problem.” He gave me a small smile. “That’s where the line between reality and psychosis is. It’s the belief.” “So, I’m crazy?” I asked lamely, choking on the words. “No.” He shook his head at me. “I don’t think that at all. There are perfectly sane people walking around in the world who believe in things like ghosts. And even some who have captured them on record.” “You think I’m seeing ghosts?” I yelped. Of course. I knew that’s what they had to be if I wasn’t crazy, but hearing him address it so casually made it that much more terrifying. I think I’d rather be crazy. “It’s one of a million possibilities, Ever. I’m openminded about most things in the world.” He laid his pad and pen on his lap, before leaning forward to continue, “It could very well be related to your brain injury. But because you’ve always seen things, I’m more inclined to say it’s something more than just your body going through a traumatic event. I’m going to recommend that you come see me twice a week. And I’m going to prescribe you some medication to help you sleep at night, plus something to take the edge off. I’m also going to say this to you—I wouldn’t be so afraid of this shadow you’ve seen or think you’ve seen. If he hasn’t harmed you in all these years, I don’t think he will.” He winked at me, a small smile on his lips and went back to scribbling on different pad of paper that he withdrew from his pocket. He acted like this was no big deal, and maybe it wasn’t. He probably dealt with way crazier people than me. My case was probably a walk in the park. He handed me slips of paper with prescriptions scrawled on them and a card with his number on it. “My cell number is on the back. If you need anything, just call me anytime day or night. I’ll be there to help you.” “So, you’re like a really involved shrink?” I frowned looking down at his number scrawled on the back. “Something like that,” he chuckled softly. We both got to our feet, and he ushered me out the door. He seemed somber. Tense. Who knew. Maybe I was imagining that, too. I mean, I was seeing things that no one else could see. Imagining his feelings wasn’t too far out of the ballpark.",

      "content": "Chapter Twelve Immediately after getting my prescriptions filled, I took them and within the hour I felt ridiculously mellow and tired—my mind muddled and fuzzy feeling. When we got home, I lay on the couch and zonked out. And that’s how the next few weeks went, I lived in a pharmaceutical fog and the voices faded to distant whispers. I’d been going to my appointments with Dr. Brighton and had even done more brain scans on Dr. Sanders’s orders—all those were normal. Dr. Brighton continued to grill me about my past, as well as the things I was seeing and hearing. But because I was so doped up, I didn’t have much to report to him except I still heard the voices in the distance. It struck me as odd that he seemed almost delighted by my accounts, as he rushed to write everything down on his pad of paper. It was well into summer break before I was able to move around without my crutches and grimaces of pain. Nina came over after my latest session with Dr. Brighton, and we went out to get ice cream. When we got back, she’d wanted to come inside, but I was exhausted and told her I was just going to nap. We said our goodbyes, and I went into the house. I limped to the couch and flopped down, falling into a deep sleep. When I woke up, it was late in the evening. I got up and rubbed my eyes, my head still feeling weird. “Mom? Mamá?” I called out. “¿Dónde estás?” I hobbled through the downstairs, frowning when she didn’t answer. I called out loudly to her three more times, receiving no response. She wouldn’t just leave me, and I knew she didn’t have to work. It took forever, but I managed to make it up the stairs. I knocked on her bedroom door before cracking it open and going inside. “Mamá?” Silence greeted me. I stepped up to her bed where she had a box of old photos opened. Scooping up a handful, I smiled down at the pictures of me and her together at the park, at Christmas, with grandma. And then there was one with me and my dad. He was grinning widely, his green eyes—the same color as mine—alight with humor, his dark hair a mess on his head, as he sat in his favorite chair with his arm around me. I must have been about three years old. We both looked so happy. So normal. My lips parted as I peered more closely at the photo. In the background, surrounding us, were dozens of creatures—maybe humans. Possibly the dead. Some looked like they were screaming in pain, others in anguish, and some were just watching. How anyone could miss seeing them was beyond me. My hands trembled as I held the photo. I wasn’t crazy. I wasn’t crazy! A loud crash pulled me from my thoughts, and my head snapped up to see a vase of flowers had smashed to the floor. I took a step back, the photo still clutched in my hands. “Everrr, come child,” a voice beckoned. “No,” I whispered, backing away, shaking my head. “We’re coming. We are many. You cannot run! You must dieeeee!” “Leave me alone,” I screamed, looking around the room frantically as I tried to find where the voice was coming from. Wicked laughter surrounded me. I covered my ears with my hands, shaking, sobbing, as I tried to block it out. Cold bit my skin, making me shiver. “We will get you, girl.” A nasty, black figure broke through the mirror on my mother’s vanity causing the glass to shatter into bits around me. I screamed and fell onto my backside, my still tender ankle and wrist protesting as I tried to crabwalk away. The gnarled, bony body came at me on all fours like a spider might skitter toward its prey. It was covered in blood and soot and things I didn’t want to even think about. Its hair was matted and dirty. Hollow holes marked the area where eyes should’ve been. In its hand, a shard of glass gleamed in the setting sunlight that streamed in through the open window. I was on my back, propped up by my elbows. My chest ached with every breath I tried desperately to rake in. Its face was only inches from mine. Breath soured with death and decay blew across my face. Blood dripped from its mouth onto my white tank top as it glared at me with its sightless eyes. I was frozen in fear while I waited for whatever would happen next. The thing whipped its arm back and brought the shard of broken mirror down onto my arms over and over, stabbing into my tender skin. I screamed from the sheer agony as my flesh was torn. Blood pooled around me, running from my arms like a river. Maniacal laughter echoed from the creature—the ghost—as I bled and sobbed on the floor of my mother’s bedroom. “Ever! Oh my God! Ever!” My mom ran into the room, her face a mask of terror. The creature over me disappeared as quickly as it had appeared, leaving me hurting and panting on the floor. “Mija, what did you do,” my mom choked out. I looked down at my bleeding arms and sputtered on my shock. I was clutching the shard from the broken mirror in my hand, still etching it into my flesh. “I-I didn’t, Mamá.” I shook my head, tears streaming down my face. “It-it was them. I swear.” “Dios míos.” My mom rushed to her bathroom and brought back two towels, wrapping my arms tightly. “Mom, I’m scared,” I whispered, shaking. “Me too, baby,” she murmured, her eyes wavering as she looked at me. “We need to go to the hospital. I’m going to call an ambulance. Stay right there. I’ll be right—” “No,” I interrupted, shaking my head vigorously and reaching out desperately to her with my good arm. “Please, don’t leave me.” “Sweetie, look at me.” She took my face in her hands and made me look at her. “I will be right back. I promise.” “No,” I choked out as she got to her feet. She rushed from the room, her footfalls on the stairs echoing in my ears.",

When we got home, I lay on the couch and zonked out. And that’s how the next few weeks went, I lived in a pharmaceutical fog and the voices faded to distant whispers. I’d been going to my appointments with Dr. Brighton and had even done more brain scans on Dr. Sanders’s orders—all those were normal. Dr. Brighton continued to grill me about my past, as well as the things I was seeing and hearing.

      "content": "Chapter Thirteen I was sick of hospitals and doctors. I’d seen more doctors in the past few weeks than I’d seen in my entire life before the accident. Once again, I found myself sitting in a cold hospital room. The white walls washed all the color from my skin, and made me feel cold and uncomfortable. This time I was totally conscious and very aware of what happened to me. Or what I did to myself. I guess it was just a matter of whose opinion you got. Everyone that had come into my room to talk to me seemed to think I was a danger to myself. I was positive that thing had done it to me, though. Voicing that thought only got me strange looks and a shot of something that made my head feel fuzzy. They stitched up both arms, shooting me concerned and skeptical looks. I was tired of trying to explain to everyone what had happened. I was groggy and tired and just wanted to sleep. Apparently, someone decided to consult Dr. Brighton because to my surprise, he walked into my hospital room later that night. “Ever, how are you?” he greeted me in a serious tone. He looked impeccable with his dark hair combed back perfectly and his straight teeth nearly as white as the walls of the hospital room. “Well,” I chuckled bitterly. “I apparently hallucinated. Then tried to kill myself. I’ve had a bit of a bad day.” “It would appear you have.” He closed the door behind him and sat down in the chair beside my bed. “I told your mom I wanted to speak to you alone. Are we? Alone?” He looked around the room interestedly. “Really?” I snorted dryly. He continued to look serenely at me. I sighed and rolled my eyes. “Yes, we’re alone.” “Good,” he answered. “So, tell me what happened.” I went into detail about the entire thing, even telling him about the photo of me and my father. He nodded and made some notes. When I finished, I sat and waited for his verdict. “And the shadow? Was he there this time?” Dr. Brighton asked. We’d talked at length about how I felt like Shadow wanted to protect me. “No,” I answered softly. “He never came.” “I see.” Something like anger flashed in his eyes before he cleared his throat and made another note on his pad of paper. “I think we’ll double your dosage, Ever. Now, one final question. Do you want to hurt yourself?” “No.” I frowned at the question. “Great. I think we can spring you out of here tonight.” “That’s it? What-what about those things? H-how am I going to go back home and try to sleep? Or even function?” “Well,” he answered delicately as he closed the leather-bound legal pad he’d used to write his notes in. “They may just be figments of your imagination. For the sake of both of us not appearing off, let’s assume they are simply hallucinations due to your injuries and leave it at that. I’ll double your medications. That should keep things at bay, I daresay. You’ll be safe. I promise.” “How can you promise that?” I demanded bitterly, glaring at him. “I saw a thing burst through my mother’s mirror and cut me. Then it had the nerve to make it look like I’d done it to myself. I-I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not.” I looked at him helplessly, silently pleading with him to understand my terror. “It won’t happen again. Let’s just call it intuition.” He got to his feet. “You still have my card?” “Yep,” I muttered, disgusted at everything that was transpiring. “Great. Well, let’s hope I don’t have to see you before your next appointment.” He pulled open the door and started to step out. “Oh, and Ever. Stay away from mirrors. Seven years of bad luck and all that.” He departed, and I scowled after him. If that was his idea of a joke, it sucked.",

Sometimes I didn’t even remember where’d I’d been or how I’d gotten there. It was frustrating. I hated it. On the flipside of it all, I wasn’t really seeing or hearing anything. Or if I was, I had no recollection of it. By the end of the summer, I’d healed completely with the exception of the strange mark on my shoulder. Maybe it was a scar and would be there forever. I didn’t leave my house often, and I spent most of my time alone. Ever since my accident, I didn’t like to be around people, not even Nina or my mom. I felt different, more than I’d ever felt before. This overwhelming, nagging feeling of not belonging continued to plague me. I couldn’t shake it. My appointments with Dr. Brighton continued. When I mentioned how weird things seemed, he’d make a note, nod, and then ask me how it made me feel. I didn’t feel like we were really getting anywhere with the therapy, something I made mention of at every visit. He’d added a new anti-anxiety medication to my ever-growing list of pharmaceuticals. I’d snatched it out of his hand with a scowl, all while telling him I didn’t suffer from anxiety disorders. There was something seriously out there trying to get me. Even if I couldn’t see them or hear them anymore, I could feel them lurking just beyond the veil of heavy drugs and the delusions that everything would be OK. Annoyed that he didn’t seem to be taking me seriously, I started telling him I wasn’t hearing or seeing anything anymore. He simply looked at me impassively and made more notes on his yellow legal pad, then offered me a piece of green, hard candy that tasted very sweet with a hint of mint. It was actually rather enjoyable. But when he asked me if I liked it, I’d only grunted. He’d made another note on his paper before proclaiming our session over. “Ever? Earth to Ever,” Nina’s voice cut through my brooding thoughts during our lunch period on the first Friday back since the new school year started. “Huh?” I asked, looking at her in a daze made possible by the latest round of morning meds. “I asked if you wanted to go to Jax’s party tomorrow. I mean, you don’t have to. I don’t want you to think I’m making you—” “Thanks, I’ll pass,” I mumbled tiredly. I chanced a look over to where Dylan was sitting with his friends and caught him staring at me, a frown on his face. I figured it was because of how I looked—all gaunt and thin, sickly with dark circles under my eyes, limp hair, and dried, cracked lips. When I looked in the mirror, I reminded myself of an old house—the kind that was falling apart but that had once been beautiful. Now it looked haunted. I was haunted. I snorted at the thought and pulled my eyes away from his. He hadn’t spoken to me once since I’d gotten out of the hospital or returned to school. I didn’t expect him to. He was seeing Casey now anyway. So much for love. I got to my feet, the bitter thoughts too much to bear. “You OK?” Nina asked, rising to her feet and looking at me with so much concern and pity it made my stomach turn. Gemma and Beth gazed at me nervously making me wonder if Nina had told them about my hallucinations. “Yeah.” I gave her a forced smile. “Just need some air.” Nina gave me a tight nod, her eyes never leaving me as I backed away from the table. Out of the corner of my eye I made out a creature crawling along the wall. Whenever the meds waned, I started to see them again. It happened every day at that time. I swallowed hard and blinked rapidly, whispering frantically, begging God to make it go away just like my mom had told me to do. It didn’t work. Instead, the creature came more into focus, its scaly, gray skin dripping chunks of flesh and thick, putrid-smelling liquid onto the floor. Its large all-white, sightless eyes glared at me. With abnormally long humanoid fingers and toes ending in four-inch-long claws, the sight of it sent a chill up my spine. The bones protruded from its skin in some spots. “Go away, go away, go away,” I whispered. My hands clenched into fists so hard that my nails dug into my tender flesh tearing the skin on my palms. The creature cocked its head at me and made a funny clicking, hissing noise. I took a shaky step back. My breath leaving my lungs in ragged puffs. Not here. Anywhere but here! Everyone was going to see. “Ever?” Nina’s voice called out to me. It sounded far away. “Ever? Hey!” The creature’s lips opened to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth. A nasty screech emitted from its twisted, ugly mouth. I covered my ears with my hands trying to shield myself from the horrid sounds. And then, the unthinkable happened.",

      "content": "Chapter Fifteen It lunged at me, with teeth barred and claws aiming to tear, to maim, to kill. I fell backward, a scream erupting from deep within me. I desperately tried to scoot away, my hands frantically going out behind me to pull myself away from the nightmare that was before me, but I hit the legs of someone’s innocently eating lunch, thus halting my pathetic plans for an escape. “Ever! Oh my God.” Nina rushed toward me, unknowingly putting herself between me and the creature. I was screaming too hysterically to warn her to move. She let out a scream that matched mine and fell forward as the creature leapt off her, completely invisible to everyone but me. She rolled over and groaned as I stared transfixed, locked in a death gaze with the creature. Its pungent spittle dripped from its hissing mouth, while its forked tongue flicked out, sliding roughly against my skin. I turned my head and whimpered, as its tongue continued to brush against my cheek. My entire body trembled. Its tongue slurped back into its mouth, as it turned its hungry eyes over to Nina, who was trying to sit up. Her forehead was bleeding where she’d smacked it on a chair when she went down. He slinked over to her, hunkered down like a cat getting ready to pounce on a mouse. “N-no,” I choked out. “Y-you will not touch her.” The creature snapped its angry jaws at me, as it eyed me over its shoulder. Its milky white eyes narrowed on me. Someone was going to be its dinner, Nina or me. I could see that by looking into its eyes. It moved back a step, turned back to me, and hunched down, ready to spring. I covered my head, sobbing, as it rushed forward. I sat frozen waiting for the inevitable pain that would accompany its pointed teeth sinking into my flesh. But the pain never came. It never made contact. The shadow from my bedroom appeared out of nowhere and drew a weapon—the same sword he used before—and plunged it through the creature’s body. The creature fell with a yip and a whine to the ground. Its body twitched violently until it exploded, leaving nothing but a spot of black on the floor before fading away to nothing but a few bits of ash in the air. “Ever? Are you OK?” Dylan called out to me. I gazed up at Shadow, my savior, with wide, frightened eyes. He returned my stare with his own red-eyed gaze. I couldn’t see any part of him but darkness. My lower lip quivered as I remained captivated by him. There were so many unsaid words behind his eyes. So many secrets. So many things that frightened me. Was he real? Was this happening? I knew him all too well. He’d been in my thoughts, perhaps only a flash, over the past few weeks. I couldn’t count the number of times I’d struggled to remember the night with him when I’d almost died. I’d been trying to make sense of it—of all of it—and had failed miserably. But there he was, staring me down in the school cafeteria, a picture of mystery for my eyes only. “Ever,” Dylan pulled me to my feet, and I stumbled into him, my eyes still locked on Shadow’s. “We need to get you to the nurse’s office. You hit your head pretty hard.” “I-I,” I stammered, glancing at Dylan before turning to look back at Shadow who was still standing in the same spot, unmoving. His eyes glared red at me, a heat coming from him that I’d never felt before. Was it anger? Was he going to ram his shadowy blade through my abdomen too, so I could join the creature he’d just killed? He didn’t seem the type to harm me. In fact, out of all the crap I’d been seeing and hearing, he was the only one that didn’t want to kill me or scare me. At least that’s what I felt. “Come on.” Dylan tugged me away from the stoic shadow, and I looked around to see that Jax had gotten Nina to her feet. Everyone in the cafeteria looked stunned. Many of them whispered behind their hands, as they looked at me with eyes filled with pity. I allowed him to pull me away, my eyes locked on the very thing I feared but had needed. Shadow gave me a curt nod before turning on his heel and disappearing through the brick wall of the school cafeteria, his heat retreating with him. I didn’t dare think that my hallucinations were warring with one another. That was just crazy talk. Crazy talk from a crazy person.",

      "content": "Chapter Sixteen Dylan didn’t say anything as he helped me to the nurse’s office. It was just as well. I was speechless, still seeing things slithering along the walls and hearing the growls and wails coming from places my mind couldn’t reach out to. I could only imagine what it would be like if I didn’t have my psych meds. But then, the very real thought of how they were breaking through now hit me. I needed something else to make them go away. Something stronger. And I needed it fast. But I didn’t want to ask Dr. Brighton for more. I didn’t even want to mention it to him. He hadn’t questioned me much when I’d said I was no longer experiencing the hallucinations. I didn’t want to revisit all that. He’d seemed hopeful and told me things would get better soon. While I appreciated his optimism, he was full of crap. This wasn’t getting better. It was getting worse. Way worse. “Ever?” Dylan’s soft voice cut through my thoughts, as I huddled even closer to him for the rest of our walk. His arm went around my waist, and I gratefully got closer. His nearness leeched calmness into me as we stopped outside the nurse’s office. I knew I shouldn’t want to feel the comfort of his nearness, but I couldn’t help myself. “I-I can’t go in there,” I whispered hoarsely, gazing forward, my body stiff with fear and apprehension. “It’s OK. Come on. I’m here with you,” he said gently, nudging me forward. “No.” I shook my head vigorously, putting my brakes on. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to go in. I very much wanted to. The problem was, there was some nasty, rotting being hanging by a noose a few feet into the room. Its head was angled oddly with its eyes wide and unblinking on mine. “I’ll go with you,” he coaxed. “Dylan?” I tore my eyes away from the dead body in front of me. “Yeah?” His eyes swept my face quickly. “Can you take me home instead?” I looked back at him and saw what I didn’t want to see—fear, sympathy, and the exact same look my mom wore when she didn’t think I was looking. The look that said she knew I was going crazy, and it was killing her to watch me catch fire and burn. “If that’s what you want,” he answered, his arm tightening around my waist. I nodded, and he wasted no time steering me away from the nurse’s office and outside to his car. I didn’t even bother to retrieve my backpack from my locker. I climbed into the passenger seat, and he closed my door, then got in on his side. We backed out of the parking lot and drove to my place, neither of us saying much. When we pulled into the driveway, he put the car in park and turned to look at me. “Ever, about everything—” “I know. You’re sorry.” I gave him a watery smile. “Yeah,” he breathed out, reaching forward and taking my hand in his. “I mean, it’s been really hard on me.” “I can only imagine the torment you’re going through,” I chuckled bitterly. Whatever he was going through was nothing compared to what I was. He must have taken my words seriously because he answered quickly, “It’s been bad. I felt so guilty. I’ve been worried about you. Are you OK? You seem, I don’t know, off. And you look terrible. No offense.” “I’m not OK, Dylan,” I whispered, watching his eyes widen as he stared back at me. “I’m never going to be OK. You see, I’m crazy. I see dead people. Or at least I think they’re dead. I see creatures that are so terrifying that you couldn’t even imagine them in your worst nightmares. I hear voices. So, I can only imagine what you’re going through when compared to me.” “You hear voices and see things that aren’t there? Are you seeing a doctor about it? Is that what happened to you today?” There was that sympathetic fearful look again. Oh, and there was the “damn, she really is crazy” look. “Yeah, I’m medicated for it,” I answered bitterly, looking away from him. A moment later his fingers brushed against my cheek causing me to turn back to him. “I’m still here for you. You know that, right?” “You’re also there for Casey too,” I replied softly, our eyes meeting. “It’s not like that with her. We’re just…I don’t know. We’re messing around. Having fun, you know? Just waiting for you to come back.” “That’s how you wait for someone?” I mused, snorting a little but not looking away from him. “What do you want me to do, Ever? You made it clear you didn’t want me! I’m just doing whatever. Like I said, I’m still here for you. It’s hard seeing you like this, though. You’re not the same girl I knew—” “That girl pretty much died on the pavement months ago,” I snapped at him. “You were there, remember?” He flinched like I’d struck him. I shook my head and looked down at my hands in my lap. “I’m sorry. I’m on edge. I don’t mean to snap,” I whispered. A moment later Dylan’s arms were around me, hugging me. “I know,” he murmured. “I don’t understand what’s happening to you. I blame myself for it all, though.” “I don’t think it’s all your fault,” I sniffled as I buried my face in his neck, breathing in his familiar scent. How I missed what once held so much pleasure for me. Everything had changed. I hated it. Our problems seemed so insignificant now. “Regardless,” he replied, pulling away from me, raking his eyes over my face, cupping my cheek tenderly with his hand, “I miss you. I didn’t know how much until you were gone… And now I’m afraid you aren’t going to come back.” “I’m afraid you’re right. That girl really is gone,” I murmured as he leaned in, his mouth close to mine. “She’s still in there. I know she is.” His lips brushed against mine, and for a moment, I lost myself in him—the guy I’d once felt so much for. He kissed me gently at first before he pressed his mouth firmer on mine. And I kissed him back with wild abandon. “Why’d you stop?” he breathed out with hooded eyes when I pulled away. “It’s…I just can’t,” I shook my head sadly. “You and Brit. You and Casey—” “Ever, I messed up! Come on. I told you how sorry I was about Brit. And Casey doesn’t mean anything to me. I know you can feel what I feel when you kiss me. Just let go and make yourself happy for once.” “Is that what you tell them?” my voice was barely audible as I looked at him, my heart aching. “What?” He crinkled his brows, confused. “When you kiss them… did you tell them the same thing about me? That I didn’t mean anything?” “Ever, no. No!” He shook his head, a frown on his lips. “I never said that about you. I-I don’t know. I just screwed up. I always wanted to be with you in ways you didn’t want me. I made some mistakes that I wish I could change. If I’d have been a better boyfriend, you wouldn’t be suffering right now.” His fingers gripped mine in a desperate attempt to hold on. “That night with the accident wouldn’t have happened. We’d still be together and planning on what to wear for homecoming and prom. I’d be pulling you into an empty classroom and kissing you right now and telling you how beautiful I think you are. These other girls just don’t hold a candle to you. No one compares. I want you back, Ever. So bad.” He finished with a deep breath, his eyes sad as he stared at me. “I-I can’t. I need some time.” “I’ll give it to you,” he answered quickly, his eyes wide and pleading. “Please, just consider us again.” “And Casey?” “Gone if you want me,” his voice determined and resolute. “I-I don’t know.” I hugged myself, my bottom lip pulled between my teeth as I tried to sort through all the weird emotions going through me. I wanted him. God help me, I did. But it wasn’t right. Not then. Maybe not ever. What could me, a broken girl, even offer him now? What could he, a liar and a cheater, offer me now? If anything, our relationship would just be even more messed up. “Think about it, Ever. I don’t need an answer today. Just get yourself straightened out. I’ll be here.” “OK,” I whispered, swallowing hard. He gave me another gentle kiss, which I accepted despite knowing better, before I got out and walked into my house. I wanted what he offered. I wanted it so much that my heart ached for it. I had way too many confusing thoughts in my head and not enough energy to sort through them. I wanted to be normal again. All I knew was that I had to find a way to numb all my pain. Just like my dad used to do.",

      "title": "Chapter Seventeen",
      "content": "Chapter Seventeen I’d never felt so alone in my life. Everyone was here for me. They seemed to care about me and wanted to help me get better. But they couldn’t. I didn’t suffer from a sickness that could be healed. Deep in my heart, I knew that, and it made the pain that much worse. The only person that might be able to understand was my father. I’d seen the picture. I’d lived through his torment. I became part of his nightmare. The one person that I feared, may be the one person that could offer me the answers I so desperately needed. The realization that my father may have struggled with the same issues made me mad. But if it was true, then I understood his anger, perhaps not how he directed it, but I understood it. When I went into the house after Dylan dropped me off, I picked up Mom’s address book and looked up my dad’s number. I didn’t even know if she had it. I was surprised to find it scribbled in the back. I hadn’t spoken to him in years. I wondered if maybe she had, although it seemed unlikely considering how things went the last time they were near each other. I shook that idea out of my head. My mom hated him and for good reason, but what if. . . Taking a deep breath, I dialed his number and listened as it rang, my heart racing. What was I going to say to him if he answered? Finally, after the eighth ring, I was going to hang it up, but his deep voice came across the line, “Elena?” I stood there with the phone in my hand, unable to speak. I hadn’t heard his voice in so long. It brought tears to my eyes, reminding me of when he used to hold me and read me bedtime stories. “Elena, is that you?” “N-no. It’s me. Ever,” I breathed out, my voice shaking as I held the phone in my trembling hand. “Everly? Is your mom OK? Is there something wrong?” It seemed odd that he’d ask that considering he used to smack us around all the time. Our well-being hadn’t seemed to matter back then. “S-she’s fine, Dad. I-I’m the one who’s sick,” I answered softly, a knot forming in my stomach. “They’ve come, haven’t they?” his voice sounded just as shaky as mine. “I heard about the accident.” “I think they’ve always been there,” I whispered in a choked voice. “I-I need to talk to you.” “Does your mother know you’ve called?” his voice became stronger, and I imagined him straightening to his impressive height as he waited for my answer. “No, but I can’t tell her this. She’s already stressed out. I-I just need to ask you a question, then I promise to leave you alone.” I bit my bottom lip waiting for him to respond. “Are you home?” “Yeah.” “Meet me at Lucinda’s Diner on the edge of town off Old Ten. Do you remember it?” Of course, I remembered it. He used to take me there for their super breakfast special. I’d order the chocolate chip pancakes with whipped cream. “Yes. I’ll leave now.” “Ever, be careful and try to come alone,” he said softly before the line went dead, making me wonder if he meant alone in the same way I did.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen I’d never felt so alone in my life. Everyone was here for me. They seemed to care about me and wanted to help me get better. But they couldn’t. I didn’t suffer from a sickness that could be healed. Deep in my heart, I knew that, and it made the pain that much worse. The only person that might be able to understand was my father. I’d seen the picture. I’d lived through his torment. I became part of his nightmare. The one person that I feared, may be the one person that could offer me the answers I so desperately needed. The realization that my father may have struggled with the same issues made me mad. But if it was true, then I understood his anger, perhaps not how he directed it, but I understood it. When I went into the house after Dylan dropped me off, I picked up Mom’s address book and looked up my dad’s number. I didn’t even know if she had it. I was surprised to find it scribbled in the back. I hadn’t spoken to him in years. I wondered if maybe she had, although it seemed unlikely considering how things went the last time they were near each other. I shook that idea out of my head. My mom hated him and for good reason, but what if. . . Taking a deep breath, I dialed his number and listened as it rang, my heart racing. What was I going to say to him if he answered? Finally, after the eighth ring, I was going to hang it up, but his deep voice came across the line, “Elena?” I stood there with the phone in my hand, unable to speak. I hadn’t heard his voice in so long. It brought tears to my eyes, reminding me of when he used to hold me and read me bedtime stories. “Elena, is that you?” “N-no. It’s me. Ever,” I breathed out, my voice shaking as I held the phone in my trembling hand. “Everly? Is your mom OK? Is there something wrong?” It seemed odd that he’d ask that considering he used to smack us around all the time. Our well-being hadn’t seemed to matter back then. “S-she’s fine, Dad. I-I’m the one who’s sick,” I answered softly, a knot forming in my stomach. “They’ve come, haven’t they?” his voice sounded just as shaky as mine. “I heard about the accident.” “I think they’ve always been there,” I whispered in a choked voice. “I-I need to talk to you.” “Does your mother know you’ve called?” his voice became stronger, and I imagined him straightening to his impressive height as he waited for my answer. “No, but I can’t tell her this.

      "content": "Chapter Eighteen I pulled up to Lucinda’s Diner and looked around. It hadn’t changed much over the years, unless you counted that they’d replaced the blown-out lights in half the neon sign so now it read Lucinda’s Diner and not da’s Diner. The grass was mowed down to nearly the dirt, and the parking lot was still cracked with tiny weeds cropping up through the jagged cuts in the faded pavement. I turned off my car and went inside, not knowing if I’d even recognize my dad. It had been years since we’d seen each other. “Can I help you, hon?” a middle-aged waitress with graying hair and a kind smile greeted me as I walked to the faded yellow counter, the smell of deep fried food greeting me. “Um, I’m just waiting for my dad.” “You want a booth?” “Yeah,” I nodded and followed her to a booth near the back. I ordered a soda and sat there fidgeting as I waited for him. Five minutes into the wait, the bell over the door jingled causing my head to snap in the direction of the new arrival. My heart was in my throat thinking this was it. This was the moment I’d be face-to-face with my abusive father. Again. My lips parted and a strange buzzing started inside as I watched a tall, blond guy, about my age with piercing blue eyes, walk into the diner and sit down at the counter. His long black trench coat nearly reached his ankles. His all black attire made his white-blond hair stick out in stark contrast. He was breathtaking to look at it, and my heart stuttered in my chest when he turned and locked eyes on me from over his shoulder. His eyes swept me up and down lazily, before he turned away without so much as a change in his expression and drummed his fingers lazily on the counter. I cleared my throat and took a sip of my soda, my heart still racing. He seemed out of place as he sat on the worn yellow stool. The waitress brought him a slice of pumpkin pie complete with a fluffy cloud of whipped cream on top. He dug into it calmly, his fingers poking out of his fingerless gloves holding the fork like a weapon. He struck me as someone who knew how to use that fork, and not just as an eating utensil. He seemed dangerous. And scary. How someone could look so cool and intimidating eating a slice of pumpkin pie was beyond me. I’d been so caught up watching the guy at the counter that I failed to notice my father walk in and approach my table looking bedraggled. His shaggy dark hair was graying and his face was gaunt, but he looked infinitely better than the last time I saw him. Of course, back then he was being led away in handcuffs by the police, with his face bloodied from Mom clocking him with a decorative vase my grandma had given her for her birthday after he’d hit her repeatedly. That was the last time I’d seen him. His dark eyes fixed on me as he walked forward. His large frame was still as intimidating as I remembered. Just looking at his hulking form made me shake, as old memories flooded my thoughts—memories that I didn’t want to think about, memories I’d kept locked away in the dark recesses of my mind. It had been rough living with him as a kid. He seemed to have changed overnight. One day he was my daddy—tickling me and calling me princess—and the next, he was choking my mother and dragging me by my hair to throw me into a dark closet, while yelling maniacally for them to just take me. I never knew who they were, but I was beginning to piece it together. “Everly?” He used my full first name in his deep voice He looked me over quickly as I got to my feet. My body shook as I looked up at him through my thick lashes. “H-hi, Dad,” I answered softly, my tongue heavy in my mouth. A small smile touched his lips. He made to reach for me, but I flinched, those old memories a reminder of what could happen if he got a hold of me. He pulled back instead and gestured for us to sit. I sat nervously across from him, and we stared at one another for a moment before he cleared his throat and spoke, “You’ve grown quite a lot. Seventeen, now, huh?” “Growing up happens. An inevitability to those of us blessed enough to experience it,” I mumbled, averting my eyes from his face as I fidgeted in my seat. I focused my attention over my dad’s shoulder at the guy at the counter. He rose from his seat and moved to sit in the booth in front of where we were. If I didn’t know better, I’d think he was trying to listen in to our conversation. “Indeed,” he nodded at me, his eyes sweeping over my face quickly and halting on the silver infinity around my neck. “You look like your mom. You’re quite beautiful, Ever. It’s been, what? Four years?” “Five, but I-I’m not here for a reunion.” I cleared my throat, pulling myself together. I caught a glimpse of one of the dead lurking outside on the sidewalk, peering in at us—jagged cuts on its body, clothes tattered and bloodstained. I shuddered and closed my eyes as I drew in a deep breath trying to calm myself. When I opened my eyes, mysterious counter guy glanced over his shoulder at me with a frown on his face. He quickly turned away and looked out the window to where the dead man stood. I swallowed hard wondering if maybe he could see him too. I laughed inwardly. Of course, he couldn’t. I was being ridiculous. A side effect of my poor mental health. I looked back out the window, cringing as I saw the dead guy cock his head at me. His mouth broke into a crooked smile, and bugs skittered out from behind his blackened teeth. “I didn’t think you were here for a reunion,” my dad answered, following my gaze outside and letting out a sigh. “So, I suppose we should just get to the point.” I nodded wordlessly as I tore my eyes away from the man outside. “First, I’m sorry, Everly. For your awful childhood. That’s on me. I can’t change it, though. It is what it is, and that’s all it will ever be. Is that what you wanted? An apology from me?” “No,” I shook my head at him, wishing the guy sitting at the booth would go away. He’d stilled in his seat with his head inclined to us. I drew in another deep breath. I had to get my crap together. I was being paranoid. “I didn’t ask you here for that.” “No?” he raised an eyebrow at me. “Then what is it? I already know about the accident. Your grandma called and told me. I wanted to see you then, but I knew I couldn’t.” “It-it’s not about that. Not really. I’m here about this,” I placed the photograph of him and me onto the table and looked at him, swallowing hard. He stared down at it, no emotion on his face. After a few moments of silence his eyes found mine. “I need answers, Dad.” His eyes went to my fingers fiddling with my necklace. “You’ve always worn that necklace, haven’t you?” What the hell did that have to do with anything? “Yeah, I don’t remember when I got it. I think Mom told me when I was a little girl that Grandma, your mom, gave it to me. Kind of a symbol to remind me that love was infinite.” He chuckled darkly, “Yeah, love is infinite and so are other things…like death. Unfortunately, you’re learning more about those things now that you’re getting older. And life…” His eyes searched my face, looking for something. I had no idea what, but I’d be patient while he figured it out. He had answers that I needed. “Do you know how you got your name, Everly?” I cocked my head as I thought back through my memories. I hadn’t ever heard anyone mention it before. “No. I always assumed Mom found it in a baby book or something.” “My mother picked that name out for you. I know you were little when she died. But she loved you so much. Your grandmother was different…special. She knew things she shouldn’t know. Saw things others couldn’t.” A chill went down my spine. “What do you mean, Dad?” He looked over his shoulder to make sure no one was close by. Leaning forward, he pitched his voice low and said, “She was psychic. Not about everything, but about key, instrumental things. She knew your mom was pregnant with you before we even knew. She told us your name was to be Everly and that you’d be special. More gifted than anyone in our family has ever been before. The Torres family is cursed… or blessed, depending on how you look at it, with supernatural gifts.” “Gifts?” I scoffed. What I had experienced so far couldn’t be considered a gift. If it was, I needed to return it. “That’s what your grandmother called it when she explained it to me when I was a kid. I saw them too. Not many before you were born, just random ones here and there. But I remember Mom telling me that they just wanted to be heard. They had things to tell us.” “Who?” He looked at me with knowing eyes. “You know who, Ever. The dead.” “What do they have to tell us?” “When I was a kid, they told me nothing. I actually convinced myself when I became an adult that they weren’t real. Just a product of my mother’s imagination. They weren’t around anymore. Then after Mom told us that you were on the way and that you’d change everything, they started appearing again. I think the dead told Mom that you were coming.” “How would they know something like that?” He shrugged. “Same way they know anything I guess. They just do. Anyway, Mom said you were coming and that you’d be the greatest gift the world would get in a long time. That you’d save everyone.” “I think she got some bad information.” “No. And when you were little and she was dying, on her deathbed, she gave me the infinity necklace you wear. With her last breath she tried to tell me something. But all I could make out was Everly, fin, job, save and live forever. I assumed she was trying to say something about the infinity and that it was my job to save you and love you forever. Failed on those fronts, I’d say.” With a sigh and a shake of his head he opened his mouth and continued, “Funny thing about life,” he murmured, tearing his eyes away from me and looking back out the window. He grew quiet for a moment before speaking, “I want you to know that I always only wanted what was best for you and your mother, Ever. I know I didn’t showcase that in a positive way. I was fighting my own demons that grew bigger as time passed, and unfortunately, I waged war on the two people I cared most about. In fact, it got to the point where I was willing to sacrifice those I loved for a moment of peace. I wasn’t able to do my job and save you.” He grew quiet again, his eyes focused on the dead man, before continuing, “Do you see the dead man on the sidewalk?” “Y-yes,” I whispered, still surprised at how easily he spoke of it. “Yes, well, there are more, and they’re going to come for you, Ever. Thousands of them will come for you just like they came for me.” He nodded, still not looking at me. “But why—” “I suspect you’ll have a harder time dealing than I have,” he mused, finally dragging his eyes back to me, a small, sad smile on his lips. “And I don’t know why they’ll come for you. I can only catch bits of words. I can’t hear them as well as I’m guessing you can. And don’t ask me how to get rid of them. Do you think if I knew I’d be the man I am today?” He snorted and shook his head. “I tried you know. To get rid of them. I told them they could have you if they wanted you so bad. Remember when I tied you up and shoved you in that dark closet? I thought they’d take you then. They tried. I remember when your mama pulled you out, you had all those cuts and bruises on your body. She thought I’d done it to you. I was guilty of putting you there, but those cuts and bruises weren’t my doing. It was them. The dead.” His voice grew soft and his eyes darkened as he twirled the fork he was holding between his fingers. I had a flash of him jamming the fork through my flesh. I sat back, swallowing hard, my breathing picking up. He was crazy, maybe even more so than me! What kind of father would do those things to his own child? “They’ve always wanted you. You’re special to them. Your place is among them, Everly. You belong among the dead.” His dark eyes were hard and cold as he stared at me, his mouth turned down into a frown. “If you go to them, you’ll save many, myself included. Don’t you want to be a savior, my sweet, beautiful daughter?” He wasn’t the same man who’d walked into the diner twenty minutes before. He was cold, calculating. Insane. “You think I should kill myself?” I asked softly, my eyes on the fork in his hand. “I think that if you don’t do it, they will. There’s something bigger at work here. I think you need to choose between the lesser evil.” He paused and licked his lips before he spoke again, his voice a low, snake-like hiss, “They’ve been whispering about your importance. And he’s going to come for you. I don’t know who he is, but it must be bad to have them around this much. None of them will stop until you submit.” “Who are they? Who are any of them?” I asked, my body trembling, my mouth dry. “You don’t have any idea?” “He’s important. In fact,” he paused as he cast narrowed eyes to the ghost still standing on the sidewalk, before continuing, “I think he’s already been visiting you. Or at least, that’s the impression I’m getting. Funny,” he chuckled darkly, “I think they want me to take you away. He must be a very bad creature, if they’re begging me to take you because we both know how terrible I am.” He laughed maniacally this time, a hint of bitterness in the harsh barking sound. “I think they know they can trust me to finish the job.” “You’re nuts,” I whispered, the bile rising in my throat. My own father was willing to kill me. Crazy ran deeply in my family apparently. “So, they tell me,” he grinned wickedly at me, his green eyes flashing. “It probably wasn’t the best idea to call me. There’s a restraining order against me for a reason.” “What happened to you?” I asked, my voice trembling. “You were once a good man. A good father!” “And then they came back. I’m willing to do anything for some peace. You’ll understand soon enough. You’ll do it yourself. That’s what I’ve always told myself. My sweet, beautiful daughter will kill herself. You must, Everly. Kill yourself. Or let me do it. It’ll be quick. And we’ll both have peace.” “You’re sick!” I hissed at him, bristling at his words. “I am,” he agreed, looking out the window again. “And I hate myself for it. I don’t like wishing for your death, Everly. You were my princess. Despite my words, I do love you. But sometimes loving someone means letting them go. And I need to let go of you. You’re the reason for my torment. My pain. Your mother’s pain. Her sadness. All of it. You’re the reason no one is happy. You don’t belong here. In time you’ll understand it, and you’ll end it.” “I won’t kill myself,” I snarled at him through clenched teeth, tears burning my eyes. “I won’t!” “You will. You’ll die. You’re meant to. Hopefully, you’ll stay dead this time. For your own sake. The alternative isn’t something I want for you. I never wanted any of this for any of us.” His voice grew more bitter as he laid the fork on the table and picked up the knife. “I could do it for you. Right now. End it all. Don’t you want the pain to go away?” “Yes,” I whispered, warm tears snaking their way down my cheeks. “But I don’t want to die for it.” “You’ll want to die. It’s best to do it now. Fast. Clean. I’ll do it with you. My car is outside. We can get in it, and I’ll hit a tree or drive it into the river. If you’re afraid, I have pills. You can take them and sleep, Everly. I’ll drive us over a cliff. It’s your death. Choose which method you’d prefer. It’ll be my final gift to you. My death with yours so you won’t have to go alone.” Was my father seriously suggesting we Thelma and Louise it off a cliff? “You’re really insane,” I whispered, a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. “I’m not going to kill myself. I’ll figure this out without you. I’ve been doing it on my own so far.” “If you could do it on your own, you wouldn’t have called me.” He sat back in his seat, the knife still in his hands and his gaze leveled on me. “And you will try to kill yourself. It’s the only way to really get answers.” “I just wanted to know if you were like me. It’s clear to me that we are nothing alike,” I seethed at him. Fear and anger warred within me to be the stronger emotion in my trembling body as I stared at the man who contributed half my DNA. “We’re more alike that you realize.” He smiled sadly at me, my old daddy peeking through for a moment before the darkness in him surfaced again. “And I’m so sorry, peanut.” I let out a shriek as he lunged across the table at me, the knife raised, a maniacal glint in his dark eyes.",

If it was, I needed to return it. “That’s what your grandmother called it when she explained it to me when I was a kid. I saw them too. Not many before you were born, just random ones here and there. But I remember Mom telling me that they just wanted to be heard. They had things to tell us.” “Who?” He looked at me with knowing eyes. “You know who, Ever. The dead.” “What do they have to tell us?” “When I was a kid, they told me nothing. I actually convinced myself when I became an adult that they weren’t real. Just a product of my mother’s imagination. They weren’t around anymore. Then after Mom told us that you were on the way and that you’d change everything, they started appearing again. I think the dead told Mom that you were coming.” “How would they know something like that?” He shrugged. “Same way they know anything I guess. They just do. Anyway, Mom said you were coming and that you’d be the greatest gift the world would get in a long time. That you’d save everyone.” “I think she got some bad information.” “No. And when you were little and she was dying, on her deathbed, she gave me the infinity necklace you wear. With her last breath she tried to tell me something. But all I could make out was Everly, fin, job, save and live forever. I assumed she was trying to say something about the infinity and that it was my job to save you and love you forever. Failed on those fronts, I’d say.” With a sigh and a shake of his head he opened his mouth and continued, “Funny thing about life,” he murmured, tearing his eyes away from me and looking back out the window. He grew quiet for a moment before speaking, “I want you to know that I always only wanted what was best for you and your mother, Ever. I know I didn’t showcase that in a positive way. I was fighting my own demons that grew bigger as time passed, and unfortunately, I waged war on the two people I cared most about. In fact, it got to the point where I was willing to sacrifice those I loved for a moment of peace. I wasn’t able to do my job and save you.” He grew quiet again, his eyes focused on the dead man, before continuing, “Do you see the dead man on the sidewalk?” “Y-yes,” I whispered, still surprised at how easily he spoke of it. “Yes, well, there are more, and they’re going to come for you, Ever. Thousands of them will come for you just like they came for me.” He nodded, still not looking at me. “But why—” “I suspect you’ll have a harder time dealing than I have,” he mused, finally dragging his eyes back to me, a small, sad smile on his lips. “And I don’t know why they’ll come for you. I can only catch bits of words. I can’t hear them as well as I’m guessing you can. And don’t ask me how to get rid of them. Do you think if I knew I’d be the man I am today?” He snorted and shook his head. “I tried you know. To get rid of them. I told them they could have you if they wanted you so bad. Remember when I tied you up and shoved you in that dark closet? I thought they’d take you then. They tried. I remember when your mama pulled you out, you had all those cuts and bruises on your body. She thought I’d done it to you. I was guilty of putting you there, but those cuts and bruises weren’t my doing. It was them. The dead.” His voice grew soft and his eyes darkened as he twirled the fork he was holding between his fingers. I had a flash of him jamming the fork through my flesh. I sat back, swallowing hard, my breathing picking up. He was crazy, maybe even more so than me! What kind of father would do those things to his own child? “They’ve always wanted you. You’re special to them. Your place is among them, Everly. You belong among the dead.” His dark eyes were hard and cold as he stared at me, his mouth turned down into a frown. “If you go to them, you’ll save many, myself included. Don’t you want to be a savior, my sweet, beautiful daughter?” He wasn’t the same man who’d walked into the diner twenty minutes before. He was cold, calculating. Insane. “You think I should kill myself?” I asked softly, my eyes on the fork in his hand. “I think that if you don’t do it, they will. There’s something bigger at work here. I think you need to choose between the lesser evil.” He paused and licked his lips before he spoke again, his voice a low, snake-like hiss, “They’ve been whispering about your importance. And he’s going to come for you. I don’t know who he is, but it must be bad to have them around this much. None of them will stop until you submit.” “Who are they? Who are any of them?” I asked, my body trembling, my mouth dry. “You don’t have any idea?” “He’s important. In fact,” he paused as he cast narrowed eyes to the ghost still standing on the sidewalk, before continuing, “I think he’s already been visiting you. Or at least, that’s the impression I’m getting. Funny,” he chuckled darkly, “I think they want me to take you away. He must be a very bad creature, if they’re begging me to take you because we both know how terrible I am.” He laughed maniacally this time, a hint of bitterness in the harsh barking sound. “I think they know they can trust me to finish the job.” “You’re nuts,” I whispered, the bile rising in my throat. My own father was willing to kill me. Crazy ran deeply in my family apparently. “So, they tell me,” he grinned wickedly at me, his green eyes flashing. “It probably wasn’t the best idea to call me. There’s a restraining order against me for a reason.” “What happened to you?” I asked, my voice trembling. “You were once a good man. A good father!” “And then they came back. I’m willing to do anything for some peace. You’ll understand soon enough. You’ll do it yourself. That’s what I’ve always told myself. My sweet, beautiful daughter will kill herself. You must, Everly. Kill yourself. Or let me do it. It’ll be quick. And we’ll both have peace.” “You’re sick!” I hissed at him, bristling at his words. “I am,” he agreed, looking out the window again. “And I hate myself for it. I don’t like wishing for your death, Everly. You were my princess. Despite my words, I do love you. But sometimes loving someone means letting them go. And I need to let go of you. You’re the reason for my torment. My pain. Your mother’s pain. Her sadness. All of it. You’re the reason no one is happy. You don’t belong here. In time you’ll understand it, and you’ll end it.” “I won’t kill myself,” I snarled at him through clenched teeth, tears burning my eyes. “I won’t!” “You will. You’ll die. You’re meant to. Hopefully, you’ll stay dead this time. For your own sake. The alternative isn’t something I want for you. I never wanted any of this for any of us.” His voice grew more bitter as he laid the fork on the table and picked up the knife. “I could do it for you. Right now. End it all. Don’t you want the pain to go away?” “Yes,” I whispered, warm tears snaking their way down my cheeks. “But I don’t want to die for it.” “You’ll want to die. It’s best to do it now. Fast. Clean. I’ll do it with you. My car is outside. We can get in it, and I’ll hit a tree or drive it into the river. If you’re afraid, I have pills. You can take them and sleep, Everly. I’ll drive us over a cliff. It’s your death. Choose which method you’d prefer. It’ll be my final gift to you. My death with yours so you won’t have to go alone.” Was my father seriously suggesting we Thelma and Louise it off a cliff? “You’re really insane,” I whispered, a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. “I’m not going to kill myself. I’ll figure this out without you. I’ve been doing it on my own so far.” “If you could do it on your own, you wouldn’t have called me.” He sat back in his seat, the knife still in his hands and his gaze leveled on me. “And you will try to kill yourself. It’s the only way to really get answers.” “I just wanted to know if you were like me. It’s clear to me that we are nothing alike,” I seethed at him. Fear and anger warred within me to be the stronger emotion in my trembling body as I stared at the man who contributed half my DNA. “We’re more alike that you realize.” He smiled sadly at me, my old daddy peeking through for a moment before the darkness in him surfaced again. “And I’m so sorry, peanut.” I let out a shriek as he lunged across the table at me, the knife raised, a maniacal glint in his dark eyes.",

It happened so fast—one moment he was talking to me, and the next he was lunging at me with a knife poised to kill. When the impact and pain didn’t happen, I peeked through my lashes to see that my father was frozen in place—his mouth twisted open, a bit of spittle falling from his lips, eyes just as crazy as they’d been moments before. Lowering my arms, I looked around in confusion. Everyone and everything was frozen in place. A fly hovered in mid-air, its wings no longer moving. Coffee hung suspended in a brown trail from a pot in the waitress’s hand, on its way to the cup. “What the hell,” I whispered, my heartbeat pounding in my ears. Was I dead? Was this what the last moments of life looked like? I frowned as I remembered the car accident. It hadn’t been that way when I’d been hit by the SUV. This was different. This was something else. The guy from the booth in front of ours got to his feet and came to my table. I stared up at him even more confused. We were the only two people not frozen in place. “You should run,” the guy said softly, his voice deep with a slight accent. His blue eyes remained focused on my father. “I won’t be able to hold this stitch forever.” “What’s happening?” I asked, my voice shaking as I slid slowly out of the booth. I wasn’t even sure if I could stand on my own. My entire body quivered in fear. “I’m saving your life so someone won’t have to save your death,” he answered, his eyes moving from my father to me. “I-I don’t understand,” I stammered, my legs quaking beneath me as I tried to maintain my balance. He reached out to steady me, and I stared up into his bright blue eyes. “You will. Soon.” “Who are you?” I breathed out as he released me and turned his focus back to my father, who was still frozen in place. “My name’s Eric. We’ll meet again. Now you have about ten seconds to get as far from here as you can because this stitch is about to reach its end. Don’t look back, Ever. Never look back.” His blue eyes flicked back to me quickly before going back to my father, his lip curling up, as a terrifying look fell over his face. He was going to do something I didn’t want to see. I backed away, keeping my eyes glued to him. “Five seconds,” he hissed. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead as his hand rose up from his side, his fingers curling. A strange blue glow began to flicker around him, the cobalt color swirling out of his hand in waves. I didn’t need him to say it again. I turned and fled, leaving the frozen patrons at Lucinda’s Diner behind. I was in my car and tires squealing when a deep boom shook my vehicle. I hit the accelerator harder and watched in my rearview mirror as the building lit up in the same blue glow as that which had engulfed Eric. I didn’t even want to know what was happening in there. I focused on the road ahead of me without bothering to look back again.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty My dad had tried to kill me. Some strange guy had stopped time. I saw dead people—this had to be the most bizarre, worst day of my life, and that included the night I’d been hit by the car. At least I’d spent most of that event unconscious. This I was very much awake for. Or at least I thought I was. Maybe it was just more of my weird delusions and hallucinations. Maybe I hadn’t really met with my dad. Maybe I only thought I did. Yeah. That seemed likely. None of this was real. All of it was just a figment of my imagination, created from my brain injury. I was so delusional that I was having delusions about my delusions. Deep down I knew it was more than just crazy thoughts. And that was scarier than being nuts. “Everly Lucia! ¿Dónde estabas? I got a call from the school today that you left early. I was worried sick. I kept calling you, but you didn’t answer.” My mom met me at the front door with her hands on her slender hips and her mouth turned down into a frown. “Sorry,” I muttered pushing past her and going to the kitchen where I grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and swallowed down my nightly snack of high-powered pharmaceuticals. I knew everything was real. I hadn’t imagined it. There was no way my mind was that imaginative. If it was, I’d probably have been better in art class or my writing class. “I-I had to meet someone.” “Just because you want to hang out with your friends doesn’t mean you can just walk out of school whenever you want. You need to tell me where you’re going. You’re not well, Ever—” “You’re right,” I laughed disgustedly, the day’s events still all too fresh in my mind’s eye. “I’m not. And no amount of pills or coddling is ever going to change that! I think it’s safe to say we both need to learn to get over it!” “Ever, you’ll get better—” “No, I won’t, Mamá! I have a sickness that can’t be cured. Prayers and tears and hopes and positive thinking won’t change me back. You know why? Because I’ve always been this person. This is me. Broken and crazy,” I shouted at her hysterically. A ghost hovered in the corner of the dining room, and I laughed maniacally, the sound a mixture of bitterness and anger. It reminded me of my lunatic father. “Come get me, you shits!” I shouted at it, spit flying from my mouth. “Here I am. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for?” I taunted and threw my bottle of water across the room at it. Tears streamed down my face. I was losing it. Jesus. I was the female version of my father. All I needed now was a knife and a bottle of alcohol. “Whatever,” I breathed out, my lower lip quivering and my eyes on fire with unshed tears. “I’m going to bed. Maybe they’ll kill me this time so no one else will have to. Save me the trouble of doing it myself.” “Ev—” my mom’s voice cracked. “Goodnight,” I called over my shoulder at her as I disappeared up the stairs. I slammed my door closed behind me and went to my bed and sat down on the edge of it making sure to sit with my feet off the floor. I pulled the picture of me and my dad out of my pocket and looked down at it. Tears continued to stream down my face as soft sobs escaped my trembling lips. The air shifted in my room. I didn’t need to look up to know I wasn’t alone anymore. “What do you want from me?” I whispered, closing my eyes, feeling warm sadness snaking its way down my cheeks. There was a gentle touch on my face, like someone was wiping my tears away. I opened my eyes to find myself face to face with Shadow as he knelt in front of me. His red eyes wavered like he was crying with me. Little tendrils of blackness curled off him like tiny serpents. “Why did you save me if I’m meant to die?” I managed to choke out, my body quivering as I stared at him. I knew he’d been there. It was coming back to me in small, terrifying pieces. He’d always been there. My childhood, growing with me. My accident, healing me. The cafeteria, saving me. Now, comforting me. He reached forward and placed a black finger to my lips, and his head gave a slight shake. His warm finger slipped slowly away from my lips, and he took my hand and lifted it, placing it against the spot on his chest where his heart would be. He rested his other hand over my heart as his glowing ember eyes focused on me. A memory surfaced. His hand had been over my heart when I’d had the accident. Beneath my palm, his heart thumped along in his chest. How could he have a heartbeat if he was dead? If he was just a shadow? “This doesn’t make any sense,” I murmured. He leaned in to me and rested his forehead against mine and breathed out slowly. He breathed. He was warm. He had a heartbeat. Was he another creature like the guy from the diner? I closed my eyes as our foreheads stayed pressed to one another. None of this seemed real, yet I knew it had to be. If it wasn’t, then I’d been sick since the day I saw the first spirit. Since the first time I saw the shadow. Since. . . forever. Always. When he pulled away from me, his eyes looked even sadder if that was even possible. I watched as he got to his feet and backed away from me. “Where are you going?” I asked worriedly, reaching out for him. I needed him. I felt like he needed to be here with me. He couldn’t just disappear. I had the sudden crazy thought that I couldn’t exist without him. “Why won’t you talk to me!” He bowed his head as tiny wisps of black smoke puffed up around him He faded away within them, leaving me all alone again in my bedroom. I couldn’t do this. Forty-five minutes ago, all I wanted was answers and to resist dying by the hands of my father. None of this made sense. Ghosts haunted me. A strange shadow man was worried about me, so it seemed. And there was a guy who could literally stop time. My father’s crazy rantings echoed in my mind. He said I’d want death. I wasn’t sure how in forty-five minutes I could go from wanting life to wanting death just to escape. It was a nod to my mental issues, that was for sure. My dad drank. Heavily. He did it to dull the voices. The voices I could hear humming in the distance even now. They were coming. He wanted me dead to what? Save me? Save himself? If I was dead, none of this would matter. Peace. My dad had wanted peace. God, I did too. He found it in the bottom of a bottle of alcohol, or at least he found tolerance there. I wanted something, anything, just so I could breathe without fear. Maybe he’d been onto something. There was really only one way to find out. I just had to take that step. I had to become what I feared—my dad.",

I awoke sometime later that night to an odd sensation of being watched. And it wasn’t Shadow this time. The full moon cut through my bedroom window, sending a sliver of pale white light to splay across my floor and casting the room in shadow. I pulled a deep breath into my lungs as the hairs on the back of my neck stood at attention. “Breathe, Ever. Breathe,” I commanded myself softly, pulling my blankets up to my chin as I tried to get comfortable in bed. My attention snapped in the direction of a floorboard squeaking, and I swallowed hard. “Just the house settling,” I whispered, trying to reassure myself. My hands gripped my blanket tightly as I settled back against my pillow, my body on high alert. When nothing else happened, I closed my eyes, hoping that I’d be able to sleep through this nightmare. Creeeak! My eyes snapped open, and I looked at my closet door. It was opening slowly, the creaking like electricity coursing through the room, the energy nearly palpable. “Crap,” I swallowed hard, burying myself deeper into my bed. The creaking stopped when the door was completely open. I waited for whatever was within it to show itself. The room grew eerily quiet. Too quiet. Dead quiet. This silence was thick. Stagnant. Suffocating. BANG! Something slammed against my bedroom window, shaking the walls around it. “Crap, crap, crap,” I hissed, my grip on the blankets tight and painful. And then the black, decayed hand appeared. Its long broken gray nails scratched across the broken pane of glass. Wreeeeeet! The terrible scratching sound echoed around me. I covered my ears with my hands, as my body trembled with fright. Ever! Let me in, child. I have something that belongs to you.” The voice cut through my body, sending a river of chills over me. The pane of glass cracked again as the fingers dug their way through. I tugged my blankets fiercely, wanting to cover my head like I’d done as a child. I wanted to hide. I wanted to escape! “ARGH,” I screamed as I covered my head and found a body covered in bugs, rot, and blood clawing its way up beneath my blanket from the end of my bed. Its broken teeth gnashed as its jagged fingernails cut painfully into my legs. I kicked furiously. The acrid taste of rotting flesh filled my mouth as I struggled and fell out of bed, hitting the floor hard. I tried to scramble away, to run as far from there as I could, but something wrapped its cold hands around my ankles and tugged me ferociously. I reached out, screaming, clawing at anything I could to hold on, but it was useless. I was pulled under my bed into complete darkness, the only sound was my screaming and the heavy breathing from my captor.",

      "title": "Chapter Twenty-Two",
      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Two I woke up the next morning under my bed and quickly crawled out. My body felt like I’d been beaten and left for dead. And who knew, maybe I had been. It certainly felt that way as I tried to stretch my sore muscles. I had no idea what had happened to me, but I was certainly grateful that I was still alive. A quick shower helped to relieve some of the ache. When I saw the mark on my shoulder, I frowned. It was even redder than before, and now it had a purple tint too, like a bruise. It seemed larger, too. I hastily tried to rub the reddened skin but winced when that proved to be quite painful. Great. Something else to worry about. Having no memory of what happened once I’d been pulled under, freaked me out. Any fear I had of turning into my dad was outweighed by the fear of existing like this. I grabbed the flask that Dylan had given me after an evening of heavy sparring and went downstairs to my mom’s liquor cabinet. After filling it, I made sure to drink down a large portion straight from the bottle. Then I took my handful of small miracles and stuffed the flask into my bag as I sank down on the couch. My mom was working a double, but she texted me throughout the day to check on me. By eight that night, I was so drunk that I couldn’t see straight. It seemed to work even better than the pills did. My father had given me the best gift he could—his desire to drink gallons of alcohol to escape his problems. If it kept my own demons away, then I was game. It beat his alternative—death. At least at the moment. But the night was young, and my mind wasn’t in the best place. “Nia?” I slurred into the phone. “Ever? What’s wrong?” “You still going to the party tonight?” I asked, shaking my head to clear my vision. It only made it worse. “Um, yeah. I’m leaving now. Why?” “Come get me?” I asked. “O-kay. I’ll be there in a few minutes.” She sounded hesitant, no doubt because the last party I went to I’d been hit by a car. “Be fast. I hate being alone in this house. You know how crazy I am.” Not waiting for her answer, I hung up and stumbled to my room. I pulled on a short jean skirt and tight black tank top that left way too much skin exposed. Old Ever would’ve been appalled. New Ever didn’t care. Unable to stay inside the house any longer, I sat outside and waited for Nina to pull up. When the crunch of the gravel sounded, I climbed to my feet, ambled out to her car, and climbed into the front seat. “Good evening,” I exclaimed drunkenly. My vision blurred and my heart fluttered madly in my chest. “Ever, are you drunk?” Nina asked, wide-eyed. “Abso-freaking-lutely!” I laughed, struggling with my seatbelt. “It’s so much easier like this. I can’t see any of the people or hear their voices. I know why my dad was always wasted so much now.” “Ever, maybe you should just stay home and sleep it off—” “No. I have to go! I have to. OK?” I stilled in my seat as I gazed at her. I couldn’t be alone. It wasn’t a good idea. “OK,” she murmured, backing out of the driveway and heading to Jax’s house. She rambled the entire way about how she wasn’t sure what she’d tripped on that day in the cafeteria when she’d fallen, but she’d been embarrassed over it. I stared out the window and winced as we passed the cemetery. There were no shadows wandering the path this time. Something about that bothered me. I knew there were others out there besides him. I’d seen them. And what was his deal anyway? Why did he show up sometimes but not others? Why wouldn’t he talk to me? Why was I so worried about a shadow talking to me? God, I was screwed in the head. Once we got to the party, I made my way to the keg and continued to drink. My eyes scanned the room, seeking Jax. But he was nowhere. By midnight, I was stumbling around hugging everyone. Everyone but Dylan, who still hadn’t shown up yet. “Ever, maybe you should slow down,” Nina frowned at me as I finished my tenth beer for the night. With bleary eyes I stared back at her, wondering when she became a hater of fun. Not that I was having fun. I was numbing the pain, silencing the voices, blinding myself so I wouldn’t have to deal with all of it. If I didn’t, I feared that I’d do something stupid. I knew I was on the verge of it. It was like knowing a word but not being able to say it. That’s what it was like with me, as I teetered on the line between sanity and insanity, with my dad telling me to just kill myself on repeat in my head. He was right. It was a means to an end. “You’re right,” I slurred out morosely. “This beer isn’t working.” The voices were still there, just muted. With one hand I dug in my purse and pulled out the bottle of pills I’d hidden inside. I fumbled with the lid for a moment before I was able to get it off. With a shake, I poured two small pills into my hand and tossed them back, using my eleventh beer to wash them down. “Ever, come on,” Nina pleaded, her blue eyes big as she stared at me. “Stop, OK? Do you want me to call your mom? She can help you-,” “My mom?” I scoffed, steadying myself on the wall. “She already thinks I’ve slipped off the deep end. She’ll have me committed before sunrise.” I let my bleary eyes wander over to where Dylan was standing with a beer in his hand. He was finally here. His handsome face looked amused as Jax and his group of friends laughed. He said he wanted me still. He said he’d always be there when I was ready. Well, I was ready for something else to distract me. Casey stood beside him. She kept touching him lightly on the arm or chest. I narrowed my eyes and pushed my drink into Nina’s hand. I was doing this. Alcohol was my liquid courage. “Ever, what are you doing?” Nina reached out for me, the worry evident in her voice. I pulled away and didn’t answer her as I made my way over to Dylan. I wasn’t even sure what I was doing. There was this wild idea in my head that I had to do something drastic to make the pain and confusion disappear. Dylan seemed like the best place to start. If I wasn’t with him, then everything that had happened to me had been in vain. “Dylan,” I called his name out softly, and his eyes snapped to me, his arm dropping away from Casey’s waist. “Hey, Ever,” he replied, a careful, curious smile on his face. His eyes raked over my body quickly, lingering in some places before finding my eyes and locking on them. I swallowed hard as Casey glared at me. Dylan’s friends went quiet as they watched. Blame it on the alcohol or my sudden craziness, but I had to have him back. I wanted to be normal again. With a step forward, I rested my hand on his chest, pushing Casey out of the way. He stared down at me for a moment with a look of confusion on his face, before I went up on my tiptoes and pressed my mouth to his. He seemed stunned by my move, and I heard Casey sputter out a protest, but it was short-lived as his hands landed on the small of my back, tugging me to him. His tongue swept my mouth quickly. When we broke apart, Dylan’s friends stared at us, stunned. Casey’s face was livid, her hands clenching and unclenching into fists as she stared daggers at me. “Want to leave?” Dylan asked softly, glancing from Casey to me. “Yeah,” I nodded breathlessly, letting him steer me away. “Ever,” Nina shouted after me as she tried to break through the crowd of partygoers. “Ever! Wait!” I didn’t bother to stop. I’d give Dylan whatever he wanted if it made me feel normal again.",

      "title": "Chapter Twenty-Three",
      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Three I was wasted. I let Dylan take me out to his car, him pushing me along quickly as I stumbled around trying to maintain my balance. Clumsily, I climbed in, and he shut the door. Nina and Jax approached. Jax looked apprehensive with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Nina pointed her finger at Dylan as her pretty face twisted into a scowl. I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but she was definitely angry as her mouth moved quickly and her eyes flashed. She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest, seemingly tired of their conversation. After another moment of arguing, she pushed him out of the way and opened my door. “Ever, get out of the car. Now,” she demanded, her voice hard. “Nina, leave her alone,” Dylan snapped from behind her as he tried to move her aside. “I’m not getting out,” I slurred, my head spinning. “I’m going with Dylan.” “See? She wants to go, Nina, so why don’t you go back to the party and drink a little and loosen up. God knows you could use it.” Dylan managed to wedge himself between me and Nina effectively blocking me from her view. “Ever, you’re drunk. Just get out and come with me. I won’t tell your mom. We can go back to my place, and you can sleep it off,” she reasoned breathlessly, pushing him so I could see her. “No,” I shook my head, staring straight ahead. “Jax, take Nina back to the party, would you?” Dylan cut in, sighing in exasperation. “Don’t you hurt her, Dylan,” Nina breathed out shakily, her voice dangerous. “You nearly killed her last time.” “Piss off, Nina,” Dylan growled, moving to shove her. Jax jumped between them and put his hand on Dylan’s chest to stop him from getting too close to her. “Dylan, chill, man. Ever’s really messed up right now. Maybe it’s best if she does go home with Nina,” Jax said diplomatically. Nina’s soft sniffles fell on my ears making my heart clench. I knew she was upset about the situation. I just had to do this. “She’s sick, Dylan,” Nina shouted, pointing accusingly at him, her voice trembling. “She needs to be home, not getting you off in the backseat of your car.” “Get her out of my face, Jax,” Dylan spat, backing away from Nina. Jax pulled Nina away, her face falling. He said something to her and she shook her head, looking over her shoulder at me. I drew in a deep breath, my mind made up. I was going with Dylan. He climbed into the car and started it. His hand moved over the console to rest on my bare thigh briefly. His eyes were hungry. Giving my leg a slight squeeze, he let go, put the car in gear, and we sped off down the street. We didn’t talk until he pulled into his driveway. “My parents are away for the weekend,” he murmured, his dark eyes shining as he gazed at me. “No one will bother us.” Without waiting for me to answer, he got out of the car and came around to my side to help me out. I stumbled into him as my head spun. Leaning down, he pressed his warm mouth to mine. His hands roved over my back. “I’ve missed you, Ever,” he said, peppering my face with kisses. “Come on.” He pulled away and helped me into his house and up the stairs to his bedroom. He didn’t waste any time getting his hands on me again as we fell onto his bed. “I’m so sorry about us. About what happened to you that night,” he breathed out between kisses. “I’ve been so worried about you, baby. I’m glad you decided to end this nonsense and be with me again.” I kissed him back, ignoring the war my heart and mind waged within me—the alcohol and pills fought a war I wasn’t sure either would win. “I-I shouldn’t be doing this,” I managed to gasp as he pulled me closer, the old Ever trying to claw her way out. “Shh, baby,” he kissed me deeply. “Stop overthinking it. I’ll make you feel so good.” I lay back on the bed, my body numb, as Dylan gazed down at me fondly. He leveled his body over mine, his mouth finding mine again. His hands moved to touch every bit of my warm skin. “He’s going to find out,” a voice whispered frantically through the haze. I raked my fingers through Dylan’s hair, desperate to distract myself from whatever the voice was talking about. “He’s going to be so mad,” another shaky voice whispered. “We should go. Who knows what he’ll do when he finds out.” “I’m not leaving. She brought this on herself. What’s he going to do to us? We’re already dead.” “You know damn well what he’ll do if he gets his hands on us. We’ll be forced into a box and used—sucked dry.” I pushed Dylan off me, panting, and dropped my head into my hands. “Ever?” Dylan asked, confusion making his voice thick. “You OK?” “No,” I shook my head, trying to breathe evenly. I looked at Dylan, his hair messy, his handsome face concerned. He never looked concerned about anything. Maybe I really was a freak if even he looked at me odd. I didn’t want to be a freak. I didn’t want pity. I wanted to be Ever again, not the crazy girl who heard voices and saw strange things lurking around. I leaned in and kissed him again. He didn’t resist, his mouth opening easily so he could run his tongue along mine. I let him lay me back down as his hands went back to holding me. The air shifted around us. It grew heavy and thick with foreboding. I squeezed my eyes closed, ignoring it as I continued to kiss Dylan. “He’s coming,” the first voice squealed with fright. “Hide! Hide so he won’t find us,” another voice called out frantically. “She’s in so much trouble, He won’t be happy,” a third voice shouted. “He might remedy the problem for us, though,” another sneering voice hissed. “Stop,” I screamed out, the noise too much. “Stop, please,” I whimpered as my hands covered my ears. Dylan stopped kissing me, and stared down at me with a frazzled look on his face. “Ever, baby, come on. Relax,” he murmured as he raked his fingers through my hair. His lips found mine again, only I didn’t kiss him back this time. Frustrated, his mouth moved down to my neck. His hips dug into mine. “Dylan, stop. Please,” I whispered, suddenly needing to get out of there. The air was difficult to breathe. Something terrifying was coming. Something I’d already faced only yesterday in my bedroom. Shadow appeared at the foot of the bed. His eyes glowed red and fiery. Anger resonated from every bit of blackness that blanketed him. Dylan was lifted off me. His face twisted in terror and shock, as he was tossed easily across the room. He landed with a thud against the wall before sliding down it. Shadow stalked purposefully toward him. Dylan clearly couldn’t see it, but fear was written on his face. His wild eyes darted about frantically, as he tried to process what just happened. “No,” I screamed, trying to scramble out of the bed. My feet tangled in the bedsheets from Dylan’s unmade bed. “No. Don’t hurt him.” Shadow ignored me and leaned down. He wrapped his fingers around Dylan’s neck causing Dylan to choke and sputter in protest. His beautiful eyes bulged as he scrambled to claw at Shadow’s invisible hand around his neck. “Stop,” I shouted, tears pouring down my cheeks. My chest ached with fear. “Please, stop!” Finally able to cross the room, I reached out, not knowing what else to do, and touched Shadow’s arm. He turned his head to me, his grip on Dylan’s neck loosening. He seemed to be contemplating something. His gleaming red eyes gazing deeply into my own as he cocked his head. Appearing to have come to a decision, he turned back to Dylan and tightened his grip again. Effortlessly, he lifted Dylan to his feet and then just a little higher so he was pinned to the wall with his feet dangling inches from the floor. Terror filled Dylan’s features as he was held against his will to the wall, his body flailing, his hands clawing at his invisible attacker. Shadow leaned forward and whispered something to Dylan causing him to still. A tear leaked out of his eye and he nodded, gasping. Shadow tightened his grip on Dylan’s neck some more, and Dylan reached out to push against the force that was holding him but came up empty. He still couldn’t see Shadow. My heart sank as Dylan’s eyes met mine, fear flashing in them. “I-I understand,” Dylan choked out as another tear leaked from his eye. Shadow seemed satisfied with his answer because he released his grip, and Dylan slid to the floor with a loud thud. “Dylan!” I rushed to him and reached out, but he scooted away from me, shaking his head. “Go away, Ever,” he rasped out, shrinking back from me. “Wh-why? Let me help you!” I tried again, but he batted my hands away. “You need to go. Now. Leave, Ever! I don’t want you here,” Dylan’s voice was firm, scared, insistent. “I-I’m sorry,” I whispered, backing away from him. Grabbing my jacket from the floor, I tugged it on and glared at Shadow who still stood in the center of the room, daring me, challenging me, to go back to Dylan. I knew it was in Dylan’s best interest that I leave. I cast his frightened body one final look before stumbling down the stairs and out his front door.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Three I was wasted. I let Dylan take me out to his car, him pushing me along quickly as I stumbled around trying to maintain my balance. Clumsily, I climbed in, and he shut the door. Nina and Jax approached. Jax looked apprehensive with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Nina pointed her finger at Dylan as her pretty face twisted into a scowl. I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but she was definitely angry as her mouth moved quickly and her eyes flashed. She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest, seemingly tired of their conversation. After another moment of arguing, she pushed him out of the way and opened my door. “Ever, get out of the car. Now,” she demanded, her voice hard. “Nina, leave her alone,” Dylan snapped from behind her as he tried to move her aside. “I’m not getting out,” I slurred, my head spinning. “I’m going with Dylan.” “See? She wants to go, Nina, so why don’t you go back to the party and drink a little and loosen up. God knows you could use it.” Dylan managed to wedge himself between me and Nina effectively blocking me from her view. “Ever, you’re drunk. Just get out and come with me. I won’t tell your mom. We can go back to my place, and you can sleep it off,” she reasoned breathlessly, pushing him so I could see her. “No,” I shook my head, staring straight ahead. “Jax, take Nina back to the party, would you?” Dylan cut in, sighing in exasperation. “Don’t you hurt her, Dylan,” Nina breathed out shakily, her voice dangerous. “You nearly killed her last time.” “Piss off, Nina,” Dylan growled, moving to shove her. Jax jumped between them and put his hand on Dylan’s chest to stop him from getting too close to her. “Dylan, chill, man. Ever’s really messed up right now. Maybe it’s best if she does go home with Nina,” Jax said diplomatically. Nina’s soft sniffles fell on my ears making my heart clench. I knew she was upset about the situation. I just had to do this. “She’s sick, Dylan,” Nina shouted, pointing accusingly at him, her voice trembling. “She needs to be home, not getting you off in the backseat of your car.” “Get her out of my face, Jax,” Dylan spat, backing away from Nina. Jax pulled Nina away, her face falling. He said something to her and she shook her head, looking over her shoulder at me. I drew in a deep breath, my mind made up. I was going with Dylan. He climbed into the car and started it. His hand moved over the console to rest on my bare thigh briefly. His eyes were hungry. Giving my leg a slight squeeze, he let go, put the car in gear, and we sped off down the street. We didn’t talk until he pulled into his driveway. “My parents are away for the weekend,” he murmured, his dark eyes shining as he gazed at me. “No one will bother us.” Without waiting for me to answer, he got out of the car and came around to my side to help me out. I stumbled into him as my head spun. Leaning down, he pressed his warm mouth to mine. His hands roved over my back. “I’ve missed you, Ever,” he said, peppering my face with kisses. “Come on.” He pulled away and helped me into his house and up the stairs to his bedroom. He didn’t waste any time getting his hands on me again as we fell onto his bed. “I’m so sorry about us. About what happened to you that night,” he breathed out between kisses. “I’ve been so worried about you, baby. I’m glad you decided to end this nonsense and be with me again.” I kissed him back, ignoring the war my heart and mind waged within me—the alcohol and pills fought a war I wasn’t sure either would win. “I-I shouldn’t be doing this,” I managed to gasp as he pulled me closer, the old Ever trying to claw her way out. “Shh, baby,” he kissed me deeply. “Stop overthinking it. I’ll make you feel so good.” I lay back on the bed, my body numb, as Dylan gazed down at me fondly. He leveled his body over mine, his mouth finding mine again. His hands moved to touch every bit of my warm skin. “He’s going to find out,” a voice whispered frantically through the haze. I raked my fingers through Dylan’s hair, desperate to distract myself from whatever the voice was talking about. “He’s going to be so mad,” another shaky voice whispered. “We should go. Who knows what he’ll do when he finds out.” “I’m not leaving. She brought this on herself. What’s he going to do to us? We’re already dead.” “You know damn well what he’ll do if he gets his hands on us. We’ll be forced into a box and used—sucked dry.” I pushed Dylan off me, panting, and dropped my head into my hands. “Ever?” Dylan asked, confusion making his voice thick. “You OK?” “No,” I shook my head, trying to breathe evenly. I looked at Dylan, his hair messy, his handsome face concerned. He never looked concerned about anything. Maybe I really was a freak if even he looked at me odd. I didn’t want to be a freak. I didn’t want pity. I wanted to be Ever again, not the crazy girl who heard voices and saw strange things lurking around. I leaned in and kissed him again. He didn’t resist, his mouth opening easily so he could run his tongue along mine. I let him lay me back down as his hands went back to holding me. The air shifted around us. It grew heavy and thick with foreboding. I squeezed my eyes closed, ignoring it as I continued to kiss Dylan. “He’s coming,” the first voice squealed with fright. “Hide! Hide so he won’t find us,” another voice called out frantically. “She’s in so much trouble, He won’t be happy,” a third voice shouted. “He might remedy the problem for us, though,” another sneering voice hissed. “Stop,” I screamed out, the noise too much. “Stop, please,” I whimpered as my hands covered my ears. Dylan stopped kissing me, and stared down at me with a frazzled look on his face. “Ever, baby, come on. Relax,” he murmured as he raked his fingers through my hair. His lips found mine again, only I didn’t kiss him back this time. Frustrated, his mouth moved down to my neck. His hips dug into mine. “Dylan, stop. Please,” I whispered, suddenly needing to get out of there. The air was difficult to breathe. Something terrifying was coming. Something I’d already faced only yesterday in my bedroom. Shadow appeared at the foot of the bed. His eyes glowed red and fiery. Anger resonated from every bit of blackness that blanketed him. Dylan was lifted off me. His face twisted in terror and shock, as he was tossed easily across the room. He landed with a thud against the wall before sliding down it. Shadow stalked purposefully toward him. Dylan clearly couldn’t see it, but fear was written on his face. His wild eyes darted about frantically, as he tried to process what just happened. “No,” I screamed, trying to scramble out of the bed. My feet tangled in the bedsheets from Dylan’s unmade bed. “No. Don’t hurt him.” Shadow ignored me and leaned down. He wrapped his fingers around Dylan’s neck causing Dylan to choke and sputter in protest. His beautiful eyes bulged as he scrambled to claw at Shadow’s invisible hand around his neck. “Stop,” I shouted, tears pouring down my cheeks. My chest ached with fear. “Please, stop!” Finally able to cross the room, I reached out, not knowing what else to do, and touched Shadow’s arm. He turned his head to me, his grip on Dylan’s neck loosening. He seemed to be contemplating something. His gleaming red eyes gazing deeply into my own as he cocked his head.

He was beginning to sound like the voice of reason. What just happened? In the past Shadow always seemed to protect me, to watch over me. Why did he feel the need to hurt Dylan? It was wrong! I could handle myself with Dylan. I didn’t need him to intervene. The thought of him keeping tabs on me like that, made me sick. What else had he watched me do? If he could lift someone like Dylan and toss him like a ragdoll across a room, there was no telling what else he was capable of. I was sick of trying to sort through all the madness happening in my world. I needed an escape, a bigger one than I’d been using. I wandered to Gleeman’s Liquor, a store in the middle of town. There were voices all around me, whispering and clawing at my mind. My buzz was starting to wear off. I needed more. The adrenaline rush from what went down at Dylan’s no doubt had a sobering effect. I went to the hard liquor aisle and chuckled darkly as I stared at the selection. I’d just witnessed my boyfriend—ex-boyfriend—get flung across the room and choked by some supernatural being. I was hearing voices. I was seeing creatures and humans that had once existed but had left this world long ago—or had never existed, but wanted to. I couldn’t take it. I was done. So. Done. I grabbed a bottle of amber liquid off the shelf and popped the lid off. “Bottoms up,” I muttered morosely. I tipped the bottle back and downed half of it before moving on to another bottle. Then another. “Hey,” a clerk shouted ten minutes later. “What the hell are you doing?” “Whas it look-hic-like?” I slurred, stumbling back and knocking over a shelf of loose tobacco. It landed with a clatter and a crash. “I’m calling the cops,” he yelled, his face red with anger. “Call the ghos’ busers while you’re at it,” I shouted after him as he ran back to the front to phone the police. I continued to drink, the voices finally gone. I smiled in satisfaction as I finished another bottle. My vision went wonky then, causing me to stumble forward and then back before I crumpled to the ground with vomit coming out of my mouth. My vision blurred. Maybe I’d finally finished the job of killing myself—a process that had started months ago when the car hit me. Maybe I’d make my dad proud. I breathed out a ragged breath, hoping beyond anything that there would finally be silence. And darkness. And peace. I craved them more than my next breath as my eyes closed and I faded away.",

The familiar beep of the monitors filled my ears, making my head throb. “You’re awake,” my mom murmured. I snapped my head in the direction of her voice and winced at how bright the sun was coming through the window. “Then I guess that means I failed,” I muttered with a sigh, burrowing deeper in my bed. “What?” she asked, frowning. “Were you actually trying to kill yourself, Ever?” Her large dark eyes were glossy with tears, her lower lip trembling. “Doesn’t matter,” I rolled over and pulled the blanket up tighter around me. “When are they letting me out of here?” “Ever, we need to tal—” she started, but I silenced her by sitting up suddenly and shouting. My long hair was wild and messy as it clung to my damp, sweaty skin in chunks. “No! No talking. All I freaking hear are voices. Voices all the damn time. I don’t want to hear anything but silence.” I paused and turned my head in the direction of a small, dark creature with large black eyes, tiny black horns, and charcoal-colored matted fur as it lurked by the doorway to the hospital room. “Get out of here,” I bellowed louder, throwing my pillow at the creature. It dodged the pillow and glared at me, its eyes narrowing. It let out a low growl and started pacing the doorway again. I lunged out of the bed causing the IV in my arm to rip out. My arm started bleeding, and the wires attached to me gave way, as I rushed forward at the creature. “Ever,” my mom shouted frantically, trying to get to me. She must have hit the call button because a couple nurses and a doctor rushed in and grabbed me as I tried to chase the creature around the room. It was quick and let out a low growl as I kicked at it. Its mouth opened to reveal a row of razor-sharp teeth. My arms were restrained by the nurses, but that didn’t stop the fight in me as I tried to go back at the creature, kicking out ferociously at it. “I hate you,” I shouted, gnashing my teeth at it. “I hate you! Leave! Get out of here!” There was a sudden pinprick pain in my butt diverting my attention to the person beside me. “Sorry, sweetheart,” Dr. Brighton said softly as my vision blurred. He capped the syringe. My mother sobbed in the distance. A smile touched my lips. The silence. It was coming. Thank God.",

      "title": "Chapter Twenty-Six",
      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Six When I woke up, I wasn’t in the same room. This room was small. Too small. Not much was in it. It had the hard bed I lay in, a dresser, and a heavy metal door with a tiny window in it. The walls were an ugly shade of mint, a color that made me feel cold. My head felt fuzzy and my mouth felt thick and dry. I stumbled forward and tried to open the door, but it was locked. My fists banged loudly on it. My heart hammered a matching rhythm in my chest as the anxiety started to build. I was locked inside this room—this cell. “Help,” I screamed. “Help! Let me out! Please!” I screamed and screamed until my voice barely worked. I slid to the floor, my hands bruised from pounding on the door for so long and so hard. I wept big, fat, ugly tears. My body trembled violently as I hugged my knees to my chest. Moments later, the door opened and two large men entered the small area. Fear made me scoot on my butt away from them. The hasty motion made my hospital gown slip off my shoulder. I was terrified of what was happening. One held a jacket with buckles on it that looked like something they put crazy people in. I pressed my body against the wall as their large hands reached forward and tugged me to my feet. “No,” I screamed, my voice hoarse. “NO!” My words fell on deaf ears. I struggled against them as they forced my arms into the jacket and secured the straps so I was a prisoner in the rough fabric. I cried out, wanting to wipe the tears away, but I was unable. Panic crept up my throat. The straps were so tight that it was hard to breathe. My sweat-dampened hair was matted to my tear-soaked face. The metallic ting of blood filled my taste buds where I’d bitten my tongue during my futile struggles. They wordlessly took me by my arms and tugged me from the room. I tried putting the brakes on, dragging my feet in fear of what was happening and where I was being taken. “Who are you?” I croaked out, fighting against them. “Please! Where are you taking me?” They didn’t answer no matter how I kicked and screamed. I was lifted easily and hauled to an elevator where we descended swiftly. When the doors opened, I was pulled out and taken down a long hallway with flickering, buzzing fluorescent lights that made my head throb. The dull glow from them was the only indicator that the place was even inhabited. One of the men rapped once on a heavy metal door, and it swung open. Without a word, I was pulled through and left to just stand there as the men left. The sound of the door closing firmly behind them was a resounding thud. “You’re afraid,” a deep familiar voice stated from behind me. “D-Dr. Brighton?” I asked, my voice hoarse and shaking as I squinted at him through the tangled mess of hair hanging in my face. The dim flickering, fluorescent lights made it difficult to see him clearly. He was shrouded in shadow as he sat in his chair behind a metal table. “Where am I? What’s happening?” “You’re at a facility in Traverse City,” he answered, gesturing to a chair across from him for me to sit in. “Why am I here? Why am I wearing this?” I demanded, my throat aching from screaming so much. “Where’s my mom?” “Calm down, Ever. I’ll undo your restraints if you promise to be good. If you aren’t, I’ll sedate you. OK?” “O-Ok,” I breathed out, scared. Dr. Brighton came over and quickly undid the straps on the jacket and removed it from me. “This was a necessary evil, unfortunately,” he explained, holding up the strait jacket. “We didn’t want you to lash out, especially with all your training.” He tossed the jacket onto the table. How did he know about my self-defense classes? I narrowed my eyes at him. I’d never told him about my training with Dylan or my other martial arts classes. “Please. Sit,” he gestured to the chair again. I hesitated a moment before moving forward to sit as he indicated. My eyes roved around the stark, cold room. There was nothing but a small table and two chairs in there along with a camera in the corner. “How did you know about my fighting?” I demanded, staring him down. “I know a lot about you, Ever. I’ve been studying you for a very long time.” Dr. Brighton looked down at me, his face expressionless. “What?” I frowned. “You’ve been on the Order’s radar since you were a child. I’ve followed you closely since you were young. We actually got lucky with that accident.” “I’d hardly call me getting hit by a car and nearly dying, lucky,” I scoffed. “It’s all a matter of perspective. It brought you directly to me, which is a good thing. You see, I’m really the only one who’ll be able to help you now.” “Why am I here?” I whispered, trembling. His words scared me and didn’t make any sense. “I don’t understand.” “Because you need help, Ever. Wouldn’t you agree?” I didn’t say anything. Of course, I needed help, but I doubted that he’d be the one to help me. Unless he had a knife. Or pills. Or alcohol. Or drugs. Or a gun. I wasn’t picky. Whatever I could get my hands on to get the hell out of this miserable life. He and his pad of yellow legal paper weren’t cutting it anymore. “You can’t help me, Dr. Brighton,” I said softly, hoarsely. “No one can. I want to die.” “Ah, and that’s where the problem lies, I’m afraid,” Dr. Brighton commented, coming to sit in front of me at the metal table. “We cannot let you leave because you’re a danger to yourself, Everly.” “No, I’m not,” I muttered, denying the words I’d just told him. “You’re lying. We both know it. So, let’s cut to the chase.” Dr. Brighton folded his hands on the table and surveyed me with his gray eyes. “How long have you really been hearing the voices? You told me in our last session that everything was back to normal.” “What voices?” I played dumb. “I’m not hearing voices.” If I told him the truth, he’d keep me locked up in a padded room, or worse, back in that damn jacket. “The ones whispering to you right now.” A small smile touched his thin lips as he watched me. I fidgeted uncomfortably, wincing at the voices in the distance. “They’re going to take you away,” a sing-song voice taunted. “She’s already doomed,” another voice wailed. “It’s too late. She’ll become one of them.” “Should’ve finished her off in that closet all those years ago. Now we’re all screwed,” a gruff voice lamented. “Mm,” I whimpered, shaking my head, my jaw quivering. “I really can help you with them.” He leaned forward, lowering his voice, “Tell me what they’re saying, Ever. I know they’re speaking to you. Remember the candy in my office?” “Yes,” I answered softly. “Butter mint. That was my test. It’s only tolerable by Specials. The Naturals, or humans, can’t handle the bitter flavor. I know you can hear the voices. I know I can help you. Tell me, Ever. Tell me what are they saying to you?” “They said I’m doomed. That I’ll become one of them. I don’t even know what that means. I-I can’t do this.” My fingers dug into the palms of my hands as I struggled to find a way out of my despair. “Dr. Brighton, if there’s a compassionate bone in your body, please. Please, kill me or give me the means to do it myself,” I burst out, begging him, tears streaming down my face. “I want to die. I didn’t before. But I do now. Let me go.” I sniffled and wiped at my tears, feeling defeated. I had no idea what a Special or a Natural was. I didn’t even care. All I cared about was getting rid of the dead and their insistent voices. I wanted everything gone. “And therein lies the problem, you poor child,” he leaned back in his chair and rubbed the stubble on his face. “You’re clearly a very gifted girl, possibly the strongest of your kind in years. Tell me, what would death do for you that it’s not doing already? You wish to walk among the dead? You already are. You wish to be dead so you won’t feel? You already are dead inside. Tell me, Ever, because I want to understand where your mind is right now.” “What?” I shook my head, wiping at my eyes. “I-I don’t understand.” “If you only take one thing away from our meeting today, let it be this—You will never die. You could set yourself on fire, take all the pills in your mother’s medicine cabinet, drink every lick of alcohol your rotten father has in his mobile home, and yet, you will live if he comes. I believe that you, my poor child, are meant to exist. Forever.”",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Six When I woke up, I wasn’t in the same room. This room was small. Too small. Not much was in it. It had the hard bed I lay in, a dresser, and a heavy metal door with a tiny window in it. The walls were an ugly shade of mint, a color that made me feel cold. My head felt fuzzy and my mouth felt thick and dry. I stumbled forward and tried to open the door, but it was locked. My fists banged loudly on it. My heart hammered a matching rhythm in my chest as the anxiety started to build. I was locked inside this room—this cell. “Help,” I screamed. “Help! Let me out! Please!” I screamed and screamed until my voice barely worked. I slid to the floor, my hands bruised from pounding on the door for so long and so hard. I wept big, fat, ugly tears. My body trembled violently as I hugged my knees to my chest. Moments later, the door opened and two large men entered the small area. Fear made me scoot on my butt away from them. The hasty motion made my hospital gown slip off my shoulder. I was terrified of what was happening. One held a jacket with buckles on it that looked like something they put crazy people in. I pressed my body against the wall as their large hands reached forward and tugged me to my feet. “No,” I screamed, my voice hoarse. “NO!” My words fell on deaf ears. I struggled against them as they forced my arms into the jacket and secured the straps so I was a prisoner in the rough fabric. I cried out, wanting to wipe the tears away, but I was unable. Panic crept up my throat. The straps were so tight that it was hard to breathe. My sweat-dampened hair was matted to my tear-soaked face. The metallic ting of blood filled my taste buds where I’d bitten my tongue during my futile struggles. They wordlessly took me by my arms and tugged me from the room. I tried putting the brakes on, dragging my feet in fear of what was happening and where I was being taken. “Who are you?” I croaked out, fighting against them. “Please! Where are you taking me?” They didn’t answer no matter how I kicked and screamed. I was lifted easily and hauled to an elevator where we descended swiftly. When the doors opened, I was pulled out and taken down a long hallway with flickering, buzzing fluorescent lights that made my head throb. The dull glow from them was the only indicator that the place was even inhabited. One of the men rapped once on a heavy metal door, and it swung open. Without a word, I was pulled through and left to just stand there as the men left. The sound of the door closing firmly behind them was a resounding thud. “You’re afraid,” a deep familiar voice stated from behind me. “D-Dr. Brighton?” I asked, my voice hoarse and shaking as I squinted at him through the tangled mess of hair hanging in my face. The dim flickering, fluorescent lights made it difficult to see him clearly. He was shrouded in shadow as he sat in his chair behind a metal table. “Where am I? What’s happening?” “You’re at a facility in Traverse City,” he answered, gesturing to a chair across from him for me to sit in. “Why am I here? Why am I wearing this?” I demanded, my throat aching from screaming so much. “Where’s my mom?” “Calm down, Ever. I’ll undo your restraints if you promise to be good. If you aren’t, I’ll sedate you. OK?” “O-Ok,” I breathed out, scared. Dr. Brighton came over and quickly undid the straps on the jacket and removed it from me. “This was a necessary evil, unfortunately,” he explained, holding up the strait jacket. “We didn’t want you to lash out, especially with all your training.” He tossed the jacket onto the table. How did he know about my self-defense classes? I narrowed my eyes at him. I’d never told him about my training with Dylan or my other martial arts classes. “Please. Sit,” he gestured to the chair again. I hesitated a moment before moving forward to sit as he indicated. My eyes roved around the stark, cold room. There was nothing but a small table and two chairs in there along with a camera in the corner. “How did you know about my fighting?” I demanded, staring him down. “I know a lot about you, Ever. I’ve been studying you for a very long time.” Dr. Brighton looked down at me, his face expressionless. “What?” I frowned. “You’ve been on the Order’s radar since you were a child. I’ve followed you closely since you were young. We actually got lucky with that accident.” “I’d hardly call me getting hit by a car and nearly dying, lucky,” I scoffed. “It’s all a matter of perspective. It brought you directly to me, which is a good thing. You see, I’m really the only one who’ll be able to help you now.” “Why am I here?” I whispered, trembling. His words scared me and didn’t make any sense. “I don’t understand.” “Because you need help, Ever. Wouldn’t you agree?” I didn’t say anything. Of course, I needed help, but I doubted that he’d be the one to help me. Unless he had a knife. Or pills. Or alcohol. Or drugs. Or a gun. I wasn’t picky. Whatever I could get my hands on to get the hell out of this miserable life. He and his pad of yellow legal paper weren’t cutting it anymore. “You can’t help me, Dr. Brighton,” I said softly, hoarsely. “No one can. I want to die.” “Ah, and that’s where the problem lies, I’m afraid,” Dr. Brighton commented, coming to sit in front of me at the metal table. “We cannot let you leave because you’re a danger to yourself, Everly.” “No, I’m not,” I muttered, denying the words I’d just told him. “You’re lying. We both know it. So, let’s cut to the chase.” Dr. Brighton folded his hands on the table and surveyed me with his gray eyes. “How long have you really been hearing the voices? You told me in our last session that everything was back to normal.” “What voices?” I played dumb. “I’m not hearing voices.” If I told him the truth, he’d keep me locked up in a padded room, or worse, back in that damn jacket. “The ones whispering to you right now.” A small smile touched his thin lips as he watched me.

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Seven “No one lives forever,” I said softly, narrowing my burning eyes at him. My throat was tight and aching. I was exhausted. And the voices. They were getting louder. “Why would they even want to?” “True,” Dr. Brighton agreed. “And false. Mortals—Naturals—don’t live forever. You, however, are a bit above the cut.” “Dr. Brighton, I don’t mean to be rude, but get to your point. You’re beginning to sound crazier than me, and I’m going to be honest, that’s not something you should strive to be considering you’re sitting in the doctor seat over there. I really just want to go back to my room and hang myself with my bedsheets. You’re holding me up. No pun intended.” “You are a feisty one.” He tilted his chin up in disdain. “You’re special, Ever. A Special, to be more exact. That means you’ve been gifted with a certain amount of abilities—abilities many would run from. You’re not crazy. The voices are real. The shadows are real. The creatures—all real.” “And me in this loony bin?” I bit out, snorting at him. Great! Even my doc was a nut job. “Real,” he smiled again. “Only this isn’t the place for you. It’s more of a halfway house until we get you to where you need to be.” “And where would that be?” I asked dryly, shaking my head as the voices grew louder. “She’d be better off drunk in an alley somewhere than at Dementon.” “That’s where he is. You know what it means,” a voice warbled with worry. “He’s lying, Ever. You are crazy. Insane. This isn’t even real. It’s all an elaborate setup. You’re unconscious in a hospital bed. You were hit by a car. This is part of your coma. Wake up, Ever! WAKE UP!” a voice shouted. “ARGH!” I screamed, leaping to my feet, swinging my arms. Something had hit me hard across my back, making it burn and sting. The pain was agonizing. I continued to swing madly, allowing my anger taking over. The doors to the room burst open and the two large orderlies barged in, took my arms hard, and pulled them behind my back, restraining me. I cried out, not sure which was worse—the pain from the invisible blow or the pain from their massive hands holding me hostage. “Let me go,” I screamed, bucking and fighting as best I could against them. Finally, I managed to break free, and when one of the large men reached for me, I kicked him square in the chest, my kickboxing classes flooding back to me. The man stumbled backward and fell into the wall. The other man advanced on me and lunged. With a punch to the face, I knocked him back. He let out a ferocious growl and grabbed me by the arms. I wrestled and twisted in his grasp, unable to break free. Dr. Brighton jumped to his feet and jabbed me with a needle. I whimpered and gnashed my teeth, as the other orderly recovered and helped restrain me. Dropping my head, I caught him in the arm with my teeth and drew blood. Jerking back, he struck me across the face, causing my body to go limp. Blood pooled in my mouth. My head rung from the blow. And my eyes and senses dulled from whatever had been in the needle. With a whimper, I slumped forward. A blurry dark figure, dressed in black, appeared in front of me. He came forward quickly, and I was released. I fell forward as the orderlies were tossed roughly aside by the figure moving swiftly between them. “Help,” I choked out, my vision darkening as the figure swept forward and scooped me off the floor. I couldn’t make out who or what he was because of a dark hood pulled over his head. “Please. Let me die.” “Where’s the fun in that?” he murmured, his voice distorted as my world spun and darkness descended on me.",

I knew someone had entered the room I was in with Dr. Brighton last night and helped me. But who? And how? He seemed to poof in out of nowhere. My brain throbbed. I was sick of trying to figure everything out. Staggering to my feet, I tore the sheets off my bed. As I knotted them together, I looked around for a suitable place to die from. I was being reckless. I knew it. But I wanted out. Just like my dad said I would. That disembodied voice that told me this it was all a dream, and I was still in a coma, whispered in my mind. Only one way to find out. With a boost, I scrambled onto the dresser. I reached up and tapped the ceiling tiles. They were the loose kind. Perfect. Pushing a few aside, I looked up at the steel rafters. In one toss, I’d slung my roped sheets over the rafters and knotted them quickly. I stared at the makeshift noose I’d made and licked my lips. My heart hammered wildly in my chest. Third time’s a charm. I stuck my head through the noose and closed my eyes With a deep exhale, I poised myself to jump. My knees bent. My mind racing. An eerie calm settled over me. The voices whispered from the depths of wherever they existed. “Do it quick. Don’t hesitate,” one encouraged. “I remember when I killed myself. It was glorious.” “You won’t die,” one taunted. “Jump, Ever. He’s coming for you. Then you won’t be able to come see the truth. Quick, JUMP.” “JUMP! JUMP! JUMP,” a chorus of voices picked up the chant. The voices became excited. It was contagious. The truth? I wanted that. “If you’re listening, tell me what you’re talking about. What truth is out there?” “We’re listening. Always listening,” the voice encouraging me to jump answered. “The truth about you. What you are. We can help. You just have to come here.” “He stopped you last time. Be quick about it, girl. Come see the truth,” a voice begged. “Become what you fear.” “It’ll change everything, Ever. Are you prepared for it?” “Yes,” I whispered, closing my eyes in resignation. I made the jump with tears streaming down my face. It didn’t even matter to me if the voices were right or not. Real or not. They could be, or they could just be a manifestation of my brain injury. I didn’t care. I wanted the truth, whatever deep, dark, final truth that was. I’d die for it.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Nine The sheets caught, pulling me roughly to a stop before I hit the floor. I dangled above it, not struggling as my vision began to pop, dotted with sparkles. My body begged for its next breath, but my soul demanded to be set free. Through my sparkly vison, I saw a face peering in through the window on my door. “Ever! Everly,” Dr. Brighton shouted through the locked door, his face stricken with panic. “Open the damn door!” “I-I can’t,” someone shouted. “It won’t open.” Dr. Brighton shouted frantically, hammering his fists on the heavy, metal door. “Where the hell is he,” Dr. Brighton hollered. “This can’t be happening.” I watched as beings slithered from beneath my bed and barred the door by pressing their ghostly forms against it. One turned and looked at me. A man whose face was covered in blood and twisted in pain. “Go, Ever! Let go,” he urged. The last breath in my lungs was finally extinguished like a flame, and I let go. Death wasn’t what I expected. The last time I’d almost died, I hadn’t seen anything. At least nothing I remembered. I was disappointed to see that there wasn’t a brilliant white light at the end of a tunnel. No family members greeted me. Instead, it was just me standing in a dull, gray, foggy world still wearing my ugly hospital gown. Frantically, I looked around. Hissing and scurrying sounds travelled through the dense fog. I yelped as something skittered past and grabbed at my leg. With a kick, I sent it away. Stumbling, I rushed blindly through the fog. “Where are you going?” a male voice called out. He didn’t sound menacing. I halted and looked around trying to find the source of the voice. A moment later, a young man wearing jeans and a blue t-shirt came into view. His russet-colored hair was windswept, and his green eyes were bright, alive. “W-who are you?” I asked, my voice trembling as I looked around uncertainly. “A messenger,” he answered, stopping in front of me, keeping his hands in his pockets. “Did I succeed? Am I dead?” “Yes… And no.” He shrugged and gave me a small smile. “It’s complicated.” “Either I’m dead or I’m not. It’s not all that complicated,” I snapped at him. Seemed death hadn’t made me any less irritable. “Where am I?” “Fine. You’re dead enough to be here—the Veil—and alive enough to continue to exist. Your body is hurt, but it lives. For how long? I don’t know. It depends, but I daresay it won’t matter if he gets here in time. And the Veil, the place between life and death—you’re the only one of your kind able to walk here. That makes you very special, Ever. Your body is still alive, your soul is just on hiatus until he gets to you.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” I demanded, wondering where were all the answers I was promised. “It means, that he hasn’t come for you yet. But, I don’t doubt he will. We’re holding him off as best we can. If we can hold him off long enough, maybe he won’t be able to get you back. We’ve never done it before, so we don’t know,” he shrugged again. “It’s a bit of a new adventure for all of us.” “Who is he? And who is us?” “You know who he is,” he scoffed. My mind raced. The light bulb finally came on. “Shadow? You mean Shadow when you’re talking about him?” He nodded and continued, “He is a powerful being. More powerful than you can imagine. He has several roles. Primarily, he deals in redemption and punishment.” “Like a judge?” “You could say that, but on a supernatural level. But the biggest thing you need to know is that he has the power to take your death from you. Only yours.” “Why would he do that? Not that I even understand what THAT is.” Frustration was rising rapidly. I was supposed to get answers, not more questions. “It may not seem like it, but it’s a huge honor. He chose you. He cares about you. He has spent his entire life watching over you, trying to keep you safe. And he would stop at nothing to do that, even Marking you. Even taking your death to experience as his own so that you can live.” So many questions rolled in my mind, each fighting for supremacy. Who is this guy talking to me? What am I? What did he mean by Marking me? Is that what that bruise is? Finally, a question won in my mind. “Why are all the voices so concerned about me living or dying?” “Because. You’re meant to tip the tide of war, Ever. The war within the Special world. And unfortunately, the poor fool protecting you has been given misinformation. That’s the problem with taking orders and being blinded though, isn’t it? Once the Order realized what he might be many years ago, he was taken under their wing and honed to be what he’s become—dangerous.” “I don’t understand. Who’s the Order?” I shook my head at him frowning. None of what was happening made a lick of sense to me. “There are so many things I need to explain to you. But I would need hours to make you understand. And we don’t have hours. When he reaches you, he’ll lift the Veil and pull you back. So, this is what matters. You’re a special girl, Ever.” He smiled easily at me. “Unfortunately, you’re dangerous because of it.” Confusion crossed my face. I was dangerous? I only ever hurt myself or defended myself. Never anyone else for no reason. He rushed to explain, “You see, the world you live in isn’t only what you think it is. There are others like you with gifts. There’s a special place for them. A place to get away. They go there to harness their abilities so that they can function in the “real world” should they choose to. If they decide to stay in Xanan or any of their home realms, they may—” “This isn’t making any sense—” “Just listen. We’re running out of time,” the man said, his voice becoming urgent. Apprehension marred his features as a loud crash sounded from somewhere behind us. “He’s strong.” I looked through the fog to where the crash came from. “Ever, listen,” the man said quickly, “he doesn’t know that what he’s doing is wrong. There’s a bigger picture here that he doesn’t see or doesn’t know about. He thinks he’s helping, but he isn’t. If you go back, it’s your job to save us.” “What?” “The dead, the Specials, the Naturals, even him—we’re all in danger. Something is happening to us—the dead, and even to the Specials. There’s a man, a Special, who wants power, Ever. He gets it from us. He’s taking us and turning us into something twisted and vile. You have to fight him.” “I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention, but I’m barely functioning. I can’t fight anything, not even myself. I can’t help you. I can’t even help myself.” “You have to. Innocents are being harmed. Life is being taken. He doesn’t want you to live if you don’t join his insane crusade to take over. You’re a threat to him. You’re a threat to all of us.” “How am I a threat? I am locked up in a padded room, where I keep trying to figure out a way to leave this world. “You make Shadow stronger, Ever. And he follows orders blindly because he’s been tricked into thinking he’s saving you. He doesn’t know the one giving the orders is also the one sending the dead after you. Don’t join him. Play the game as long as you have to. When you get a chance to break free, do it. The fate of all of us, falls on you. We fear what the two of you together are capable of. Everyone’s in jeopardy. I’d keep you safe and dead here if I could.” “This isn’t making any sense,” I shouted for what felt like the hundredth time as the wails of pain echoed around us. “He’s here,” the man murmured. “He’s going to take you.” “Who’s here? What’s your name?” I asked frantically, the shouts grew louder. “My name is Marek. Ever, listen. Everything you see and hear is real. You aren’t crazy. You’re a Special. Your ability is veil walking and ghost whispering. So far. More will manifest.” I opened my mouth to ask more questions about these abilities and what other freakish things might develop, but a swift headshake from him stopped me. “They’ll be taking you to Dementon, something we expected when you came here. You’ll hone your skills and abilities there like the others. Like you would if you could go to Xanan. But you’re not like them. You’re so much more. Shadow will show you, but be careful. He knows not what he does. He’s more lost than the souls he’s taking. But he’ll keep you safe from those who wish to harm you. I have faith that you will not join his quest, and you’ll realize what you need to do in order to save all those involved. But beware, if you are not with him, you are apart from him.…And that makes you an enemy to the crusade they’re on. We can’t change what you’re meant to be.” “And what is that?” I asked, trying to absorb everything he was saying to me. “We don’t know. That’s why we’re so afraid,” Marek whispered, swallowing hard. “Just stay who you are. Trust your heart. Your gut. I believe you’ll make the right choices. You have enemies all over. The dead. The living. Specials. The creatures from the void. We’re all separated by fear.” There was a tremendous tugging inside of me, and I fell to my knees before him. “W-what’s happening?” I asked, staring fearfully at my hands as they began to flicker, becoming transparent. “He broke through. He’s bringing you back before your heart completely stops. He’ll take your injuries as his own, again, and regenerate. He gives you his strength. It’s part of who—and what—he is. Please, Ever, try to remember what I’ve told you. I don’t know that you’ll retain this information. I pray that you do.” “Marek!” I screamed, as pain seared my body. Tiny flickers of blue electricity crackled through my transparent skin. “Be brave,” Marek shouted desperately. Another tug. I clawed uselessly at the air around me as some invisible force started pulling me back in the direction I’d come from. My body felt heavy. “Ever! Come on! Don’t leave me,” pleaded a ragged, desperate, distorted voice in the distance. The veil closed, and I slammed back in place. The experience was jarring. Something was wrapped around me. Holding me. It was nice. I had the feeling of being lifted, then laid flat. I opened my eyes. Filling my field of vision was darkness. After a few blinks, the darkness began to resolve and shift. My eyes focused on mesmerizing red orbs floating a few inches from my face. It was him. He came. “Why?” he cried in an anguished voice. A shock of white flashed through his body. I could almost make out features. But the flash was so quick, I might have imagined it. I opened my mouth to speak. I needed to answer him. He deserved an answer. But I was afraid he’d be disappointed in me. His hold on me was loosening. Before he let go of me, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to my lips. It was warmer than I expected. I reached a hand up to cradle his cheek. He sighed against my mouth and whispered, “Everly,” then he faded away. My hand clutched at the empty air. The loss of him was crushing. I closed my eyes and surrendered to the darkness as a tear leaked out.",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-Nine The sheets caught, pulling me roughly to a stop before I hit the floor. I dangled above it, not struggling as my vision began to pop, dotted with sparkles. My body begged for its next breath, but my soul demanded to be set free. Through my sparkly vison, I saw a face peering in through the window on my door. “Ever! Everly,” Dr. Brighton shouted through the locked door, his face stricken with panic. “Open the damn door!” “I-I can’t,” someone shouted. “It won’t open.” Dr. Brighton shouted frantically, hammering his fists on the heavy, metal door. “Where the hell is he,” Dr. Brighton hollered. “This can’t be happening.” I watched as beings slithered from beneath my bed and barred the door by pressing their ghostly forms against it. One turned and looked at me. A man whose face was covered in blood and twisted in pain. “Go, Ever! Let go,” he urged. The last breath in my lungs was finally extinguished like a flame, and I let go. Death wasn’t what I expected. The last time I’d almost died, I hadn’t seen anything. At least nothing I remembered. I was disappointed to see that there wasn’t a brilliant white light at the end of a tunnel. No family members greeted me. Instead, it was just me standing in a dull, gray, foggy world still wearing my ugly hospital gown. Frantically, I looked around. Hissing and scurrying sounds travelled through the dense fog. I yelped as something skittered past and grabbed at my leg. With a kick, I sent it away. Stumbling, I rushed blindly through the fog. “Where are you going?” a male voice called out. He didn’t sound menacing. I halted and looked around trying to find the source of the voice. A moment later, a young man wearing jeans and a blue t-shirt came into view. His russet-colored hair was windswept, and his green eyes were bright, alive. “W-who are you?” I asked, my voice trembling as I looked around uncertainly. “A messenger,” he answered, stopping in front of me, keeping his hands in his pockets. “Did I succeed? Am I dead?” “Yes… And no.” He shrugged and gave me a small smile. “It’s complicated.” “Either I’m dead or I’m not. It’s not all that complicated,” I snapped at him. Seemed death hadn’t made me any less irritable. “Where am I?” “Fine. You’re dead enough to be here—the Veil—and alive enough to continue to exist. Your body is hurt, but it lives. For how long? I don’t know. It depends, but I daresay it won’t matter if he gets here in time. And the Veil, the place between life and death—you’re the only one of your kind able to walk here. That makes you very special, Ever. Your body is still alive, your soul is just on hiatus until he gets to you.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” I demanded, wondering where were all the answers I was promised. “It means, that he hasn’t come for you yet. But, I don’t doubt he will. We’re holding him off as best we can. If we can hold him off long enough, maybe he won’t be able to get you back. We’ve never done it before, so we don’t know,” he shrugged again. “It’s a bit of a new adventure for all of us.” “Who is he? And who is us?” “You know who he is,” he scoffed. My mind raced. The light bulb finally came on. “Shadow? You mean Shadow when you’re talking about him?” He nodded and continued, “He is a powerful being. More powerful than you can imagine. He has several roles. Primarily, he deals in redemption and punishment.” “Like a judge?” “You could say that, but on a supernatural level. But the biggest thing you need to know is that he has the power to take your death from you. Only yours.” “Why would he do that? Not that I even understand what THAT is.” Frustration was rising rapidly. I was supposed to get answers, not more questions. “It may not seem like it, but it’s a huge honor. He chose you. He cares about you. He has spent his entire life watching over you, trying to keep you safe. And he would stop at nothing to do that, even Marking you. Even taking your death to experience as his own so that you can live.” So many questions rolled in my mind, each fighting for supremacy. Who is this guy talking to me? What am I? What did he mean by Marking me? Is that what that bruise is? Finally, a question won in my mind. “Why are all the voices so concerned about me living or dying?” “Because. You’re meant to tip the tide of war, Ever. The war within the Special world. And unfortunately, the poor fool protecting you has been given misinformation. That’s the problem with taking orders and being blinded though, isn’t it? Once the Order realized what he might be many years ago, he was taken under their wing and honed to be what he’s become—dangerous.” “I don’t understand. Who’s the Order?” I shook my head at him frowning. None of what was happening made a lick of sense to me. “There are so many things I need to explain to you. But I would need hours to make you understand. And we don’t have hours. When he reaches you, he’ll lift the Veil and pull you back. So, this is what matters.

Never anyone else for no reason. He rushed to explain, “You see, the world you live in isn’t only what you think it is. There are others like you with gifts. There’s a special place for them. A place to get away. They go there to harness their abilities so that they can function in the “real world” should they choose to.

      "content": "Chapter Thirty “How are you feeling?” Dr. Brighton’s voice broke through the haze as I blinked my eyes rapidly. “Like a failure,” I rasped out, my throat ridiculously sore. “And like I’m sick of waking up like this.” I gingerly reached up and touched my neck. “Ugh. Why does this hurt so much?” “Well,” Dr. Brighton answered curtly, “you hung yourself. You decided to kill yourself in your bedroom yesterday before morning meds were passed out. Congratulations. You almost succeeded there for a minute.” “Where’s my gold star?” I muttered, adjusting myself to sit up. I winced at how sore my body was. “Or my participation trophy.” “Everly, this isn’t a joke,” Dr. Brighton reprimanded sternly, his gray eyes narrowed at me and his lip curled. “Whatever. Did you tell my mom?” He didn’t need to say anything for me to know the answer. “Really? You have me in this facility, I nearly kill myself, and you don’t tell my mom?” “Your mother has been through enough, wouldn’t you agree?” Dr. Brighton replied icily. “Do you really want me to add to it?” “No,” I muttered, rubbing my eyes. “So,” Dr. Brighton said after a moment of silence, “did you find the answers you were looking for?” “Like that I should use a rope instead of a bed sheet next time?” “You know what I mean, Ever,” he said sternly. “You may have had this strange urge to end it all, but you were also looking for confirmation. Did you find it?” I bit my lip and looked at him, flashes of my conversation with the man surfaced. I couldn’t recall it all. I frowned as I dug deeper into my mind. But nothing significant came back to me, with the exception of him telling me I was going to a place called Dementon. And him assuring me that everything I was experiencing was real. Oh, and Shadow could pretty much take my pain away and die for me should my heart stop so that I wouldn’t die. Figured. I couldn’t escape if I wanted to. A niggling of fear and doubt crept in at my hazy memory of Shadow bringing me back from wherever I was. My heart ached at the despair that was so visible on a featureless being. I knew that I had somehow let him down. What if he never came back? What if there was a limit to how many times he could save me from myself? Or worse, what if he was fed up with me? What if he no longer wanted to be my get out of death free card? Yes, I’d gotten answers and thousands more questions. “I guess,” I mumbled. “Are you done being reckless?” Dr. Brighton demanded. “Probably not,” I said with a shrug. “But as far as trying to kill myself, it doesn’t make much sense to keep doing something that I can’t succeed at. Isn’t that what insanity is? Doing the same thing over and over yet expecting different results?” “According to some,” he answered, his lip still curled with disdain. “When am I leaving?” “And where do you think you’ll be going?” Dr. Brighton leveled his steely gaze on me. “Dementon.” I stated matter-of-factly. “I know that’s where I’m supposed to go. I don’t get a choice in it, do I?” “It may seem harsh that you don’t get to choose where you go,” he replied, not bothering to play dumb with me. “But to be fair, Dementon is the top facility in our country for Specials. We accept many into the program. So, yes, you’ll be going there. I expect your mother wants you to have a top-notch education, and Dementon will afford you that in addition to being a place where you can learn about yourself and how to hone and control your abilities.” “And have you told my mother that I’m some kind of immortal, ghost-chatting freak?” I asked sweetly, my voice still raw. “No.” He gave me a small smirk. “All your mother knows is that you’re not well, and Dementon will help you. It’s disguised as a place for troubled youth. She’s already signed the paperwork to send you there.” “Nice,” I muttered. “How’s she going to pay for it? It’s not like we’re rolling in fat stacks of cash—” “Don’t worry, Ever. You’re special to Dementon. Your enrollment is on the house.” “I must be pretty amazing to get a free ride to this prestigious freak show of a school.” I rolled my eyes. “How many other freaks like me are going to be there? And how the hell am I going to be OK around others when all I hear are voices and see ghosts?” “You are amazing, Ever. More than you realize. You’d do well to remember that you’re also a ‘freak’, so please, use the term sparingly around your peers. There will be many. It seems this happened at the perfect time. Dementon’s classes for the year are beginning this week. And you’ll be fine there because, lucky for you, the ghosts can’t, or won’t, penetrate the walls of Dementon. Nothing unwanted can enter our walls.” “Wait. What? Why can’t, I mean won’t, they?” I narrowed my eyes at him as I sat forward, eager to hear what he had to say. “It seems a dangerous folly to go a place loaded with Specials. A place where the Conexus has its most elite soldiers guarding it, don’t you think?” he asked, smiling smugly at me. “What’s a Conexus?” I frowned. “Not what, who, but that’s information for another time. Right now, we have more important things to tend to. For instance, your medication. I’ll be halting them immediately. I suspect the next week will be a rough one for you. Just know I’ll do all I can to try to control it for you. And you’ll be on watch every second of every day until you leave here and are safely tucked away at Dementon.” “You can’t just take them away! I need them! They dull the voices—” “You won’t be needing them on the Dementon grounds,” Dr. Brighton stated firmly. “I already told you, none of that will bother you there. You have my word.” “How can I trust you? You’re moonlighting as a doctor when you’re really Professor X. Plus, if you knew I was a Special, why didn’t you help me sooner? Why did you let me suffer?” “We find our strengths in our suffering. Consider it your first test. It will be one of many.” He smiled serenely and got to his feet. “This new world is a strange one. It’s different. You’ll see things that will blow your mind. You’ll learn things you never thought possible. And you’ll become something extraordinary, if you take the right paths. You’re a lucky one—your path is already set for you. You’re meant for more than the others at Dementon. I hope you’re ready for it. We’re counting on you.”",

Doing the same thing over and over yet expecting different results?” “According to some,” he answered, his lip still curled with disdain. “When am I leaving?” “And where do you think you’ll be going?” Dr. Brighton leveled his steely gaze on me. “Dementon.” I stated matter-of-factly. “I know that’s where I’m supposed to go. I don’t get a choice in it, do I?” “It may seem harsh that you don’t get to choose where you go,” he replied, not bothering to play dumb with me. “But to be fair, Dementon is the top facility in our country for Specials. We accept many into the program. So, yes, you’ll be going there. I expect your mother wants you to have a top-notch education, and Dementon will afford you that in addition to being a place where you can learn about yourself and how to hone and control your abilities.” “And have you told my mother that I’m some kind of immortal, ghost-chatting freak?” I asked sweetly, my voice still raw. “No.” He gave me a small smirk. “All your mother knows is that you’re not well, and Dementon will help you. It’s disguised as a place for troubled youth. She’s already signed the paperwork to send you there.” “Nice,” I muttered. “How’s she going to pay for it? It’s not like we’re rolling in fat stacks of cash—” “Don’t worry, Ever. You’re special to Dementon. Your enrollment is on the house.” “I must be pretty amazing to get a free ride to this prestigious freak show of a school.” I rolled my eyes. “How many other freaks like me are going to be there? And how the hell am I going to be OK around others when all I hear are voices and see ghosts?” “You are amazing, Ever. More than you realize. You’d do well to remember that you’re also a ‘freak’, so please, use the term sparingly around your peers. There will be many. It seems this happened at the perfect time. Dementon’s classes for the year are beginning this week. And you’ll be fine there because, lucky for you, the ghosts can’t, or won’t, penetrate the walls of Dementon. Nothing unwanted can enter our walls.” “Wait. What? Why can’t, I mean won’t, they?” I narrowed my eyes at him as I sat forward, eager to hear what he had to say. “It seems a dangerous folly to go a place loaded with Specials. A place where the Conexus has its most elite soldiers guarding it, don’t you think?” he asked, smiling smugly at me. “What’s a Conexus?” I frowned. “Not what, who, but that’s information for another time. Right now, we have more important things to tend to. For instance, your medication. I’ll be halting them immediately. I suspect the next week will be a rough one for you. Just know I’ll do all I can to try to control it for you. And you’ll be on watch every second of every day until you leave here and are safely tucked away at Dementon.” “You can’t just take them away! I need them! They dull the voices—” “You won’t be needing them on the Dementon grounds,” Dr. Brighton stated firmly. “I already told you, none of that will bother you there. You have my word.” “How can I trust you? You’re moonlighting as a doctor when you’re really Professor X. Plus, if you knew I was a Special, why didn’t you help me sooner? Why did you let me suffer?” “We find our strengths in our suffering. Consider it your first test. It will be one of many.” He smiled serenely and got to his feet. “This new world is a strange one. It’s different. You’ll see things that will blow your mind. You’ll learn things you never thought possible. And you’ll become something extraordinary, if you take the right paths. You’re a lucky one—your path is already set for you. You’re meant for more than the others at Dementon. I hope you’re ready for it. We’re counting on you.”",

      "content": "Chapter Thirty-One A week later, I was standing in the entranceway to Rolling Thunder Psychiatric Facility, the place where I’d been locked up. The past week had been a nightmare, truly. The dead plagued me. They never came into my room, but they whispered through the walls. The sounds of their distressed voices sent shivers down my spine. Ever since my hanging stunt, they had backed off a bit. I was grateful, yet still terrified. I was pulled from my thoughts of despair as my mom and Nina entered through the heavy oak front doors. “Sweetie,” my mom greeted me, rushing up with tears in her eyes. She flung her arms around me and held me tightly as we rocked back and forth. “How are you?” “Better,” I lied. I’d spent the night cowering in the corner of my bedroom while the shouts from other patients echoed around me. Sometimes I couldn’t tell if the shouts were from other patients or the dead, which made it more unnerving. “You look exhausted,” she continued, pulling away and staring at me. “But still so beautiful. Dr. Brighton says you’re getting better too and that Dementon will be a good place for you. You know I wouldn’t send you there if I had another choice—” “Mom, I know. It’s OK. I-I need to go. I need the help they offer.” I gave her a forced smile. Truth be told, I was eager to check the place out. Not because I wanted the help, but because I was promised the voices and sightings would end. That was enough for me to go. I wasn’t happy that I had to be somewhere else to do it, but I’d deal with it. And if I got answers as well, then I guess it wasn’t a total loss. “Well, I don’t want you to hate me for it. I’ve been worried sick.” “I don’t hate you, Mom,” I scoffed. She was quiet for a minute, her eyes sad as she gazed at me. “I love you.” “I love you too, mija.” She sniffled and wiped at her eyes before she seemed to collect herself. “I need to check in.” She cleared her throat, giving my hand a squeeze. “I’ll be right back, OK?” I gave her a reassuring nod and a weak smile. She accepted it and walked to the front desk to check in. “Hey,” Nina said softly, giving me a small smile. “Hey,” I answered awkwardly, shoving my fidgeting hands in my pockets. The last time we’d seen each other I’d been climbing into the car with Dylan. I hadn’t spoken to her since. I figured she was mad at me. And disappointed. Hell, I was disappointed with me. I’d been a pain. “I’ve been worried about you. Everyone has been. Even Dylan,” Nina said, giving me a tight hug. “Really? Dylan?” I frowned. I figured he’d be terrified considering what Shadow had done to him that night. “Yeah,” Nina nodded, pulling away from me. “He said you ran out of his house after freaking out. He said you two got into a fight and you left. He’s the one who called me to see if I’d seen you. But then I heard a-about Gleeman’s…” She stopped talking and bit her bottom lip. “Are you going to be OK, Ever? I’m really worried.” “Nina, I’m going to be better than OK. I already feel myself getting there.” I gave her my best reassuring smile. It was a damn lie. I’d basically died a week ago. Things were only getting weirder. “OK,” she said through a watery smile, her lips trembling as she tried not to let her tears fall. “And Dylan—he didn’t say anything… weird? About that night?” I asked hesitantly. “He seemed OK?” “He seemed concerned about you. He just said you two were making out and that he wanted to go further but you didn’t. Then he said you guys got into an argument and you left. He seems OK other than he’s worried about you.” She sniffled and wiped at her eyes quickly. “Weird,” I muttered, scratching my head. Maybe I’d actually hallucinated the whole thing. Deep down, I knew something else was at play. Something I wanted to figure out. I couldn’t keep trying to talk myself into thinking everything was a delusion. Dr. Brighton told me it was real. I knew it was, too. It was just a hard pill to swallow. “How has Dr. Brighton been for you here?” my mom asked coming back to my side after checking in. “It seems like a really great place.” She rubbed her hands together and looked around. “It’s-it’s been bearable,” I answered, grimacing a little as I tried to block out the memories of the screams still echoing in my head. Every place I went was like that, though. I couldn’t escape them. “I’m so sorry, baby,” she sniffled, hugging me again. “Once we get things sorted, you can come back home. It won’t be permanent.” “OK,” I said tightly. I was fairly certain it wasn’t going to get better. I liked her optimism, though. “I brought your favorite outfits, and I even picked out a few new things for you. Dr. Brighton says you won’t be able to leave or have visitors for the first few weeks as you get situated there. And you don’t get your phone. He said there’s a place to make calls, though.” “Great,” I said through gritted teeth. “I put some stationary in your suitcase so you can write us,” Nina added brightly. “And a journal in case you want to write things down to clear your head or vent. Oh, and I put in a party outfit, a few dresses, and your favorite heels.” She ticked off items on her fingers. “And your makeup and some pictures, so you don’t forget about us!” “Thanks,” I smiled appreciatively at her. “I put Mr. Boggles in,” my mom added. “Elena, hello,” Dr. Brighton emerged from somewhere and shook my mom’s hand halting our conversation. “How are you?” “Great, given the circumstances,” she smiled sadly at him. “I brought Ever some of her stuff.” “Ah, wonderful!” He returned her smile with one of his own. “She won’t need much. She’ll be given a uniform once she’s at Dementon.” “Oh,” my mom seemed surprised at the news. “That’s a… really good thing.” “It is,” Dr. Brighton nodded, still smiling. “In fact, her ride should be arriving shortly to take her there.” “Will you be accompanying her?” “I won’t, but rest assured, she’ll be in perfectly good hands. Dementon likes to send its best to retrieve the new arrivals.” “So-so other students will be caring for her?” My mom didn’t look like she liked the idea of other “delinquents” taking her crazy daughter to her new school. “They’re a bit more than just students. I assure you. She’ll be in very capable hands. I wouldn’t allow her to go, if I wasn’t certain she’d be safe.” “I just worry—” “I’d expect nothing less,” Dr. Brighton nodded solemnly. “It’s what makes you such a good parent. I’ll be in contact with you often. You have my number, and you’ll have the number to reach Ever should you need to. I promise all will be well.” “OK,” my mom breathed out nervously. “Hey,” Nina motioned for me to step away with her for a second. I glanced at my mom. She was still voicing her concerns to Dr. Brighton. I moved over to the large picture windows with Nina. “What’s up?” “Be safe, Ever. I’ve been worried sick about you. After you left with Dylan that night I thought I was going to die. Did something else happen with you two? I mean, you tried drinking yourself to death and Dylan wasn’t even with you.” “Nothing happened,” I mumbled. “He already told you. We were messing around, I freaked out and left. We were close to sealing the deal, you know? Then, I don’t know… Things got weird. I-I had to go. End of story.” I figured it was important to stick to whatever story he’d told her. No sense in freaking her out with my version of the events, since they wouldn’t match Dylan’s, and I’d just come off looking crazier. “He’s been worried about you, Ever,” she squeezed my hand. “I’m not a fan of him, but he wanted me to tell you something. He said he’s sorry and hopes that you two can talk once you’re feeling better.” She shrugged before continuing, “I don’t know. He’s back with Casey, but you know how he is.” “I sure do,” I snorted, rolling my eyes. Well, so much for him being traumatized. “Ever,” Dr. Brighton called out, “it’s time to go. Your ride is here.” I looked out the window as a sleek black SUV with tinted windows pulled up under the awning. I swallowed hard and looked at Nina. This was it. No turning back.",

      "content": "Chapter Thirty-Two My mouth opened in an O of surprised as the guy from the diner walked into the entryway, looking just as breathtaking as he’d been the last time I’d seen him. “Ever, I’d like you to meet Eric Craft and Damien Wick. They’re some of our elite students,” Dr. Brighton nodded to the two large, muscle-bound guys that stopped and stood beside him. They both stood well over six feet tall and were dressed in all black. It was clear they were in their school uniforms. Very slick uniforms. Black blazers, black shirts, black ties, black pants, black shoes. I bet even their socks were black. A red shield with a golden D was embellished on the left breasts of their jackets. “Hello, Ever,” Eric greeted me with a curt nod as if we’d never met before. He was a beautiful creature. His shock of blond hair fell past his ears in a mess, and his blue eyes shone brightly. The guy was a heartbreaker, that was for sure. “We’ve heard a lot about you.” I gave him a shaky smile, still trying to figure out what was going on. Why had he been at the diner that day? This whole thing screamed “beware!” in bright neon lights. “Ever, I’m Damien,” the other guy said, holding his hand out for me to shake. His voice was deep and stern making me think he’d probably slap the sarcasm right out of me if I stepped too far out of line. He was beautiful too. Damien’s hair was a deep shade of brown, and his eyes matched. Both men looked like they could take on an entire football team on their own. “Wow, lucky,” Nina whispered from beside me. Eric’s lips quirked up into a small smile, but it happened so fast I wasn’t even sure if I’d really seen it. I shook Damien’s hand, and he winced before pulling it away quickly. As he flexed his fingers, he cast a quick look to Eric who wore a tight smile on his face. They seemed to be communicating with one another without speaking. Were they telepaths or something? I didn’t even know what sorts of Specials attended Dementon. I’d been so absorbed in my own problems that I’d failed to inquire what I was getting into. “Do you have all your stuff?” Eric asked. “Um, yeah. It’s right here,” I nodded to the stack of suitcases and backpack. Damien grabbed two of the suitcases and took them outside while Eric grabbed the remaining ones. “Backpack?” he nodded to my bag slung over my shoulder. “Um, I can carry it.” “Backpack,” he said it this time as a demand. I hastily took it off and handed it to him. He went out the doors, and we followed. “Ever, Eric and Damien are some of the best Dementon has to offer. You’ll learn a lot with them. Listen to what they say and don’t try to do anything… funny. I assure you it would be unwise.” Dr. Brighton gave me a look that said he meant business. If these guys’ sheer sizes didn’t make them intimidating, then the fact that they had some weird hidden powers made them terrifying. And I’d already seen some of what Eric was capable of. “Dr. Brighton?” I asked softly, biting my bottom lip as I peered past him, keeping my eyes on the guys as they loaded my luggage into the back of the SUV. “Yes?” he leaned down to hear me. “I… When will I see you? What-what if I need help?” “I suggest you make some friends, Ever. You’re going to need to pick a faction eventually. Eric and Damien will explain it to you on the way. These guys are the exception to all the rules, so trust them. Even if their requests seem strange. They know what they’re doing. I’ll be around. It’s my job, after all.” I nodded, a frown carved deeply onto my face as I cast a look to where Damien and Eric now stood, both gazing intently at me. “Bye, sweetie,” my mom pulled me out of my thoughts and brought me in for a tight hug. “I love you so much. Please, call me if you need anything.” “I will, Mom,” I sniffled. “I love you, too.” After a lengthy embrace, I turned to Nina and hugged her. “Be good. Come back to us better, Ever. We have prom in the spring, and we have to go shopping.” She hugged me tightly. “I will.” I pulled away and wiped at my eyes. “Come on.” Eric cleared his throat, opening the door to the SUV. Damien was already in the driver’s seat. I cast one last look at my mom, Nina, and Dr. Brighton before clambering onto the cool leather seat in the back of the SUV. Eric climbed in behind me and closed the door. “Ready?” he asked, fixing his blue eyes on me. “If I have to be,” I murmured. “You do. Damien, we’re ready. Take us home.” I swallowed hard as the crunch of gravel echoed in my ears, signaling our departure. I turned to look out the back window as my mom and Nina waved at me. I didn’t turn to face forward until they were tiny dark specks in the distance. “Scared?” Eric’s strong voice cut through my morose thoughts. “Should I be?” I asked, meeting his blue eyes. “Only if you know what’s good for you,” he replied smoothly, settling back into his leather seat. Scared wasn’t a word I’d use to describe my feelings. I was flat-out terrified. To Be Continued. . .",

I hastily took it off and handed it to him. He went out the doors, and we followed. “Ever, Eric and Damien are some of the best Dementon has to offer. You’ll learn a lot with them. Listen to what they say and don’t try to do anything… funny. I assure you it would be unwise.” Dr. Brighton gave me a look that said he meant business. If these guys’ sheer sizes didn’t make them intimidating, then the fact that they had some weird hidden powers made them terrifying. And I’d already seen some of what Eric was capable of. “Dr. Brighton?” I asked softly, biting my bottom lip as I peered past him, keeping my eyes on the guys as they loaded my luggage into the back of the SUV. “Yes?” he leaned down to hear me. “I… When will I see you? What-what if I need help?” “I suggest you make some friends, Ever. You’re going to need to pick a faction eventually. Eric and Damien will explain it to you on the way. These guys are the exception to all the rules, so trust them. Even if their requests seem strange. They know what they’re doing. I’ll be around. It’s my job, after all.” I nodded, a frown carved deeply onto my face as I cast a look to where Damien and Eric now stood, both gazing intently at me. “Bye, sweetie,” my mom pulled me out of my thoughts and brought me in for a tight hug. “I love you so much. Please, call me if you need anything.” “I will, Mom,” I sniffled. “I love you, too.” After a lengthy embrace, I turned to Nina and hugged her. “Be good. Come back to us better, Ever. We have prom in the spring, and we have to go shopping.” She hugged me tightly. “I will.” I pulled away and wiped at my eyes. “Come on.” Eric cleared his throat, opening the door to the SUV. Damien was already in the driver’s seat. I cast one last look at my mom, Nina, and Dr. Brighton before clambering onto the cool leather seat in the back of the SUV. Eric climbed in behind me and closed the door. “Ready?” he asked, fixing his blue eyes on me. “If I have to be,” I murmured. “You do. Damien, we’re ready. Take us home.” I swallowed hard as the crunch of gravel echoed in my ears, signaling our departure. I turned to look out the back window as my mom and Nina waved at me. I didn’t turn to face forward until they were tiny dark specks in the distance. “Scared?” Eric’s strong voice cut through my morose thoughts. “Should I be?” I asked, meeting his blue eyes. “Only if you know what’s good for you,” he replied smoothly, settling back into his leather seat. Scared wasn’t a word I’d use to describe my feelings. I was flat-out terrified. To Be Continued. . .",

      "content": "Broken Shadow Book 2 in the Everlasting Chronicles You heard Ever's story in Dead Silence, but you don't have the whole story. Now it's time for mine. She knows me but not really. She doesn't know my name. I've done a lot for her over the years to keep her safe. But to her I'm just Shadow. Excerpt from Broken Shadow (subject to edits and changes) My mom said that we shouldn’t speak ill of the dead. That they were gone, leaving behind only their memories. And they had no way to defend themselves against harsh words or brutal truths. She believed that what was done was done, and we should let them rest in peace. But Mom didn’t know what I knew. Years ago, I flung her beliefs and expectations on that topic out of the highest window from the tallest tower in the known world. The moment the beautiful, green-eyed, raven haired, ivory skin angel entered my life, I learned the truth about the dead. I didn’t know it at the time, didn’t know that she was going to change my world forever. How could I? I was four and she was only three. One moment I was in my room, lying in bed after Mom had tucked me in, and the next there was a terrible pull in my gut, taking me from my room and leaving me frightened in a dark place where I could hear growls, snarls, and voices hissing through the surrounding blackness. It was my time in shadow. My first time through the darkest places of the Veil. I cried. I remember that. I didn’t know where I was or why I was there. Voices were all around me. Claws scraped my skin. I ran. I ran as far and as fast as my little legs could take me. Suddenly, there was a light. A beautiful, promising light. A bright rectangle through an opening. As I ran closer, I could make out the form of a girl sitting on the floor of a room. Her blanket was pulled tightly around her as she rocked back and forth. I burst into the light. The claws scratched my legs, arms, and neck. I tumbled into the girl’s bedroom through her closet door. She didn’t pay any attention to me. Confused about why she wasn’t seeing me, I looked down and found that I was as black as night, having turned into a shadow myself. My heart hammered like mad in my chest. While I was afraid for myself, I was even more afraid for her. She continued to rock, her green eyes wavering as she stared at her bedroom door. Still frightened about what had just happened to me, and how I’d gotten there, I backed into the corner to watch her. I wanted to talk to her, but couldn’t. I didn’t have the words to say. Besides she already looked frightened enough. Yelling came from somewhere else in the house. The screams got louder. She rocked faster as heavy footsteps thudded down the hall. “You will not touch her,” a woman screamed. “Por favor!” My fear for the girl grew as the door to her room slammed open. She jumped, her eyes wider as the menacing form of a large, hulking man with wild green eyes entered her room. “Everly,” he growled, stomping into the room. She scooted away from him, her small hands still clutching her blanket. “They want you.” “Don’t touch her,” the woman screamed, rushing into the room. She looked like the girl—long dark hair and a pretty face. The man reached out and struck the woman across the face, sending her flying into the wall where she banged her head and slid down, her body limp. “Mommy,” little Everly cried out, scrambling to her feet. The little girl tried to run behind her bed, but the man was fast and caught her by her hair, yanking her back to him. He gripped her tightly, pressing his hand over her mouth as she kicked and screamed. “It has started! They want you! You are a curse that they can have!” He pulled her small struggling body to the closet I’d just escaped from and opened the door. The stench of death permeated the room. The wails from the monsters inside caused me to cover my ears. I watched in horror as many sets of gnarled, dead hands reached out. The girl was thrust forward and captured by the creatures in her closet. “Daddy! Daddy! Please,” she screamed as they tore at her, pulling her into the darkness. He only stood here watching, a grim expression on his face as she was taken away. Her father had let her go. I watched as he went to his wife who lay unconscious on the floor. He scooped her limp body up easily and left the room. I stared at the closed closet door, my mind made up before I even contemplated it. I drew in a deep breath as I approached the door. I was going to save her. It was a decision easily made. I was put there for a reason. She was my reason, and I’d die before I let something happen to her.",
